<answer>Yes</answer>
<other>The energy minister justified the government's intervention by citing the high prices charged by minigrid operators like Husk.

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Less</answer>
<other>The fastest minigrid developer is Husk, thriving in Nigeria.  If Tanzania mirrored Nigeria's regulatory environment, Husk might still be operating there, and Gesenda would likely be paying less for electricity, as he stated Husk's prices were lower than Tanesco's.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
