It only states that diagnosis of A.D.H.D. has shifted in recent years, with more older people, especially women and people of color, being diagnosed, but does not discuss how this conflicts with the study's conclusions.</other>

It only states that "Since a nationwide Adderall shortage started, some people with A.D.H.D. have said their medication no longer helps with their symptoms. But there could be other factors at play.", but does not discuss the impact on the British study.</other>
