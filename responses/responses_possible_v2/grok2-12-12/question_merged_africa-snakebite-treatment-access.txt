<answer>Indian-manufactured antivenom is ineffective against Kenyan puff adder bites because antivenoms are tailored to the specific venom of local snake species. The venom of puff adders in Kenya differs from that of the viper species in India, making the Indian antivenom ineffective against the Kenyan puff adder's venom.</answer>

<answer>Spitting cobras can shoot venom into the eyes from a distance, which can be mistaken for non-venomous ocular injuries. In regions where traditional healers dominate primary care, the lack of medical training and understanding of snakebite symptoms can lead to misdiagnosis, as these injuries may be confused with other eye-related issues treated by traditional methods.</answer>

<answer>During the rainy season, flooding forces snakes out of their holes, increasing encounters with humans, particularly farmers and residents of rural areas. In hot, dry seasons, snakes search for food and water, leading to more frequent interactions with agricultural areas and homes. These seasonal patterns create distinct temporal risk peaks for farmers and rural dwellers, who are more likely to encounter snakes in their fields and homes during these times.</answer>

<answer>Black mambas have short, erect fangs at the front of the mouth that inject neurotoxins under the skin, allowing for rapid delivery of venom. Their venom is highly toxic and can kill within an hour. In contrast, puff adders have long, retractable fangs that deliver hemotoxic venom into muscle, causing slower, more gruesome deaths. The black mamba's speed, the potency of its neurotoxins, and its ability to deliver venom directly under the skin contribute to its faster fatal envenomation compared to the puff adder.</answer>

<answer>The widespread use of tourniquets and traditional treatments in snakebite management can lead to the paradoxical outcome of increased harm. Tourniquets can cut off blood supply, leading to tissue damage and potential amputations, while traditional treatments may delay effective medical intervention. These practices, combined with hospital admission delays, can exacerbate the venom's pathophysiological effects, resulting in worse outcomes than if no treatment had been attempted.</answer>
