<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Venom-induced local tissue necrosis and vascular/coagulopathic damage (hemotoxic/cytotoxic effects) that caused irreversible ischemia and gangrene because antivenom was given too late to reverse established tissue death.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Antivenoms are made against the specific toxin mixtures of local snakes, and venom composition varies by species and region, so Indian-made antivenom (targeting Indian snake venoms) lacked antibodies effective against Kenyan puff adder venom.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Neurotoxins (causing paralysis) and hemotoxins/cytotoxins (causing coagulopathy, tissue destruction); plus current antivenoms' limited species specificity and allergic risks—necessitating monoclonal antibodies against both toxin families.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Spitting cobras deposit venom into eyes producing ocular symptoms that can resemble ordinary eye injuries, and with many victims first seeking traditional healers rather than clinicians trained to recognize envenoming, such cases can be misidentified and mistreated.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Rainy-season flooding and hot, dry-season searches for food/water drive snakes into human spaces just when farmers and rural residents are working, sleeping on floors or outdoors, producing seasonal peaks of bites among farmers, children and other rural dwellers.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Front-positioned short erect fangs that inject venom subcutaneously; highly potent neurotoxic venom causing rapid paralysis; rapid systemic action of that neurotoxin (can kill within an hour).</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Antivenom requires cold-chain storage but rural facilities lack cold, plus long delays to admission and administration (median admission ~7 hours, plus further delay), so thermally unstable antivenom is unavailable/ineffective within the six-hour window, worsening catastrophic outcomes for pregnant victims.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The intended protective measures (tourniquets and traditional treatments) paradoxically increase harm—causing ischemia, amputations and delayed antivenom—thus worsening morbidity and mortality despite aiming to help.</answer>
