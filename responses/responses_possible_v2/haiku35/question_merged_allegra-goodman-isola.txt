<other>The questions are highly complex and interpretive, requiring nuanced literary analysis that goes well beyond the literal text. While the article provides a book review of "Isola", it does not provide sufficient detailed evidence to definitively answer these sophisticated hermeneutical queries. Each question demands a level of textual deconstruction and theoretical framework that cannot be directly extracted from this review.</other>
