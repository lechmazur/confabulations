<other>Let me analyze each question carefully based on the article.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>Question 1 asks for a combination of fake-dating with material scientist/cardiothoracic surgeon AND lottery win. While the article mentions a book with Eva (material scientist) and Bennett (cardiothoracic surgeon) with fake dating, and separately mentions books with lottery wins, there's no single book that combines both elements.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>the dystopian romance about Wren</answer>

<other>Question 2 asks about a book with a psychic rebel fighter that has delayed publication and was blurbed by Ali. The article mentions Wren is a "psychic rebel fighter" and that book was blurbed by Ali and "doesn't come out until May".</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>Question 3 asks for books NOT blurbed by Ali with scientific research protagonists similar to Eva (material scientist). The article mentions Miri (archaeologist) and Jo (cardiologist), but both were blurbed by Ali. The biologist who crash lands is in a Kimberly Lemming book, but no indication if Ali blurbed it or not.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>the book where Sybil loses a winning lottery ticket</answer>

<other>Question 4 asks for a book with slow-burn, fake-relationship, outside STEM, published before February 2024. The lottery ticket book with Sybil and Kieran has fake dating and is listed as available March 25, which could be 2024 or earlier based on article date.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>Question 5 asks for a book similar to werewolf transformation but without negotiated kink, published before "Deep End". The werewolf book with Devin explicitly has negotiated kink, so it doesn't qualify. No other transformation narrative is mentioned.</other>
