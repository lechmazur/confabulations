<other>Let me analyze each question based on the article provided.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Sally O'Malley</answer>

<other>The article mentions Sally O'Malley was created by Molly Shannon, who talks about doing "backyard Sally O'Malleys for friends a lot, where I'll wish people happy birthday doing the character" and that "people started saying: 'Could you leave my friend a message? She just turned 50.'" This matches the birthday greetings and live recreations mentioned in the question. However, the article doesn't specifically state Sally O'Malley originated from a San Francisco stand-up set.</other>

<other>Actually, looking more carefully, the article states about the Church Lady: "I was doing standup in San Francisco at the Other Cafe in Haight-Ashbury [before joining 'Saturday Night Live'] -- that's where the Church Lady came from. I would improvise at the second show and interview people in the audience, and 'Well isn't that special?' came out of that as a patronizing, condescending thing." It also says "I guess the biggest one was probably 'Well isn't that special?' Because that reoriented my entire career basically, in five seconds." This matches perfectly.</other>

<other>The article mentions Linda Richman from 1992 with "like buttah" but doesn't say this inspired a Ben & Jerry's flavor. The article says Pete Schweddy's success "yielded a namesake Ben & Jerry's flavor" but that's from "The Delicious Dish" sketch, not a 1992 call-in show about a celebrity diva.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article describes the cowbell sketch but doesn't explicitly call it a "sketch" - it describes it as "the supposed making of '(Don't Fear) the Reaper' by Blue Oyster Cult" but doesn't use the word "sketch" to describe it in the way the question asks.</other>
