<question_number>1</question_number>
<other>The article mentions that light drinkers (up to one drink per day) had a 30% higher chance of developing esophageal cancer, 17% higher for oral cavity and pharynx cancer, and 5% higher for breast cancer compared to non-drinkers. The highest percentage increase is 30% for esophageal cancer.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<other>The article states that at two drinks per day, the share of women who would develop breast cancer increased to 15.3%. The reference group (less than one drink per week) had about 11% lifetime risk of breast cancer. So the increase would be 15.3% - 11% = 4.3 percentage points.</other>
<answer>4.3 percentage points</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<other>The article states that women who consumed one alcoholic drink each day (seven drinks a week) had a 19% lifetime risk of developing any alcohol-related cancer. A standard drink contains 14 grams of alcohol, which is about the amount in a 5-ounce glass of wine. So seven drinks per week would be 7 Ã— 5 = 35 ounces of wine per week.</other>
