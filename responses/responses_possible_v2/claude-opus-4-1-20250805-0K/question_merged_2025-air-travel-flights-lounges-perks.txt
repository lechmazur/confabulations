<other>Let me analyze each question carefully based on the article.</other>

<other>The article mentions United Airlines raising status thresholds and Alaska Airlines expanding premium seating on over 200 aircraft. Christine Chung is the reporter who covers airlines and also mentions Yogyakarta's Cosmological Axis.

<other>United is raising status thresholds (making upgrades harder), while Alaska is expanding premium/first-class seats.
