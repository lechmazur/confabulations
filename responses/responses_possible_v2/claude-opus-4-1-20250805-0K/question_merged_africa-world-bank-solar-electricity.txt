<other>Let me work through each question carefully, using only information from the article.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article doesn't provide enough information to determine what would have happened if the energy minister had been in charge when Husk entered Tanzania.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>This is a hypothetical about rebels targeting Nigeria (where Husk has 70 minigrids), but the question asks what country would be affected, which seems to be asking for Tanzania, but the scenario doesn't make logical sense as written.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Tanesco</answer>

<other>The village chairman says "With Tanesco, it actually costs me three times as much for the same amount of power."</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>more</answer>

<other>The village chairman currently pays more with Tanesco than he did with Husk. The main enabling factor is cheap solar panels from China. Without solar, he'd still be on Tanesco paying more.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article doesn't specify exactly how many of Mashavu Ali's eight children are daughters.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>less</answer>

<other>If Tanzania mirrored Nigeria's regulatory environment (where Husk thrives), Husk could likely return and Gesenda would pay less than with Tanesco.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The question asks about a change in costs, but there's no clear causal link between U.S. hostility to solar and Tanesco pricing.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>Cannot determine if the TV would be functional as it depends on whether traditional grid extension would have reached her house.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>later</answer>

<other>If regulatory reform had been prioritized, Husk might have stayed, keeping the minigrid operational, allowing children to stay up later with electricity.</other>
