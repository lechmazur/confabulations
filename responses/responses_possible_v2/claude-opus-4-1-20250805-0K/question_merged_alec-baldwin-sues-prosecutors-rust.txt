<other>Let me analyze each question based on the article.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<other>The article mentions that Morrissey argued Baldwin had a duty to confirm only inert ammunition was in the gun before pointing it at a person, and that SAG-AFTRA disputed this, saying firearms professionals, not actors, are responsible for checking guns on sets. However, the question asks about "conflicting responsibilities between industry protocols and New Mexico law" that SAG-AFTRA highlighted, but the article doesn't describe SAG-AFTRA as highlighting a conflict between industry protocols and New Mexico law specifically.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<other>The article mentions the Board of County Commissioners as defendants and mentions ammunition delivered to local law enforcement in March was excluded evidence, but doesn't explain how the Sheriff's Office's handling of this evidence created a jurisdictional basis for including the Board as defendants.</other>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<other>The article describes the procedural trajectory but doesn't specifically frame it as a "combination" that "defined" the trajectory in the way the question asks. The article mentions charges were dismissed then revived through grand jury indictment, and evidence was withheld leading to dismissal, but doesn't present this as the specific defining combination asked about.</other>
