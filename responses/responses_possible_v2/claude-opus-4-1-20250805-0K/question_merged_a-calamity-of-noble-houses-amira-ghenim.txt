<other>These questions ask me to make speculative connections between different works and authors mentioned in the article, but they require me to imagine hypothetical scenarios that aren't directly addressed in the text. The article doesn't provide information about what Tahar Haddad might think about Han Kang's work, or how Scott Turow would adapt certain stories, etc. These are all hypothetical scenarios that cannot be answered based solely on the facts in the article.</other>
