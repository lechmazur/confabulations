<answer>No</answer>
<other>The article indicates that Mwajuma Mohamed's TV is "now back in the box it came in" after Husk Power Systems left Tanzania because the government insisted on regulated pricing. If the same energy minister had been in charge earlier with the same pricing policies, Husk likely wouldn't have entered Tanzania in the first place, meaning Mwajuma would never have gotten electricity and thus wouldn't have purchased a TV.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Nigeria</answer>
<other>The article states that Husk has built 70 minigrids in Nigeria, where it found a receptive regulatory environment. Husk is the company that left Tanzania, which had the "Bulldozer" president (John Magufuli).</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Tanesco</answer>
<other>According to the village chairman Gesenda Mwise Gesenda, "With Tanesco, it actually costs me three times as much for the same amount of power. Either it is my meter going up and up, or the power cuts for hours, even days." Tanesco is the state-run utility mentioned in the article.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>More</answer>
<other>The Rockefeller Foundation's leader Raj Shah stated that "tech and the pricing" are why electrification is happening now, with solar power becoming more affordable due to "China's breakneck growth as a producer of inexpensive, high-quality solar panels." If this main enabling factor (inexpensive solar panels from China) were unavailable, the village chairman would likely be paying even more for electricity than he currently is with Tanesco.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>8</answer>
<other>The article states that Mashavu Ali has 8 daughters. If her village were in Nigeria (where Husk is currently most active with a receptive regulatory environment), her daughters would likely be able to study late into the night with reliable electricity.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Less</answer>
<other>If Tanzania implemented policies similar to Nigeria's receptive regulatory environment, Husk or similar companies could operate profitably. Gesenda states that with Tanesco "it actually costs me three times as much for the same amount of power" compared to Husk, so he would likely spend less if private providers could compete.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Increase</answer>
<other>If the U.S. administration became hostile to renewable energy (the main enabling factor being solar power with inexpensive panels from China), funding for the World Bank's electrification mission could be reduced. This would likely result in less competition and investment in Tanzania's energy sector, causing Gesenda (who uses Tanesco to refrigerate drinks) to face higher electricity costs.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>No</answer>
<other>Mwajuma Mohamed's first appliance was a TV, which is "now back in the box it came in" after losing electricity access. The article notes that Tanzania's state-run utility (Tanesco) "runs at a steep loss and lack of maintenance leads to frequent and lengthy power cuts." If the Rockefeller Foundation prioritized extending these unreliable existing grids instead of solar minigrids, her TV would likely still not be functional.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Later</answer>
<other>The article states that children in Matipwili "go to bed soon after the sun sets" due to lack of electricity. If the "Bulldozer" president had prioritized regulatory reform that allowed Husk to operate profitably, the minigrids would likely still be operational, providing electricity that would allow children to stay up later.</other>
