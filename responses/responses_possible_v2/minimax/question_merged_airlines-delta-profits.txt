<answer>The sequence of events involved Boeing's manufacturing issues with the 737 Max, which led to production delays and delayed deliveries. This was exacerbated by Airbus' order backlog, which meant they couldn't pick up the slack, and Pratt & Whitney engine problems further compounded the issue by creating an irreversible supply chain bottleneck that disproportionately affected airlines with older fleets.</answer>

<answer>The three operational crises that contributed to the industry's improved pricing power are: 1) the panel blowing off a Boeing 737 Max, which disrupted flights and reduced capacity; 2) a brief technology outage that disrupted travel and resulted in thousands of canceled flights; and 3) smaller airlines flooding popular domestic routes with seats, which led to a reduction in flights and seats by major airlines, thus managing capacity and improving pricing power.</answer>

<answer>The article's temporal framing of "the last five years" as a period of challenges conflicts with the projection of 2025 stability because it highlights the industry's volatility and the recent nature of issues like pandemic recovery, activist investor interventions, and fuel cost fluctuations, suggesting that the current stability may be short-lived and not indicative of a long-term trend.</answer>
