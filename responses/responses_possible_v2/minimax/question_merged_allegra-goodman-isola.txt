<other>First, I will analyze the article to find relevant information for each question.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The paradoxical social structure that emerges is one where Marguerite, despite being of noble birth and subject to patriarchal control, becomes a ruler on the island, challenging the 16th-century French hierarchies that would typically confine her to a subordinate role.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The restrained narrative voice when describing survival techniques like shooting a polar bear contrasts with the vivid, sensory descriptions of eating seabirds, highlighting a tension between Marguerite's ingrained noble identity and the primal, instinctual adaptations required for survival, thus questioning the rigidity of class distinctions.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Three textual evidence points are: Roberval's history of allowing Marguerite the "illusion of freedom," his calculated decision to strand her rather than act impulsively, and his deliberate delay in punishment despite being enraged by her meetings with Auguste.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The geopolitical contradiction is that while Basque fishermen, representing a different European network, rescued Marguerite, the narrative simultaneously emphasizes the French colonial ambitions in New France, showcasing competing European interests and alliances in the 1540s.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The causal chain is formed by Roberval's absences eroding Marguerite's faith in guidance, Auguste's pre-existing doubts amplifying the theological crisis during their exile, and the harsh winter conditions further challenging their beliefs, thus shaping the narrative's theological arc.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The contradictions are that despite Roberval's management of Marguerite's wealth for his own benefit, she ends up in conditions of impoverishment on the island, revealing his true priority of control and exploitation over her well-being.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Han Kang's exploration of national trauma contrasts with Goodman's approach in "Isola," as Kang's protagonists often confront institutional power structures directly, while Marguerite's story is more about personal resilience and survival within a system of imposed power, reflecting different narrative strategies in addressing historical themes.</answer>
<question_number>8</answer>
<answer>The four narrative elements are: the island's isolation providing freedom from Roberval's control, the necessity of self-governance for survival, the absence of formal legal structures, and the couple's ability to create their own rules, thus transforming the island into a space of legal autonomy despite French colonial claims.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The descriptions of Marguerite's undocumented agonies, the queen's view of endurance as a teaching tool, and Damienne's supportive role during exile collectively undermine Roberval's intended symbolic meaning of punishment by highlighting resilience and personal growth over retribution and subjugation.</answer>
