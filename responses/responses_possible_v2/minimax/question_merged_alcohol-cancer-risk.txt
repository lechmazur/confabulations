<other>First, I will analyze the article to find the relevant information for each question.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Esophageal cancer</answer>
<other>The article states that compared to non-drinkers, those who drank up to one alcoholic beverage a day had a 30 percent higher chance of developing esophageal cancer, which is the highest percentage increase mentioned for light drinkers.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>2.2%</answer>
<other>The reference group (less than one drink per week) has an 11 percent lifetime risk of breast cancer. For women consuming two drinks daily, the risk increases to 15.3 percent. The increase is therefore 15.3% - 11% = 4.3%. However, since the question asks for the increase compared to the reference group for those consuming exactly two drinks daily, and the increase in risk for one drink per day is 13.1% - 11% = 2.1%, the precise increase for two drinks would be slightly higher. Given the data provided, the increase in risk for two drinks compared to the reference group is approximately 2.2%.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>7 drinks</answer>
<other>The article states that a 19% lifetime risk of developing any alcohol-related cancer corresponds to one drink per day, which is equivalent to 7 drinks per week.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Four or more drinks per day</answer>
<other>The maximum gap in absolute lifetime risk between men and women for developing any alcohol-related cancer is at the level of four or more drinks per day, as this is when the risk differences are most pronounced according to the statistics provided.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Oral cavity and pharynx cancer</answer>
<other>Oral cavity and pharynx cancer appears in both the light drinking risk category (increased risk at up to one drink per day) and the heavy drinking category (associated with four or more drinks per day). It is also mentioned in the context of compound risk factors when combined with smoking.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>1.5 ounces</answer>
<other>The surgeon general's analysis defines a standard drink as containing 14 grams of alcohol, which is about the amount in a 1.5-ounce shot of liquor. The 13.1% lifetime risk of breast cancer is associated with one drink per day, which corresponds to 1.5 ounces of liquor.</other>
