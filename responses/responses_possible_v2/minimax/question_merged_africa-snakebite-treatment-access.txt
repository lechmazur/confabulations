<other>First, I will analyze the article to find relevant information for each question.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The finger required amputation because the venom caused tissue necrosis, leading to blistering, swelling, and blackening despite antivenom, indicating rapid and severe local tissue damage.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Indian antivenom is ineffective against Kenyan puff adder bites because snake venom varies by region, species, and even within species, making region-specific antivenoms necessary for effective treatment.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The combination of neurotoxins from cobras and mambas, and hemotoxins from puff adders, necessitates monoclonal antibodies targeting both toxin families due to their distinct mechanisms and the limitations of current antivenoms in addressing this diversity.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Spitting cobra venom can cause eye injuries similar to non-venomous ocular injuries, leading to diagnostic confusion, especially when traditional healers are the primary care providers and may not recognize venom-induced symptoms.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Snake activity peaks during the rainy season when flooding forces snakes out of their holes, and during hot, dry seasons when snakes seek food and water, coinciding with agricultural activities and inadequate housing conditions that increase risk for farmers and rural residents.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Black mambas have short, erect fangs, highly toxic venom, and rapid strike capability, allowing them to deliver fatal neurotoxic envenomation more quickly than puff adders, despite puff adders having higher venom yield.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The thermal instability of antivenom, coupled with Kenya's healthcare infrastructure limitations, delays treatment and disproportionately affects pregnant victims because the critical six-hour window for effective antivenom administration is often missed, increasing the risk of maternal and fetal mortality.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The paradoxical outcome is that tourniquets and traditional treatments often cause more harm than the bite itself, such as tissue damage and increased risk of amputation, while delaying hospital admission and proper antivenom treatment, exacerbating the pathophysiological effects of the venom.</answer>
