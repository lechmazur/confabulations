Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I use only the information from the provided article. Let me start by skimming through the article again to recall the key points.

Question 1 asks which founder of 651 Arts witnessed both the initial response to community demands about German opera and the current expansion near luxury apartments and an Apple Store. The article mentions Mikki Shepard as one of the founders. It also says the current expansion is at 10 Lafayette, near the Apple Store and luxury apartments. The initial response was in response to the community's call about German opera, which Shepard and Leonard Goines were involved in. So Mikki Shepard would be the answer here.

Question 2 is about an artistic director who found inspiration at 651 events and is now creating work on defying forces and male vulnerability. The article mentions Andre Zachery, who was inspired by 651-supported artists when he started out. His current work "Against Gravity" deals with defying gravity and has workshops about being held, which relates to vulnerability. So Andre Zachery is the answer.

Question 3 asks for the artistic director using a female poet's perspective on three male archetypes in an African diasporic space. Again, Andre Zachery's piece uses Gwendolyn Brooks' poems and examines three Chicago figures (Fred Hampton, Harold Washington, Ben Wilson). The space is 651 Arts' new location. So Andre Zachery here too.

Question 4 is about the executive director moving from construction punch lists to community tours. The article states Toya Lillard dealt with the capital project, punch lists, and now does "skin to skin contact" tours. So Toya Lillard.

Question 5: The performance combining Virginia Hamilton's tales with 1980s Chicago issues in 651's new space. "Against Gravity" references Virginia Hamilton's "The People Could Fly" and deals with Chicago's 1980s problems. The premiere is in the new space. So that's "Against Gravity: Flying Afrikans + Other Legends".

Question 6: The Brooklyn artist exploring flight and survival in the same neighborhood where 651 started. Andre Zachery is Brooklyn-based, his work deals with flight themes (Igbo Landing, etc.), and 651 began near BAM, which is in the same area as the new location. So Andre Zachery again.

Question 7: The work examining three male archetypes from Chicago history in a space that moved from 651 Fulton to 10 Lafayette. "Against Gravity" features three Chicago figures, and 651 moved from Fulton to Lafayette. So the answer is the same piece as before, "Against Gravity".

I need to check each answer against the text to ensure they're directly supported. No inferences beyond what's stated. Let me confirm each point again quickly. All answers seem to align with the article's details. None of the questions have missing info, so no N/A here.
