Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by skimming through the article again to find the answers.

1. The first question asks about the dual role of the person who both wrote the original monologue and plays the main character. The article mentions "Khawla Ibraheem, who is also the playwright" and she portrays Mariam. So her dual role is both playwright and actress. 

2. The next question is about a verbal motif that shows the character's effort to appear normal. The text says, "I act normal," which is stated by Mariam. That's the phrase they're looking for.

3. The minimal set design is credited to Frank J Oliva, as noted in the paragraph about the director's choices affecting immersion. The answer is his name.

4. The original monologue was written in 2014, as stated in the article. That's straightforward.

5. The time frame after the warning is 5 to 15 minutes. The article says "five to 15 minutes to evacuate before the actual rocket destroys the building."

6. The director is Oliver Butler, who also directed "What the Constitution Means to Me." The question mentions the constitution-themed success, so that's him.

7. The protagonist includes her mother in the drills, since her mother moves in during the war. The text says "plus Nour, a heavy sleeper... alongside her mother."

8. The Broadway show with Idina Menzel climbing trees is "Redwood," as she's mentioned there. She's known for "Rent" and "Wicked."

9. The title refers to the "knock on the roof" technique with a small bomb as a warning. The article explains this directly.

10. The running time is 1 hour 25 minutes, listed at the end of the play's details. That's the exact time given.

I need to make sure each answer is exact and only from the text. Let me double-check each point against the article to avoid mistakes. No outside knowledge allowed. Also, if any question can't be answered, use N/A. But I think all are covered here.
