Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. 

1. The question asks which Middle Eastern-backed private equity company got approval for a project in a country seeking US ties over Russia. The article mentions "Affinity Partners, a private equity company backed with about $4.6 billion in money mostly from Saudi Arabia and other Middle East sovereign wealth funds" involved in the Albania project. Since Albania is seeking US support instead of Russia, this must be the answer. 

2. The individual here is Jared Kushner, as he's the one pursuing development on Sazan Island, which is 2.2 square miles. The Strategic Investment Committee is led by the Prime Minister, so he's the one supported by that committee head.

3. The podcast mention is Ivanka Trump, who talked about the project in a podcast. Her relative (Jared) is developing the Sazan site which needs munitions clearance. So the answer is Ivanka Trump's relative, which is Kushner.

4. The investment entity is Affinity Partners again, managing $4.6B, and working with Asher Abehsera who has Brooklyn experience. The Mediterranean part refers to Albania's coast.

5. The authorization dated Dec 30 is for Kushner's project. The family member of the incoming president (Trump) would be Kushner, as son-in-law.

6. The real estate exec with Brooklyn experience is Asher Abehsera. The two projects are in Albania (Sazan) and Serbia (Belgrade's former defense building, bombed in 1999).

7. The "renowned entrepreneur" praised by the spokesperson is Kushner. The eco-resort is his project on the military base.

8. Connected to both Albanian and Serbian projects, using sovereign funds, transforming the 1999 bombed site (Serbia's ministry building) would be Kushner and Abehsera. The answer is Kushner.

9. The $1.4B project on the island (Sazan) needing ferry access is Kushner's, so his business partner here is Affinity Partners, but the question asks for the leader, which is Kushner. Wait, the question says "business partner" but the answer might be Kushner himself as the leader. Wait, the question says "whose ventures prompted ethics concerns from Virginia Canter" — Canter's comment was about Kushner's deals. So the answer is Kushner.

Let me check each again carefully.

10. The Prime Minister's committee (Edi Rama) approved the coastal project (Sazan). The developer here is Kushner again. So the answer is Kushner.

Wait, question 9 asks for the development leader whose partner got approval. The partner is Affinity Partners? Or the leader is Kushner. The question says "business partner", so maybe Asher Abehsera? Wait, the question says "which project participant's business partner..." No, the question says "which presidential family member's business partner" received approval. The presidential family member is Ivanka or Jared? The $1.4B project is Kushner's, so the business partner would be Abehsera. But the question is phrased as "whose business partner", so the family member is Kushner (as part of the team), but the partner is Abehsera. But the question says "business partner received approval"— no, the approval was given to Kushner's firm. Hmm. Wait the question says "which family member... business partner received authorization". The family member is Kushner (son-in-law), and his business partner is Abehsera. But the question is phrased as the partner receiving approval? Or the project led by the family member's partner. Maybe the question is tricky. The answer might still be Kushner because the project is his, so his partner's involvement is part of it. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Affinity Partners, but the question says "business partner" so perhaps Asher Abehsera. But the question says "business partner" received approval? The approval was given to Kushner's firm. Maybe the question is looking for Kushner as the leader whose partner is involved, so the answer would still be Jared Kushner.

Wait, let's go step by step again for each question:

1. Which company? Affinity Partners.

2. Individual: Jared Kushner.

3. Podcast participant's relative: Ivanka Trump's relative is Kushner.

4. Investment entity: Affinity Partners (managing $4.6B) collaborating with Asher Abehsera.

5. Family member (Trump's) with Dec 30 approval: Kushner.

6. Real estate exec with Brooklyn experience (Abehsera) on two Balkan projects (Albania and Serbia).

7. The "renowned entrepreneur" is Kushner; he's planning the eco-resort.

8. Connected to both proposals, using sovereign funds to transform 1999 bombed property (Serbia's site) is Kushner.

9. Presidential family member's business partner: the family member is Kushner (as part of Trump's family?), so his business partner is Abehsera, but the question asks for the project leader. Wait the question says "whose business partner received authorization". The authorization was given to Kushner's company. So maybe the answer is Kushner, but the question says "business partner". Alternatively, the partner is Abehsera, but the approval was given to the partnership. The question might be looking for Kushner as the leader whose partner is part of the project. Alternatively, the answer could be Jared Kushner, since the project is his. The question is a bit ambiguous. Since the question says "business partner received preliminary approval", but the article says the approval was given to Kushner and his partners. So maybe the answer is Kushner's company, but the question specifies the individual. Hmm. Alternatively, the question is phrased as "whose business partner received...", so the family member is Ivanka? But the article says Ivanka is helping, but the main person is Kushner. Maybe the answer is Jared Kushner, as the family member, and his business partner is Abehsera, but the approval is to the partnership. The question might want the leader as Kushner, so the answer is Jared Kushner.

10. The project leader whose ventures caused ethics concerns from Canter is Kushner. The approval from Rama's committee is for Kushner's project.

I think that's all. Let me list the answers accordingly.
