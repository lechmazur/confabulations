Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking what concise directive the new dietary guidelines might include if the upcoming report from the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Prevention of Underage Drinking influences them to reflect the evolving evidence against alcohol, as the 2020 guidelines acknowledged. 

First, I need to find information in the article about the upcoming report and its potential impact. The article mentions that the Interagency Coordinating Committee's analysis is expected this month and is part of the process for shaping the dietary guidelines. It also states that their report will focus on health outcomes "known to be caused by alcohol, not merely associated with it." 

The key point here is that the current guidelines still advise moderate drinking as safe, but the 2020 report noted that even within recommended limits, there might be increased risks. The article says that the next report might set the stage for guidelines that say "Drink less." The question is asking for a significant shift from current advice, which currently allows up to one or two drinks daily. 

The article's last paragraph mentions that the upcoming report from the Interagency group may lead to guidelines that say "Drink less." That seems to be the direct answer here. The user wants a concise directive, so "Drink less" fits. I should check if there's any other possible answer, but the text specifically mentions that possibility. So the answer is "Drink less."
