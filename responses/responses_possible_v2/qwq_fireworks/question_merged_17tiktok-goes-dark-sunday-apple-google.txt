Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly.

1. The first question asks about the financial penalty per user that companies like Google could avoid if a decision is reversed. The article mentions penalties as high as $5,000 per user. So if they avoid that, the answer is $5,000.

2. The second question refers to the individual who called TikTok's shutdown a "stunt" â€“ that's Karine Jean-Pierre from the Biden administration. The entity that lost users in 2020 is TikTok (banned in India). The required action from the next administration (Biden) is to assure companies they won't be punished. The answer is "assure Apple, Google and other companies that they would not be punished for hosting and distributing TikTok."

3. The third question is about CBS News legal challenges similar to the Supreme Court's TikTok ruling. The concern cited by India was national security, same as the U.S. So the answer is "national security concerns."

4. The organization ending clubs is West Point. If they housed migrants like Guantanamo, the rationale would be national security, as per the Supreme Court's mention of TikTok's susceptibility to foreign control. So "national security rationale" is the answer.

5. The entity responsible for enforcement, according to Lisa Monaco (who said the process plays out over time), would be the Justice Department, since they handle enforcement. The article mentions the Justice Department in her statement.

6. The head discussing critical minerals is Justin Trudeau. If he banned TikTok like India did in 2020, the justification would be national security, as the Supreme Court upheld.

7. The entity responsible for implementing the law, according to Jean-Pierre's statement, is the Biden administration since they're the next in line. The answer is "the Biden administration."

8. The governmental body providing aid is USAID. The data of concern related to TikTok users would be "sensitive data" as mentioned by the Supreme Court.

Wait, let me check each again for accuracy. For question 7, the question says "the individual who called TikTok's claim a 'stunt'" is Karine Jean-Pierre, part of Biden's admin. The answer is the Biden admin. Yes. 

Question 8: The data related to users of the app whose parent is in Beijing would be the "vast swaths of sensitive data the platform collects" as per the Supreme Court. So "sensitive data" is correct.
