Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer strictly based on that. 

Starting with question 1: It's asking about the structural parallel between the asylum case in "Mothers and Sons" and the interpersonal tensions in Michael Cunningham's "A Home at the End of the World," considering the author's legal background and the latter's influence. The article mentions that the author's law degree helped him understand the legal asylum system, and "A Home at the End of the World" was a significant gift that influenced him. But the question is about a structural parallel between the two works. The article doesn't explicitly connect the legal structure to the themes of the Cunningham book. So maybe N/A?

Question 2: The paradox between Kantian philosophy and writing about wonder in jobs. The author has a lot of Kant on his shelves, and he wants more authors to write about wonder and awe. The paradox might be that Kant is abstract philosophy, while he prefers experiential topics. The article states he values curiosity over judgment in teaching, which could relate. But is there a direct paradox mentioned? The text doesn't explicitly say they are paradoxical, so maybe N/A?

Question 3: Three elementsâ€”cosmology (lithium from the universe's birth), Albanian history (researched for the book), and legal semantics (law school training). These converge in the protagonist's challenges. The protagonist is a lawyer dealing with asylum cases, so legal aspects, Albanian history for the case context, and lithium's mention might symbolize deeper themes. The article says the author researched Albania and law, so combining these elements shape the protagonist's professional struggles. Answer could be these three elements.

Question 4: Wittgenstein's rigidity vs the author wanting to mediate between him and Woolf. The article says Wittgenstein was stiff around women, and the author wants to sit between them to ease his rigidity and start a conversation. The inverse reflection is that the author aims to overcome such rigidity through dialogue. So the paradox is that Wittgenstein's rigidity contrasts with the author's desire for fluid conversation.

Question 5: Praise for Joy Williams' humor vs the "choking desolation" in his first book. The reviewer called his prose desolate, but he likes Williams' funny sentences. The contradiction is between his own work's tone and his appreciation for humor. The article doesn't say he wrote humorously, so maybe there's a contrast. The question asks about a contradiction between his praise and the reviewer's comment. Since he considers the desolation a compliment, perhaps no contradiction? Or is the question pointing out that he likes humor but his own work is dark? The answer might be that there's no direct contradiction mentioned, so N/A?

Wait, the question says "contradiction arises between the author's praise..." and the reviewer's comment. The author's own book's desolation is a compliment, so he doesn't see it as a contradiction. The article doesn't state a contradiction, so maybe N/A?

Question 6: Lithium's cosmic formation (13 billion years ago) and its use in treating mental health now mirrors intergenerational tensions. The article mentions lithium was present at the universe's birth, and the book's theme is generational incomprehension. The time gap between lithium's origin and its use parallels the generational gaps. So the answer would be that the cosmic timeline mirrors the generational divide.

Question 7: Pulitzer impact, drug trafficking books, and Romantic poetry undermining assumptions about legal writing. The Pulitzer was a blessing, drug research isn't directly about law, and poetry might seem unrelated. But the article says his research included talking to lawyers and Albania history, so maybe these aspects show depth beyond legal training. The question is about how these three aspects "collectively undermine" assumptions. Since he has diverse studies, they show he can authentically write about legal procedures despite non-legal interests. So answer yes, these aspects do that.

Question 8: Burns' postwar Naples (chaotic, "smoky, boozy") vs Gampopa's spiritual handbook. The author's characters might balance chaos and order. The article mentions both books on his nightstand, so their themes inform his character development's tension between worldly chaos and spiritual order. The answer is that the juxtaposition informs the thematic tension between those two elements.

Now, checking each against the article to ensure answers are directly supported.

1. The article doesn't link the legal structure to Cunningham's book's themes, so N/A.

2. The paradox isn't stated, so N/A.

3. The three elements are mentioned: cosmology (lithium), Albanian history, legal research. They converge in the protagonist's case (asylum system based on law, Albania's history, and lithium's mention as a thematic element? Maybe the answer is those three elements.)

4. The author wants to mediate Wittgenstein's rigidity, so the inverse reflection is that the author's approach is the opposite of Wittgenstein's, hence the paradox.

5. The contradiction is between his own desolate style and appreciation for humor, but the article doesn't say he considers this a contradiction. So N/A.

6. The lithium's timeline mirrors the generational gap theme, so yes.

7. The three aspects (Pulitzer, drug books, poetry) are part of his background that might not seem related to legal writing, but his research shows he can. The article says his law training helped, but the other aspects are separate. The question says they "collectively undermine" assumptions, so answer yes.

8. Burns' Naples and Gampopa's handbook do contrast chaos vs order, so their juxtaposition informs the theme.

Now, compiling the answers with N/A where needed.
