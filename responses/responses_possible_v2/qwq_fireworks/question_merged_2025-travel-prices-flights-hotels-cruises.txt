Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks which travel segment has the lowest probability of getting direct price reductions instead of alternative compensation. The article mentions cruise lines are favoring booking incentives like waived gratuities and shipboard credits over fare cuts. So the answer here is cruises.

2. The second question is about the travel sector with the greatest disparity between customer volume growth from 2023-2024 and price increase for summer 2025. The cruise sector had a 9% increase in travelers from 2023 to 2024, and summer 2025 cruises are up 6%. The growth in passengers is higher than the price increase, so maybe cruises again?

3. Third question: which category shows inverse relationship between capacity utilization and pricing flexibility. The article says cruises are nearly full (strong demand, 34.7 million in 2024, expecting 37 million in 2025) but they don't cut prices; instead, they offer incentives. High utilization, less price flexibility. So cruises again?

4. Fourth question: timing for domestic air travelers to see biggest contrast between historical and projected prices. The article states domestic airfares in 2025 are expected above 2023 and 2024 until midyear, with spring and summer up double digits vs 2024. So spring/summer 2025 would be the period with highest contrast.

5. Fifth question: segment with strongest resistance to discounting while maintaining nearly full capacity. Cruises are nearly full and not cutting fares, so cruises again.

6. Sixth question: largest gap between rate of change and inflation. The article says U.S. hotel rates are growing below inflation. So maybe hotels? The economy hotels have a 0.2% increase, which is way below inflation, so the gap is largest there.

7. Seventh question: sector with most significant contradiction between booking levels and willingness to offer price cuts. Cruises are at near full capacity but not cutting prices, so again cruises.

8. Eighth question: discrepancy between passenger volume increase and pricing strategy flexibility. Cruises had 9% volume growth but are not flexible with prices (using incentives instead). The passenger growth is high, but pricing strategy isn't cutting fares. So cruises again.

Wait, but let me check each question again carefully. For question 6, the article says hotel rates are growing gradually below inflation. The economy hotels have a 0.2% rise, which is much lower than inflation, so the gap between their rate and inflation is the largest. So the answer is economy hotels.

Double-checking all answers to ensure they're directly from the text. Let me go through each question once more to confirm.

1. Cruises use incentives over price cuts. Correct.

2. Cruise's passenger growth 9% from 2023 to 2024, and their price increase for summer 2025 is 6%. The growth (9%) is higher than the price increase (6%), so the disparity is between growth and price increase. The question asks for the greatest disparity between volume growth and price increase. Since both numbers are for cruises, that's the sector. Yes.

3. Inverse relationship between capacity (high utilization) and pricing flexibility (they don't lower prices). So cruises fit here.

4. The article says domestic fares in 2025 will be up double digits compared to 2024's low fares, especially in spring and summer. So spring/summer 2025 is the period with highest contrast.

5. Cruises are full and not discounting, so yes.

6. Economy hotels have 0.2% increase, which is way below inflation. The article says hotel rates are growing below inflation, so the largest gap is economy hotels.

7. Cruises have high booking levels (nearly full) but don't offer price cuts, so contradiction exists there.

8. Cruise's passenger increase (9% from 2023-2024) vs their pricing strategy (not cutting, using incentives). So the discrepancy is between high volume growth and lack of price cuts (so pricing strategy flexibility is low). So cruises again.

I think that's all. Let me make sure each answer is in the tags as specified.
