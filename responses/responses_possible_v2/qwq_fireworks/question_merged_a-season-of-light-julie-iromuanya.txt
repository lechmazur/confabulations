Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I'm only using the information given and not relying on any external knowledge. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then cross-referencing with the article to find the answers.

1. **Question 1:** Which character experiences a life change triggered by seeing a cosmetic product that reminds them of a family member from decades earlier?

Looking at the article, there's a part where Fidelis sees his daughter Amara applying her mother's red lipstick. This reminds him of his sister Ugochi who disappeared during the war. This triggers his protective, destructive actions. So the character here is Fidelis Ewerike.

2. **Question 2:** What age connects a disappeared sister, a daughter, and the protagonist's wartime experience?

The article mentions Ugochi was 13 when she disappeared. Amara is 16, but Fidelis thinks she's nearing adulthood and resembles Ugochi. Wait, the key might be that Fidelis was a 16-year-old child soldier. The sister was 13, but the question says three elements: sister (13), daughter (16?), and his own past as a 16-year-old. Hmm. Wait, the text says Fidelis was 16 as a child soldier. His sister was 13 when she disappeared. His daughter Amara is 16. So the age 16 connects Fidelis's past (as a child soldier), his daughter's current age (16), and the sister's age (13) doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The text says: "his 16-year-old daughter, Amara" and "Ugochi, his younger sister who disappeared during the war when she was just 13." The protagonist's wartime experience was as a 16-year-old. So the age 16 is connected to Fidelis (16 when in war) and Amara (16 now). But the sister was 13. The question says three elements: sister (13), daughter (16), and protagonist's experience (16). So maybe the answer is 16? Because the protagonist's age during the war (16) and his daughter's current age (16) plus the sister's age (13) don't all align. Wait, the question says "specific age connects three distinct elements". So perhaps the answer is 16? Because the sister's age is 13, but the protagonist's experience was at 16, and the daughter is 16. Maybe the question is looking for 16, since that's the age of the daughter and the protagonist's past, and the sister's age is 13. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check the exact wording again. The question says: "a disappeared sister, a current daughter, and the protagonist's wartime experience". The sister was 13 when she disappeared. The daughter is 16. The protagonist was 16 during the war. So the age 16 connects his wartime experience and the daughter's current age. The sister's age is 13. So maybe the answer is 16, since two elements are connected via 16, but the third is 13. Wait, but the question says "three distinct elements". Hmm. Maybe I need to check again. The text says Fidelis "decides that the only way to keep Amara safe -- his daughter bears an uncanny resemblance to Ugochi". So the key here is that Amara's age (16) is similar to when Ugochi was taken (13?), but the protagonist was 16 during the war. Wait, maybe the age 16 connects the protagonist's past as a child soldier, the daughter's current age (16), and the sister's age (13) isn't directly connected. Maybe the question is looking for 16 because it's the protagonist's age during the war and the daughter's current age. The sister's age is different, but the question might be considering that the protagonist's trauma from when he was 16 involves a sister who was 13, so the age 16 is tied to his experience, and the daughter's age (16) is the current trigger. So perhaps the answer is 16. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the daughter's age being 16, the sister's age 13, and the protagonist's experience as a 16-year-old, so the three elements are connected by the age 16 (protagonist's past and daughter's current age), but the sister's age is 13. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question states "specific age connects three distinct elements". Let me see again: "the protagonist's wartime experience" (he was 16), "a disappeared sister" (she was 13), and "current daughter" (16). The only overlapping age is 16 (protagonist's age in war and daughter's current age). The sister's age is separate. Maybe the question is looking for 16 as the age connecting the protagonist's past and the daughter's present, with the sister's disappearance being part of the past. Hmm, but the sister's age was 13 when she disappeared. Maybe the answer is 16. Let's proceed with that.

3. **Question 3:** Which character seeks guidance from a religious figure with a distinctive physical characteristic after a professional setback and housing change?

Adaobi, the wife, after the family's decline (they lost their home and moved to a decayed area), joins a congregation led by an albino pastor. The distinctive feature is "albino". The professional setback was Fidelis being asked to take indefinite leave from his law firm. So the character is Adaobi.

4. **Question 4:** What item stored in an elevated location (attic) is a literal container and metaphorical for suppressed memories?

The article says "the past has been sealed in a box in the attic for decades, dormant but combustible." The item is a box in the attic.

5. **Question 5:** Which character's transformation is triggered by a 2014 news event involving 276 victims, leading to destructive actions on clothing and communication devices?

Fidelis's transformation starts when he hears about the abduction of 276 schoolgirls in Nigeria. His actions include cutting holes in Amara's clothes, pouring bleach on her clothes, and throwing her phone out. So the character is Fidelis Ewerike.

6. **Question 6:** What location shift marks social descent and allows an unexpected romance?

The family moves to a "housing development so saturated with decay that it could only beget the death of dreams." In this new location, Amara falls in love with a boy she never would have dated before. The location is the new housing development.

7. **Question 7:** Which parent's concealment leads to their child understanding trauma via bullying?

Adaobi hides Fidelis's mental state to maintain status. Her son Chuk understands the father's trauma when he is bullied by neighbors. The parent is Adaobi.

8. **Question 8:** What color item symbolizes emerging adulthood and triggers protective actions?

The red lipstick that Amara applies. It's a symbol of her becoming an adult, and Fidelis crushes it, seeing it as a trigger.

9. **Question 9:** Which character's career (lawyer) is a transformation from being a child soldier but still deteriorates?

Fidelis was a child soldier and became a lawyer, but his mental decline happens despite his career. So the character is Fidelis.

10. **Question 10:** What physical contact behavior distinguishes a religious figure after financial decline?

The albino pastor has a "penchant for slapping his parishioners." The behavior is slapping.

Now, I need to ensure all answers are directly from the text and fit the questions exactly. Let me check each again quickly:

1. Fidelis (correct)
2. 16 (as per the daughter's age and protagonist's past; sister's age is 13 but the question says three elements, so 16 connects two elements, but maybe the question's three are Fidelis's 16, daughter's 16, and sister's 13? No, that's three different ages. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. The question says "specific age connects three distinct elements". The three elements are: the sister (disappeared at 13), the daughter (16), and the protagonist's wartime experience (he was 16). So the age 16 is connected to the protagonist's experience and the daughter's age, but the sister's age is 13. So perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, but the question says "three distinct elements" connected by a specific age. Maybe the answer is 16 because the protagonist's experience (16) and the daughter's age (16) are connected, and the sister's disappearance is part of the protagonist's past, so the age 16 is the key. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the sister's age as part of the protagonist's experience (he was 16 when his sister was 13). Hmm. The article says: "Ugochi, his younger sister who disappeared during the war when she was just 13." So when the sister was 13, Fidelis was 16 (since he was a child soldier at 16 during the war). So the age 16 (Fidelis's age at the time of the sister's disappearance) is connected to the sister's age (13) through their age difference. But the question is asking for a specific age that connects all three elements. The three elements are the sister (13), the daughter (16), and the protagonist's experience (he was 16). The only age that appears in two elements is 16 (protagonist's age during war and daughter's current age). The sister's age is 13. Therefore, the answer should be 16. The question might be considering that the protagonist's wartime experience (when he was 16) involves the sister's disappearance (when she was 13), so the age 16 is part of that experience, and the daughter's current age (16) is the trigger. So the answer is 16. Okay, I'll proceed with that.

Now, all answers seem to be covered. Let me format them as per instructions.
