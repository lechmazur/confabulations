Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article and answer strictly based on that.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks which streaming platform's curated selection would mirror the film's disarray if the screenwriter had focused on streaming recommendations. The article mentions "Streaming Guides: If you are overwhelmed by the endless options, don't despair -- we put together the best offerings on Netflix, Max, Disney+, Amazon Prime and Hulu..." The film's plot is described as a "flavorless tossed salad of code names and cleaning crews, drone strikes and shootouts." The platforms listed include Amazon Prime, which is also mentioned in Tom Green's return part. But the article says the screenwriter's work is chaotic. Maybe Amazon Prime because Tom Green's projects are there, and the article links him to new projects there. But the question is about the platform's curated selection as a thematic foundation. The article doesn't explicitly link any platform to chaotic structure. Hmm, maybe N/A? Wait, the question is hypothetical. Since the article lists several platforms, but the answer must be directly inferred. Since the article mentions Amazon Prime in the context of Tom Green's return, maybe not. Alternatively, the "flavorless tossed salad" could mirror a platform's mix? The article says "best offerings on Netflix, Max, Disney+, Amazon Prime and Hulu to make choosing your next binge a little easier." So maybe none of them are chaotic. The answer might be N/A. But maybe the question is suggesting that the chaotic structure mirrors a platform's recommendations. Since the article doesn't say which platform's curation is chaotic, I think N/A.

Wait, the question says "which specific platform's curated selection might have served as the thematic foundation for his chaotic and poorly received plot structure, mirroring the film's own disarray?" The article says the screenwriter's plot is chaotic. The question is hypothetical, but the answer must be from the text. The article mentions Amazon Prime for Tom Green's projects, but that's not directly about streaming recommendations. The "Streaming Guides" section lists platforms but doesn't link them to chaos. So N/A here.

2. **Question 2**: If Chester from "Alarum" were in "Evil" (Mike Colter's show where he plays a priest), how long would his presence last before expulsion? The article says Mike Colter is in "Evil" as a priest praying for better movies. The question is about Chester's runtime in that show. The article mentions the film's running time is 1h35m. But the question is about his presence in "Evil." Since the article doesn't mention anything about "Evil" episode lengths or Chester being there, this is N/A. Unless the film's running time is the answer? The question says "specific running time expressed in minutes." The film's runtime is 95 minutes (1h35). Maybe that's the answer? But why? The question is about Chester's presence in "Evil." Since there's no info, N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The "best trained killer" (Lara) eliminating a streaming service. The article mentions she's the best trained killer. The question asks which platform with an extensive library she'd eliminate first, mirroring the film's reception. The article lists Netflix, Max, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Hulu. The film's critical reception is poor. The article says "the less said about the cinematography, the better" and "flavorless." Maybe she'd eliminate the one with the most content? The article doesn't say which has the most, but Amazon Prime is known for extensive library. But the question is which one would she eliminate first to mirror the film's poor reception. Maybe the film's own distributor? The article says "In theaters and available to rent or buy on most major platforms." So maybe the platform that's most associated with the film's flaws. Since the article criticizes the plot, maybe the platform that's part of the problem? Or perhaps the article doesn't give enough info. Alternatively, the "best trained killer" would eliminate the one with the most content to streamline, but the article doesn't say. N/A?

Wait, the article says "the best trained killer in the world, per herself" â€“ she's part of "Alarum." The question is if she were to streamline streaming choices, which service would she eliminate first, mirroring the film's critical reception. The film's reception is poor, so maybe the platform that's part of the "endless options" problem. The article mentions "Streaming Guides" to make choosing easier. If she wants to eliminate one, maybe the one with the most content? The article doesn't specify which has the most, so N/A.

4. **Question 4**: If the screenwriter had explored complex power dynamics without sex, which genre would be opposite to the film's actual genre? The article mentions "Sex Scenes That Aren't Sexy" explores power dynamics. The film's genre is an action/spy thriller. The opposite genre mentioned in the article is "Black Cinema's Time Revolution: RaMell Ross, A.V. Rockwell, Raven Jackson and Garrett Bradley are the new Black directors chronicling Black life at a different speed." That's a slower, more contemplative genre. So the actual film is action-thriller; the opposite would be the slow, Black cinema genre. So the genre is "Black cinema chronicling Black life at a different speed." The question asks for the genre name. The article says "Black Cinema's Time Revolution" so the genre is "Black cinema" or "chronicling Black life at a different speed." The answer is "Black cinema" or the specific term? The article's heading is "Black Cinema's Time Revolution" so maybe the genre is "Black cinema" or "chronicling Black life at a different speed." The answer is "chronicling Black life at a different speed" since that's the descriptor given. So the opposite genre is that, so the answer is that genre.

5. **Question 5**: Sylvester Stallone's character rates TV title sequences. The article says "The Extravagance of TV Title Sequences: A visual style originally meant to make TV series appear epic and distinctive has become awfully familiar." The film's rating is R. If he were to rate the opening credits of a show, would he use the film's R rating? The question says "what specific rating, mentioned in the context of the film's overall quality, would he assign..." The film's rating is R for gun magazines and surgery. So maybe he'd assign R? But the question is about the opening credits of a hypothetical show. The article mentions the R rating's details. The answer is "R".

6. **Question 6**: If "bargain-bin Ryan Reynolds" stars in a film about Black life at a different speed, which director least likely to cast him? The directors mentioned are RaMell Ross, A.V. Rockwell, Raven Jackson, Garrett Bradley. The article says Reynolds' character has no personality. The director least likely would be one who values depth. The article doesn't say which director's preferences, but since the question is hypothetical, maybe the one mentioned first? Not sure. Since the article doesn't specify, N/A? Or maybe Garrett Bradley, since she's known for her work in that genre and Reynolds is seen as a bad fit. But without explicit info, N/A.

Wait, the question says "given his performance in Alarum" where he was "blandly boring" and "smarmy." The directors mentioned in the "Black Cinema's Time Revolution" are the ones making films about Black life. The question asks which would be least likely to cast him. Since the article doesn't state any of their casting preferences, but since the reviewer criticizes Reynolds' role, perhaps the director who's focused on serious, contemplative work (like the Black cinema directors) would not want him. But since all the directors are in that category, maybe the answer is N/A. Or perhaps the question expects one of their names. The article lists four names. Since the question says "specific director," but the article doesn't link any to rejecting actors, so N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The "flavorless tossed salad" plot on a streaming platform, which family-friendly platform wouldn't feature it? The film is rated R. The platforms listed are Netflix, Max, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Hulu. Family-friendly is Disney+. Since the content is R-rated (for gun violence and surgery), Disney+ wouldn't carry it. So the answer is "Disney+".

8. **Question 8**: The "sapling-like beauty" critiques Tom Green's projects. What aspect of his earlier work would she find incompatible? The article says Tom Green is known for his "Y2K-era phenomenon... MTV prank show and surreal brand of comedy." The film's serious action attempt would clash with his comedic/surreal work. The aspect is "surreal brand of comedy" or "prank show." The question asks for the specific aspect referenced. The article says "MTV prank show and surreal brand of comedy." So the answer is "surreal brand of comedy" or "prank show." The question says "specific aspect of his earlier work referenced in the article." The article mentions both, but the "surreal brand of comedy" is part of his identity. The answer is "surreal brand of comedy."

9. **Question 9**: If the film's plot were a patient undergoing "impromptu stomach surgery" mentioned in the rating, what's the duration? The film's runtime is 1h35m. The surgery is part of the R rating's content. The question is metaphorical: the surgery's duration equals the film's runtime. So 1 hour 35 minutes, converted to minutes is 95. But the question asks in hours and minutes. So "1 hour 35 minutes" or "95 minutes." The article states the running time is 1h35. The answer is "1 hour 35 minutes."

10. **Question 10**: The "nondescript suits" discussing the film's reception in a gloomy room would see Tom Green's projects as the opposite tone. The article says Tom Green's return is associated with "MTV prank show and surreal brand of comedy." The film's tone is serious action. The opposite is "prank show" or "surreal comedy." The question asks for the comedic presentation associated with Tom Green. The article mentions "Y2K-era phenomenon most famous for his MTV prank show and surreal brand of comedy." The specific aspect is "prank show." The answer is "prank show."
