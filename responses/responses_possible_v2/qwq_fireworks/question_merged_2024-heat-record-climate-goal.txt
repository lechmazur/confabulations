Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by going through each question and finding the relevant parts in the text.

1. The first question asks for the exact global average temperature anomaly for 2024 according to multiple agencies. The article mentions that the World Meteorological Organization combined estimates and arrived at 1.55 degrees. So that's the number here.

2. The next question is about the year nations could have started emissions cuts to stay at 1.5°C with gradual reductions. The article states that starting in 2005 would have allowed gradual cuts. So 2005 is the answer.

3. The third question asks about the environmental condition that fueled hurricanes and cyclones. The text says "bathtub-warm ocean waters" supercharged both the Gulf hurricanes and Philippines cyclones. So that's the condition.

4. The UN Environment Program's director mentioned in the context of urging decarbonization even after overshooting is Inger Andersen. The article quotes her directly.

5. The specific event in Bangladesh and India contributing to the temperature rise was the 104-degree heat waves that shuttered schools. So that's the answer.

6. Despite clean energy investments, 2024 saw record CO2 emissions, which the article clearly states.

7. The professor comparing climate targets to cholesterol guidelines is Costa Samaras from Carnegie Mellon. The article mentions his role in the White House as well.

8. The political figure threatening to withdraw from Paris Agreement is Donald Trump, as noted in the text about his presidency.

9. The official from a Pacific island nation at the Azerbaijan summit is Cedric Schuster from Samoa. The article quotes him directly.

I need to ensure each answer is directly from the text. Let me cross-check each point again quickly.

1. Yes, WMO's 1.55°C is mentioned. 

2. 2005 is correct as per the counterfactual scenario.

3. "Bathtub-warm ocean waters" is exactly what's stated.

4. Inger Andersen is correctly identified as the UNEP director.

5. The heat waves in Bangladesh and India with the temperature are specified.

6. Record CO2 emissions in 2024 are explicitly noted.

7. Costa Samaras is the professor mentioned.

8. Trump's promise to withdraw is in the text.

9. Cedric Schuster from Samoa is correct for the Azerbaijan summit.

All answers are directly from the article. No need for N/A here since all questions are addressed with the given info.
