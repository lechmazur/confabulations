Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I'm only using the article provided and not any outside knowledge. Let me start by going through each question and cross-referencing with the article.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks about a conversational technique that shows Brooks' corporate background. The article mentions her research came from a negotiation course and her maxims have a business school feel. It also says that making a joke increased leadership votes by 9%. The example given is the joke leading to a 9% boost in leadership positions. So that's probably the answer here.

2. **Question 2:** The question refers to a philosopher's rigid structure that Brooks praises but rejects. The article talks about Kant's structured dinner conversations with specific topics per course. Brooks prefers the jazz metaphor from Arlie Hochschild. So Kant is the answer here.

3. **Question 3:** The reviewer criticizes systematic approaches like the "jazz" metaphor being opposed to rigid methods. The reviewer mentions diagrams and graphs like the "conversational compass" as feeling like training for AI. So the "conversational compass" or similar structured tools might be the answer. Wait, the reviewer specifically mentions the "conversational compass," "topic pyramid," and "chart of emotions." The question asks which strategy the reviewer would see as antithetical to jazz's spontaneity. The structured tools like the compass would be it.

4. **Question 4:** The author discovered he used "candidate answers" which limited responses. The article says the author realized they curtail questions this way, leading to broader answers when left open. So "candidate answers" is the answer.

5. **Question 5:** The 9% figure is mentioned in the context of making a joke leading to higher leadership votes. The question asks for the percentage, so "9" or "9%" exactly?

6. **Question 6:** The reviewer criticizes the levity section for AI-like advice, like sending Onion headlines or mimicking Seinfeld reactions. So the specific technique here is sending Onion headlines.

7. **Question 7:** The mnemonic TALK has "Asking" instead of "Questions" for symmetry. The article says "Asking" spoils the parallelism but they used it for the book title. So the compromised element is "Questions" replaced by "Asking" to avoid changing the title.

Let me check each again to ensure accuracy.

1. The 9% leadership is from the joke example, which ties to corporate success. Correct.

2. Kant's structured dinners, yes.

3. The structured tools like the compass, so "conversational compass" is the specific element the reviewer criticizes as systematic, opposing jazz.

4. Candidate answers, correct.

5. 9% exactly.

6. Sending Onion headlines.

7. The word "Questions" was replaced by "Asking" for the title's sake, so the answer is "Questions".

Wait, the question says which element of the mnemonic was compromised for marketability. The mnemonic is Topics, Asking, Levity, Kindness. The article says "Asking may spoil the parallelism, but had she gone with 'Questions' they would've had to call the book 'Tqlk.'" So the compromised term was "Questions" in favor of "Asking" to keep the title TALK. So the answer is "Questions".

All answers seem to fit. Now format them correctly.
