Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided.

1. The first question asks about the colonial governor who created a "floating town" and issued a proclamation freeing enslaved people, reevaluated by Lawler. The article mentions Lord Dunmore multiple times, especially his floating town and the proclamation. So the answer should be Dunmore.

2. The second question refers to the 1777 investigation about Norfolk's destruction. The article says patriots burned 1,279 out of 1,333 buildings. So the patriots were responsible.

3. The third question is about the Founding Father who called Dunmore "that arch traitor." The text quotes Washington doing this. So George Washington.

4. The fourth question asks which decision caused the floating town and the epidemic. Dunmore moved after the powder incident, leading to the floating town. The decision was moving the gunpowder to a British ship.

5. The fifth question is the name of the Black military unit with "Liberty for Slaves." The Ethiopian Regiment is mentioned.

6. The sixth question is the event on Jan 1, 1776, involving burning Norfolk. Dunmore's forces started it, but patriots did most burning. The event is the cannonade and subsequent burning, called the "greatest single war crime."

7. The seventh question is the November 1775 order by the governor. That's Dunmore's Proclamation.

8. The eighth question is about a lithograph's incorrect date. The caption mentions a lithograph of George Washington was dated around 1852, not 1797.

9. The ninth question is the planter who discussed with Dunmore and later condemned him. The article mentions George Washington discussing with Dunmore and later condemning him.

10. The tenth question is the phrase from a patriot slaveowner's letter. Lund Washington's letter says "Liberty is sweet."
