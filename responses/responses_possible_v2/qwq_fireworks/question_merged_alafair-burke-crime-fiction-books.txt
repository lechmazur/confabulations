Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the given article and answer each question exactly as per the instructions. Let me start by reading through the questions again and then cross-referencing with the article.

Question 1: The question is about a tenacious sleuth from $1 paperbacks at Powell’s, influenced by her librarian mother and specific female detectives. The article mentions "a slew of smart, gritty female sleuths who began to feel like friends — Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone, Sara Paretsky's V.I. Warshawski, Karen Kijewski's Kat Colorado, Marcia Muller's Sharon McCone." So the answer is one of these. The question asks for the central early influence highlighted, so maybe the first one listed? The question says "highlighted as a central early influence," but the article just lists them. Since they are all mentioned together, but the question might be looking for one of them. Wait, the question says "specific female detective characters she names" so any of those. But the first one is Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone. The question is asking which one is highlighted, but the article doesn't single one out. Hmm. Wait, the question says "which tenacious sleuth... is highlighted as a central early influence?" Maybe it's Kinsey Millhone since she's first? Or maybe the question expects all of them but the answer is one. Wait, maybe the question is referring to one of them. Let me check the exact wording. The user says "which tenacious sleuth... is highlighted as a central early influence?" The article lists them all, but perhaps the answer is one of them. Since the question says "highlighted as a central early influence," but the article doesn't specify which one is central. Wait, maybe the answer is "N/A" because it's not specified which is the central one. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting one of the names listed. Let me check again. The question says "which tenacious sleuth—introduced as feeling like a friend in those $1 paperbacks—is highlighted as a central early influence?" The key here is "feeling like a friend in those $1 paperbacks"—the article says "a slew of smart, gritty female sleuths who began to feel like friends — Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone, Sara Paretsky's V.I. Warshawski, Karen Kijewski's Kat Colorado, Marcia Muller's Sharon McCone." The list includes all of them, but the question is asking for one. Since the question is phrased as "which" (singular), maybe any one of them is acceptable. But the first one listed is Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone. Maybe that's the intended answer. I'll go with that unless there's a better clue. Wait, the question says "central early influence"—maybe the author mentions one more specifically? The article says "discovered a slew... who began to feel like friends" and lists them. Since the question is about which is highlighted, perhaps the first one is the answer. Let's tentatively put Kinsey Millhone.

Question 2: Her current audiobook is "An Inconvenient Cop," by Edwin Raymond, a retired N.Y.P.D. lieutenant. The question asks for the retired law enforcement official's name. So the answer is Edwin Raymond.

Question 3: She cites Scott Turow's "Presumed Innocent" as an example where legal details aren't the star. The question asks which author's expertise she cites. That's Scott Turow.

Question 4: The cherished personalized signed copies have James Lee Burke up top. So the answer is James Lee Burke.

Question 5: She now asks if legal details add to character, plot, or setting before including them. The question asks for the criterion. The answer is "adds to character, plot or setting".

Question 6: She didn't read Plato's "Republic" and used CliffsNotes. So the answer is "Republic".

Question 7: The story involves social-media blowback, so the phenomenon is "social-media blowback" or "crowdsourced online fan-fiction" as per the article. The exact phrase is "social media" but the question is about the phenomenon woven in. The article says "social-media blowback figure in the story" and mentions "we don't have more nuance when it comes to characterizing real people whose real lives are affected by the weird sort of fan-fiction that gets crowdsourced online." So the phenomenon is "social-media blowback" or "crowdsourced online fan-fiction." The question asks for the specific digital phenomenon. The direct answer from the question's context is "social-media blowback" as the answer.

Question 8: The answer is "completely unexpected yet totally inevitable" from the quote about twists needing to feel that way.

Question 9: She places books to read soon on the night stand. The article says "Anything I want to read soon gets piled onto the night stand."

Question 10: The question is asking which legal thriller author she references as a benchmark. She compares her character Wanda Morris to Turow and Grisham. The article says "Wanda Morris is only three books in, and she's already been compared to Turow and John Grisham for good reason." But the question is about the benchmark for her own narrative refinement. The example given in her answer about "Presumed Innocent" is Scott Turow. Since the question asks for the author she implicitly references as a benchmark, that would be Scott Turow, since she praises his work as an example of integrating legal details well without overloading the story.

Let me go through each again quickly.

1. Kinsey Millhone (Sue Grafton's) – yes, listed first.
2. Edwin Raymond – correct.
3. Scott Turow – yes.
4. James Lee Burke – correct.
5. "adds to character, plot or setting" – exact quote from the article.
6. Republic – yes.
7. social-media blowback – the question says "specific digital phenomenon" and the article mentions social-media blowback as part of the plot.
8. "completely unexpected yet totally inevitable" – direct quote.
9. night stand – yes.
10. Scott Turow – since she compared her own approach to his work in "Presumed Innocent".

Everything seems to check out. I think that's all.
