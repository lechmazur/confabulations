Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I'm only using the information from the provided article and following the strict answer format. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then cross-referencing the article.

1. The first question asks which Trump appointee wants bureaucrats to be "traumatically affected". The article mentions Russell Vought as the pick for OMB director, and he's quoted saying they want bureaucrats to be traumatically affected. So the answer should be Russell Vought.

2. The second question is about the governmental entity targeted for deconstruction. The article mentions the Department of Education as one Trump wants to abolish. But wait, the question says "repeatedly targeted". Let me check again. The article says "the administrative state" is the target, but the question asks for a single entity. Wait, the first paragraph says Trump wants to "deconstruct the administrative state". But the question might be looking for the Department of Education? Hmm, no, the question says "governmental entity" that's repeatedly targeted. Wait, the article also mentions the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) but that's a creation. Wait, the question is about what's repeatedly targeted for deconstruction. The answer is "the administrative state" as per the first paragraph and throughout the text. Let me check again. The question says "governmental entity" but the administrative state isn't an entity, it's the system. Wait, maybe the Department of Education? The article says Trump says he'll abolish it, but the main target is the administrative state. The question might be tricking me here. The answer is "the administrative state".

3. The third question is about who lamented the right co-opting anti-bureaucratic rhetoric. The article mentions David Graeber in the context of left-wing critics, and he lamented that the right used "anti-bureaucratic individualism" for free-market agendas. So the answer is David Graeber.

4. The fourth question asks for the neologism describing patchwork policies. The article mentions Steven Teles coined "kludgeocracy" for layering policies leading to incoherence. So the answer is kludgeocracy.

5. The fifth question is about the executive order enabling dismissals. The article says Trump issued Schedule F to fire career employees. So the answer is Schedule F.

6. The sixth question asks the politically appointed subset. The article states 4,000 are political appointees among 2.2 million. So the component is the 4,000 political appointees.

7. The seventh question combines illegibility and necessity. The political scientists Muirhead and Rosenblum say bureaucracy is necessary despite its flaws. The key feature is the administrative state itself, but the question asks for the feature. The answer is "illegibility" but the question's phrasing says "key feature... identified as necessary and vulnerable". Wait, the article says "illegibility" creates a vacuum for conspiracy theories, but the necessary feature is the administrative state's existence. The answer might be "the administrative state's necessity and vulnerability", but the question is looking for a key feature. The answer is "the administrative state" but maybe the exact term is "the submerged state"? Wait, no. Let me recheck. The question says "key feature of modern governance identified as necessary and vulnerable". The article says "Every modern state is an administrative state... bureaucracy is necessary". The feature is the administrative state's necessity, but the term in the text when discussing Muirhead and Rosenblum's point is that the bureaucracy's "illegibility" makes it vulnerable. The answer is "illegibility" but the question is combining both necessity and vulnerability. Wait, the exact quote: "the intricacies of policy implementation make the nuts and bolts of governing opaque. This informational vacuum is fertile ground..." So the key feature is the administrative state's necessity but its "illegibility" makes it vulnerable. The answer is "the administrative state" or "bureaucracy"? The question asks for the key feature identified as necessary and vulnerable. The article says "Every modern state is an administrative state" so the key feature is the administrative state itself. But the question says "key feature... simultaneously necessary and vulnerable". The answer is "the administrative state".

8. The eighth question is about the scholar favoring a powerful presidency. The article mentions Adrian Vermeule as the constitutional scholar who wants a powerful presidency over a bureaucracy to legislate morality. So the answer is Adrian Vermeule.

9. The ninth question is about the author of "Who Is Government?". The article says Michael Lewis compiled the edited volume. So the answer is Michael Lewis.

10. The last question asks which term Trump prefers over "administrative state". The article says Trump prefers "deep state" over the "administrative state". So the answer is "deep state".
