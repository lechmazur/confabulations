Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to go through each question and find the answers strictly from the article provided.

Starting with question 1: The person who had autoimmune flare-ups, arthritis, and "hangziety" during the pandemic and called alcohol a poison. Let me look through the text. The article mentions Dawn Murray, a librarian in St. Louis. She drank most weekdays during the pandemic, and alcohol worsened her autoimmune diseases, arthritis, and caused "hangziety." She eventually stopped drinking after a night with gut pain. So the answer here is Dawn Murray.

Question 2: The individual who went through a 12-step program (like AA), then tried moderation and psilocybin, and wrote "Soberish." The article mentions Kayla Lyons. She tried AA at 23, stayed for two years, then tried other methods including moderating and microdosing psilocybin. She also published "Soberish" in 2023. So that's Kayla Lyons.

Question 3: The person in San Francisco's business marketing who first swore off alcohol after a bad hangover but later became "soberish." The article's first example is Christine Mosley, a business marketing manager in San Francisco. She had a severe hangover, tried to quit but later opted for "soberish," reducing intake. So Christine Mosley is the answer here.

Question 4: The physiological measurement that decreased when people cut back. The article states that studies found a drop in blood pressure, improved liver function, better quality of life, and anxiety symptoms improved. The question asks for a specific measurement that decreased. Blood pressure is a numerical measurement that decreased. So the answer is blood pressure.

Question 5: The person aiming for more dry days, not strict sobriety. Christine Mosley again is mentioned as wanting to increase dry days, emphasizing the "-ish" part. So Christine Mosley here as well.

Question 6: The factor of increase in alcohol deaths between 1999-2020. The article says "alcohol deaths in the U.S. more than doubled" according to CDC data. "More than doubled" means the factor is over 2, but the exact answer is "more than doubled," but the question asks for the factor. The answer should be "more than doubled" but maybe the exact phrasing from the text is needed. The question says "by what factor," so the answer is "more than doubled."
