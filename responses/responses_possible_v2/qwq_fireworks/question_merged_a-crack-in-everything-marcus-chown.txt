Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks which scientist made a discovery about black holes while dealing with a medical issue during wartime. The article mentions Karl Schwarzschild, who had skin blisters as a soldier in WWI and discovered the Schwarzschild radius. So the answer should be Karl Schwarzschild.

2. **Question 2:** The next one is about a mathematical concept developed during a nighttime trip on a ship. The text talks about Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar doing calculations on a steamship's deck, leading to the Chandrasekhar limit. That's the concept here.

3. **Question 3:** The scientist who rejected their own work leading to black holes. The article says Einstein didn't believe in black holes despite his theory. So Einstein is the answer.

4. **Question 4:** The phenomenon that's seen as monstrous but later helps planetary formation. The conclusion mentions black holes as facilitating galaxies and planets. So black holes themselves.

5. **Question 5:** The 2015 observation validating the "death spiral" (gravitational waves from merging black holes). The article mentions 2015 gravitational waves detected, so that's the answer.

6. **Question 6:** The instrument with image quality issues. The Hubble Space Telescope's blurry images are mentioned, so Hubble.

7. **Question 7:** The mathematical concept from someone under adverse conditions. Schwarzschild's radius again, as he was in wartime with health issues.

8. **Question 8:** Researcher on a ship calculating stellar evolution. Chandrasekhar again with the Chandrasekhar limit.

9. **Question 9:** The space-time paradox inside black holes. The text says "space and time swap places," so that's the answer.

10. **Question 10:** The entity that changes from monster to catalyst. The book's conclusion says black holes are now seen as facilitating galaxies and life, so black holes.

Now check each answer against the text to ensure accuracy and no N/A. All answers are directly from the article. No need for N/A here.
