Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly.

1. The first question asks about a subsidiary of a hospital-owned discount negotiator that was a nonprofit turned for-profit, with projected $227M revenue and over 80% profit. The article mentions Apexus as a subsidiary of Vizient, which became for-profit in 2014. The 2022 memo mentions $227M and 80%+ margins. So the answer should be Apexus.

2. The second question refers to a company called "a license to hunt" by someone who helped draft the program. The article says Marsha Simon, a staff member who helped write the bill, used that phrase. So the answer is Apexus again.

3. The entity with the purchasing optimization team and bonuses tied to revenue. The article states Apexus has such a team and the 2022 presentation mentions bonuses for revenue increases. Government directed them to focus on admin but they ignored. So Apexus.

4. The cancer patient who switched from a 340B hospital to a non-participating clinic. The article mentions Virginia King had the $22,700 bill and switched to a clinic that charged $8,000. So her name is Virginia King.

5. The program with over 200% cost increase in NY leading to Medicaid changes in 2023. The article says New York changed administration because 340B costs increased over 200% in three years. The program is 340B.

6. The company with a $750 certification course and 36-month patient records advice. Apexus is mentioned as offering the $750 course and employees advised reviewing records back 36 months. So Apexus.

7. Krista Pedley criticized a business practice during a Skype meeting. The article says she reprimanded Apexus for acting sales-driven instead of admin. The practice was promoting sales-focused strategies. The answer is Apexus's sales-driven approach.

8. The state where participating hospitals billed 85% more for cancer drugs. The example given is North Carolina, where a report found 85% more for certain drugs, like melanoma's $8k to $21.5k. So North Carolina.

9. The service sold last year related to data and discounts. The article mentions Acentrus, a business Apexus sold that helped hospitals get deeper discounts via data exchange. So Acentrus.

10. The Texas-based company with 3% fees on generics and non-340B purchases. Apexus is based in Irving, Texas, and charges 3% on generic drugs. Baxter tried to bypass them but couldn't. So Apexus.

Wait, let me check each again to ensure accuracy.

1. Correct, Apexus is the subsidiary of Vizient.

2. Marsha Simon's quote is about Apexus.

3. Apexus' team and bonuses.

4. Virginia King.

5. 340B program in NY.

6. Apexus's course and advice.

7. Apexus's sales focus.

8. North Carolina.

9. Acentrus was sold.

10. Apexus in Texas.
