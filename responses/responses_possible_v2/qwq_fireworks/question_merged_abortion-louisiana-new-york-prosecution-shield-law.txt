Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and answer exactly what's asked.

1. The first question asks for the New York-based reproductive health specialist who co-founded an organization advocating telemedicine abortion and was indicted in Louisiana. The article mentions Dr. Margaret Carpenter as the doctor indicted, and she's a co-founder of the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine. So the answer is her name.

2. The state's district attorney used the phrase "our citizens' babies." The article says the district attorney from West Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, Tony Clayton, made that statement. So the state is Louisiana.

3. The shield law under which she operated is New York's, since she was under New York's telemedicine law. The article states she was operating under New York's shield law.

4. The governor who vowed not to extradite her is Kathy Hochul of New York, as mentioned in the article with her X post.

5. The 151-year-old federal law is the Comstock Act, which abortion opponents want revived to restrict mailing pills. The article mentions this explicitly.

6. The attorney general calling it a state-sponsored effort is New York's Letitia James. She's quoted saying Louisiana is weaponizing the law.

7. The December civil suit was filed by Texas's attorney general, Ken Paxton, against Dr. Carpenter.

8. The organization co-founded by her is the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, as stated in the article.

9. The method is medication abortion, which accounts for two-thirds of abortions post-FDA rule change allowing mail delivery.

10. The criminal charge in Louisiana is "criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs," exactly as stated in the indictment details.

Let me double-check each answer against the text to ensure accuracy and that there's no missing info. All answers are directly from the article, so I think theyâ€™re correct.
