Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I use only the information from the provided article. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question is asking about a veterinarian who discovered tapioca in horse vaccines. The key here is the metallic element later used in US diphtheria shots. The article mentions that Gaston Ramon used tapioca, but later aluminum salts were used. The compound in cheese is mentioned as having 50mg of aluminum. So the metallic element is aluminum. So the answer should be aluminum.

2. The second question refers to the Children's Health Defense chairman (which is RFK Jr.) citing a study linking a respiratory condition (asthma) to vaccine components. The ingredient in question is aluminum, since the study mentioned was about aluminum and asthma. The article says a slice of cheese has more aluminum than vaccines. So the answer is aluminum.

3. Third question: Dr. Ramon's work led to adjuvants. The study linked vaccine components (aluminum) to asthma. The element here is aluminum, which is in Tdap. The future HHS head (RFK Jr.) would blame it. So answer is aluminum.

4. Fourth question: The element in vaccines at 4.4mg in first six months, studied and safe, but blamed by RFK. The article states that the 4.4mg is aluminum, and he blames it for illnesses. So aluminum again.

Wait, all questions are about aluminum. Let me confirm each part. 

For question 1: The substance in cheese is aluminum (as per the article's comparison of 50mg in cheese vs vaccines). The metallic element in the experimental mixture (tapioca plus something else?) but the question is a bit tricky. The question says if he used a substance with 50mg of a compound found in cheese. Since cheese has aluminum, the metallic element would be aluminum. So even if the tapioca mixture didn't have it, the question's hypothetical is that he used a substance with that compound (aluminum from cheese), so the element is aluminum. Correct.

Yes, all answers are aluminum. I think that's right. Let me check each question again quickly.

1. The metallic element in the experimental mixture (if he used the cheese compound) is aluminum. Correct.

2. The ingredient in cheese (aluminum) is the focus. Correct.

3. Element in Tdap linked to asthma via study, which is aluminum. Correct.

4. The element at 4.4mg is aluminum. Correct.

So all answers are aluminum. No N/A here.
