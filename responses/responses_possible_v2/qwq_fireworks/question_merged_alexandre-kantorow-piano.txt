Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I use only the information from the provided article and follow the strict answer format. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The individual who fostered Kantorow's detailed practice approach is Igor Lasko. The question asks what specific element of Kantorow's career trajectory, contrasting with Chamayou's, would show the depth of focus Lasko instilled. The article mentions that Chamayou is stylistically flexible, playing multiple pieces in different genres. Kantorow, in contrast, is taking his time and is uncomfortable with some repertoire until ready. So the answer might be his cautious approach or reluctance to perform certain works until ready. The article says "the luxury of not touching some repertoire until they are absolutely ready" which contrasts with Chamayou's flexibility. So the element is his deliberate, unhurried exploration of repertoire.

2. **Question 2**: The artisanal outlook refers to Kantorow's methodical approach. The teacher who believed all music came from Bach is Shereshevskaya. Kantorow is uncomfortable with Bach in public. Since Shereshevskaya's belief is that all music stems from Bach, the aspect challenging that would be his discomfort performing Bach itself, which is the foundation she emphasized. So the answer is his discomfort performing Bach publicly.

3. **Question 3**: The musician who accompanied his father on the 2014 album is Kantorow himself. The conductor with a belated Philharmonic debut is Marek Janowski. Their shared characteristic: Kantorow's father is a conductor, and Janowski finally got to conduct the NY Phil after long wait. Both have delayed recognition or achieved something later in their careers. The shared trait is their delayed or belated recognition in major roles.

4. **Question 4**: The decision reflecting "unflappable" quality after the rain performance. The article says he stayed with Bis instead of a major label. This shows he's not swayed by sudden fame, staying committed. So the answer is remaining with Bis Records.

5. **Question 5**: The pianist's belief in harmony vs. the artist who played multiple ballet scores (Chamayou). The crucial element Kantorow would emphasize, absent in Chamayou's style, is a focus on harmony and structure. Since Chamayou is flexible and plays varied styles, maybe Kantorow prioritizes harmony over stylistic diversity. The answer might be "a sense of harmony/grammar" as per his quote about harmony not needing tonality but a sense of grammar.

6. **Question 6**: Shereshevskaya's training was like an athlete's, rigorous. The photo shows him as "relaxed in flow". The contradiction is the natural, effortless performance vs. the rigorous training. The aspect would be the "disappearance" of the brain, the effortless flow, which might contradict the intense training regimen.

7. **Question 7**: The "special experience" is the silence, non-amplified music. Idina Menzel's show involves climbing conifers, so her show has physical elements beyond just sound. The essential element Kantorow values is the absence of amplification and focus on pure acoustic sound.

8. **Question 8**: Founder of Bis (Robert von Bahr) describing Kantorow's brashness in Brahms. The parallel to his career choices is his deliberate pacing, not rushing into repertoire. The answer would be his cautious approach, waiting until ready, like with Brahms.

9. **Question 9**: The "private family thing" was his early musical life. After fame, the ironic decision is the fans holding "cherche place" signs, showing overexposure, which his parents feared. So the decision leading to that is his international fame and popularity causing fans to seek his concerts.
