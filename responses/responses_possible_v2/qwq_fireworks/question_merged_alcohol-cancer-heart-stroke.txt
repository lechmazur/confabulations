Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and cross-referencing the article to find the answers.

1. The first question asks about a specific cancer more prevalent in women mentioned in the federal analysis even at minimal consumption. The article says women face a higher risk of liver cancer even at one drink a day. So the answer is liver cancer.

2. The second question is about a cerebrovascular event where the protective effect disappears at two drinks. The article mentions that reduction in strokes from blood clots disappears with two or more drinks. Ischemic stroke is caused by blood clots, so the answer is ischemic stroke.

3. The third question asks for the minimum number of drinks leading to increased alcohol-caused death, aligning with the upper limit for one gender. The article states two drinks a day increases odds of death for both, which is the current upper limit for men. So the answer is two.

4. The fourth question is about the age group with over tenfold increase in death odds. The report mentions starting drinking at 15, so the age group is teenagers or under 15. The exact wording says "girls and boys who start drinking at 15," so the answer is teenagers (or 15-year-olds, but the question says age group, so "teenagers").

5. The fifth question is about a metabolic condition less prevalent with moderate drinking in women. The article says women with one drink may have lower diabetes risk. So if she abstains, maybe higher diabetes risk. The answer is diabetes.

6. The sixth question asks for a cancer in the area where food and air passages cross. The article lists cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus. The pharynx or larynx could be where food and air cross. The question specifies "area where food and air passages cross"â€”the pharynx is part of both. The answer might be pharyngeal cancer or pharynx cancer. The exact wording in the article says "cancers of the oral cavity, the pharynx and larynx and the esophagus," so pharyngeal cancer.

7. The seventh question is about a liver disease cited with one drink. The article mentions liver cirrhosis. So the answer is liver cirrhosis.

8. The eighth question is about a cancer with a small increase in women by National Academies and listed in the new report. The National Academies mentioned breast cancer. The new report lists seven cancers including breast. So the answer is breast cancer.

9. The ninth question asks the current maximum for men, which the article says is two drinks, as in 2020 they suggested lowering to one but the guidelines kept two for men. So the answer is two.

10. The tenth question is a digestive system cancer among the seven. The article lists colorectal, liver, etc. Colorectal is a digestive cancer. The answer is colorectal cancer.
