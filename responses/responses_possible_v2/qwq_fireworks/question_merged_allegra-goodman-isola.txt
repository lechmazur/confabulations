Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks about a paradoxical social structure that contradicts 16th-century French hierarchies, considering Marguerite's observation about being rulers and subjects, Roberval's financial manipulations, and the queen's commentary. The article mentions Marguerite saying they were "rulers and their own subjects," which suggests they had both authority and subjugation. Roberval controlled her finances, showing the existing hierarchy, but on the island, they had autonomy. The queen's line about enduring teaching implies that suffering grants them a different status. So the paradox is that despite being exiled, they have both power and lack of it, which contradicts the rigid French hierarchy. The answer should be something like "autonomy within subjugation" or similar.

2. The second question is about the juxtaposition of Marguerite's restrained voice when talking about the polar bear versus visceral descriptions of seabirds. The text says she describes the bear like a beef Wellington, which is restrained, but the seabirds are more vivid. This contrast shows a tension between maintaining class identity (restrained, elegant) and primal survival (visceral). So the theme is class vs. primal adaptation. The answer might be "class restraint vs. primal survival."

3. For the third question, three textual points showing Roberval delayed punishment strategically. The article mentions he "allowed the illusion of freedom," "slow to mete out punishment," and the "penalty is appalling" (implying calculated). Those are three points. So the answer lists those three elements.

4. The fourth question involves Basque fishermen, New France, and Damienne's role. Damienne was Marguerite's nurse, so part of the household. The Basque rescue might be non-French, showing colonial contradictions—French colonization attempts but rescue by another group. The geopolitical contradiction is that while France is colonizing, other Europeans (Basque) are the ones who rescue her, undermining French control. Answer: "Basque rescue vs. French colonial claims."

5. The fifth question about temporal sequencing: Marguerite's loss of faith in winter, Auguste's doubts before exile, Roberval's absences. The causal chain links Roberval's neglect (absences) leading to Auguste's doubts, then their exile, leading to Marguerite's loss of faith. So the theological arc is caused by these events in sequence. Answer: "Roberval's absences led to Auguste's doubts, exile caused faith crisis."

6. Financial status under Roberval vs. exile conditions. The article says Roberval managed her finances to his advantage, but on the island they had to survive on birds and had only what they could carry. So contradiction is that she was wealthy before but impoverished on the island, showing Roberval cared more about his gain than her well-being. Answer: "Wealth under Roberval vs. material poverty on island reveals his greed."

7. Han Kang's trauma vs. Goodman's approach. The article states Han Kang probes historic wounds through fiction, while Marguerite's story uses historical records but focuses on personal survival and endurance. The contrast is institutional power structures: Goodman's protagonist adapts personally, while Han's deals with collective trauma. Answer: "Goodman focuses on personal endurance vs. Kang's collective trauma under power."

8. Four elements making the island a space of legal autonomy. The text mentions they were rulers and subjects, had property (shelter, pelt), freedom from Roberval's control, and self-governance. The four points could be: self-rule, property ownership, absence of Roberval's authority, survival through their own means. Answer: "Self-rule, property, absence of guardian, self-sufficiency."

9. The last question: Marguerite's undocumented agonies, queen's commentary, Damienne's role undermining Roberval's punishment. The queen says endurance teaches, Marguerite hides her pain, Damienne helps them survive. This shows they found strength, contradicting Roberval's intent to break them. So the answer is "Their endurance and Damienne's aid subvert Roberval's punitive intent."
