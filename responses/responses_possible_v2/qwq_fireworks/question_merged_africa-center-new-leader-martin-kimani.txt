Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked without assuming anything beyond the text. Let me go through each question step by step.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks about a former Wall Street professional with a doctorate in war studies aiming to strengthen connections between African migrants and the diaspora. The article mentions Martin Kimani has a Ph.D. in war studies from King's College London, worked on Wall Street in the mid-90s, and plans initiatives for migrants from countries like Mauritania and Senegal. So the answer is Martin Kimani.

2. **Question 2**: The leader who succeeded a seven-year tenure by Uzodinma Iweala. The article states Kimani started after Iweala stepped down after seven years. The Harlem institution is the Africa Center, which occupies 20% of its space (so 14,000 sq ft of 70k). The answer is Martin Kimani.

3. **Question 3**: Philosophy graduate from NH, transitioned from currency sales to head an institution needing $4.25M. Kimani has a BA in philosophy from UNH, worked in currency sales, and the Africa Center needs that funding. So Martin Kimani again.

4. **Question 4**: NYU executive director with American residency at the northern end of Museum Mile (the Africa Center is on Museum Mile). Kimani is the NYU Center's exec director and has American residency. Plans to engage the neighborhood beyond international visitors. Answer: Martin Kimani.

5. **Question 5**: Security expert (he was a counterterrorism envoy) who admitted he wasn't good at making money in the 90s, now leads an org in a luxury condo building designed by Robert A.M. Stern. The Africa Center's building includes condos by that architect. Answer: Martin Kimani.

6. **Question 6**: King's College grad (he has a PhD there) aiming to shift fundraising from big donors to smaller ones. The article mentions he wants to go beyond big philanthropy. Answer: Martin Kimani.

7. **Question 7**: UN rep (he was Kenya's permanent UN rep) arrived in NY in 2020, seeks dialogue between recent immigrants (Mauritania, Senegal) and the broader community. The article states his arrival date and the initiative. Answer: Martin Kimani.

8. **Question 8**: Leader occupying 14k sq ft (20% of 70k is 14k) planning to serve neighborhood residents. The Africa Center is the org, and Kimani is the leader. Answer: Martin Kimani.

9. **Question 9**: Counterterrorism envoy (special envoy for countering extremism) with bond sales experience leading the Africa Center, which evolved from an art museum. Answer: Martin Kimani.

10. **Question 10**: Former political risk analyst replacing Iweala to transform the space and address diaspora divisions. Kimani has political risk analysis experience, replaced Iweala, and mentions solidarity issues. Answer: Martin Kimani.

I need to confirm each answer is directly from the text. All questions are about Kimani except if there's a trick, but the article only mentions him as the new leader. All answers should be Kimani except if any details don't fit. Let me check each again quickly.

1. Yes, all details match.  
2. Succeeded Iweala after seven years.  
3. Philosophy from NH and funding.  
4. NYU role and residency.  
5. Security background and condos.  
6. King's College and fundraising.  
7. UN rep and arrival date.  
8. 14k sq ft.  
9. Counterterrorism and bond sales.
