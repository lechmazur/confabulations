Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then cross-referencing the article for answers.

Question 1 asks which philanthropist, married to a former Google CEO and involved in producing socially relevant documentaries, bought a majority stake in the New York-based company that made "Taxi to the Dark Side." The article mentions Wendy Schmidt, who is married to Eric Schmidt (the ex-CEO of Google). She's described as a philanthropist and has executive produced films like "The Hunting Ground." That fits, so the answer should be Wendy Schmidt.

Question 2 is about the name of the profit-making documentary company based in New York with 15 employees that made the Oscar-winning "Taxi to the Dark Side." The article clearly states the company is Jigsaw Productions. So that's straightforward.

Question 3 asks for the title of an independent documentary about a Middle Eastern conflict that's a best documentary front-runner but can't get US distribution. The article mentions "No Other Land," which is about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That's the one.

Question 4 refers to a socially conscious company that was once Hollywood's leader in that genre and is mentioned via a new hire. The article says Participant Media was Hollywood's preeminent maker until it shut down, and Courtney Sexton came from there. So the answer is Participant Media.

Question 5 wants the title of a Jigsaw film about a corporate scandal involving energy trading. The article lists "Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room" as one of their films. Enron was an energy trading company, so that's the answer.

Question 6 asks who the director leading his own company is, considering age and continued leadership after selling a majority stake. The article says Alex Gibney sold a majority stake but continues to run Jigsaw. He's 71, so he's the answer.

Question 7 is about who stated society is at an inflection point due to tech and compromised systems. The quote is from Wendy Schmidt in the article. She talks about existential threats from technology and systems, so her name goes here.

I need to make sure each answer is directly from the text. Let me check each again quickly. All answers seem to be explicitly stated except maybe the Enron film, but the article does mention that as part of Jigsaw's work. Okay, looks good. No N/A needed here since all questions are answered in the text.
