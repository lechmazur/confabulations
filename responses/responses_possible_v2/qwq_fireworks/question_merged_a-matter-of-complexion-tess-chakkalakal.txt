Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. 

1. The first question asks which novel by a North Carolinian writer challenges the "Lost Cause" version of a Southern coup. The article mentions that Chesnutt's 1901 novel "The Marrow of Tradition" directly addresses the Wilmington Massacre and counters the white supremacist narrative. So the answer should be "The Marrow of Tradition".

2. The violent event described as an "orgy of violence" is the Wilmington Massacre of 1898. The article states this event as the backdrop for Chesnutt's critique. So that's the answer here.

3. The publication credential Chesnutt used in 1888 to meet Cable was his work in The Atlantic. The article says he used his authorship there to get access to Cable. So "The Atlantic" is the answer.

4. Chesnatt's ability to pass as white is due to being light-skinned and having fine hair. The article mentions his one-eighth African heritage allowed him to pass. So the characteristic is "light-skinned, fine-haired".

5. The essay "A Multitude of Counselors" targets Cable and Tourgee. The question asks for the white literary figure Chesnutt critiqued. The answer is George Washington Cable, as mentioned in the text.

6. The overshadowing figure is likely Mark Twain, since he's listed among contemporaries like Howells and Tourgee who were white and wrote on racial themes. The article says Chesnutt's work was overshadowed by these white authors.

7. "The Goophered Grapevine" was published in The Atlantic. The article explicitly states that this was the first Black writer's fiction in The Atlantic.

8. The political reinterpretation by Waddell called the coup "legal" and dismissed Black governance. The answer is his claim of a "perfectly legal" transfer due to Fusionist inefficiency.

9. The story about identity conflict under the one-drop rule is "The Wife of His Youth", mentioned in the article as dealing with those themes.

10. The contemporary biography is "A Matter of Complexion" by Tess Chakkalakal, stated as the first in a generation.
