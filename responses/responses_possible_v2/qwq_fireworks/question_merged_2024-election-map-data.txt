Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article provided. Let's go through each question carefully.

1. The first question is a bit complex. It asks about a visualization method from 2016 that prioritized popular vote over political character, and what type of data presentation was rejected due to incompleteness. The article mentions they used a choropleth map which doesn't account for population density. The question suggests an alternative method that's unsuitable because of incomplete data. The article says some states don't include early or mail-in ballots, so maybe the rejected method is something like a choropleth that requires complete data? Wait, the article says the choropleth was chosen despite not accounting for population. The question's answer might be about a different method that's not used because data is incomplete. Wait, the article says they didn't include places with incomplete data (like those missing early/absentee). The "explicitly rejected" method might be one that requires full data. Hmm, maybe the answer is "choropleth" but that's what they used. Wait, the question is about the method that was rejected. Wait, the article says they chose choropleth despite its drawback. The other methods? The article doesn't mention others, but maybe the rejected data presentation is the one that requires complete data, like a map that can't handle missing areas. Or perhaps the answer is "dot density maps" or something else. Wait, the question says "explicitly rejected for the current map due to its incompleteness in many locations". The article says some areas are empty because data isn't available. So maybe the rejected method is one that can't handle missing data, but the choropleth just leaves areas empty. Wait, perhaps the answer is "cartogram" which adjusts for population, but the article didn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "maps that require complete data coverage", but the question wants a specific term. Wait, the article mentions that some states don't provide early/absentee, so those are excluded. The question's answer might be "precinct-level maps" but that's what they did. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the article again. The choropleth was chosen even though it doesn't account for population, but they prioritized political character. The drawback is that it doesn't account for population. The question's first part says if the 2016 method (which was choropleth) had prioritized popular vote instead of political character, what presentation was rejected. Wait, the current map uses choropleth. If they had chosen a method that shows popular vote (like a pie chart for each precinct scaled by population?), but the rejected one is the choropleth because of incomplete data? Not sure. Maybe the answer is "choropleth maps" but that's what they used. Alternatively, maybe the answer refers to the "shaded area choropleth" but the question is tricky. Maybe the answer is "dot density maps" but that's not mentioned. Alternatively, the question is asking for the type of data presentation that was rejected because of incomplete data. The article says they didn't include areas with incomplete data (like missing early votes). So the presentation that requires complete data would be unsuitable. But the question says "explicitly rejected for the current map due to its incompleteness". The answer might be "maps that require complete precinct data" but the article says they excluded those. Wait, the question's wording is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "maps that account for population density" because that's the drawback they mention. The current choropleth doesn't account for population, so if they had chosen a method that does (to reflect popular vote), but rejected because data was incomplete. Hmm, maybe the answer is "choropleth maps" but I'm not sure. Let me come back to this after others.

2. The second question asks for the percentage of votes represented on the map as of initial publication. The article says the map includes "more than 110,000 precincts, or 73 percent of all votes". So the answer is 73%.

3. The third question: excluding the person who joined in 2013 (Wilson Andrews), the individual who parsed PDF data (maybe someone else) prioritizing counties with most votes. The data often excluded from precinct releases is early or mail-in ballots. So if they prioritize high-vote counties but those counties exclude early/mail-in, their turnout would be misrepresented. The answer is "early or mail-in absentee ballots".

4. The fourth question: if shading intensity is inversely related to population density (so sparse areas have darker shades), and some data couldn't be matched, what task would be more complex? The article says "putting the data into precinct boundaries" was half the battle. If sparse areas have dark shades but boundaries are misaligned, the task of matching results to boundaries becomes harder. The task mentioned as "half the battle" was "putting the data into precinct boundaries". So the answer is "matching results to precinct boundaries".

5. If data-curious individuals focused on areas where names aligned perfectly, which initial step would be less time-consuming? The initial step was collecting data (like parsing PDFs). The article mentions "in some cases, data was trapped in PDFs and had to be parsed. In a few places, data-curious individuals had already collected precinct data..." So if those individuals did the parsing for areas with aligned names, then the time-consuming part (parsing PDFs) would be less so. The initial step they avoided would be parsing PDFs. The answer is "parsing data trapped in PDF files".

6. If a state added least populated counties, and the map's drawback is not accounting for population density, then the drawback of choropleth (overemphasizing sparse areas) would be worse. The drawback mentioned is that "a sparsely populated area... is shaded the same as a densely populated one with same margin". Adding more sparse areas would exacerbate that. The answer is "the choropleth's failure to account for population density".

7. If a state now provides complete data tables (previously had incomplete), what submission becomes less crucial? The article says they welcome submissions from officials and citizens to add missing data. If the data is now complete, the less crucial would be "submissions of missing data" or "notifying inaccuracies". The answer is "submissions of missing data".

8. If they switch to a method that shows population density, what limitation becomes irrelevant? The current limitation is not accounting for population. So that limitation (choropleth's ignoring population) would be irrelevant. The answer is "the choropleth's failure to account for population density".

9. If a county's boundaries are different but vote counts match, what external contribution helps? The article mentions using official boundaries and needing to verify. The contribution would be "precinct boundary files from election officials" or "boundary data". The answer is "precinct boundary files".

10. If the election compared to 2016 instead of 2020, what challenge remains? The challenge is varying data formats from different entities. The answer is "the lack of a nationwide source of data" or "varying formats from state/county sources". The article says "each has its own way of releasing data, and no nationwide source". So the answer is "the lack of a nationwide source of precinct-level data".
