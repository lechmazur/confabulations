Okay, let me start by reading through the questions one by one and then refer back to the article to find the answers. I need to make sure I'm only using the information provided in the text and not making any assumptions.

1. The first question is about the strategy used by the Isoko-inspired founder (Masobe Books' founder, Othuke Anthony Ominiabohs) to boost sales beyond workshops. The article mentions collaborations with a pharmacy chain, social media influencers, a book club, and discounts to bookstores. The question also references "Nearly All the Men in Lagos Are Mad," which was published by Masobe. So the answer should be those strategies he implemented.

2. Tsitsi Dangarembga's "Nervous Conditions" was translated into Shona. If it were Wolof instead, the publisher involved in Shona was in Zimbabwe, but Wolof is in Senegal. The article mentions Sulaiman Adebowale of Amalion Publishing in Senegal who is looking to translate into Wolof and Hausa. So the answer would be Amalion Publishing.

3. The question asks about a non-traditional method used by the "Let us read" publisher (Masobe's founder) for children's books outside of BookStorm. The founder used partnerships with pharmacies, influencers, etc. So adapting that for children's books would involve similar partnerships or discounts, but since BookStorm is excluded, maybe the business partnerships like with pharmacies?

4. The initiative by a novelist and festival organizer (Lola Shoneyin, founder of Ake Arts and Book Festival) for training in children's books is BookStorm itself. But the question excludes BookStorm, so maybe the training part of BookStorm? Wait, the question says "directly addresses the need for training in areas crucial for the success of children's book publication". The answer is BookStorm's training program, but since the question excludes BookStorm, maybe N/A? Wait, no, the question says "excluding BookStorm project", so maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says Lola's BookStorm is the project for training. Since the question excludes BookStorm, then the answer would be N/A? Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The question says "excluding the BookStorm project", so the answer is N/A? Or is there another initiative? The article says "Lola Shoneyin... is leading a project to train..." which is BookStorm. So without BookStorm, no other mentioned. So answer N/A?

Wait, the question says "what non-traditional promotional method... employed by the founder of the publishing house whose name translates to 'Let us read' (Masobe Books) could be adapted to further enhance distribution of children's books via BookStorm? Wait, no, the question says "excluding BookStorm project" so the answer is the methods Masobe used, like collaborating with pharmacies. So the answer would be partnerships with businesses like pharmacies.

Wait the question is: "what non-traditional promotional method... employed by the founder of the publishing house whose name translates to 'Let us read' (Masobe) could be adapted to children's books developed through BookStorm?" So the method is the business partnerships (pharmacy chains, etc.), so answer is collaborating with businesses like pharmacies.

5. Jahazi Press initially acquired rights from Western publishers. The example given is "A Broken People's Playlist" by Chimeka Garricks, published by Masobe then acquired by HarperCollins. So the type is a story collection. So the answer is story collections or short story collections.

6. The language targeted by the Senegalese publisher (Sulaiman Adebowale of Amalion) for broader reach besides French and English is Wolof or Hausa. Since the question is about preserving heritage and the Shona translation was by someone else, the answer is Wolof or Hausa. The question asks which one is spoken by millions across West Africa. The article says "Wolof and Hausa, languages spoken by millions in several West African nations." Since the actual translation was into Shona (Zimbabwe), the answer would be Wolof or Hausa. The question is which one the Senegalese publisher is targeting. The publisher is in Senegal, so Wolof is a major language there. But Hausa is spoken across West Africa. The question says "targeted by a Senegalese publisher", so the answer is Wolof and/or Hausa. The question asks for the specific language, so maybe both? But the answer needs to be one. The article says "looking to translate into Wolof and Hausa", so either is correct. Since the question is about the Booker finalist's work (Dangarembga's) which was in Shona, the equivalent would be Wolof or Hausa. The answer is either. Since the publisher is in Senegal, maybe Wolof. But the question specifies "spoken by millions across several West African nations"—Hausa is spoken in multiple countries. So the answer is Hausa.

Wait, the question says "which specific language... targeted by a Senegalese publisher, represents a potential market..." The publisher is targeting both, but the answer should be one. The article says "translating into Wolof and Hausa", so both are options, but the question asks for "specific", so maybe either is acceptable. Since the user might expect one, perhaps the answer is Hausa because it's more cross-national, but the article doesn't specify which one. Hmm, maybe the answer is Hausa? Or maybe the question wants both? But the format requires a single answer. The question says "specific language", so perhaps the correct answer is Hausa since it's spoken across several countries, while Wolof is mainly in Senegal. The article says "spoken by millions of people in several West African nations" for both. Maybe both are acceptable, but since the question asks for one, perhaps the answer is Wolof because the publisher is in Senegal. But the question is about the Booker finalist's work (Shona) translated into another language. The answer should be Wolof or Hausa. The article says the Senegalese publisher is targeting both. Since the question is about which one, perhaps the answer is Hausa because it's more widespread. Alternatively, the article says "looking to translate into Wolof and Hausa", so either is possible. Since the question requires one, maybe the answer is "Wolof" because the publisher is Senegalese where Wolof is a major language. But the question says "spoken by millions across several West African nations"—Hausa is in Nigeria, Niger, etc. So maybe Hausa. The article says "spoken by millions of people in several West African nations"—so both qualify. Since the question is about a potential market for the translated works of the Booker finalist (Dangarembga's Shona translation), the equivalent would be either. Since the answer requires a specific one, and the publisher is mentioned as Sulaiman Adebowale of Amalion, which is in Senegal, perhaps Wolof. But the question says "targeted by a Senegalese publisher"—so the answer is Wolof. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Hausa because the question mentions "West African nations beyond Senegal". Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous, but the article states both, so perhaps the answer is "Hausa" because it's spoken across more countries. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "Wolof" as the first mentioned. I think the article says "Wolof and Hausa" so perhaps the answer is both, but the question asks for "specific", so maybe one of them. Since the user might expect Hausa, I'll go with Hausa.

7. The audio platform mentioned for publicizing African radio dramas is Genti and AkooBooks. The question asks which one could collaborate with the publisher of "A Broken People's Playlist" (Masobe Books) to expand beyond print. The answer is either Genti or AkooBooks. The article mentions both, so the answer is either. Since the question asks for one, perhaps "Genti" or "AkooBooks". The article says "Audio platforms like Genti and AkooBooks are publicizing...", so either is correct. The answer could be "Genti and AkooBooks", but the question says "what audio platform", so one of them. Maybe the first one mentioned, Genti. Or the answer is both, but the format requires one. Let me check the exact wording: "Audio platforms like Genti and AkooBooks are publicizing..." so the answer is either. Since the question says "what audio platform", perhaps the answer is Genti or AkooBooks. Since the user might accept either, but the article lists both, maybe the answer is "Genti and AkooBooks", but the instructions say to answer with the exact term. Wait, the question says "what audio platform", so the answer would be either one. Since the article lists both, perhaps the answer is "Genti" as the first mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the answer is both, but the user expects one. Since the user requires a single answer, perhaps pick the first one.

8. The collaborative approach advocated by Doek's founder (Ngamije) is solidarity and working together. The article says "We have to have boots on the ground... face them together" and "We are going to need each other... hold space for each other." So the answer is collaboration or solidarity among African publishers. The question asks for the specific approach, so the exact phrase would be "solidarity" or "collaboration across Africa" but the article says "face them together" and "need each other", so the answer is collaboration among African publishers. The exact term from the text is "solidarity" and "face them together". The question mentions "collaborative approach advocated by the festival's founder", which is "solidarity" and "working together". The answer is "collaboration" or "solidarity". The exact quote is "We have to have boots on the ground... We can't fix this struggle from somewhere else. We are going to need each other...". The answer would be collaboration or solidarity. Since the question asks for the specific approach, the answer is "solidarity and collaboration".

9. The founder of Prestige Bookshop (Ahmed Aidarus) wants to increase visibility for Kenyan authors. The strategy used by the computer scientist (Ominiabohs) was partnering with pharmacies and businesses. So the answer is collaborating with businesses like pharmacies or other chains.

10. The challenge faced by the author of "Odufa" after self-publication was promoting the book and making money. If the children had been exposed to digital strategies (like self-publishing online, using social media), that might have helped with promotion. The question asks which challenge would be mitigated. The answer is "promoting the book" or "making money from it". The question says "which specific challenge... might have been partially mitigated". The challenge was "how to promote the book and make money from it". So the answer is promotion.
