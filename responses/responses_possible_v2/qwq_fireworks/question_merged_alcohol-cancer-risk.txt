Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to make sure I understand each question and find the exact information in the article to answer them correctly. Let me go through each question step by step.

1. **Question 1**: Which cancer type shows the highest percentage increase in relative risk for light drinkers compared to non-drinkers, despite not being the most common in absolute terms?

The article mentions a 2013 study in the Annals of Oncology. It states that light drinkers (up to one drink a day) had a 30% higher chance of esophageal cancer, 17% for oral cavity and pharynx, and 5% for breast cancer compared to non-drinkers. The highest here is 30% for esophageal. The question specifies it's not the most common, but the highest relative increase. So esophageal cancer is the answer.

2. **Question 2**: For women consuming exactly two drinks daily, what's the precise percentage increase in breast cancer risk compared to the reference group?

The reference group is less than one drink/week. The article says at two drinks/day (14/week), women's breast cancer risk increases to 15.3%. The reference group's breast cancer risk was 11% (from "less than one drink per week"). The increase is 15.3 - 11 = 4.3 percentage points. But the question asks for percentage increase relative to the reference. Wait, the question says "precise percentage increase" which might mean relative risk. Wait, the article states "the share of those who would develop breast cancer increased to 15.3 percent" from 11% (since in the reference group it was 11% for women). The increase is (15.3 - 11)/11 * 100 = approx 39.1%. But the question says "precise percentage increase". Wait, maybe the article says the exact numbers. Let me check again. The article says "the share of those who would develop breast cancer increased to 15.3 percent." The reference group is less than one drink/week had 11% for breast cancer. So the increase is 15.3-11 = 4.3 percentage points, but percentage increase is (4.3/11)*100 ≈ 39.09%, but the question says "precise percentage increase". The article doesn't state the exact percentage increase, only the absolute numbers. Wait, but the question says "precise percentage increase". Since the article provides the absolute percentages, the increase is 4.3 percentage points. But the question might want the relative increase. However, the exact wording says "precise percentage increase" so perhaps it's 4.3% but that's points, not percentage of the original. Hmm, maybe the question is looking for the difference in percentage points. The answer might be 4.3% but the exact numbers from the article for two drinks: women's breast cancer goes to 15.3% from 11% (reference). So the increase is 4.3 percentage points. But the question says "percentage increase compared to the reference group". That would be (15.3/11 -1)*100 ≈ 39.09%. However, the article doesn't state this as a percentage increase, only the absolute values. Since the question asks for the "precise percentage increase", maybe the answer is 4.3, but it's points. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting the 15.3% as the new risk, but the question is about the increase from the reference. Since the article states the exact numbers (11% to 15.3%), the answer is 4.3 percentage points. But the question says "percentage increase", which is relative. Since the article doesn't give the relative increase, maybe it's N/A? Wait, but the question says "based solely on the facts in the text". The article says "the share of those who would develop breast cancer increased to 15.3 percent". The original was 11%, so the increase is 15.3 -11 = 4.3. The question says "precise percentage increase", so maybe the answer is 4.3, but in percentage points. Alternatively, maybe it's 39% but the article doesn't state that. Since the article gives the exact absolute percentages, perhaps the question expects the difference as 4.3 percentage points. But the question says "percentage increase", which is a relative term. Since the article doesn't state the relative increase, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, but the article does say "the lifetime risk of breast cancer increased to 13.1 percent" at one drink per day. Wait, no, for two drinks, it's 15.3% from 11%. So the increase is 4.3 percentage points. The question might be looking for that, so 4.3. But the question specifies "precise percentage increase". Since the article provides the exact numbers (11% to 15.3%), the precise percentage increase in absolute terms is 4.3 percentage points. But if they want relative (percentage), it's (4.3/11)*100, but that's not stated. Since the question says "precise percentage increase", maybe they want the 4.3, but as a percentage point difference. The answer might be 4.3, but I need to check the exact wording again.

Wait the question says "precise percentage increase in lifetime breast cancer risk". The article states that at two drinks per day, the breast cancer risk is 15.3% compared to the reference group's 11%. The increase is 15.3 -11 = 4.3 percentage points. But percentage increase would be (15.3 / 11 -1)*100 = 39.09%. However, the article does not present this as a percentage increase, only the absolute values. Since the question asks for the "precise percentage increase", maybe the answer is N/A because the article only provides the absolute percentages. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting the 4.3 as the increase in percentage points. But the term "percentage increase" usually refers to relative, so maybe it's N/A. Hmm, tricky. Let me hold on and check other questions first.

3. **Question 3**: What volume of wine corresponds to the level where women have a 19% lifetime risk of any alcohol-related cancer?

The article says that one drink per day (seven drinks/week) leads to 19% for women. Since a standard drink is 5 ounces of wine, so 7 drinks per week would be 7 *5 = 35 ounces. So 35 ounces per week.

4. **Question 4**: At what daily consumption level does the absolute risk difference between men and women reach its maximum?

Looking at the data: 

- Less than 1/week: Women 17%, Men 10% → difference 7%
- 1/day (men 11%, women 19% → difference 8%)
- 2/day: Women 22%, Men 13% → difference 9%
- 4+/day: Not given for absolute numbers except that heavy drinking increases more, but the article says "the share of those who would develop alcohol-related cancers over life span increased from 16.5 (women's <1/week) to nearly 22% at 2 drinks/day. Men at 2/day: 13% (from 10% at <1/week). So the difference at 2/day is 22-13=9%. At 4+/day, the article says for men, heavy drinking (4+/day) is linked to more cancers, but the exact percentages aren't given beyond 13% for 2 drinks. The question is about the maximum gap. The highest difference so far is 9% at 2/day. Since the article doesn't give data beyond that, the maximum is at 2 drinks per day.

5. **Question 5**: Which cancer type is in both light and heavy drinking categories and has a compound risk with smoking?

The light drinking section mentions cancers like mouth, throat, larynx, esophagus, breast, liver, colon/rectum. Heavy adds liver, stomach, gallbladder, pancreas. The overlap would be mouth, throat, larynx, esophagus, liver, colon/rectum. The article also mentions that drinking and smoking together compound head and neck cancers (oral cavity and pharynx). So esophageal or mouth/oral cavity. The question says "specific cancer type". The article says "Drinking and smoking cigarettes is known to compound the risk of head and neck cancers". Head and neck includes oral cavity and pharynx. The light drinking section includes "mouth, pharynx". So oral cavity and pharynx cancers are in the light category. Heavy drinking's cancers include mouth, oropharynx, etc. So the overlapping cancer that is in both and has a compound risk with smoking would be oral cavity/pharynx, but the exact term in the article for that is "oral cavity and pharynx" (from the 2013 study). The question asks for the specific cancer type. Alternatively, esophageal is mentioned in the light drinking's relative risk (30% increase). But the compound risk with smoking is for head and neck. The article says "head and neck cancers" which includes oral cavity and pharynx. The answer would be oral cavity/pharynx, but the question asks for a specific type. The article mentions "cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx" as having 17% higher risk with light drinking. So the answer is oral cavity and pharynx, but maybe "oral cavity" or "pharynx" alone? Or "head and neck"? The question says "specific cancer type", so perhaps "oral cavity and pharynx cancer". But the options in the article: The original seven cancers include mouth, throat, larynx, esophagus, breast, liver, colon/rectum. The heavy drinking adds liver, stomach, gall bladder, pancreas. The overlapping ones would be mouth, throat, larynx, esophagus, liver, colon/rectum. The compound risk with smoking is for head and neck (oral cavity and pharynx). The article says "head and neck cancers" which would be under the mouth, throat, etc. So the answer is oral cavity and pharynx cancer.

6. **Question 6**: What volume of liquor consumed daily corresponds to the 13.1% breast cancer risk?

The 13.1% is mentioned for women at one drink per day. Since one standard drink is 1.5 ounces of liquor, so the daily volume would be 1.5 ounces. But the question asks for the volume corresponding to 13.1%, which is at one drink/day. So the answer is 1.5 ounces of liquor per day.

Wait let me verify each again.

1. Highest relative risk increase for light drinkers: esophageal at 30%, which is higher than oral (17%) and breast (5%). So answer is esophageal cancer.

2. For two drinks daily, the breast cancer risk for women is 15.3% vs reference group's 11%. The increase is 4.3 percentage points. The question says "percentage increase", which is relative. So (15.3/11 -1)*100 ≈ 39%. But the article doesn't state this as a percentage increase. The question says "precise percentage increase". Since the article provides the absolute numbers, the difference is 4.3 percentage points. But percentage increase is relative. Since the question says "precise", maybe it's expecting the 4.3, but that's points. Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong, but according to the article, the exact increase from 11% to 15.3% is 4.3 percentage points. Since the question asks for the "percentage increase", which is relative, but the article doesn't give the relative number, so perhaps N/A? Wait, but maybe the question is referring to the absolute percentage (15.3% is the new risk, so the increase is 4.3). The question says "precise percentage increase", so maybe 4.3. But the term "percentage increase" is ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the 15.3% is the new risk, so the increase compared to the reference is 15.3-11=4.3, so the answer is 4.3. But the question says "percentage increase", so maybe they mean the absolute difference. Let me check the article again. The article states "the lifetime risk of breast cancer increased to 13.1 percent" (for one drink/day). For two drinks, it's 15.3% from 11% (reference). The question is about two drinks, so the increase from 11 to 15.3 is 4.3 percentage points. Since the question says "precise percentage increase", maybe the answer is 4.3, as in 4.3 percentage points. But the term "percentage increase" could be misinterpreted. Since the article doesn't give the relative percentage increase (like 39%), but only the absolute, maybe the answer is 4.3. Alternatively, since the question says "precise percentage increase", but the article doesn't state it as a percentage, perhaps it's N/A. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the 15.3% itself as the new risk, but the question asks for the increase compared to the reference. Since the article gives the absolute numbers, perhaps the answer is 4.3, but I'm not sure. Let me proceed and see if other questions are clearer.

3. Volume of wine for 19% risk: one drink/day (7/week). Each drink is 5 oz wine. 7*5=35 oz per week. So 35 ounces.

4. Daily consumption level where the gender difference is maximum. The differences are:

At <1/week: 7% (17-10)

At 1/day (women 19%, men 11% → 8% difference)

At 2/day: women 22%, men 13% → 9% difference

So maximum at 2 drinks per day. So the answer is two drinks per day.

5. Cancer type in both categories and compound with smoking: oral cavity and pharynx cancers (since they are in light drinking and also in the compound risk with smoking). The article mentions "cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx" with 17% higher risk. The compound risk is for head and neck, which includes these. So the answer is oral cavity and pharynx cancer.

6. The 13.1% is at one drink/day. Since one drink is 1.5 oz of liquor, so 1.5 oz daily.

Now, let me check each again.

For question 2: The exact question says "precise percentage increase". The article says "the share of those who would develop breast cancer increased to 13.1 percent" (at one drink/day). Wait, the question is about two drinks per day. Wait the question says: For women consuming exactly two drinks daily, what's the increase compared to the reference group. The reference group is <1 drink/week. The article says at two drinks per day (14 per week), the breast cancer risk is 15.3% vs reference's 11%. The increase is 4.3 percentage points. If the question requires the percentage increase (relative), then (15.3 -11)/11 *100 ≈ 39.09%. But since the article doesn't state this percentage, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, if they want the absolute increase in percentage points, it's 4.3. The question says "precise percentage increase". Since the article provides the exact absolute percentages (11% to 15.3%), the difference is 4.3 percentage points. But percentage increase usually refers to relative. Since the article doesn't give that number, maybe it's N/A. Wait, but the question says "based solely on the facts in the text". The article gives the numbers, so the percentage points can be calculated. The question might accept 4.3 as the answer. Alternatively, the question might expect the 15.3% as the new risk, but the question is about the increase. Since the article states the new risk, the increase is the difference. So the answer is 4.3. But it's percentage points. The question says "percentage increase", which is ambiguous. Maybe the answer is 4.3, but I'll have to go with that since the data allows calculating the difference.

Proceeding with that.
