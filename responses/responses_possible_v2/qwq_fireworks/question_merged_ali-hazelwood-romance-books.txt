Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one, making sure I only use the article provided. Let me start by going through each question carefully and see what the article says.

1. The first question asks for a book recommended by the author of "Deep End" (which is Ali Hazelwood) that mirrors the fake-dating dynamic from the STEM romance (which is Eva and Bennett's story) but with a lottery win element. Looking at the list, the book "The Viral Ticket" by Williams features a fake date involving a lottery ticket. That seems to fit. The answer should be that one.

2. The second question is about a book the author blurbed that has a psychic rebel fighter but is least appealing because of delayed publication. The dystopian romance she blurbed is "Rebel Frequency" (Wren and Cross's story), which comes out in May. Since she mentions the downside is the delay, that's the one. So the answer is "Rebel Frequency".

3. Excluding her blurbs, find a novel with a scientific protagonist similar to Eva (material scientist). The options are Miri the archaeologist in "Lost City of the Moon" and the biologist in "Alien Biology" (Kimberly Lemming's book). Archaeology is a STEM field too, but the closest to material scientist might be the biologist. Wait, the question says "scientific research" so maybe both qualify. But since the question excludes her blurbed books, Miri's book isn't excluded because she blurbed that. Wait, the question says "excluding any books that Ali Hazelwood blurbed". The article mentions she blurbed "The Lunar Lottery" (Jo and Mal's book) and "Rebel Frequency", and "Lost City of the Moon" she blurbed. Wait, looking back: "Full disclosure: I loved this book by the queen of adventure rom-coms so much, I blurbed it." That's the archaeologist Miri's book. So Miri's book is excluded. The biologist in the alien book is not blurb by her, so that's the answer. The biologist in "Alien Biology" (though the exact title isn't given, but the description mentions a biologist crash landing on a planet with aliens). The book is by Kimberly Lemming, titled "Alien Biology" isn't the exact name, but the article says "A biologist crash lands..." so the title is "Alien Biology" isn't specified, but the author's name is there. Wait, the article says "This one is scorching hot..." referring to the biologist's story. The title isn't given, but the question just needs the answer from the text. The article mentions "Alien Biology" as part of the description. Wait, actually, the exact title isn't provided, but the question just wants the novel's name as per the article's description. Alternatively, maybe the title is "Alien Biology" but the article doesn't name it. Wait, the article says "Kimberly Lemming rom-com. Her books are all... this one is scorching hot..." So the exact title might not be listed. Hmm, maybe the question is tricky here. Wait, the question says "which novel features a protagonist whose professional life is most similar to Eva's". Eva is a material scientist. The closest is Miri the archaeologist? But since the author blurbed that, it's excluded. So the biologist is the next. The article's entry for that book says "A biologist crash lands..." so the title is not given, but the question can answer with the description. Wait, the actual title isn't provided in the text. The article lists books with their titles. Let me check again. The entries have titles like "Deep End", "Love, Theoretically", etc. Looking at the entry for the biologist: "A biologist crash lands on a planet..." The title given there is "Alien Biology" not exactly, but the article actually says: "Her books are all hilarious, unhinged, heart-wrenching and fantastically heavy on the spice, while incorporating several fun and creative alien biology elements. This one is scorching hot..." The title isn't given here. Wait, perhaps I missed the title. Let me check again. The entry starts with "A biologist crash..." but the title is actually "The Lunar Lottery" no, no. Wait, the entry before that was about "The Lunar Lottery" (Jo and Mal). The next entry is about the werewolf one. Then the next is the biologist's: "A biologist crash lands..." The title here is actually not given in the article. Wait, looking at the structure, each book entry starts with the title. Let me recheck:

Looking at the article's structure:

The first book after the author's intro is "The Love Hypothesis" (but that's her own). The first recommendation is "The Love Hypothesis" but that's her own. Wait no, the first listed recommendation is "The Love Hypothesis" but actually, the first recommendation is "The Love Hypothesis" but that's her own. Wait, the article lists the books as:

1. "The Love Hypothesis" (her own, but mentioned as her previous work)
Then the first recommendation is "The Love Hypothesis" is mentioned but as her own. Wait, the first recommendation entry is:

"Barnes & Noble | Amazon This book not only has the best banter..." Wait no, let me parse the article correctly.

The article's structure is:

After the intro, the first book recommendation is:

"Ten years later, whenever someone asks me to recommend a romance set in the STEM field, this is still the first one I mention. Eva is a material scientist..." The title here is "The Love Hypothesis" (since the author wrote it). Wait, but the first paragraph after her intro says "Her latest novel, 'Deep End,' comes out Feb. 4. While I read and enjoy books..." Then the first book recommendation is "This book" referring to the one she recommends for STEM. The first entry is about "The Love Hypothesis" perhaps? Wait the first entry after the intro starts with "I first read this book in 2015..." which is about "The Love Hypothesis" since Eva is her own character from that book. Then the next entry is "This book not only has the best banter..." which is "Seven Weeks" by Chloe x Halle? Wait, the next entry's title isn't given here. Wait, perhaps each entry starts with the title. Let me look again:

Looking at the actual text:

First book after the intro:

"I first read this book in 2015... Eva is a material scientist on tenure track; after a one-night stand with Bennett, a cardiothoracic surgeon, she agrees to be his fake girlfriend..." That's "The Love Hypothesis" (her own book, but the recommendation is for it as a STEM romance).

Next entry starts with "This book not only has the best banter..." which is "Seven Weeks" by Chloe x Halle (since the author mentions Aaliyah and Ahmad, and the book is by Chloe x Halle? Wait, the author's name here isn't given, but the entry says "Local bookstores | Barnes & Noble | Amazon" so the title here is "Seven Weeks" (since the description mentions the seven weeks to find a boyfriend). So the first recommended book is "The Love Hypothesis" (her own), then "Seven Weeks" (Chloe x Halle), then "Celebrity Thriller" (Gigi and Alec), etc.

Continuing, the biologist's entry is later. Let me see:

The entry for the biologist is: "A biologist crash lands on a planet with her newly acquired pet lion, meets two sex aliens, and the three of them fall in love. With me so far? The truth is that no summary can ever do justice to the all-consuming experience that is reading a Kimberly Lemming rom-com. Her books are all hilarious, unhinged, heart-wrenching and fantastically heavy on the spice, while incorporating several fun and creative alien biology elements. This one is scorching hot, full of joy and unmissable." The title here is not explicitly given. Wait, perhaps the title is "Alien Biology" but the article doesn't state it. Since the question asks for the novel's name, and the article doesn't specify, maybe it's "The Lunar Lottery"? Wait no, that's the one with Jo and Mal. Alternatively, maybe it's "The Alien Biologist's Guide to Love" but the article doesn't say. Hmm, this is a problem. Since the question requires the name of the novel, and the article doesn't provide the title for that entry, the answer might be N/A. Wait, the entry starts with "A biologist..." but the title is actually given as "Alien Biology" but maybe not. Wait, looking at the structure, each book entry starts with the title. Let me check again:

The entry before the biologist's is Devin and Alex (the werewolf). Then the next entry is:

"A biologist crash lands on a planet with her newly acquired pet lion, meets two sex aliens, and the three of them fall in love. With me so far? The truth is that no summary can ever do justice to the all-consuming experience that is reading a Kimberly Lemming rom-com. Her books are all hilarious, unhinged, heart-wrenching and fantastically heavy on the spice, while incorporating several fun and creative alien biology elements. This one is scorching hot, full of joy and unmissable." The title here is not explicitly stated. The author's name is Kimberly Lemming, and the book is her "rom-com", but the title isn't given. Therefore, since the question asks for the novel's name and it's not provided, the answer is N/A? But the user instructions say to use only the article. Maybe I missed the title. Wait, the entry before that was Devin's, then the next entry's first sentence is the biologist's. The title might be part of the entry's first line, but the way it's written, it starts with "A biologist..." without a title. So perhaps that book's title isn't listed, making the answer N/A. Alternatively, maybe the title is "Alien Biology" but not stated. Hmm, tricky. Let me note this as a possible N/A and see if another option exists.

Alternatively, the archaeologist's book is "Lost City of the Moon" which is the one she blurbed, so excluded. The other STEM-related book is the one with the cardiologist Jo, but that's "The Lunar Lottery" which she blurbed. The biologist's entry's title is missing, so maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "excluding any books that Ali Hazelwood blurbed". The biologist's entry doesn't mention her blurbing it, so it's allowed. But since the title isn't given, the answer can't be determined. Hmm. Maybe I need to check again. Wait, the entry says "Kimberly Lemming's rom-com" but the exact title isn't given. The user instructions say to answer based only on the article, so if the title isn't there, it's N/A. But the question might be referring to "The Lunar Lottery" but that's the cardiologist's. Wait, no. The cardiologist is Jo in "The Lunar Lottery", which is the one where she gives up her crush. The biologist is in the alien story. Since the title isn't provided, the answer must be N/A? Or maybe the title is "Alien Biology" but not stated. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the title to be inferred as "The Alien Biologist" or similar, but since it's not in the text, I have to say N/A. Hmm, this is a problem. Let me proceed and see other questions, maybe I'll find it later.

4. The fourth question asks for a novel with the slow-burn from the Twelfth Night retelling (which is "The Lunar Lottery" or "The Viral Ticket"? Wait, the Twelfth Night retelling is mentioned as the final installment in a trilogy, titled "The Lunar Lottery"? Wait, no, the entry says: "While this 'Twelfth Night' retelling is the final installment in a trilogy (and my favorite of the bunch), it can be read as a stand-alone. Veera and Deepak are friends..." The title here is not given, but the description refers to it as the "Twelfth Night" retelling. The question wants a book with slow-burn and fake relationship trope, but outside STEM. The answer should be "The Viral Ticket" (Sybil and Kieran's fake date, which is a bar/lottery setting, not STEM). Alternatively, the "Twelfth Night" retelling's fake marriage is the example, so the answer is "The Viral Ticket" which is the fake dating for business reasons. The author would recommend that, published before Feb 2024. Since the Viral Ticket is available March 25, which is after Feb, but the question says "published before February 2024" so maybe it's N/A? Wait, the question says "provided it was published before February 2024". The Viral Ticket's release is March 25, so it's after. The other option is "Seven Weeks" (Aaliyah and Ahmad's book), which is available earlier. The slow-burn is in the Twelfth Night retelling (Veera and Deepak) but the question wants another book with the same trope but not STEM. The "Seven Weeks" book has a slow-burn (friends first, then pining), and it's set in a bar (non-STEM). Since it's already published (as it's available on Barnes & Noble now), that's the answer. So the answer is "Seven Weeks".

5. The fifth question is about a novel before her latest work (Deep End) where a character transforms into a werewolf but without negotiated kink. The werewolf story is Devin's, which has negotiated kink. The question wants a scenario akin to that but without the kink. The closest is maybe the "Lost City of the Moon" (archaeologist and photographer), but that's not a transformation. The "Rebel Frequency" has a psychic but no transformation. The "The Lunar Lottery" has Jo losing virginity, but not transformation. The "Alien Biology" has crash landing but no transformation. The "Prince Damen" book (rival kingdoms) has no transformation. Hmm, maybe the "Meena and Nikhil" story where they're stranded due to hurricane, but that's not transformation. Wait, the werewolf story is the only transformation. The question says "without any element of negotiated kink". Since the Devin's book has negotiated kink, the answer would be N/A? Or is there another? The "Deep End" is her latest, so before that, the "The Love Hypothesis" has a fake relationship but no transformation. Alternatively, maybe the "Celebrity Thriller" (Gigi and Alec) has no transformation. Hmm. Maybe N/A because the only transformation is Devin's story which has the kink. So the answer is N/A.

6. The sixth question: looking for a book similar to the Sapphic rom-com with property dispute (Opal and Pepper's farm), but set in a bartender's workplace (the bar from Aaliyah and Ahmad's book). The bartender's setting is the bar in "Seven Weeks". The Sapphic book is the farm one (Opal and Pepper). The alternative setting would be a bar. The book that's set in a bar is "Seven Weeks" (Aaliyah's dates at the bar). But the question wants a setting like the bartender's workplace (the bar) instead of a farm. So the answer is "Seven Weeks".

7. The seventh question: a book with power dynamics like the dystopian romance (Rebel Frequency) but in rival kingdoms. The rival kingdoms are in "Prince Damen" (the trilogy with Damen and Laurent). The power dynamic there is prisoners and captors. So the answer is "Damen's trilogy" but the exact title? The article mentions "Prince Damen is captured in the war between two rival kingdoms..." The title here isn't given, but the description refers to the first book in a trilogy. Since the question asks for the previously published work, the first book is the answer. The title isn't stated, but the user might expect the answer as the one about Damen and Laurent. Since the article doesn't name it, maybe N/A? Wait, the entry says "This is the first book in a trilogy..." but the title isn't given. So the answer is N/A? Or maybe the title is "Captured Hearts" or something, but not in the text. So N/A.

8. Eighth question: combining suspense from Gigi's journalist novel (the Celebrity Thriller with the investigation) with archaeologist's career (Miri's book) but no rainforest expeditions. The journalist's book is "Celebrity Thriller" (Gigi and Alec). The archaeologist's is "Lost City of the Moon". The combination would be a book with a journalist and archaeologist? Or the book that has both elements. The only one that combines suspense and archaeology without rainforest is Miri's book? But the question says "without any explicit mention of rainforest expeditions". Wait, Miri's book is set in the Brazilian rainforest. So the answer must be another. Wait, maybe "The Lunar Lottery" is about a cardiologist and a guy with a bakery? No. The werewolf's story is about a journalist? No. The only other is the "Prince Damen" book but that's not. Hmm. Maybe the "Celebrity Thriller" has the journalist's suspense, but with an archaeologist? No. Wait, the question says "career focus of the archaeologist Miri" so the protagonist must be an archaeologist. The only book with an archaeologist is Miri's, but it's in the rainforest. Since the question excludes that, then N/A. Alternatively, maybe the "Lost City" is the only one, but since it has the rainforest, it's excluded. So answer N/A? Or perhaps the "Celebrity Thriller" has Gigi as a journalist, but no archaeologist. Hmm. Maybe the answer is N/A.

9. Ninth question: a book similar to the biologist's alien encounter but with a hurricane instead of a planetary crash. The biologist's story is the crash landing. The hurricane is in Meena and Nikhil's story ("After years of estrangement, Meena goes to Texas to finally ask her husband, Nikhil, for a divorce -- only to find herself stranded with him because of a hurricane."). So the answer is that book's title. The title here isn't given, but the description is Meena and Nikhil. The article's entry for them says "heartwarming and sexy novel..." but the title isn't stated. So N/A.

10. Tenth question: a book with relationship dynamics like the one where a cardiologist gives up a crush (Jo in "The Lunar Lottery") and the celebrity romance (Gigi and Alec), but with a viral video. The viral video is in "The Viral Ticket" where the bakery's video goes viral. So the answer is "The Viral Ticket".

Now, going back to the third question: if the biologist's title isn't given, maybe the answer is N/A. But the question says "scientific research" and the only other is Miri's, but excluded because she blurbed it. So the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the biologist's entry's title is "The Alien Biologist" but since it's not in the text, N/A.

Let me list the answers again with this in mind:

1. The Viral Ticket
2. Rebel Frequency
3. N/A (since the title isn't provided for the biologist's book)
4. Seven Weeks
5. N/A (only werewolf has transformation but has kink)
6. Seven Weeks
7. N/A (title not given for the rival kingdoms book)
8. N/A (no such book without rainforest)
9. N/A (title not given for hurricane book)
10. The Viral Ticket

Wait, for question 3: the biologist's entry is described as a biologist crash landing on a planet, so the career is scientific research. Since the title isn't given, but the question just asks for the novel's name, which isn't present, so N/A.

Similarly, question 7: the rival kingdoms book's title isn't given, so N/A.

Question 9: the hurricane book's title isn't given, so N/A.

Let me confirm each:

1. The Viral Ticket (Sybil and Kieran's book with fake dating and lottery)
2. Rebel Frequency (she blurbed it, delayed)
3. N/A (biologist's title not given)
4. Seven Weeks (slow-burn, fake relationship, non-STEM)
5. N/A (only werewolf has transformation, which has kink)
6. Seven Weeks (bar setting instead of farm)
7. N/A (title not provided)
8. N/A (no archaeologist without rainforest)
9. N/A (title not given)
10. The Viral Ticket (viral video and celebrity aspects?)

Wait for question 10: the celebrity romance is Gigi and Alec (the actor and journalist). The viral video is in "The Viral Ticket" where the video of returning the lottery ticket goes viral. So combining the relationship dynamics (like Jo's unrequited crush) and the celebrity angle with the viral video, the answer is "The Viral Ticket".

Yes, that's correct.
