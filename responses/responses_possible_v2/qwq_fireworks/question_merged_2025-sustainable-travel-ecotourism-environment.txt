Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. 

1. The first question asks which organization offers online classes and a free e-book on decolonizing travel and cautions against green-washing. The article mentions the RISE Travel Institute as offering online classes and the e-book. Vincie Ho from RISE talks about the "say-do gap" and warns about green-washing and ethics washing. So the answer should be RISE Travel Institute.

2. The second question is about a tour operator with itineraries in South Africa, the U.S. South, and Ireland/Northern Ireland that guides through challenging social histories. The article mentions Telos Group specifically for those regions and focusing on difficult social histories. So Telos Group is the answer.

3. The third question is about a home-swapping platform that helps avoid negative impacts of short-term rentals. The article mentions Kindred as an example of platforms offering alternatives like home-swapping. So Kindred.

4. The fourth question asks for the North American city that's an old European settlement resisting English influence. The article mentions Quebec City as one of North America's oldest, with French speakers resisting English incursion. So Quebec City.

5. The fifth question is about a destination with Hindu/Buddhist temples and the Cosmological Axis as a Javanese culture cradle. The article describes Yogyakarta, Indonesia, with temples and the Cosmological Axis. So Yogyakarta.

6. The sixth question is about a booking platform connecting travelers with independent hosts in over 30 countries. The article states StayAltered has that. So StayAltered.

7. The seventh question asks which entity's name suggests "what remains hidden" and is first among those listed for walking tours. The article lists Unseen Tours first among the walking tours that offer alternative perspectives. "Unseen" implies hidden aspects, so Unseen Tours.

8. The eighth question is the percentage of travelers wanting to leave destinations better. The article says 71% from the Booking.com survey. So 71%.

9. The ninth question is the nonprofit offering three-day listening trips along the US-Mexico border. The article mentions Abara doing that. So Abara.

Now, double-check each to ensure they're directly from the text and not inferred beyond what's stated. All answers are explicitly mentioned except maybe question 7. The article lists "Unseen Tours, Invisible Cities and Migrant Tour" so Unseen is first. The name "Unseen" does suggest hidden aspects. So that's correct.
