Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I'm only using the information from the provided article. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. The first question asks about a lawsuit by the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists targeting a different medication based on its use in Mexico City. The article mentions that the study in Mexico City used a 60 mg dose of ulipristal acetate. Since the original lawsuit was about mifepristone, the new lawsuit would focus on the dosage used in the study. So the answer should be 60 milligrams.

2. The second question is about a lawsuit similar to the Texas attorney general's, which targeted sending pills into Texas. The standard and experimental regimens both use misoprostol. The question asks for the common element, so the answer is misoprostol.

3. The third question involves Dr. Gomperts advocating off-label use, leading to scrutiny. Both mifepristone and ulipristal target progesterone. The common hormone here is progesterone.

4. The fourth question refers to FDA's 2022 clarification that Plan B doesn't affect existing pregnancies. The other medication (Ella) is claimed to affect implantation. The plaintiffs would argue it affects implantation, so the answer is implantation.

5. If the studied medication (ulipristal) is restricted, mifepristone's availability could be indirectly impacted. The drug approved up to 12 weeks is mifepristone, so that's the answer.

6. Perrigo might face a lawsuit citing Project 2025's stance. Project 2025 wants to remove Ella from ACA insurance coverage. The legal provision would be the Affordable Care Act's insurance coverage requirement.

7. The over-the-counter medication unaffected despite sharing a mechanism is Plan B One-Step, since it's OTC and the question specifies that.

8. The lawsuit would target the regimen but not misoprostol directly, since it's used in other contexts. The component not directly targeted would be misoprostol, as it's also used on its own but the focus might be on the other drug.

Wait, let me check each again for accuracy.

1. The study used 60 mg, so yes.

2. The common element between both regimens is misoprostol, correct.

3. Both drugs block progesterone, so that's right.

4. The plaintiffs would claim Ella affects implantation, which the FDA says Plan B doesn't. So implantation is the phase.

5. Mifepristone is the approved drug, so that's correct.

6. Project 2025's policy says remove from ACA coverage, so the answer is the Affordable Care Act's required coverage.

7. Plan B is OTC and the question specifies that, so yes.

8. The lawsuit would target the first drug (ulipristal), but misoprostol is the component used alone, so the lawsuit wouldn't target it directly. The answer is misoprostol.

I think that's all. Let me make sure each answer is directly from the text.
