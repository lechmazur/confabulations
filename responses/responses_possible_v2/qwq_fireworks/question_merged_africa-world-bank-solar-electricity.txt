Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict answer format. Let's start with each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The energy minister who talked about pricing is from Tanzania. The company building minigrids in Nigeria now is Husk Power Systems, which left Tanzania because of pricing issues. If the minister was in charge when Husk first came to Tanzania, would Mwajuma have a TV? The article says Mwajuma bought a TV when Husk was there, but after they left, the grid was replaced by Tanesco which serves fewer people. If the minister's policies (which led to Husk leaving) were in place earlier, maybe Husk wouldn't have stayed. So the TV wouldn't be functional. Answer: N/A? Wait, the question is hypothetical. The article says the minister (Doto Biteko) is current. The "Bulldozer" president was Magufuli. The article states that when Husk left, Mwajuma's TV was back in the box. So if the minister's policies were there earlier, Husk might not have stayed, so TV wouldn't work. But the question is if the minister was in charge when they entered, would she have a functional TV? Maybe not. But the answer is "No" or N/A? The article says the minister's justification was about pricing leading to inflation, so if the minister was there earlier, maybe Husk would have been forced to lower prices and leave earlier. So TV wouldn't be functional. But the question is tricky. The answer might be N/A because the article doesn't directly say. Wait, the exact answer is required. The question is hypothetical, so maybe N/A because the article doesn't state that scenario. Hmm. Alternatively, since the minister's policies caused Husk to leave, if those policies were in place earlier, the TV wouldn't work. So answer: No? But the format requires a direct answer from the text. Since it's a hypothetical, maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "if the energy minister who justified... had been in charge when the company (Husk) initially entered Tanzania..." The minister is the current one, but when Husk entered in 2015, the president was Magufuli. The energy minister at that time isn't mentioned. So we don't know if the current minister was in charge then. So the answer is N/A. But the question is tricky. Alternatively, the article says the energy minister (Doto Biteko) said some companies charged high prices. If he was in charge when Husk came, maybe they would have left earlier. Thus, Mwajuma wouldn't have a working TV. But since the article doesn't explicitly state this scenario, maybe it's N/A. Hmm, I'll go with N/A for now.

Wait, but the question is asking if the minister (who is the current one) had been in charge when Husk first came (2015), would Mwajuma have a TV. Since the current minister's policies caused Husk to leave, if he was there earlier, maybe Husk would have left earlier. So the answer would be "No" because the TV would not be functional. But the article doesn't explicitly say that the minister was in charge back then. The answer might require an inference. Since the article states that Tanzania's energy minister (current) justified the pricing intervention, and that Husk left because of that, if the minister was in charge when Husk first entered (2015), then the same policies would have forced them out earlier. So the TV wouldn't work. But since we don't know if the minister was in charge then, maybe it's N/A. This is a tough one. Let me note this and come back.

2. **Question 2**: The Rwandan rebels took Goma in Congo. The question is if they targeted a region with 70 minigrids built by the company that left Tanzania (Husk), which country would be affected. The article says Husk now has 70 minigrids in Nigeria. So if the 70 were in Nigeria, but the question says "if they targeted a region with 70 operational minigrids built by the company that left Tanzania due to pricing regulations", that company is Husk, which left Tanzania but is active in Nigeria. So the country would be Nigeria. The "Bulldozer" president refers to Tanzania's former president Magufuli. So the answer is Tanzania? Wait, no. The question asks which country would be affected if the rebels targeted that region with 70 grids. Since Husk's 70 are in Nigeria, the country would be Nigeria. But the question also mentions the country known for the "Bulldozer" president during the initial electrification push. That's Tanzania. Wait, the question is a bit confusing. The second part says "what country, known for its 'Bulldozer' president during the initial stages of this electrification push, would have been affected?" The "Bulldozer" president was Tanzania's Magufuli. But the grids are in Nigeria. So the answer would be Nigeria, but the "Bulldozer" is Tanzania. Wait, the question is phrased as: the country that had the Bulldozer president (Tanzania) would be affected? No. The grids are in Nigeria. The country affected is Nigeria, but the Bulldozer president was in Tanzania. The question is asking for the country that's known for the Bulldozer president (Tanzania) but the grids are in Nigeria. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The question says "if the rebels targeted a region with 70 grids built by the company that left Tanzania (Husk), which country (known for Bulldozer president) would be affected?" The company left Tanzania but built grids elsewhere. The 70 grids are in Nigeria, so the country affected is Nigeria, but the Bulldozer president was in Tanzania. The question says "what country... known for..." so the answer must be Tanzania? No, because the grids are in Nigeria. The question might be a trick. The company that left Tanzania is now active in Nigeria. So the 70 grids are in Nigeria, so the country affected would be Nigeria, but the Bulldozer president was in Tanzania. The question is asking for the country known for Bulldozer president, so answer is Tanzania. But the attack is on the grids built by the company that left Tanzania, which are in Nigeria. The country affected is Nigeria, but the question's second part is asking for the country with the Bulldozer president, which is Tanzania. Wait, the question's structure: "what country, known for its 'Bulldozer' president..., would have been affected?" The affected country is where the grids are. Since the grids are in Nigeria, but the Bulldozer is Tanzania, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is implying that the company's current operations are in Nigeria, so the country affected is Nigeria, but the Bulldozer was Tanzania. The question's phrasing is confusing. Maybe the answer is Nigeria, but the Bulldozer is Tanzania. Since the question says "what country... known for...", the answer must be Tanzania, but that's not the location of the grids. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit of a trick, and the answer is Tanzania, but the grids are in Nigeria. Since the question is asking for the country known for Bulldozer president (Tanzania), but the attack is on the grids in Nigeria, so the answer is N/A. But the question says "would have been affected?" If the grids were in Tanzania, then the answer is Tanzania. But the article says Husk left Tanzania, so their grids there are dismantled. The 70 grids are in Nigeria. Therefore, the country affected would be Nigeria, but the Bulldozer president was in Tanzania, so the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question is structured as: "if the rebels targeted a region with 70 grids built by the company that left Tanzania due to pricing...", so the company is Husk, which left Tanzania but built 70 grids in Nigeria. Therefore, the country affected would be Nigeria, but the question is asking for the country known for the Bulldozer president (Tanzania). Therefore, the answer is Tanzania? No, because the attack is in Nigeria. The question might be a trick, maybe the answer is Tanzania because the Bulldozer president was there, but the grids are elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong, but according to the article, the answer must be Nigeria. But the question asks for the country known for Bulldozer, so answer is Tanzania, but that's not where the grids are. I'm confused. Maybe the correct answer is Tanzania because the company left Tanzania, but the question is about where the grids are. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is mixing up the countries. The answer is Nigeria, but the Bulldozer was in Tanzania, so the question's second part is a red herring, and the answer is Nigeria. But the question specifically asks for the country known for Bulldozer. So maybe N/A. This is tricky. Let me note this and proceed.

3. **Question 3**: The state-run utility's per-unit cost tripled, but still less than the departed company's price. The village chairman (Gesenda) says Tanesco's cost is triple Husk's. If the cost triples (from Tanesco's original), but still lower than Husk's, then who is responsible for the higher cost? The article says the chairman says Tanesco costs three times as much. The question's scenario is if the per-unit cost is tripled (so original was X, now 3X, but still less than Husk's price). The chairman attributes the higher cost to Tanesco's issues. The question asks who is responsible according to the chairman. The answer is Tanesco, the state-run utility. So answer: Tanesco.

4. **Question 4**: Rockefeller's leader said tech and pricing are key. The main enabling factor is solar panels from China. If that's unavailable (due to trade dispute), would the chairman pay more or less? Since solar is cheaper and faster, without it, they might have to use traditional grids (which are more expensive). So the cost would be higher. Answer: more.

5. **Question 5**: The compacts correlate with receptive regulations. The company (Husk) is now most active in Nigeria. Mashavu Ali's daughters: if her village were in Nigeria (where Husk is active), the minigrids are operational, so her daughter could study late. The article says Mashavu's daughter dropped grades after losing power. In Nigeria, with Husk's grids, she'd study late. The question asks how many daughters: the article says Mashavu has eight children. The daughter who was top is now third. If in Nigeria, that daughter would be studying late, so likely the same daughter (so one). But the question says "how many daughters... likely be studying late". The answer is 1 (the top student), but the question might expect the number 1. Alternatively, maybe all daughters could study, but the article specifies one. So answer: 1.

6. **Question 6**: If Tanzania's energy minister implements Nigeria's regulatory environment (which is good for Husk), would Gesenda pay more or less? Since in Nigeria, Husk can operate, so prices might be lower. Currently, Tanesco charges triple Husk's price. If regulations allow Husk to stay, prices would be lower. So Gesenda would pay less. Answer: less.

7. **Question 7**: U.S. hostile to main enabling factor (solar from China). If so, the World Bank might lose funding. The person using Tanesco (Gesenda) would see higher costs? If the U.S. cuts World Bank funding, maybe the project can't proceed, so Tanesco remains, which is already expensive. Or if the tech isn't available, maybe they can't build grids, so Tanesco stays. The cost might not change, but the question is if it would increase or decrease. The article says the main enabling factor is solar tech. If unavailable, they can't build solar grids, so maybe they rely on traditional grids which are expensive. So Tanesco's costs might stay or increase. The question says if the U.S. is hostile to the main factor (solar), then the enabling factor is gone. Thus, electrification would be harder, but the current users (Gesenda) might still be on Tanesco, which is already expensive. The question asks if his costs would increase or decrease. The article says Tanesco is already costly. Without the solar option, maybe the situation doesn't improve, so costs remain high. But the question is about a change. If the U.S. hostility affects World Bank funding, maybe projects stall, but existing users might not see immediate changes. The question's answer might be increase, but not sure. Alternatively, if the main factor (solar) is unavailable, they can't build new grids, so maybe Tanesco's monopoly continues, and prices stay high. The question's answer is "increase" because if the U.S. stops funding, the World Bank can't help, so maybe Tanesco's issues persist or worsen. But the article says the World Bank's funding is currently sufficient. If the U.S. cuts, maybe future projects are hindered, but current users might not see immediate cost changes. The question is hypothetical, so the answer is "increase" because without the enabling factor, they can't get cheaper solar, so costs stay high or go up. So answer: increase.

8. **Question 8**: If Rockefeller prioritized grids over solar, and Tanzania's utility is bad (Tanesco is loss-making, frequent outages), would Mwajuma's first TV be functional? The current situation is that after Husk left, Tanesco serves fewer people and has poor service. If they extended the grid instead of solar, maybe her village wouldn't have power, so TV wouldn't work. So answer: no. But the question is if the TV would be functional today. If they prioritized grids, maybe the grid isn't extended there, so no. Answer: No. But the answer should be in the format "more" or "less", but the question is about functionality. Wait the question says "would the first appliance purchased... likely be functional today?" So if they prioritized grids, and the grid isn't there, then no. So answer: No. But the options are functional or not. The answer is N/A? Wait the question requires a yes/no, but the answer format requires a word. The question asks "likely be functional today?" So answer: No.

9. **Question 9**: If "Bulldozer" president prioritized regulatory reform over infrastructure, would kids go to bed later? The company left due to pricing (regulatory issues). If there was regulatory reform, Husk might stay, so minigrids work, so kids have light to study. So later. Answer: later.

Now, going back to question 1. The minister in question is the current one (Doto Biteko). If he was in charge when Husk first came (2015), would Mwajuma have a TV? Since the minister's policies caused Husk to leave, if he was there earlier, Husk would have left earlier, so no TV. The answer is "No". But the article doesn't explicitly state that the minister was in office then. However, the question is hypothetical, so we can infer based on the given info. The article says when Husk entered Tanzania in 2015 under Magufuli, but the current minister (Biteko) might not have been there then. However, the question is about if he had been, so we assume the policies he now enforces were in place. Thus, Husk would have left earlier, so the TV wouldn't work. Answer: No.

For question 2: The company that left Tanzania (Husk) now has 70 grids in Nigeria. If rebels target that region (Nigeria's 70), the country affected is Nigeria. The question asks for the country known for Bulldozer president (Tanzania), but the attack is in Nigeria. The question's wording is confusing. The second part says "what country... known for...", so the answer must be Tanzania, but the attack is in Nigeria. This is conflicting. The question might have a typo, but based on the article, the answer is Nigeria, but the Bulldozer president was in Tanzania, so the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking which country's grids would be affected if the company (Husk) had built them there instead of Nigeria. Since Husk left Tanzania, but if they built grids there, but the article says they left and grids there are dismantled. The question says "if the rebels targeted a region with 70 operational minigrids built by the company that left Tanzania...", the company is Husk, which now has 70 in Nigeria. So the country is Nigeria. The question's second part is a distractor; the answer is Nigeria. But the question specifically asks for the country known for Bulldozer, so maybe the answer is Tanzania. But the grids are in Nigeria. The question is confusing. I'll go with Nigeria as the country affected, but the second part says "known for Bulldozer", so answer is Tanzania? No, because the grids are in Nigeria. The question might have a mistake, but based on the given info, the answer is Nigeria, but the Bulldozer is Tanzania, so N/A. Alternatively, the question wants the country where the Bulldozer was president (Tanzania) but the grids are elsewhere. Hmm. I'll answer Nigeria, but the question's second part might be a trick. Alternatively, since the company left Tanzania due to their regulations, and the Bulldozer president was there, maybe the answer is Tanzania. But the grids are in Nigeria. I'm stuck. Let me look again. The question says "if the Rwandan-backed rebels who took Goma on Monday had instead targeted a region with 70 operational minigrids built by the company that left Tanzania due to pricing regulations..." The company that left Tanzania is Husk, which now has 70 in Nigeria. So the region is in Nigeria. The country affected is Nigeria. The question then asks "what country, known for its 'Bulldozer' president during the initial stages of this electrification push, would have been affected?" The Bulldozer president was in Tanzania. So the affected country is Nigeria, but the question asks for the country known for Bulldozer (Tanzania), so the answer is N/A. But the question might be intending that the country where the grids are located is where the Bulldozer was president. Since the grids are in Nigeria, not Tanzania, so N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick, and the answer is Tanzania because the company left there. But the grids are in Nigeria. I think the correct answer is Nigeria, but the second part's reference to Bulldozer makes it N/A. Since the question requires the country known for Bulldozer, which is Tanzania, but the grids are elsewhere, so N/A. Therefore, answer N/A. But I'm not sure. Let's proceed and see.

Now, compiling answers:

1. <question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>No</answer>

2. <question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Nigeria</answer> (since the 70 grids are there, even if the Bulldozer is Tanzania, the question might just want the country with the grids. Maybe I was overcomplicating.)

Wait, the question says "what country, known for its 'Bulldozer' president...", so the answer must be Tanzania. But the grids are in Nigeria. Therefore, the answer is N/A. Alternatively, perhaps the question is wrong, but based on the article, the company that left Tanzania is now in Nigeria. The country affected is Nigeria, but the question asks for the country known for Bulldozer, which is Tanzania. Since they are different countries, the answer is N/A. So:
