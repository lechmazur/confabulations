<answer>The geographical origin of antivenom production interacts with venom variation across snake populations because antivenoms are specific to the venom of the snakes used in their production. Indian-manufactured antivenom is ineffective against Kenyan puff adder bites because it is tailored to the venom of Indian kraits and does not contain antibodies against the toxins found in Kenyan puff adder venom.</answer>

<answer>A spitting cobra's venom delivery method can create diagnostic confusion with non-venomous ocular injuries because the venom can cause irritation and inflammation similar to other eye injuries. In regions where traditional healers dominate primary care, this can lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment, delaying necessary antivenom administration.</answer>

<answer>The described seasonal patterns of snake activity in Kenya, such as snakes being forced out of their holes during the rainy season and seeking food and water during hot, dry seasons, interact with agricultural practices and housing conditions to create distinct temporal risk peaks. Farmers and residents of remote villages are at higher risk during these times due to increased human-snake encounters in fields and around homes.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Black mambas deliver fatal neurotoxic envenomation more rapidly than puff adders' hemotoxic venom due to their larger size, faster strike speed, and the potency of their neurotoxins, which can cause rapid paralysis and death within an hour.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The thermal instability of antivenom, combined with Kenya's healthcare infrastructure limitations, means that antivenom may not be available or properly stored in rural areas. This, along with the critical six-hour treatment window, disproportionately affects outcomes in pregnant snakebite victims, who may suffer severe complications or death due to delays in receiving effective treatment.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The widespread use of tourniquets and traditional treatments in snakebite management can lead to paradoxical outcomes, such as increased tissue damage and the need for amputation, because these methods can exacerbate the venom's pathophysiological effects and delay hospital admission, reducing the effectiveness of antivenom treatment.</answer>
