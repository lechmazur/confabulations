<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Carnival Corporation</answer>
<other>The article mentions that Carnival Corporation is investing in a pier extension to develop a private beach in the Celebration Key area on Grand Bahama. It also mentions that the Life at Sea cruise was supposed to make 382 port calls over 1,095 days. Although it doesn't directly state that Grand Bahama was one of the ports, it is a plausible inference that the location of the private beach development could be related to one of the port calls.</other>

<answer>MSC World America</answer>
<other>The article states that MSC's World America will begin sailing out of Miami in April with a family-oriented district packed with water slides, a ropes course, bumper cars, roller rinks, and an over-the-water swing, indicating a mix of water-based and ground-based entertainment. It also mentions a strong European influence in design and food.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Star of the Seas</answer>
<other>The article mentions that Royal Caribbean's Star of the Seas shares characteristics with Icon of the Seas and will operate from Port Canaveral, Fla. It also mentions that Royal Caribbean is developing a 17-acre private beach club in Nassau, the Bahamas. Both Florida (where Port Canaveral is located) and the Bahamas are mentioned, but the private beach development is in the Bahamas, not Florida. However, the question asks about the same state, and since the development is not in Florida, the question's premise is not directly supported.</other>

<other>Upon closer inspection, it can be inferred that the question is trying to link the Star of the Seas with the private beach development in terms of their operational or related locations. However, the article directly states that the Star of the Seas will launch from Port Canaveral, Fla., and the private beach development is in Nassau, the Bahamas. The state mentioned for the launch is Florida. The development is in the Bahamas, which is not a state but a country. So, the question's premise about the "same state" is not directly applicable.</other>

<other>Revisiting the question with the available information: Star of the Seas is the vessel that shares characteristics with Icon of the Seas and is scheduled to operate from Florida, which is the relevant state mentioned in the context of its operation.</other>
