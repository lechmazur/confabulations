<answer>Kantorow's cautious approach to repertoire</answer>
<other>The article mentions that Kantorow is taking his time and is uncomfortable performing Bach in public. This cautious approach to repertoire could be seen as indicative of the "depth of focus" instilled by his teacher, Igor Lasko.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Bach's complexity</answer>
<other>The article states that Kantorow feels Bach requires "a whole balance with the head and heart" that he currently lacks. This complexity would challenge the approach of Rena Shereshevskaya, who believed all music stemmed from Bach.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Collaborations with family members</answer>
<other>The article mentions that Alexandre Kantorow accompanied his father on a 2014 album. Marek Janowski, the conductor making his belated Philharmonic debut, does not have a mentioned family collaboration. However, it can be inferred that both Kantorow and Janowski have had long careers, which might be a shared characteristic.</other>

<answer>Remaining with the same general manager and piano teacher</answer>
<other>The article states that despite Kantorow's "rapid rise," he remained with the same general manager and piano teacher he had since he was 16. This decision reflects his "unflappable" quality.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Harmony</answer>
<other>The article mentions that Kantorow believes in harmony and that it doesn't need to be tonality, but rather a sense of the grammar built over the ages. Bertrand Chamayou played multiple pieces in different styles, but the article doesn't specify that he lacked harmony.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Relaxation</answer>
<other>The article describes Kantorow as an "unusually relaxed performer in flow" in Fadi Kheir's photograph. The training regimen with Rena Shereshevskaya was compared to that of an athlete, which implies intense focus and rigor, contradicting the relaxation observed in the photograph.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Silence</answer>
<other>The article quotes Kantorow as valuing the silence of a classical music concert, where "there's not much else going on other than the sounds of what you hear onstage." This contrasts with a Broadway show like Idina Menzel's, which likely includes more elements than just the music.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Remaining with a small label</answer>
<other>The article states that Kantorow remained with Bis, a small Swedish label, rather than signing with a major label. Robert von Bahr, the founder of Bis, might cite this decision as a parallel to the "brashness" Kantorow identifies in Brahms's First Sonata, as both reflect a commitment to his artistic vision.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Remaining with the same general manager and piano teacher</answer>
<other>The article mentions that Kantorow's parents were concerned about his potential overexposure to the music industry. Despite his international recognition, Kantorow remained with the same general manager and piano teacher, which ironically reflects his parents' initial concerns by showing he didn't overexpose himself by constantly changing his team.</other>
