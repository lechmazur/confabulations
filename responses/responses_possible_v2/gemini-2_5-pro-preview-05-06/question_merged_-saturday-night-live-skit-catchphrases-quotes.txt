<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article describes the Church Lady character as originating from a San Francisco stand-up set and her catchphrase "Well isn't that special?" as reorienting Dana Carvey's career. However, the celebration through birthday greetings and live recreations is attributed to Molly Shannon's Sally O'Malley character. Since the question asks for a single character fitting all these descriptions, and the article attributes these specific traits to different characters, the answer is N/A.</other>

<answer>George Bush Sr.</answer>
<other>The article states: "The one that took the longest was "Not gonna do it," George Bush Sr. [As Bush] "Not gonna do it, wouldn't be prudent at this juncture." That became its own little song. I eventually extrapolated the syntax from "Not gonna do it" to "Na gana da it," and on. By the end the cue card just said "Na ga da it."" This character was impersonated by Dana Carvey.</other>

<answer>The Church Lady</answer>
<other>The article says: "Even though she's a fountain of catchphrases, the Church Lady is recognizable without even opening her mouth: All she needs are those pursed lips set hard to one side and she's ready to start judging you. ... This Dana Carvey character, the host of "Church Chat," came along at a perfect time for religious satire, when scandal-prone televangelists and their tingling nether regions were making national news."</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article links Linda Richman to a 1992 call-in show, a celebrity diva (Barbra Joan Streisand), and the simile "like buttah." However, the Ben & Jerry's flavor mentioned in the article ("Schweddy Balls") is linked to "The Delicious Dish" sketch featuring Pete Schweddy, Margaret Jo McCullin, and Terry Rialto, not Linda Richman. Since the question requires the same persona to be associated with both "like buttah" and the Ben & Jerry's flavor, and the article attributes these to different personas/sketches, the answer is N/A.</other>

<answer>Derek Stevens</answer>
<other>The article states: "In addition to the Church Lady, Dana Carvey debuted another defining character in Season 12: Derek Stevens, a washed-up British singer-songwriter who's antsy to "bloody score." When he meets with record executives ... he improvises -- performing a song technically called "The Lady I Know" but that has gone down in pop history as "Choppin' Broccoli," a send-up of the ubiquitous self-serious rock-pop ballads of the 1980s."</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>John Belushi</answer>
<other>The article mentions: "Don't expect a tuna salad sandwich, an egg breakfast or anything other than this menu item at the Olympia diner operated by John Belushi, and inspired either by Chicago's Billy Goat Tavern or a real-life restaurant owned by Belushi's father (depending on who's telling the tale)."</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Nat X</answer>
<other>The article states: "Chris Rock plays the host -- "so Black they counted him four times at the Million Man March" -- of "The Dark Side With Nat X."" The character hosting the segment is Nat X.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The sketch about the making of "(Don't Fear) the Reaper" by Blue Oyster Cult</answer>
<other>The article describes the sketch: "That's the premise of the supposed making of '(Don't Fear) the Reaper' by Blue Oyster Cult, with Christopher Walken as the renowned hitmaker Bruce Dickinson ... and Will Ferrell as Gene, the only musician who can fulfill his producer's weirdly rustic demand. ... just give us more cowbell!" The question asks for "Which sketch," and this description identifies it based on the article's content.</other>
