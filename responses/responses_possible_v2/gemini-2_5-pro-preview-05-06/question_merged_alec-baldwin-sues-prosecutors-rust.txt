<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>SAG-AFTRA highlighted that industry protocol makes firearms professionals, not actors, responsible for checking guns on sets, which conflicted with the prosecution's assertion that New Mexico law made Baldwin responsible for checking the revolver's ammunition.</answer>
<other>The article states, "SAG-AFTRA, the union which represents actors, disputed that, saying that firearms professionals, not actors, are responsible for checking guns on sets." This was in response to Ms. Morrissey's argument that "Mr. Baldwin had a duty to confirm that only inert ammunition had been placed in the gun... as a gun handler in the State of New Mexico subject to New Mexico laws." The conflict is between the industry protocol (firearms professionals responsible) and the asserted New Mexico law (actor responsible).</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that officials in the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office and the Board of County Commissioners are named as defendants. It also mentions that "a tranche of ammunition delivered to local law enforcement in March" was the excluded evidence that halted the trial. However, the article does not explain *how* the Sheriff's Office's handling of this specific ammunition evidence created a *jurisdictional basis* for including the Board of County Commissioners as defendants.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The initial involuntary manslaughter charge being downgraded due to incorrect application of law; a subsequent dismissal of this charge by a special prosecutor; the revival of the case through a grand jury indictment; and the final dismissal with prejudice due to the state withholding evidence.</answer>
<other>The article details these procedural steps: 1. The original manslaughter charge faced a mandatory minimum, then was downgraded because it was incorrectly charged under a new law. 2. Special prosecutor Ms. Morrissey "at first dismissed the involuntary manslaughter charge to review the evidence". 3. She then "revived the case in front of a grand jury, which indicted Mr. Baldwin." 4. The case was "dismissed without the potential for it to be retried" because "the state had withheld evidence from the defense." This combination of events involving charge amendments (dismissed/downgraded), grand jury reindictment, and evidentiary disputes (withheld evidence) defines the trajectory.</other>
