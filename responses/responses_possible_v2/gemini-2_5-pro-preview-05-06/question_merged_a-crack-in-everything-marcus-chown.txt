<other>I will go through each question and extract the answer from the provided article, ensuring I only use information from the article.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Karl Schwarzschild</answer>
<other>The article states: "We see Karl Schwarzschild of the Schwarzschild radius, the equation describing the size of a black hole, making his discovery while suffering from painful, chronic skin blisters as a soldier in World War I."</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Chandrasekhar limit</answer>
<other>The article mentions: "Years later, we glimpse Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar of the Chandrasekhar limit, a way to identify the stars that might someday become black holes, doing his calculations by starlight on the deck of a steamship bound for Cambridge..." The phrase "Years later" implies chronological progression after Schwarzschild, and the description matches the question.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Albert Einstein</answer>
<other>The article states: "Einstein's new theory of gravity, known as general relativity, gave birth to a monster that he never escaped: the black hole... As the author concludes, 'No wonder Einstein never believed in black holes.'"</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Black holes</answer>
<other>The article describes black holes initially as "destructive monsters" and later states: "By the time you finish 'A Crack in Everything' you will see black holes for what they really are: vibrant, spinning hearts around which star matter whirls, coaxing the growth of galaxies and forming a path for the emergence of planets, even life itself."</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Gravitational waves</answer>
<other>The article says: "Two black holes 'locked in a death spiral,' he writes, 'launched a tsunami of tortured space-time' -- gravitational waves that reverberated across the cosmos and, notably in 2015, into the detectors of eagerly awaiting astronomers on Earth, direct proof that black holes exist."</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Hubble Space Telescope</answer>
<other>The article mentions: "...and the despair that astronomers felt when the first images from the Hubble Space Telescope came back blurry."</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Schwarzschild radius</answer>
<other>The article states: "We see Karl Schwarzschild of the Schwarzschild radius, the equation describing the size of a black hole, making his discovery while suffering from painful, chronic skin blisters as a soldier in World War I." This describes the dimensional parameter and the adverse conditions.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar</answer>
<other>The article states: "Years later, we glimpse Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar of the Chandrasekhar limit, a way to identify the stars that might someday become black holes, doing his calculations by starlight on the deck of a steamship bound for Cambridge..."</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Space and time become so distorted that they effectively swap places</answer>
<other>The article asks: "How does the average reader comprehend, for example, that inside a black hole, 'space and time become so distorted that they effectively swap places'?"</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Black holes</answer>
<other>The article initially describes black holes as "monsters" and "the stuff of physicists' nightmares," then later as "passive predators" and "vibrant, spinning hearts around which star matter whirls, coaxing the growth of galaxies."</other>
