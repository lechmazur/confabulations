<answer>Cruises</answer>
<other>The article states, "Cruise ships prefer to offer incentives like prepaid gratuities and shipboard credits over fare cuts." This indicates the lowest probability of direct price reductions for cruises.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article provides customer volume growth rate from 2023 to 2024 for cruises (9%) and its average price increase for summer 2025 (6%). However, it does not provide the "customer volume growth rate from 2023 to 2024" for domestic airfares or hotels, making it impossible to compare and determine which sector has the "greatest disparity" based on both metrics.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Cruises</answer>
<other>The article states for cruises: "strong demand is keeping prices high. Ships are sailing into the new year nearly full." (high capacity utilization) and "Cruise ships prefer to offer incentives like prepaid gratuities and shipboard credits over fare cuts" (low pricing flexibility for direct cuts). This indicates a strong inverse relationship.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Spring and summer 2025</answer>
<other>The article states that domestic fares in 2024 "were some of the lowest on record." For 2025, it projects prices "will likely be up by double digits for spring and summer compared to 2024." The greatest contrast would be encountered during this projected period of significantly higher prices (spring and summer 2025) compared to the historical low of 2024.</other>

<answer>Cruises</answer>
<other>The article says, "strong demand is keeping prices high. Ships are sailing into the new year nearly full." and "Cruise ships prefer to offer incentives like prepaid gratuities and shipboard credits over fare cuts... 'That creates value without creating an addiction to discounts,' Mr. Cash said." This shows resistance to traditional discounting (fare cuts) while maintaining nearly full capacity.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>International airfares (Caribbean)</answer>
<other>Hotel rates are "expected to grow gradually -- below the rate of inflation." Economy hotels are projected to rise 0.2%. Domestic airfares are "up by double digits." Cruise rates are up 6%. International airfares to the Caribbean were "down 17 percent." A 17% decrease represents a very large gap from a typical positive inflation rate, likely larger than "double digits" (e.g., 10-15%) minus inflation, or 6% minus inflation, or 0.2% versus inflation. For example, if inflation is 3%, the gap for Caribbean airfares is |-17% - 3%| = 20 percentage points. If domestic airfares are up 10%, the gap is |10% - 3%| = 7 percentage points.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Cruises</answer>
<other>The article states, "Ships are sailing into the new year nearly full" (high current booking levels/demand). It also states, "Cruise ships prefer to offer incentives like prepaid gratuities and shipboard credits over fare cuts" (unwillingness to offer direct price reductions). This combination fits the question.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Cruises</answer>
<other>For cruises, the article states, "An estimated 34.7 million travelers cruised in 2024... up 9 percent from 2023" (year-over-year passenger volume increase). For pricing strategy flexibility, it says, "Cruise ships prefer to offer incentives like prepaid gratuities and shipboard credits over fare cuts" (low flexibility for direct fare cuts, prices are high due to strong demand). The discrepancy is that there's strong volume growth (9%) alongside a pricing strategy that avoids direct fare cuts. Other sectors do not have both these specific data points (YoY passenger volume % increase and explicit strategy on fare cut flexibility) as clearly laid out for comparison of a "discrepancy."</other>
