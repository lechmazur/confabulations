<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article highlights that Boeing's production slowdown and delivery delays "disrupted the plans of some airlines that had hoped to carry more passengers," and that Airbus engine problems forced planes out of service. These point to limited aircraft availability as a constraint on expansion. However, the article does not explicitly state this was the "most critical" limitation compared to others, nor does it establish this through explicit causal relationships described across three non-consecutive paragraphs that also incorporate Spirit Airlines' bankruptcy as a direct cause for this specific operational constraint on other carriers' expansion plans.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions Boeing's manufacturing issues ("slow production and delay deliveries of jets"), Airbus's long order backlogs, and "an engine problem" on some Airbus planes. However, it does not mention "Pratt & Whitney" by name. Furthermore, the article does not use the term "irreversible supply chain bottleneck," nor does it explicitly detail a precise sequence of these specific events creating such a bottleneck that disproportionately affected airlines with older fleets in the manner described by the question.</other>

<other>The article states in paragraph 8 that Southwest Airlines "made changes aimed at lowering costs and increasing profits" and that JetBlue Airways "unveiled a strategy with similar aims." This description of JetBlue's strategy in paragraph 8 indicates similar aims to Southwest, not a fundamental divergence. JetBlue's addition of premium seats is mentioned in paragraph 10, in a different context. The article does not present a juxtaposition of Southwest's cost-cutting (paragraph 8) and JetBlue's premium seating expansion (paragraph 10) in a way that explicitly reveals a "fundamental divergence" in strategic responses to the same market pressures described in paragraphs 4 and 8.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions rebounding business travel, customers eager for international flights, and aircraft delivery delays. It also states that large airlines (Delta, United, American) are well-positioned for business travel and international flights. However, the article does not use the term "critical path dependency," nor does it explicitly state that aircraft delivery delays create a situation that "specifically advantages carriers with existing widebody fleets over those reliant on narrowbody aircraft orders" in the manner described by the question.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The three crises are:
1. Safety-related aircraft issues: The Boeing 737 Max panel incident which led to slowed Boeing production and delayed jet deliveries, and an engine problem on some Airbus planes that forced carriers to pull these jets out of service for inspections.
2. Technology outage: A brief technology outage that disrupted travel and resulted in thousands of canceled flights.
3. Financial crisis: Spirit Airlines' bankruptcy filing.</answer>
<other>These crises contributed to the industry's improved pricing power. The article states that pricing power resulted from a "demand-over-supply imbalance" achieved when "airlines reduced the number of flights and seats." The safety-related aircraft issues limited the availability of planes and forced some out of service. The technology outage directly led to canceled flights. Spirit Airlines' bankruptcy would also impact overall market capacity if it led to a reduction in its flights. Collectively, these events impacted (reduced or constrained) available flights and seats (capacity management), contributing to the supply-side conditions for the demand-over-supply imbalance that gives the industry pricing power.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article frames "the last five years" as a period of significant challenges ("every bird in the sky was a black swan"). However, it then states, "But it appears that this industry does have its ducks in a row," attributing this to factors like strong demand (pandemic recovery), airlines improving their businesses (which includes responses to activist investors), and the "stabilization of fuel, labor and other costs." These cumulative effects are presented as the reasons for the projected 2025 stability ("banner 2025," "best setup we've had in decades"), suggesting the industry is emerging from challenges, rather than presenting a conflict between the past difficulties and future optimism when these positive factors are considered.</other>
