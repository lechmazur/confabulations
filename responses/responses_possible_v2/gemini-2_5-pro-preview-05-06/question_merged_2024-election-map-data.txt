<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that data from places not including early or mail-in absentee ballots is considered incomplete and not included in the map. However, it does not specify a "type of data presentation" that was explicitly rejected due to this incompleteness. It discusses the data itself being unsuitable for inclusion.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>73 percent</answer>
<other>The article states: "It currently includes results for more than 110,000 precincts, or 73 percent of all votes..."</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Early or mail-in absentee ballots</answer>
<other>The article mentions: "Many places do not include early or mail-in absentee ballots in the precinct data they release, and since a majority of Americans now vote early or by mail, we consider the data for those places incomplete..." Excluding this data would lead to misrepresenting overall voter turnout.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states the current choropleth map "does not account for population." The premise of the question ("perfectly inverse relationship between the intensity of shading... and the population density") describes a different map. Even under this hypothetical, the article does not provide information to suggest that such a shading characteristic would make the task of "putting the data into precinct boundaries" (which involves matching names/codes) more complex. The complexity of that task is attributed to misaligned labeling or coding of precinct names.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Collecting results data</answer>
<other>The article states, "To produce the map, The Times spent months collecting results data... It is a time-consuming research task." It then mentions, "In a few places, data-curious individuals had already collected precinct data, and we got permission to incorporate their hard work into our map." If these individuals collected data, this directly reduces The Times' effort in the initial step of "collecting results data" for those areas. The "perfectly aligned" condition refers to the quality of the data they collected, making subsequent matching easier, but the collection itself is the initial step made less time-consuming by their contribution.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>It does not account for population</answer>
<other>The article states a drawback of the choropleth method is that "it does not account for population; a sparsely populated area where a candidate won by 25 points is shaded the same way as a densely populated one with the same margin." Adding more least populated counties would exacerbate this, as these sparsely populated areas might gain undue visual prominence.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Submissions to help add missing data</answer>
<other>The article states, "Use the form below to help us add missing data or to notify us of potential inaccuracies." If a state provides "perfectly formatted data tables for all votes cast," and early/mail-in voting (a major source of previous incompleteness) is drastically reduced, the need for submissions to "add missing data" would become less crucial for ensuring accuracy, particularly for that state.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The exclusion of data is due to its incompleteness (e.g., missing early or mail-in ballots). A change in visualization method to accurately represent population density would not make this underlying data incompleteness, or the resulting exclusion of such data from the map, irrelevant. The limitation of having incomplete coverage due to excluded data would persist if the data itself remains incomplete.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Sharing local knowledge and insights</answer>
<other>The article states: "By sharing your local knowledge and insights, you'll help us create a more accurate map of election results." A discrepancy in boundary shapes despite matching vote counts would be an inaccuracy where local knowledge could be crucial for identification and correction. This falls under the broader call for submissions to "notify us of potential inaccuracies."</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Each of these entities has its own way of releasing such data, and there is no nationwide source of this information.</answer>
<other>The article states: "Each of these entities [state and county sources] has its own way of releasing such data, and there is no nationwide source of this information. It is a time-consuming research task..." This challenge of varying data formats and lack of a centralized source would apply to collecting historical data (like 2016 data) just as it does for current election data.</other>
