<answer>His approach of taking his time and not touching some repertoire until he is absolutely ready.</answer>
<other>The article contrasts Kantorow with Chamayou, stating, "At the moment, it's difficult to picture Kantorow being as stylistically flexible as Chamayou. He's taking his time." And "perhaps the greatest reward for prize winners like Kantorow is the luxury of not touching some repertoire until they are absolutely ready." Igor Lasko, who fostered detailed practice, brought "depth of focus." This careful, deep approach to repertoire, rather than rapid, broad expansion, would indicate the "depth of focus" Lasko instilled.</other>

<answer>Kantorow's feeling that he currently lacks the "whole balance with the head and heart, this alignment" necessary for him to perform Bach's compositions publicly.</answer>
<other>Rena Shereshevskaya believed "everything in music stemmed from Bach" and that composers are connected through a "universal ur-meaning" originating from Bach. Kantorow's stated discomfort and feeling of lacking the required "alignment" for Bach, the very composer Shereshevskaya views as the fundamental source of musical meaning, would challenge the idea that this meaning is universally or readily accessible through Bach for every performer, or that her framework fully encompasses such a specific difficulty with the foundational composer.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article provides limited information about Marek Janowski's career path beyond his age (85) and his "belated" New York Philharmonic debut after having "long ago gave up hope." While Kantorow's career path is detailed, there isn't enough information provided about Janowski's path to identify a specific shared characteristic stemming from their respective career paths that would make a collaboration particularly resonant, based solely on the text.</other>

<answer>His decision to remain with the same general manager he has had since he was 16 and with Bis, the small Swedish label, rather than signing with a major label, despite his rapid rise and increased international engagements.</answer>
<other>The "unflappable" quality suggests calmness and not being easily swayed. Despite his "rapid rise," Kantorow "remains with the same general manager... he has had since he was 16" and "remained with Bis... Rather than signing with a major label." This consistency and loyalty, and his stated dislike for "unnecessary change," reflect an unflappable nature, not being panicked or rushed into changing his professional representation due to fame.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>Kantorow believes in harmony as "a sense of the grammar that we built with the ages." Bertrand Chamayou's program included works by Ravel, Gershwin, Milhaud, and Bernstein, all of whom utilize harmony and established musical grammar. The article describes Chamayou as "stylistically flexible" but does not state or imply that his performance style is characterized by an absence of this "sense of the grammar." Therefore, the article does not provide information on an element related to this concept of harmony that would be absent from Chamayou's performance style.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>Rena Shereshevskaya's training regimen, compared to an athlete's, "was done with a view to drilling Kantorow's subconscious." Kantorow states, "The best concerts for me are the moments where your brain is quite far back... Suddenly, you disappear, you don't exist anymore," and that during the Tchaikovsky Competition, "the body knew a lot of things to do." This describes a state of flow. The photograph capturing him as an "unusually relaxed performer in flow" depicts the intended outcome and success of this training regimen, not a contradiction to it. The article presents this state as the training having "paid off."</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Music that comes from instruments directly, without amplifiers.</answer>
<other>Kantorow values the "special experience" of classical music where "you hear music that only comes from instruments directly, not with amplifiers." Broadway shows, like Idina Menzel's "Redwood," typically use amplification. Therefore, the absence of amplifiers and the direct, unamplified sound of instruments would be an essential element for Kantorow.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Kantorow's decision to remain with the small, committed Swedish label Bis and his established team, refusing to change his outlooks or relationships despite his significant success.</answer>
<other>Robert von Bahr, founder of Bis, noted that Kantorow "guards his relationships for the long run, and refuses to change himself or his outlooks. Very few artists in his class do that." Kantorow identifies "the element of brashness, of risk" in Brahms's First Sonata. Sticking with a small label and his existing team, when many peers might move to major labels or change representation after similar success, could be seen by von Bahr as a "brash" or boldly unconventional and potentially risky career choice, paralleling the youthful "brashness" and "risk" Kantorow sees in Brahms.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>His performance of Ravel's "Jeux d'Eau" in the pouring rain during the Paris Olympics opening ceremony, which gained him "worldwide notice."</answer>
<other>Kantorow's parents were "wary of overexposing their son," and his early musical life was a "private family thing." His decision to perform at an event as massively public and globally televised as the Paris Olympics opening ceremony, leading to "worldwide notice," represents a very high level of exposure. This is ironic because it starkly contrasts with the initial desire for privacy and the parental concern about overexposure, with him willingly participating in an event that maximizes such exposure.</other>
