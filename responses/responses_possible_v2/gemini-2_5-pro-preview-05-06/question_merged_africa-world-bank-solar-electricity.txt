<answer>No</answer>
<other>The article states Husk Power Systems left Tanzania because the government insisted on a price at which Husk couldn't make money. Mwajuma Mohamed's TV became non-functional after Husk's minigrid, which had powered it, became defunct. If the energy minister's policy, which led to Husk's departure, had been in place when Husk initially entered Tanzania, it's unlikely Husk would have established or maintained the minigrid that powered her TV.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The company that left Tanzania (Husk Power Systems) has 70 operational minigrids in Nigeria. If these were targeted, Nigeria would be affected. The country known for its "Bulldozer" president (John Magufuli) is Tanzania. The article does not provide information suggesting that Tanzania would be affected if minigrids in Nigeria were targeted. Therefore, no single country mentioned fits the combined description of being affected by the rebel attack on those 70 minigrids AND being known for the "Bulldozer" president.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Tanesco</answer>
<other>The village chairman, Gesenda Mwise Gesenda, states: "With Tanesco, it actually costs me three times as much for the same amount of power." The hypothetical scenario about tripled costs being less than Husk's does not change who the chairman blames for his current higher costs.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The main enabling factor is the "plummeting cost of building solar power, driven by China's breakneck growth as a producer of inexpensive, high-quality solar panels." The village chairman currently uses a Tanesco connection. The article does not provide enough information to determine whether the unavailability of cheap solar panels would directly cause the chairman to pay more or less for his *current Tanesco connection*. It would affect the viability and cost of solar alternatives, but Tanesco's pricing for existing customers is described as heavily subsidized and loss-making, and its response to changes in solar panel costs is not specified.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>One</answer>
<other>Husk Power Systems is currently most active in Nigeria, where it finds a receptive regulatory environment. Mashavu Ali has eight children. The article states, "Mashavu Ali... was above all excited for one of her daughters, who had the best grades in the village secondary school. She imagined her studying late into the night" when they had electricity. If her village were in Nigeria and had reliable Husk power, it is likely this one daughter would be studying late. The article does not provide information about other daughters' study habits in relation to electricity.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Less</answer>
<other>The unnamed energy minister is from Tanzania. The fastest minigrid developer, Husk, is thriving in Nigeria due to a "receptive regulatory environment." Gesenda Mwise Gesenda found that Tanesco (the state utility in Tanzania) cost him "three times as much for the same amount of power" as Husk did. If Tanzania adopted a regulatory environment similar to Nigeria's, allowing companies like Husk to operate viably, Gesenda would likely have access to cheaper electricity, similar to what Husk previously provided, thus spending less.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The main enabling factor is inexpensive solar panels. The person using a Tanesco connection is Gesenda Mwise Gesenda. If the U.S. administration became hostile to this factor, it could affect funding for the electrification mission and the rollout of solar projects. However, the article does not directly state how this would cause Gesenda Mwise Gesenda's *current Tanesco electricity costs* to increase or decrease. Tanesco's pricing is influenced by subsidies and its operational losses, and the direct impact of U.S. policy on solar on Tanesco's tariffs for existing customers is not specified.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>No</answer>
<other>The Rockefeller Foundation is investing in renewable energy. If it prioritized extending existing power grids (like Tanzania's Tanesco) instead of solar minigrids, Mwajuma Mohamed might get a connection from Tanesco. However, the article states that Tanesco's service, where it has reached Matipwili, is "inferior" with "frequent and lengthy power cuts." Therefore, her TV would unlikely be reliably functional.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Later</answer>
<other>Husk Power Systems ceased operations in Tanzania due to government insistence on pricing that made it unprofitable (a regulatory issue). The "Bulldozer" president was John Magufuli. If he had prioritized regulatory reform allowing companies like Husk to operate profitably, Husk might have continued providing power in Matipwili. The article states that since losing electricity access, Mashavu Ali's "children go to bed soon after the sun sets." With electricity (which Husk provided), her daughter could study late. Thus, with continued electricity, children would likely go to bed later.</other>
