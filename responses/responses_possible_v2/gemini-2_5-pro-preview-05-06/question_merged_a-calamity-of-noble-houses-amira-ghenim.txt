<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article describes Tahar Haddad's real-life activism and his fictionalized portrayal as a "poor but idealistic young tutor." It also states Han Kang's "We Do Not Part" "delves into why atrocities must be remembered." However, the article does not provide enough information to determine a specific aspect of his *fictionalized portrayal* that he might find *ironically mirrored* in Han Kang's themes.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Mhammed</answer>
<other>Mhammed is a member of the Ennaifer family. His actions (alerting the family, leading to anger and chaos) are central to the scuffle where Zbaida is injured. The "Rashomon"-like testimonies create ambiguity ("falls -- or is she pushed?"), making guilt difficult to establish. Furthermore, Mhammed's own chapter reveals a complex personal history (sexual abuse, closeted homosexuality, desperation for approval), which could be used by a defense to complicate the narrative of his culpability, making him challenging to prosecute beyond a reasonable doubt.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions Scott Turow is the author of "Presumed Innocent" and describes Zbaida's granddaughter Hind's quest for truth. However, it does not specify any "previously explored thematic element from his own work" beyond what can be generally inferred from titles like "Presumed Innocent." Thus, a specific thematic element cannot be identified solely from the text.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states Nnedi Okorafor's recent novel "explores a traumatic event" and is "her most autobiographical novel yet." However, it does not specify the *type* of traumatic event explored in Okorafor's work. Without this information, it's impossible to determine what type of traumatic event a jinn in her novel would be tasked with revealing based on her recent work.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that Han Kang's fiction has "probed at the seams of South Korea's historic wounds" and her novel "We Do Not Part" "delves into why atrocities must be remembered." However, the article does not name or describe any *specific* atrocity reflective of South Korea's history that Han Kang explores.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Hind</answer>
<other>The "Renaissance" in African publishing aims at "changing the stories told about the region." Hind, Zbaida's granddaughter, represents a modern perspective (her chapter is set in 2013) actively seeking to uncover "secret histories" and understanding their impact. Her determination to find the truth ("a jinn of truth is emerging") and her view that unexposed secrets "erupt in tragedy" reflect a changing narrative that confronts and re-examines the past, rather than ignoring or simplifying it. Her voice embodies this shift.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions May-lee Chai's collection "Useful Phrases for Immigrants" and describes Tahar Haddad's letter and its context (gender equality, national rejuvenation, political outcast). However, the article does not provide any specific phrases from Chai's work or any phrases from the text related to Haddad or Tunisian struggles that would aptly fit the "Useful Phrases for Immigrants" titling style.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article describes Mhammed's internal conflicts and the historical oppressions in "A Calamity of Noble Houses." It also states Nnedi Okorafor is a "science fiction and fantasy writer." However, the article does not provide any details about the "futuristic societal structures" typical of Okorafor's science fiction, making it impossible to identify one that would mirror the described historical oppressions.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions the "silent crowd" described by Hind as "false witnesses" and Scott Turow's work ("Presumed Innocent," "Presumed Guilty"). However, it does not specify any "legal concept, central to Turow's work" that would best describe the collective role of this "silent crowd."</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states the metal box contains "the truth about her grandmother's past" and is linked to "secret histories." It also mentions Han Kang's "We Do Not Part" explores "South Korea's historic wounds" and "why atrocities must be remembered." However, the article does not specify the *type* of historical wound specific to South Korea that Han Kang typically explores.</other>
