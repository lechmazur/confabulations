<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article provides data from a 2013 study showing esophageal cancer had a 30% higher relative risk for light drinkers compared to non-drinkers, which was higher than for oral cavity/pharynx cancer (17%) and breast cancer (5%). However, the article does not explicitly state that esophageal cancer is "not being the most common type of alcohol-related cancer in terms of absolute lifetime risk," nor does it provide a ranking of commonality for all alcohol-related cancers in absolute terms, making it impossible to verify this part of the condition.</other>

<answer>39.09%</answer>
<other>The reference group (less than one drink per week) for women had an 11% lifetime risk of breast cancer ("About 11 in 100 women"). Women consuming two drinks daily had a 15.3% lifetime risk of breast cancer ("The share of those who would develop breast cancer increased to 15.3 percent"). The percentage increase is ((15.3 - 11) / 11) * 100 = (4.3 / 11) * 100 = 39.0909...%. Rounded to two decimal places, this is 39.09%. The Australian study, as per the article, "did not include non-drinkers to avoid what is known as the 'sick quitter' effect," so the premise of the question is met.</other>

<answer>35 ounces of wine per week</answer>
<other>Women experience a 19% lifetime risk of developing any alcohol-related cancer when they consume "one alcoholic drink each day (seven drinks a week)." A standard drink is defined as containing "about the amount in a 5-ounce glass of wine." Therefore, seven drinks per week corresponds to 7 * 5 ounces = 35 ounces of wine per week.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Two drinks per day</answer>
<other>
Calculating the absolute lifetime risk difference (Women - Men) for any alcohol-related cancer:
1.  Less than one drink per week: Women 17%, Men 10%. Difference = 17% - 10% = 7 percentage points.
2.  One drink each day: Women 19%, Men 11%. Difference = 19% - 11% = 8 percentage points.
3.  Two drinks per day: Women "nearly 22 percent", Men 13%. Difference = "nearly 22%" - 13% = "nearly 9 percentage points".
Since "nearly 9 percentage points" is greater than 8 percentage points, the maximum gap reported occurs at the "Two drinks per day" level.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Mouth cancer</answer>
<other>
Light drinking (up to one drink per day) increases the risk of cancers of the "mouth, pharynx and breast."
Heavy drinking (four or more drinks a day) is linked to "cancers of the mouth, oropharynx, larynx, esophagus, breast and colorectal area."
Mouth cancer appears in both categories.
The article states, "Drinking and smoking cigarettes, for instance, is known to compound the risk of head and neck cancers." Mouth cancer is a type of head and neck cancer.

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>1.5 ounces</answer>
<other>A 13.1% lifetime risk of breast cancer for women is associated with consuming "one alcoholic drink each day." A standard drink is defined as containing, among other equivalents, "a 1.5-ounce shot of liquor." Therefore, the daily consumption of liquor corresponding to this risk level is 1.5 ounces.</other>
