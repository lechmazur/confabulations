<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>On the island, Marguerite and her companions become "rulers and our own subjects too," a self-governing structure that contradicts 16th-century French hierarchies where noble birth and male guardianship (like Roberval's financial control) dictated fixed social positions. The queen's later comment that "Those who have endured the worst have most to teach" also suggests a reordering of status based on experience rather than birthright.</answer>
<other>The article states Marguerite's observation "On this island, we were rulers and our own subjects too." It also mentions she was "noble and wealthy by birth" and her finances were controlled by Roberval, reflecting French hierarchies. The queen's quote suggests a different basis for value.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The "instructive," almost detached tone used for describing the complex task of processing a polar bear (likened to explaining "beef Wellington," a dish of refined cuisine) contrasts with the "ravenous" and visceral description of consuming seabirds ("sniffed flesh roasting and watched skin crackle... savored... every bit"). This juxtaposition highlights a tension between Marguerite's ingrained upper-class restraint and the primal, unadorned necessities of survival, forcing an adaptation that challenges her original class identity.</answer>
<other>The article explicitly contrasts the "instructive" tone for the polar bear with the reviewer wishing for a "more visceral register," and provides the "ravenous" quote for the seabird consumption.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states Roberval was "enraged" by the furtive meetings, "though he is slow to mete out his punishment." Marguerite also reflects, "As always... he allowed me the illusion I was free." These two points suggest a delay and a pattern of psychological control. However, the article does not provide a third distinct textual evidence point that *confirms* the delay was strategic to maximize psychological control *rather than* an impulsive act, especially since his rage is also mentioned.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions Basque fishermen rescuing Marguerite, the French attempt to establish New France, and Damienne's role as a nurse. However, the article, a book review, does not itself draw any conclusions or present information that would allow for the identification of a "geopolitical contradiction" regarding European colonial networks in the 1540s based on these specific elements.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions Marguerite's faith abandoning her during winter hardships, Auguste's "crises of doubt" prior to exile, and Roberval's earlier maritime absences bringing "the specter of a new horror." However, the article does not connect these three elements into a specific causal chain to explain the narrative's theological arc. Marguerite's loss of faith is directly linked to being "tested beyond what they can bear" in winter.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Marguerite is "noble and wealthy by birth," and Roberval's "primary interest is maximizing her wealth to his advantage," implying significant assets. This directly contradicts her material conditions on the island where they were allowed "only what they can carry," had to "scrabble together a shelter," fashion a "mattress made of peat," and were "impoverished," sleeping "as beggars did." This reveals Roberval's true priority was his own gain from her wealth, not her well-being.</answer>
<other>The article provides these contrasting descriptions of her financial status and her island conditions.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions Han Kang's fiction probes "South Korea's historic wounds" and "why atrocities must be remembered." It describes Goodman's "Isola" as focusing on Marguerite's personal "fight for survival." However, the article does not provide sufficient detail about Han Kang's protagonists' relationships to institutional power structures, nor does it frame Goodman's approach in a way that allows for an "implicit contrast" on this specific basis to be drawn solely from the text provided. The books are listed as separate items.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Four narrative elements are: 1. The exile affording the couple "a version of the freedom they desired." 2. The life on the island feeling "almost Edenic, despite its painful beginnings." 3. Marguerite's direct statement, "On this island, we were rulers and our own subjects too." 4. Their practical self-sufficiency in "scrabbl[ing] together a shelter," fashioning a mattress, and procuring food like birds and a polar bear, establishing a de facto autonomous existence.</answer>
<other>These elements are directly stated or described in the article as aspects of their life on the island, transforming it from a mere place of punishment.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Roberval's intended symbolic meaning of the punishment as an "appalling" act of ultimate control and degradation is undermined by: 1. Marguerite keeping her "deepest agonies private," showing an inner resilience and an ability to "impose order on a life she did not design" through her narration, meaning she is not entirely broken. 2. The queen's commentary, "Those who have endured the worst have most to teach," reframing the suffering as a source of wisdom and value, contrary to a purely destructive intent. 3. Damienne's presence and functional role as a companion in exile, providing support and preventing complete isolation, thus altering the punitive experience Roberval designed for Marguerite alone with her lover.</answer>
<other>The article mentions Marguerite's private agonies, the queen's quote, and Damienne being stranded with Marguerite and Auguste. These elements suggest outcomes (resilience, wisdom, companionship) that would counter an intention of pure, isolating punishment.</other>
