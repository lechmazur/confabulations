<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The novel by Williams features a fake-dating dynamic and a lottery win, but the article states it is "available March 25," implying it is a "soon-to-be-released gem" and not "already-published" at the likely time of the article's writing (around Ali Hazelwood's "Deep End" release on Feb. 4). The other book with fake-dating (Eva/Bennett) does not involve a lottery win.</other>

<answer>The dystopian romance novel featuring Wren, a psychic rebel fighter, and her commanding officer, Cross.</answer>
<other>This book was blurbed by Ali Hazelwood, features a psychic rebel fighter (Wren), and the article states, "The only downside to this book is that it doesn't come out until May," indicating a delayed publication that would make it less appealing in the immediate sense despite her endorsement.</other>

<answer>The "Twelfth Night" retelling where Veera and Deepak, long-time friends with romantic feelings, enter a fake marriage.</answer>
<other>This novel is described as having yearning that intensifies due to a "fake marriage" (fake-relationship trope). It's the final installment in a trilogy but can be read as a standalone. No STEM field is mentioned for Veera or Deepak. It is not listed with a future release date, implying it was published before February 2024. The Aaliyah/Ahmad book has slow burn but not a clear fake relationship trope between the main couple. The Sybil/Kieran book has fake dating but is not published before Feb 2024.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions one novel where a character (Devin) transforms into a werewolf. However, this novel "also has quite a bit of negotiated kink," which disqualifies it. Additionally, it is "available March 11," so not published before "Deep End" (Feb 4). No other novel described in the article features a similar werewolf transformation scenario without negotiated kink and published before Feb 4.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The Sapphic rom-com (Opal/Pepper) involves cohabitation on a farm due to a property dispute. The bartender's workplace (Ahmad's) is a local bar. The article does not describe any novel that combines a bar-like setting with a cohabitation/property dispute plot similar to the Opal/Pepper novel.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The first book in the trilogy where Prince Damen is captured and becomes a prisoner of Prince Laurent from a rival kingdom.</answer>
<other>The dystopian romance features Wren (psychic rebel fighter) forced into a military program under Commanding Officer Cross, indicating a power imbalance. The novel about Prince Damen and Prince Laurent is set with "rival kingdoms," involves Damen becoming a "prisoner" of Laurent (a clear power dynamic), and is described as having "intrigue, betrayal, battles," fitting a historical context. It is not listed with a future release date, implying it is previously published.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>Gigi's novel has "suspenseful thriller" elements. Miri's novel focuses on an "archaeologist" and "archaeological lore" but explicitly mentions an "expedition through the Brazilian rainforest." The question requires a book without rainforest expeditions. No other book in the article is described as combining suspenseful elements with a career focus on archaeology or archaeological lore without a rainforest expedition.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The premise of the biologist's novel is: "A biologist crash lands on a planet with her newly acquired pet lion, meets two sex aliens, and the three of them fall in love." This centrally involves a biologist and an encounter with alien life forms. The novel featuring a hurricane (Meena/Nikhil) involves an estranged human couple rekindling their love while stranded. While it has a "stranded by disaster" element, it does not feature a biologist protagonist or any encounter with alien/non-human life forms, making its premise significantly different from the biologist/aliens novel beyond the change in disaster type.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The novel by Williams where Sybil loses a lottery ticket, Kieran returns it, the gesture is captured in a viral video, and they decide to fake date.</answer>
<other>The Jo/Mal novel explores "relationship dynamics." The Gigi/Alec novel has a "celebrity romance aspect." The novel by Williams features a plot centered around a "viral video." This viral video makes Sybil and Kieran public figures, giving a "celebrity romance aspect," and their "fake date" arrangement allows for the exploration of relationship dynamics. The article states Williams "always writes likable characters who lust wholeheartedly for each other."</other>
