<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article describes Beatrice Ndanu Munyoki’s father tying her arm with strips of cloth (a tourniquet) after the bite. It later states that tourniquets "often cause more harm than the bite itself, cutting off blood supply and leading to amputations." The first hospital also "had no antidote for that kind of venom," indicating a delay in appropriate treatment. While these factors contributed to the negative outcome, the article does not specify the physiological mechanism of the particular venom that bit Beatrice that would explain why her finger still required amputation after eventually receiving two doses of antivenom at a second hospital, nor does it describe the venom properties of the "red head" snake that bit her.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Antivenoms must be tailored to the specific snake species, as venom composition, including its blend of toxins, varies significantly by species and even regionally within a species. Indian-manufactured antivenom, typically developed using venom from snakes common in India like kraits, is therefore ineffective against the venom of Kenyan puff adders, which have a different venom composition.</answer>
<other>The article states, "Antivenoms made in India, where kraits are most common, are useless against the black mambas or puff adders that terrorize Kenyans." It also explains, "To be effective, an antivenom should be tailored to the snake. Each species produces a special blend of dozens of toxins. Even within a species, the venom can vary by region, age, diet and season."</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The existence of diverse, highly dangerous toxin families, such as neurotoxins (found in cobras and mambas, causing paralysis) and toxins that destroy blood-clotting factors (found in puff adders), combined with the limitations of current antivenoms—which are often species- or region-specific, can cause allergic reactions, are made using outdated methods, and have dwindling supplies—necessitates the development of broadly effective monoclonal antibodies targeting these key toxin families for a universal treatment.</answer>
<other>The article mentions research into "lab-made monoclonal antibodies that would disarm the most important toxin families present in snakes across several continents" to create "something that's much more universal." It describes neurotoxins from cobras/mambas and blood-clotting factor destruction by puff adders. Limitations of current antivenom include regional ineffectiveness ("Antivenoms from one country often don't work on snakebites in another"), potential for "harsh allergic reactions," and being "no match for this complexity [of venom]."</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that spitting cobras can shoot venom into eyes and that some snakebite victims seek treatment from traditional healers. It also mentions that clinicians (not traditional healers) may misdiagnose puncture wounds from bites. However, the article does not explicitly state that a spitting cobra's venom delivery method (spitting into eyes, thus no puncture wound) creates diagnostic confusion with non-venomous ocular injuries specifically in the context of traditional healers, nor does it describe how traditional healers diagnose or what they might confuse ocular venom exposure with.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>In Kenya, rainy seasons cause flooding that forces snakes from their holes, increasing encounters. Hot, dry seasons compel snakes to search for food (like rats, poultry, eggs often found near farms and homes) and water, bringing them closer to human settlements. These patterns create risk peaks during these seasons for demographic groups such as farmers working in fields, and residents of dilapidated homes or those sleeping on the floor, who are more likely to encounter snakes seeking shelter, food, or water.</answer>
<other>The article states, "In the rainy season, flooding forces snakes out of their holes... Hot, dry seasons send snakes in search of food -- rats, poultry, eggs -- and water." It also mentions, "Farmers, migrant workers, nomadic groups and residents of remote villages encounter snakes in their dilapidated homes, while sleeping on the floor..."</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The question includes the premise that puff adders have a "higher venom yield per bite." The article does not state this fact. According to the initial instructions, if a question contains an incorrect or unstated premise from the article, the answer should be "N/A".</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Antivenom's requirement to be kept cold and sterile makes it difficult to stock and deliver in rural areas of Kenya with limited healthcare infrastructure, contributing to delays beyond the ideal six-hour treatment window. For pregnant snakebite victims, who already face catastrophic outcomes such as spontaneous abortion, fetal malformations, and death to both mother and fetus, these delays in receiving viable antivenom exacerbate the severity and likelihood of such devastating consequences.</answer>
<other>The article states, "Antivenom must be kept cold and sterile," "stocking and delivering the right antivenom... is tricky," "most snakebites occur in rural areas, far from dispensaries that stock antivenom," antivenom "should ideally be administered within six hours," and for pregnant women, outcomes "can be catastrophic." The need for cold storage (thermal instability) makes it harder for rural facilities to maintain antivenom, leading to delays that are particularly detrimental for pregnant women.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The paradoxical outcome is that tourniquets, widely used with the intent to halt venom flow, often cause more harm by cutting off blood supply, leading to amputations. Similarly, traditional treatments, sought for healing, are likely ineffective against venom and delay access to essential medical care like antivenom. Thus, these interventions, intended to be beneficial, frequently worsen the patient's condition or outcome, especially when combined with hospital admission delays.</answer>
<other>The article states, "Many believe tourniquets can halt the venom's flow, but they often cause more harm than the bite itself, cutting off blood supply and leading to amputations." It also mentions victims paying traditional healers for treatments like herbs and dung, while antivenom is the effective treatment, implying traditional methods are ineffective and cause delays.</other>
