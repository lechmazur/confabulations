<other>The question asks for a concise directive that might be included in new dietary guidelines if a specific upcoming report influences them to perfectly reflect the evolving evidence against alcohol, as acknowledged in the 2020 guidelines.

First, I will identify what the article says about the "evolving evidence against alcohol" and what the "2020 guidelines acknowledged."
The article states: "The final 2020 dietary guidelines did acknowledge that 'emerging evidence suggests that even drinking within the recommended limits may increase the overall risk of death from various causes, such as from several types of cancer and some forms of cardiovascular disease.'" It also mentions an "emerging scientific consensus that alcohol has no health benefits" and that "some scientists have ventured the opinion that the risks could start with the first drop."

Next, I will look for information about the "upcoming report from the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Prevention of Underage Drinking" and its potential influence.
The article states: "The government's upcoming report, the next shoe to drop in this controversy, is expected to focus on health outcomes known to be caused by alcohol, not merely associated with it. And that may set the stage for dietary guidelines that say something truly new: Drink less."

The question asks for a "concise directive" that reflects a "significant shift from current advice." The current advice mentioned is "up to two daily drinks for men and one for women is safe."
The article explicitly suggests what this "truly new" directive might be. The phrase "Drink less" is concise and would be a significant shift.

The question is conditional: "If the upcoming report... were to influence... to perfectly reflect the evolving evidence... what concise directive... might be included...?"
The article directly states that the upcoming report "may set the stage for dietary guidelines that say something truly new: Drink less." This directly answers the question about what "might be included" under the influence of this report, especially if it's to reflect the evolving evidence (which points towards more harm). "Drink less" aligns with the idea of reflecting evidence of increased risk even within recommended limits.</other>
