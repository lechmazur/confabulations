<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that Alonzo Davis's participation in the "March Against Fear" was part of a series of experiences that led him and his brother to decide to open an art gallery. The gallery's thematic focus was on showcasing "artists doing works that were politically significant" in response to "social and racial tumult set off by the civil rights movement and the unrest in the city's Watts section." However, the article does not explicitly detail *how* his participation in the march specifically or indirectly contributed to shaping this thematic focus, beyond being part of the overall impetus for the gallery's creation.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The mural "Eye on '84" was intended to be a "new landmark" and a "true picture of Los Angeles as a multicultural community," but it was eventually "lost forever" after being covered by graffiti, worn away by freeway pollution, and painted over by the highway authority.</answer>
<other>The stated purpose of permanence and multicultural representation contrasts sharply with its degradation and ultimate destruction due to neglect and official action.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article describes Brockman Gallery becoming "a community hub where politics, art and education intersected" and states that Brockman Productions "ran art festivals, concerts and continuing education programs." It does not present this expansion into educational programming as being in a paradoxical relationship with its founding premise of showcasing artists' responses to issues like police brutality; rather, it suggests a complementary role.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions that Alonzo Davis's marriage to Rebecca Braithwaite ended in divorce but does not provide the date or timeframe of the divorce. Without this information, it is not possible to determine from the text how the dissolution of his marriage temporally coincided with his professional shifts, such as leaving the gallery in 1987 to run a state arts program in Sacramento.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The original site selection for Davis's murals "along the city's freeways" (specifically, his "Eye on '84" was on a retaining wall on the Harbor Freeway) directly exposed them to "freeway pollution" and placed them under the jurisdiction of the "highway authority," which eventually "painted [them] over." These specific challenges of degradation from pollution and obliteration by the highway authority, along with being "covered by graffiti" and "buried under decades of paint and soot," were exacerbated by this freeway siting.</answer>
<other>The article links the fate of the murals (being worn by freeway pollution, painted over by the highway authority) to their freeway location.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The timeline reflects a deliberate departure as Alonzo Davis "wanted to travel, and in 1987 he left the gallery, and Los Angeles, to run a state arts program in Sacramento." His subsequent academic appointments were at the Art Institute of San Antonio and then the Memphis College of Art, geographically moving him away from the West Coast art scene he helped define.</answer>
<other>The article explicitly states his desire to travel and his departure from Los Angeles, followed by positions in Texas and Tennessee, indicating a clear move away from the West Coast.</other>
