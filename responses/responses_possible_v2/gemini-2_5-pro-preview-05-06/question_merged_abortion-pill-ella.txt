<answer>60 milligrams</answer>
<other>The article states the study involved "twice the dose of the ulipristal acetate contained in Ella," and later specifies this as "a 60 milligram dose of ulipristal acetate (double the 30 milligrams in Ella)". This is the dosage used to show ulipristal acetate as a substitute for mifepristone, which is the concern of groups like the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The specific element present in both the standard (mifepristone + misoprostol) and experimental (ulipristal acetate + misoprostol) regimens is misoprostol. However, the article states that misoprostol "has not been targeted as much by abortion opponents." This suggests it would not "likely be the focus" of a lawsuit, especially when the organization represented by Kristi Hamrick (Students for Life of America) is primarily concerned with Ella (ulipristal acetate), which is not common to both regimens. The article does not provide information to support that misoprostol would likely become "the focus" in the described scenario.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Progesterone</answer>
<other>The article states that mifepristone (the medication in the Supreme Court lawsuit) "stops the development of a pregnancy by blocking the hormone progesterone." It also states that ulipristal acetate (the medication in the Mexico City study) "is in the same class of medications as mifepristone and also blocks the activity of progesterone."</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Implantation</answer>
<other>The FDA's 2022 clarification for Plan B stated it "acts only before fertilization" and "will not affect an existing pregnancy," removing suggestions it might prevent implantation. The medication targeted by Project 2025 is Ella (ulipristal acetate). The article mentions, "The claim by some abortion opponents that morning-after pills are abortion drugs is based on a theory that they might also prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the womb." The FDA label for Ella "adds that the medication may also affect implantation," which plaintiffs would likely claim, despite recent studies suggesting otherwise.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Mifepristone</answer>
<other>Mifepristone is described as "the only drug specifically approved for abortion in the United States" and "Typically used through 12 weeks' gestation." If ulipristal acetate, as an alternative, faced restrictions similar to those sought against mifepristone, the availability of mifepristone would be indirectly impacted, likely by increasing the legal and political pressure on it as the sole remaining approved option or by emboldening efforts to restrict it further. Dr. Blumenthal's comment, "The more uses we have for these medications, the harder it will be for people to take them away," implies that restricting an alternative could make the original drug more vulnerable.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Required insurance coverage of contraception under the Affordable Care Act</answer>
<other>The article states that "Project 2025, a right-wing policy blueprint... said that Ella should be removed from required insurance coverage of contraception under the Affordable Care Act because it is 'a potential abortifacient.'" This is the specific legal provision related to insurance coverage.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Plan B One-Step</answer>
<other>The article identifies "Plan B One-Step" as a morning-after pill that "does not require a prescription," "contains a different drug" than Ella (ulipristal acetate), and "is intended to be taken within three days after unprotected sex." If ulipristal acetate were restricted, Plan B One-Step would remain unaffected by those specific restrictions. The article also notes the historical, disproven claim by some abortion opponents that morning-after pills (generally) might prevent implantation.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Misoprostol</answer>
<other>The two-drug regimen using the medication studied in the NEJM Evidence would be ulipristal acetate followed by misoprostol. The article states that misoprostol "has various medical uses and has not been targeted as much by abortion opponents." Dr. Donna Harrison's statement focuses on ulipristal acetate and mifepristone functioning similarly, implying the primary concern is with the first drug of the regimen. Therefore, misoprostol, despite its role in terminating the pregnancy and being usable on its own, would most likely not be the direct target of the lawsuit.</other>
