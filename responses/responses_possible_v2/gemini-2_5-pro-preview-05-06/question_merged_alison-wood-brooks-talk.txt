<other>The user wants me to answer questions based solely on the provided article. I will go through each question and find the answer directly from the text, or state N/A if it's not present or cannot be logically inferred. I will adhere to the specified tagging format.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Making one joke in one conversation to increase chances of being voted into leadership positions.</answer>
<other>The article states, "She sometimes frames conversation as merely another avenue to success: 'Managers who were randomly assigned to make one joke in one conversation were over 9 percent more likely to be voted into leadership positions by their teammates.' The subtext is that M.B.A. students can sharpen their wits and their knives at the same time." This directly links a specific technique (making a joke) to corporate success (leadership positions) and the business school origin of her research.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Kant</answer>
<other>The article says, "Kant, she notes, hosted dinners that adhered to a strict script... Though Brooks lauds the philosopher's ambition, she prefers her conversations faster and looser -- something, she says, like Arlie Hochschild's description of 'the jazz of human exchange.'"</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Making spreadsheets filled with promising topics to raise with strangers.</answer>
<other>The reviewer states, "But I couldn't hear the jazz in 'Talk''s pages of diagrams and graphs..." and later, "...to make 'spreadsheets filled with promising topics to raise with strangers,' as some of Brooks's students do, would make me feel even less human than I already do." This systematic strategy is contrasted with the "jazz" metaphor.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Using "candidate answers" / curtailing questions by narrowing them down in anticipation.</answer>
<other>The article states, "She also warns about 'candidate answers,' a kind of leading the witness, in which one asks an open-ended question only to narrow it down in anticipation... I realized that I curtail my questions this way all the time; leaving them open has actually expanded the answers I receive."</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Over 9 percent.</answer>
<other>The article mentions: "Managers who were randomly assigned to make one joke in one conversation were over 9 percent more likely to be voted into leadership positions by their teammates."</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Livening up texts by sending Onion headlines to friends and imitating the outsize reactions of "Seinfeld" characters.</answer>
<other>The article states: "Parts of 'Talk' feel designed not to help humans communicate but to train A.I. This is especially evident in the section on levity, which advises 'livening up your texts by sending Onion headlines to your friends' and imitating the outsize reactions of 'Seinfeld' characters."</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Asking</answer>
<other>The article explains the mnemonic: "Topics, Asking, Levity and Kindness. ('Asking' may spoil the parallelism, but had she gone with 'Questions' they would've had to call the book 'Tqlk.')" The implication is that "Tqlk" was not a marketable title, hence "Asking" was chosen over "Questions" despite spoiling parallelism.</other>
