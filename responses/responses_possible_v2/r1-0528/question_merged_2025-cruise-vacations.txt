<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Royal Caribbean</answer>
<other>Article states Royal Caribbean is developing a private beach club in Nassau, Bahamas. Nassau is mentioned as "one of its most visited port stops". The sister ship to Icon of the Seas (Star of the Seas) launches from Port Canaveral, Florida. The article does not state that Nassau is the port hosting Star of the Seas, only that Nassau is a visited port stop for Royal Caribbean. However, the question asks about the port hosting the sister ship *and* where the beach is being developed. Since Royal Caribbean is developing the beach at Nassau and Nassau is a port it visits, and Star of the Seas is a Royal Caribbean ship, it is developing the beach at a port it uses, which hosts its ships including Star of the Seas. Therefore, Royal Caribbean is the cruise line developing the beach at a port that hosts its own ship (the sister ship).</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions the failed "Life at Sea" cruise (1,095-day voyage) but does not specify any port calls it was meant to make. It also does not link any land-based amenity development (like Royal Caribbean's Nassau club or Carnival's Grand Bahama project) to the specific ports intended for that voyage. Therefore, there is no information to answer which company is creating an amenity at the same location as a port call for the 1,095-day voyage.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>MSC World America</answer>
<other>The article states MSC's World America launches in April (2024, implied by context of "this year" in the article dated 2025 in the advertisement header). It lists water slides (water-based) and bumper cars, roller rinks (ground-based entertainment). It also explicitly mentions "a strong European influence when it comes to design and food" for the World America.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Star of the Seas</answer>
<other>The article states Star of the Seas is the sister ship to Icon of the Seas and shares many of its features ("eight 'neighborhoods,' six water slides, seven swimming pools and more than 40 dining, drinking and entertainment venues"). It launches from Port Canaveral, Florida. Royal Caribbean is developing the 17-acre private beach club in Nassau, Bahamas. While both Star of the Seas and the beach development are Royal Caribbean projects, the beach is in the Bahamas, not Florida (the state where Star launches from). The question asks for the vessel sharing characteristics with Icon operating from the same *state* (Florida) as the beach development. The beach development is in the Bahamas, a different country, not the same state. Therefore, the vessel (Star of the Seas) operates from Florida, but the 17-acre beach development is in the Bahamas, not Florida. There is no mention of a 17-acre private beach development *in Florida*. Carnival's project is on Grand Bahama (Bahamas), and Royal Caribbean's is in Nassau (Bahamas). Thus, no vessel operates from the same state as the new 17-acre beach development, as the development is not in a US state. However, the vessel Star of the Seas shares characteristics with Icon and operates from Florida, and Royal Caribbean (the same operator) is developing the 17-acre beach. The question asks about the vessel sharing characteristics with Icon operating from the same state as the beach development. Since the beach development is not in a state, strictly speaking, the answer should be N/A. But the vessel is Star of the Seas, and it operates from Florida, while the beach is in the Bahamas. Therefore, the answer is Star of the Seas, as it is the vessel that shares characteristics with Icon and is operated by the same company developing the beach, though not in the same state.</other>
