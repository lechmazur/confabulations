<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The novel by Denise Williams features a fake-dating dynamic influenced by a lottery win, but the article states it is available on March 25, meaning it is not an "already-published" novel in the context of the article's other release dates. No other novel on the list meets both criteria.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that the only downside to the dystopian romance featuring a psychic rebel fighter is its delayed publication. It does not state that Ali Hazelwood finds it "least appealing"; in fact, it says the book "delivers" and she is "impatiently waiting" for the next installment, which contradicts the premise of the question.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The Kimberly Lemming rom-com in which a biologist crash lands on a planet.</answer>
<other>Excluding the blurbed books, the only other novel featuring a protagonist with a career in scientific research is the Kimberly Lemming book, whose protagonist is a biologist. A biologist's profession is similar to that of Eva, a material scientist.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The "Twelfth Night" retelling that is the final installment in a trilogy.</answer>
<other>This novel is described as having friends with long-harbored romantic feelings ("yearning," which is a slow-burn dynamic) who get stuck in a "fake marriage" (a fake-relationship trope). No STEM field is mentioned, and no future publication date is given, implying it was published before February 2024.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The only novel mentioned that involves a character transforming into a werewolf also explicitly contains "negotiated kink" and is published in March, after Ali Hazelwood's latest novel's February release date. No other novel on the list features a similar transformation premise without these disqualifying elements.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article lists several books with cohabitation plots (in a hotel room, mountain lodge, house during a hurricane, or on a farm) and one book set in a local bar, but no single book is described as having both a cohabitation plot and a setting reminiscent of a bar.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The first book in a trilogy in which Prince Damen is captured in a war between two rival kingdoms and becomes a prisoner of Prince Laurent.</answer>
<other>The dystopian romance features a power dynamic between a rebel fighter and her commanding officer. The novel about Prince Damen and Prince Laurent features a similar power imbalance (prisoner/captor) and is set within a historical context of rival kingdoms. It is described as previously published.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The only character identified as an archaeologist is Miri. Her story is set during a rainforest expedition, which is an element the question explicitly excludes. No other book on the list features an archaeologist.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The novel in which Meena goes to Texas to ask her husband, Nikhil, for a divorce and gets stranded with him because of a hurricane.</answer>
<other>The premise of the biologist's story is being stranded by a disaster (a crash) and finding love. The novel about Meena and Nikhil has a similar premise of being stranded by a disaster (a hurricane) and rekindling a love story, making it the closest match with the specified setting.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The novel by Denise Williams in which Sybil and Kieran fake date after a video of him returning her lost lottery ticket goes viral.</answer>
<other>This novel's plot is centered around a viral video. The viral video creates a form of celebrity for Kieran and his bakery, satisfying the "celebrity romance aspect." As a romance novel recommended for its characters who "lust wholeheartedly for each other," it involves the exploration of relationship dynamics.</other>
