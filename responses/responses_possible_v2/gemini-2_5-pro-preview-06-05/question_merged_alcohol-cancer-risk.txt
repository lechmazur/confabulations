<other>I will analyze each question and find the answer solely from the provided article.

For question 1, I will look for the cancer type with the highest relative risk increase for light drinkers. The article mentions a 2013 study that found a 30% higher chance for esophageal cancer, 17% for oral cavity and pharynx, and 5% for breast cancer. The highest is 30% for esophageal cancer.

For question 2, I need to calculate a precise percentage increase in breast cancer risk for women drinking two drinks daily compared to the reference group. The risk for two drinks daily is 15.3%. The risk for the reference group is "About 11 in 100". The word "About" makes the base value imprecise, so a "precise" calculation is not possible. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

For question 3, I need to find the weekly volume of wine corresponding to a 19% lifetime risk of any alcohol-related cancer in women. The article states this risk level corresponds to "one alcoholic drink each day (seven drinks a week)". A standard drink of wine is defined as a "5-ounce glass". So, 7 drinks/week * 5 ounces/drink equals 35 ounces per week.

For question 4, I will calculate the difference in absolute lifetime risk for any alcohol-related cancer between men and women at the different consumption levels provided.
- Less than one drink/week: 17% (women) - 10% (men) = 7 percentage point gap.
- One drink/day: 19% (women) - 11% (men) = 8 percentage point gap.
- Two drinks/day: "nearly 22 percent" (women) - 13% (men) = ~9 percentage point gap.
The maximum gap is at the "two drinks per day" level.

For question 5, I need to find a cancer type that is on the risk list for both light and heavy drinking and is also linked to a compound risk with smoking. The article lists "mouth", "pharynx", "breast", and "esophageal" cancers for light drinking. It lists "mouth", "oropharynx", "larynx", "esophagus", and "breast" for heavy drinking. The overlap includes mouth, pharynx/oropharynx, breast, and esophagus. The article states that smoking and drinking compound the risk for "head and neck cancers". Mouth and pharynx are head and neck cancers. Breast cancer is not. Esophageal cancer is not explicitly defined as a head and neck cancer in the text. Between mouth and pharynx, "mouth" is listed identically in both the light and heavy drinking sections, making it a clear candidate.

For question 6, I need to find the daily volume of liquor associated with a 13.1% lifetime risk of breast cancer. The article states this risk level is for those who consume "one alcoholic drink each day". A standard drink of liquor is defined as "a 1.5-ounce shot". Therefore, the volume is 1.5 ounces daily.</other>
