<other>I will analyze each question and find the answer solely from the provided article. I will be careful to answer "N/A" if the information is not present or cannot be directly inferred.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>No</answer>
<other>The article states that Husk Power Systems, the company that provided power to Mwajuma Mohamed's village, left Tanzania because the government insisted it sell electricity at a low, subsidized price. The energy minister, Doto Biteko, defended this policy. If this policy had been in place when Husk arrived, it is logical to infer they would not have set up operations, and therefore Mwajuma Mohamed would not have received power from them, and her television would not be functional.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that the company (Husk) has built 70 operational minigrids in Nigeria. The country known for its "Bulldozer" president is Tanzania. The article does not provide any information to suggest that an event in Nigeria would affect Tanzania.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Tanesco</answer>
<other>The village chairman, Gesenda Mwise Gesenda, is quoted as saying, "With Tanesco, it actually costs me three times as much for the same amount of power." This directly attributes the higher cost to the state-run utility, Tanesco.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The village chairman's current electricity connection is with Tanesco, the state-run utility, which is "mostly supplied by hydropower and fossil fuels." The "main enabling factor" mentioned is the low cost of solar panels. The article does not provide a link between the cost of solar panels and the price of electricity from Tanzania's existing hydro and fossil fuel grid.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>One</answer>
<other>The article states that Mashavu Ali "was above all excited for one of her daughters, who had the best grades in the village secondary school. She imagined her studying late into the night." It only mentions one daughter in this context.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Less</answer>
<other>The article states that Gesenda Mwise Gesenda's electricity from the state-run utility, Tanesco, "actually costs me three times as much for the same amount of power" compared to what he had with Husk. A regulatory environment like Nigeria's is described as "receptive" and is where Husk is thriving. If Tanzania adopted such a policy, it would allow a company like Husk to operate, and based on the chairman's statement, his costs would be lower.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The person in question, Gesenda Mwise Gesenda, uses a Tanesco connection, which is supplied by hydropower and fossil fuels. The "main enabling factor" is the low cost of solar panels. The article does not state that U.S. hostility towards cheap solar would affect the electricity costs of Tanzania's non-solar state utility.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>No</answer>
<other>The article states that Tanzania's national utility, Tanesco, provides "inferior" service with "frequent and lengthy power cuts." When Tanesco's grid did arrive in Matipwili, it served "only a quarter as many people" as Husk had. Mwajuma Mohamed's house is described as "darkened" after Husk left, implying she is not one of the people who received a Tanesco connection. Therefore, in the hypothetical scenario where only the Tanesco grid was extended, she would likely not have power, and her TV would not be functional.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Later</answer>
<other>The article states that Husk left Tanzania due to a regulatory issue (being forced to sell at a subsidized price). If the president had prioritized regulatory reform that allowed private companies to compete, Husk would likely have stayed. The article says that without electricity, Mashavu Ali's "children go to bed soon after the sun sets." With electricity, she imagined her daughter "studying late into the night." Therefore, with the electricity that regulatory reform would have likely preserved, the children would go to bed later.</other>
