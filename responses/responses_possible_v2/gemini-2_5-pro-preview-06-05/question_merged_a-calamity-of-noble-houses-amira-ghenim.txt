<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article describes Tahar Haddad's fictional portrayal and the themes of Han Kang's "We Do Not Part," but it provides no information to logically connect the two or identify an "ironic mirroring."</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Mhammed</answer>
<other>The article states the novel uses "Rashomon-like testimonies" to "speculate on guilt and innocence," which would inherently create reasonable doubt. It also details Mhammed's complex internal state (sexual abuse, closeted homosexuality, desperation for approval), which would provide significant material for a defense, making him the most challenging character to prosecute.</other>

<answer>Hind's testimony</answer>
<other>The article describes the "Renaissance" in African publishing as "changing the stories told about the region." Hind's character, speaking in 2013, is determined to expose "secret histories -- whether a family's or a nation's" so they are not "allowed to fester unexposed." This modern perspective focused on re-examining the past to shape the future best represents a changing narrative.</other>
