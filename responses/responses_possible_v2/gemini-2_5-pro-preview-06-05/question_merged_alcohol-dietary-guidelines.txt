<other>I will analyze the question and the provided article. The question asks for a concise directive that might be included in new dietary guidelines, based on a hypothetical scenario described in the question. I need to find if the article suggests such a directive. The last sentence of the article states that a new report "may set the stage for dietary guidelines that say something truly new: Drink less." This phrase directly answers the question.</other>
