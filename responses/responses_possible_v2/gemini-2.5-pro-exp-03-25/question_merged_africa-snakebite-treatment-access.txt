<answer>Antivenoms must be tailored to specific snake species and their unique venom composition, which varies geographically; Indian antivenoms are developed for prevalent local species like kraits and are therefore ineffective against the different venom composition of Kenyan puff adders.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The presence of distinct, dangerous toxin families like neurotoxins (from cobras, mambas) and those destroying blood-clotting factors (from puff adders) in different snake species, combined with the limitations of current antivenoms (species/region-specificity, potential for allergic reactions), necessitates developing broadly effective treatments like monoclonal antibody cocktails targeting these key toxin types for a more universal solution.</answer>

<answer>During the rainy season, flooding forces snakes from holes, increasing encounters. During hot, dry seasons, snakes seek food (rats, poultry, eggs) and water near human settlements. These seasonal activities increase risk for farmers and rural residents living in dilapidated homes, sleeping on floors, using outdoor toilets, or walking barefoot, creating risk peaks during these specific times.</answer>

<answer>Interventions like tourniquets, intended to stop venom spread, paradoxically worsen outcomes by cutting off blood supply and leading to amputations, while the use of ineffective traditional treatments can delay patients from seeking effective hospital care, further compromising outcomes due to exceeding the critical time window for antivenom administration.</answer>
