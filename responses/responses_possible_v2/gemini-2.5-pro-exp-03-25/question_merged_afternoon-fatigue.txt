<other>The article mentions Dr. Stephen Justin Thomas stating the dip is "normal physiology" and "everybody has this dip". Dr. Alon Avidan, a professor of neurology, also explains the normal dip but notes extreme sleepiness could indicate a problem. However, Dr. Thomas's statement most directly contradicts the idea that the *typical* afternoon sleepiness is inherently a sign of a medical condition requiring immediate attention, even though his specific title isn't given as "neurological scientist". Dr. Avidan, the neurologist, explains the normal dip, implying it's not necessarily a medical condition unless extreme. Given the constraint to pick a neurological scientist, Dr. Avidan is the best fit, as he explains the normal mechanism while also providing context for when it might be concerning.</other>
