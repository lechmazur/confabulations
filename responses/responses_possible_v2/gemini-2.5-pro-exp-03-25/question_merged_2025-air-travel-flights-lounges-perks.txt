<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions United raising thresholds and Alaska expanding premium seating on over 200 aircraft. Christine Chung wrote the article which mentions these airlines and Yogyakarta. However, no single airline is described as doing *both* raising thresholds *and* expanding seating on 200+ aircraft.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Private security lane</answer>
<other>The article states that eligible travelers at JFK and LAX can use a "private security lane that leads them directly to the lounge," bypassing the main security checkpoint. This is mentioned in the section discussing Delta lounges and Christine Chung, the reporter.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>Emirates introduced premium economy on refurbished Boeing 777s in the U.S. Venice is the European city described as loved by Joseph Brodsky. The article does not state whether Emirates operates in regions adjacent to Venice.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Quebec City</answer>
<other>The article describes Quebec City as "evolving" despite resisting linguistic changes. The same article mentions Alaska Airlines adding 250,000 first-class seats and Southwest Airlines retrofitting planes for premium economy.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The Delta section mentions "semi-private check-in spaces" as an exclusive feature. The private security lanes bypass the main security checkpoint. Check-in typically occurs before security. A private security lane does not necessarily make a semi-private check-in space functionally redundant, as they address different parts of the airport process (check-in vs. security screening).</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions both JetBlue (at JFK) and American Airlines (in Philadelphia) opening lounges on the East Coast in 2025, creating a geographic contrast with Yogyakarta. However, the question asks for a singular "airline," and the text provides two airlines fitting the criteria without a basis to choose one over the other.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Achieving elite status for upgrades becomes harder overall while the availability of upgrade seats may increase on specific airlines.</answer>
<other>United raising thresholds makes status harder to get. Alaska adding many premium/first seats could make upgrades easier on that airline, as the article notes. This creates a paradoxical situation where status is harder to earn, but upgrade seats might be more plentiful on certain carriers.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states British Airways is implementing a revenue-based loyalty program and Emirates is expanding premium cabins on select U.S. routes. These are two different carriers. No single carrier is mentioned as doing both simultaneously.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions Frontier adding first class, Southwest expanding premium economy, and Alaska adding premium/first seats. It describes Quebec City as both "frozen in time" and "evolving." The airline market trend towards premiumization across segments represents evolution and blurring lines, which seems analogous, not contradictory, to the description of Quebec City as a place balancing tradition and evolution. The premise of contradiction is not supported by the text.</other>
