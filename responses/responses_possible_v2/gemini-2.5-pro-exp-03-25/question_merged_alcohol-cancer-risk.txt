<other>Analyzing the article for Question 1. The question asks for the cancer type with the highest percentage increase in relative risk for light drinkers vs non-drinkers. The 2013 study cited states: 30% higher chance for esophageal cancer, 17% higher for oral cavity and pharynx, 5% higher for breast cancer. 30% is the highest figure given for relative risk increase in light drinkers.</other>

<other>Analyzing the article for Question 2. The question asks for the precise percentage increase in lifetime breast cancer risk for women drinking two drinks daily compared to the reference group (<1 drink/week). The reference group risk is "about 11 in 100 women" (11%). The risk at two drinks daily is 15.3%. The absolute increase is 15.3% - 11% = 4.3 percentage points. The percentage increase is (4.3 / 11) * 100 ≈ 39.1%. However, the article does not explicitly state this percentage increase calculation or result. It only provides the absolute risk figures (11% and 15.3%) based on the Australian study analysis. Given the instruction to only use facts directly stated or logically inferred without performing calculations not present, and the fact that the article *does* explicitly state percentage increases from a different study (the 2013 Annals of Oncology study), it's safer to conclude the specific percentage increase requested is not provided for the Australian study data comparison.</other>

<other>Analyzing the article for Question 3. The question asks for the weekly volume of wine corresponding to a 19% lifetime risk of any alcohol-related cancer in women. The article states this risk level (19%) occurs among those consuming "one alcoholic drink each day (seven drinks a week)". A standard drink is defined as "a 5-ounce glass of wine". Therefore, seven drinks per week equals 7 * 5 ounces = 35 ounces of wine per week.</other>

<answer>35 ounces per week</answer>
<other>Analyzing the article for Question 4. The question asks at which daily consumption level the absolute lifetime risk difference between men and women for any alcohol-related cancer is maximum.
Level <1 drink/week: Women 17%, Men 10%. Difference = 7 points.
Level 1 drink/day: Women 19%, Men 11%. Difference = 8 points.
Level 2 drinks/day: Women "nearly 22%", Men 13%. Difference ≈ 9 points.
Level 4+ drinks/day: No comparable absolute risk figures provided for both sexes.
Based on the provided figures, the maximum difference (approx. 9 percentage points) occurs at the "Two drinks per day" level.</other>

<other>Analyzing the article for Question 5. The question asks for a cancer type mentioned for both light and heavy drinking, and also linked to compound risk with smoking.
Light drinking risks mentioned: mouth, pharynx, breast.
Heavy drinking risks mentioned: mouth, oropharynx, larynx, esophagus, breast, colorectal, liver, stomach, gall bladder, pancreas.
Common to both: Mouth/pharynx/oropharynx, breast, esophagus (esophagus mentioned in 2013 study for light drinking).
Compound risk with smoking: "head and neck cancers" (includes mouth, pharynx, larynx).
Mouth/pharynx cancers fit all three criteria: mentioned under light drinking, heavy drinking (as mouth/oropharynx), and fall under head/neck cancers compounded by smoking.</other>

<answer>Mouth cancer</answer>
<other>Analyzing the article for Question 6. The question asks for the precise daily volume of liquor corresponding to a 13.1% lifetime risk of breast cancer. The article states this risk level (13.1%) occurs at "one alcoholic drink each day". A standard drink is defined as "a 1.5-ounce shot of liquor". Therefore, one drink per day corresponds to 1.5 ounces of liquor daily.</other>
