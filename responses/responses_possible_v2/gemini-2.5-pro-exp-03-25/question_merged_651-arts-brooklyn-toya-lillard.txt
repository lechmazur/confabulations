<answer>Mikki Shepard</answer>
<other>Processing Question 2: The question asks for an artistic director inspired by 651, creating work about defying gravity and male vulnerability. Andre Zachery fits the description of the work ("Against Gravity", defying physical forces, movement workshops exploring vulnerability) and being inspired by 651. However, the article explicitly calls him a "choreographer", not an "artistic director". Following the strict instructions to answer only the exact question based solely on the text, and the text not identifying him as an artistic director, the answer must be N/A.</other>

<other>Processing Question 3: The question asks for an artistic director creating work about Chicago history, using a female poet's view on male archetypes, in the new space. Again, this describes Andre Zachery's work "Against Gravity". It covers Chicago history, uses Gwendolyn Brooks (female poet), examines three male archetypes, and is in the new 651 space. However, as with Question 2, the article identifies Zachery as a "choreographer", not an "artistic director". Therefore, the answer is N/A.</other>

<other>Processing Question 5: The question asks for a performance piece combining Virginia Hamilton's folk tales and Chicago's 1980s challenges, presented in 651's first owned space. The article describes "Against Gravity" as drawing on Hamilton's "The People Could Fly", addressing the 1980s ("crack and AIDS"), and premiering in the new space, which is 651's "first home of its own".</other>

<other>Processing Question 6: The question asks for a Brooklyn-based artist exploring flight/survival via history, performing where 651 Arts began responding to community needs. Andre Zachery is a "Brooklyn choreographer". His work "Against Gravity" explores flight and survival through history. The new space is near Fort Greene, where the community call originated. Thus, he fits the description.</other>

<other>Processing Question 7: The question asks for an artistic work about three male archetypes from Chicago history, presented in the space resulting from the move from 651 Fulton to 10 Lafayette.
