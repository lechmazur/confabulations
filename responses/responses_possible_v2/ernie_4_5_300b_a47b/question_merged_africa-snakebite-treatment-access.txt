<other>First, I will extract relevant information from the article to answer each question. I will focus only on the provided text and avoid external sources. I will analyze each question and match it with the corresponding details in the article.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The finger blistered, swelled, and turned black despite two antivenom doses because the puff adder's venom destroys blood-clotting factors, causing slow, gruesome deaths with bleeding in the brain, eyes, and mouth, and the antivenom arrived too late to prevent tissue necrosis.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Indian-manufactured antivenom is ineffective against Kenyan puff adder bites because antivenoms from one country often don't work on snakebites in another, as venom varies by region, age, diet, and season, and Indian antivenoms are made for kraits, not black mambas or puff adders.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The development of monoclonal antibodies targeting neurotoxins and hemotoxins is necessary because each snake species produces a special blend of dozens of toxins, and even within a species, venom can vary by region, age, diet, and season, making current antivenoms ineffective across different snake populations.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>A spitting cobra's venom delivery method can create diagnostic confusion because it can shoot venom into the eyes from up to five meters away, mimicking non-venomous ocular injuries, and traditional healers may not recognize this as a snakebite, leading to inappropriate treatments.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Seasonal patterns of snake activity in Kenya, such as flooding in the rainy season forcing snakes out of their holes and hot, dry seasons sending snakes in search of food and water, interact with agricultural practices and housing conditions to create distinct temporal risk peaks, particularly for farmers and rural residents.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Black mambas can deliver fatal neurotoxic envenomation more rapidly than puff adders because they have short, erect fangs at the front of the mouth that inject neurotoxins under the skin, paralyzing victims, and their venom is so toxic it can kill within an hour, unlike puff adders, which have long, retractable fangs and venom that destroys blood-clotting factors.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The thermal instability of antivenom, which must be kept cold and sterile, interacts with Kenya's healthcare infrastructure limitations, such as lack of stock in rural areas and delayed hospital admission, to disproportionately affect pregnant snakebite victims, as the critical six-hour treatment window is often missed, leading to catastrophic outcomes like spontaneous abortion and fetal death.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The widespread use of tourniquets and traditional treatments in snakebite management creates a paradoxical outcome where these methods often cause more harm than the bite itself, such as cutting off blood supply and leading to amputations, especially when combined with hospital admission delays and lack of proper antivenom.</answer>
