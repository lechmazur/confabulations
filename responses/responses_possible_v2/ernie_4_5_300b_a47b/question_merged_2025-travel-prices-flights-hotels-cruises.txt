<other>First, I will analyze the article to identify key trends in each travel segment: airfares, hotels, and cruises. The article mentions that domestic airfares are rising, economy hotels are holding steady, and cruise lines are offering incentives rather than price cuts. International airfares have fallen, particularly in Asia and the Caribbean. Luxury hotels are doing better than economy hotels. Cruise ships are nearly full, and prices are high, with incentives like prepaid gratuities being offered. Now, I will proceed to answer each question based on these observations.</other>
