<other>Analyzing Question 1: The article mentions incomplete data (missing early/mail-in) led to exclusion from the map, but doesn't name a visualization method rejected due to this incompleteness. The choropleth method's drawback is not accounting for population, not related to data completeness exclusion.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 2: The article explicitly states the percentage of total votes included on the map.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>73 percent</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 3: The article does not identify a specific individual responsible for parsing PDF data, especially one other than Wilson Andrews who is excluded by the question's premise.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 4: The question is based on a hypothetical scenario (inverse shading/density) that contradicts the article's description of the choropleth method's drawback (does not account for population). It also links this hypothetical to the complexity of matching boundaries in a way not described in the text.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 5: The article distinguishes the initial "collecting" step from the subsequent "putting data into boundaries" (matching) step. Focusing on areas with perfect alignment would simplify the matching step, not necessarily the initial collection step described as time-consuming.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 6: The drawback mentioned is that the map does not account for population density. Adding data only from least populated counties would provide more examples of this specific drawback being displayed on the map.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>that it does not account for population</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 7: The welcomed submissions are for adding missing data or notifying of inaccuracies. If data is complete, submissions for adding missing data become less crucial.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>adding missing data</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 8: The exclusion of incomplete data (missing early/mail-in) is a limitation of the dataset, not the visualization method. Changing the method doesn't change the fact that some data was excluded.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 9: The article welcomes submissions including "local knowledge and insights" to help create a more accurate map and notify of potential inaccuracies. Local knowledge would be key to understanding boundary discrepancies.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>local knowledge and insights</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 10: The challenge of varying data formats from state/county sources is a fundamental difficulty in collecting the data, independent of the candidates or the comparison year.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>varying formats of data released by different entities</answer>
