<other>Thinking process:
1. Read Question 1.
2. Identify the key elements: energy minister (Doto Biteko), company building minigrids in Nigeria (Husk), Mwajuma Mohamed, functional television.
3. Recall from the article that Doto Biteko justified the pricing policy that led to Husk leaving Tanzania.
4. Recall that Mwajuma Mohamed lost power and her TV became non-functional after Husk left.
5. Infer that if Biteko's policy was in place when Husk entered, Husk would likely not have provided power, thus no functional TV from that source.
6. Formulate the answer based on this inference.

7. Read Question 2.
8. Identify key elements: Rwandan-backed rebels, Goma, 70 operational minigrids, company that left Tanzania (Husk), country with "Bulldozer" president (Tanzania).
9. Recall Husk left Tanzania and has 70 minigrids in Nigeria.
10. Recall Tanzania had a "Bulldozer" president.
11. The question asks which country would be affected if rebels targeted the region with 70 minigrids. This region is in Nigeria.
12. The "Bulldozer" president information is about Tanzania, not Nigeria.
13. The country affected by targeting the 70 minigrids is Nigeria.
14. Formulate the answer.

15. Read Question 3.
16. Identify key elements: state-run utility (Tanesco), country where developer exited (Tanzania), tripled cost hypothetical, less than departed company (Husk) charged hypothetical, entity responsible for higher cost, village chairman (Gesenda Mwise Gesenda).
17. Recall the chairman's statement: Tanesco costs him three times as much as Husk did.
18. The hypothetical contradicts the chairman's statement about relative costs.
19. The question asks who the chairman says is responsible for the *higher cost* he is currently paying.
20. The chairman explicitly states Tanesco costs him three times as much, attributing the higher cost to Tanesco.
21. Formulate the answer based on the chairman's statement in the article.

22. Read Question 4.
23. Identify key elements: Rockefeller Foundation leader (Raj Shah), primary drivers ("tech and pricing"), technology taking less time to deploy (solar), main enabling factor (plummeting cost of solar from China), unavailability hypothetical, village chairman (Gesenda Mwise Gesenda), cost of current connection (Tanesco).
24. Recall the chairman uses Tanesco.
25. Recall the main enabling factor relates to solar power costs.
26. The article does not provide information linking the global cost/availability of solar to the pricing of Tanzania's state-run utility (Tanesco), which has its own described issues (loss, maintenance).
27. Cannot infer the impact on Tanesco cost.
28. Formulate the answer as N/A.

29. Read Question 5.
30. Identify key elements: "compacts" correlate with receptive environment, Husk's current focus (Nigeria), daughters of Mashavu Ali, studying late, village in country where Husk is most active (Nigeria).
31. Recall Mashavu Ali is a mother of eight, mentions *one* daughter with best grades, imagined *her* studying late.
32. The article does not state the total number of daughters Mashavu Ali has.
33. Cannot determine how many daughters she has, let alone how many would be studying late.
34. Formulate the answer as N/A.

35. Read Question 6.
36. Identify key elements: unnamed energy minister from Tanzania (Doto Biteko), policy mirroring Nigeria's receptive environment, fastest minigrid developer (Husk), Gesenda Mwise Gesenda, spend more or less on refrigeration, constant consumption.
37. Recall the chairman uses Tanesco and it costs three times as much as Husk did.
38. Recall Husk left Tanzania due to regulations and thrives in Nigeria due to a receptive environment.
39. Infer that mirroring Nigeria's environment would allow Husk (or similar) to operate in Tanzania.
40. Infer that if Husk (or similar) operated, the chairman could potentially access power at a lower price than Tanesco's current price.
41. Formulate the answer.

42. Read Question 7.
43. Identify key elements: World Bank president (Ajay Banga), conversation with African leaders, plummeting solar cost from China, U.S. administration hostile to main enabling factor (plummeting solar cost), person using Tanesco (Gesenda Mwise Gesenda), increase or decrease in electricity costs.
44. Recall the person using Tanesco is Gesenda Mwise Gesenda.
45. Recall the main enabling factor is related to solar costs.
46. Recall the U.S. is the biggest World Bank contributor.
47. The article does not provide information linking U.S. policy on solar or World Bank funding issues to the specific pricing of Tanzania's state-run utility (Tanesco).
48. Cannot infer the impact on Tanesco cost.
49. Formulate the answer as N/A.

50. Read Question 8.
51. Identify key elements: Rockefeller Foundation prioritizing grid extension over minigrids, state of Tanzania's national utility (Tanesco), first appliance purchased by Mwajuma Mohamed (TV), likely functional today.
52. Recall Mwajuma Mohamed's TV was functional with Husk but not after Husk left.
53. Recall Tanesco service in Matipwili is inferior with frequent and lengthy power cuts.
54. Recall Rockefeller Foundation's Ashvin Dayal notes grid extension is often not beneficial compared to minigrids.
55. If Rockefeller prioritized grid extension, it might mean less minigrid development and potentially more grid extension.
56. However, the question asks about the functionality *today*, given Tanesco's current state.
57. Tanesco's state (inferior service, frequent cuts) makes a TV unlikely to be consistently functional.
58. Formulate the answer.

59. Read Question 9.
60. Identify key elements: ideal market conditions for Husk in Tanzania, current status of left-behind minigrids, "Bulldozer" president (John Magufuli), prioritizing regulatory reform over infrastructure development, children in Matipwili, going to bed earlier or later.
61. Recall Husk left due to regulatory issues (pricing).
62. Recall children in Matipwili go to bed early without power.
63. Recall having power allows children to study/stay up later.
64. Infer that if the president prioritized regulatory reform, Husk might have stayed, providing power.
65. Infer that having power would allow children to go to bed later.
66. Formulate the answer.
