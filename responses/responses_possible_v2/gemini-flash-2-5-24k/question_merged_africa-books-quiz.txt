<other>The user wants me to answer nine questions based *only* on the provided article. I need to extract the specific information requested for each question and format the output strictly using the specified tags: `<question_number>`, `<answer>`, and `<other>`. I must answer every question, even if the answer is "N/A". I must not use external knowledge. I must not repeat the questions. I must not include any text outside the specified tags.

Reviewing the article, it presents several quiz questions about books and their settings in African countries. For each quiz question, it provides a description and multiple-choice options, but it *does not provide the correct answer* to any of these quiz questions within the text.

Question 1 asks to identify a country based on a list of writers (Achebe, Soyinka, etc.) and a mention of Okorafor. The article lists the writers and asks "Which country is it?" with options, but doesn't state the answer. It mentions Okorafor separately. I cannot identify the country from the text alone.
Question 2 asks to identify a North African country based on a regime timeline (until 2011) and options. The article provides the description and options but not the answer.
Question 3 asks to identify a country based on bordering South Africa and Botswana and options. The article provides the hint and options but not the answer.
Question 4 asks to identify a country whose capital is Addis Ababa and is the setting for a novel, based on options. The article provides the description and options but not the answer.
Question 5 asks to identify a West African country formerly called Gold Coast, independent in 1957, and setting for a novel, based on options. The article provides the description and options but not the answer.
Question 6 asks to identify the nation from question 2 (oppressive regime until 2011) to contrast with literary renewal. Since I cannot identify the nation in question 2, I cannot answer this.
Question 7 asks to identify the West African country from question 5 (formerly Gold Coast, independent 1957, setting for novel). This is the same as question 5. The article provides the description and options but not the answer.
Question 8 asks to identify the country from question 3 (borders South Africa and Botswana, setting for novel). This is the same as question 3. The article provides the hint and options but not the answer.
Question 9 asks to identify the country from question 2 (oppressive regime until 2011, setting for novel). This is the same as question 2. The article provides the description and options but not the answer.

Based *solely* on the provided text, I cannot answer any of the questions that require identifying a specific country from the quiz options, as the article does not provide the correct answers to its own quiz questions. Therefore, all answers will be "N/A".</other>
