<question_number>1</question_number>
<other>The question asks for a tangible strategy used by Othuke Anthony Ominiabohs (founder of Masobe Books, name translates to "Let us read") to boost sales, beyond workshops, that could mirror cross-continental reach, like "Nearly All the Men in Lagos Are Mad". The article lists his strategies: collaborating with a pharmacy chain and other businesses, engaging social media influencers, convening a book club, and giving discounts to bookstores. All are tangible. Collaborating with businesses is a specific, non-traditional partnership mentioned.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<other>The question asks about a West African publisher focused on French/English translations who wants to translate into Wolof, as a potential partner for a Wolof translation of Dangarembga's book. The article mentions Sulaiman Adebowale of Amalion Publishing in Senegal, who translates from/to English and French and is looking to translate into Wolof and Hausa.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<other>The question asks for a non-traditional promotional method used by Othuke Anthony Ominiabohs (founder of Masobe Books) that could be adapted for BookStorm's children's books, excluding festivals and considering the success of "Sweet Sixteen" (which was curriculum-based, not an Ominiabohs method). Ominiabohs' methods include collaborating with businesses, social media influencers, book clubs, and bookstore discounts. Collaborating with businesses is a non-traditional promotional method.</other>

The article states Lola Shoneyin (novelist, founder of Ake festival) is leading BookStorm, a project to train people on children's book publication.</other>
<answer>BookStorm</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<other>The question asks for the type of literary work, exemplified by a Masobe title acquired by HarperCollins ("A Broken People's Playlist"), that Jahazi Press might aim for with new Kenyan talent, ignoring "Let Us Conspire and Other Stories" and Jahazi's initial focus on acquiring rights. The article identifies "A Broken People's Playlist" as a "story collection".</other>
<answer>Story collection</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<other>The question asks for a specific language (spoken by millions in West Africa, targeted by a Senegalese publisher) as a potential market for translated works like Dangarembga's novel, disregarding "Animal Farm" and considering cultural heritage. The article mentions Sulaiman Adebowale is looking to translate into "Wolof and Hausa", both spoken by millions in West Africa. The question asks for *which specific language*, but lists two options without specifying one. I cannot logically infer which single language is the correct answer.</other>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<other>The question asks for an audio platform mentioned for publicizing radio dramas that could collaborate with Masobe Books (publisher of "A Broken People's Playlist") to expand reach, excluding BookStorm and considering digital strategies. The article mentions "Audio platforms like Genti and AkooBooks are publicizing African radio dramas". The question asks for *what audio platform*, but lists two options without specifying one. I cannot logically infer which single platform is the correct answer.</other>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<other>The question asks for a specific collaborative approach advocated by the Doek festival founder (Remy Ngamije) for overcoming industry constraints (inflation, piracy), echoing inter-publisher support, besides the festival's role in connecting people. Remy Ngamije states the way to solve constraints is "for those working in the industry across Africa to be in solidarity with one another, and to face them together."</other>
<answer>Solidarity with one another</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<other>The question asks for a specific business partnership used by Othuke Anthony Ominiabohs (computer scientist turned publisher) that Ahmed Aidarus (founder of Prestige Bookshop) could leverage for new Kenyan authors, ignoring Wanner's publication and focusing on local audiences. Ominiabohs uses "collaborating with a pharmacy chain and other businesses" as a strategy to drive sales.</other>
<answer>Collaborating with a pharmacy chain and other businesses</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<other>The question asks which challenge faced by Othuke Anthony Ominiabohs after self-publication ("Odufa: A Lover's Tale") might have been mitigated if children in Kaduna were exposed via digital strategies of young self-publishers (reaching new readers), instead of Western picture books. Ominiabohs' challenges were "how to promote the book and make money from it." Digital strategies like reaching new readers directly address the challenge of promotion.</other>
