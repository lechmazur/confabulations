<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Tourniquet‑induced ischemia compounded by cytotoxic/hemotoxic tissue destruction and delayed antivenom, leading to irreversible necrosis (gangrene) of the finger</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Venom composition varies by species and region; Indian antivenoms target Indian species (e.g., kraits) and thus don’t neutralize Kenyan puff adder toxins</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Neurotoxins (cobras/mambas) plus hemotoxins that destroy clotting (puff adders), alongside animal‑derived antivenoms’ species/region specificity and allergy risk, driving mAbs against both toxin families</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Ocular venom spray mimics non‑venomous eye injuries, and victims often don’t see the snake and first seek traditional healers, fostering misdiagnosis and delayed antivenom</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Rainy‑season flooding pushes snakes into fields, spiking risk for farmers/field workers; hot, dry seasons draw snakes into homes for water/food, raising risk for rural households (people sleeping on floors, children)</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Front‑placed short erect fangs for rapid injection; neurotoxic venom causing swift paralysis; extremely high toxicity capable of killing within an hour</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Cold‑chain dependence plus rural stock and training gaps delay IV antivenom beyond the six‑hour window, worsening the already catastrophic maternal–fetal outcomes of pregnancy snakebite</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Tourniquets and traditional remedies paradoxically increase amputations and severity by causing ischemia and delaying hospital antivenom while venom continues systemic/local damage</answer>
