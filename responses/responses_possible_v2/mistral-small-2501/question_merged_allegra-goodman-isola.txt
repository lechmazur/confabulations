<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Marguerite's financial status under Roberval's management and the material conditions described during her island exile that reveal his true priorities. Marguerite is 20. Roberval's secretary, Auguste, is Marguerite's one balm on the filthy, turbulent ship. He is gentle and intelligent, prone to crises of doubt that intrigue her. Two truths are not in question: that he is not loyal to Roberval, and that he deeply loves Marguerite. Their furtive meetings -- the ship is packed with rats, in both senses -- enrage Marguerite's guardian, though he is slow to mete out his punishment. "As always," she reflects, "he allowed me the illusion I was free." The ultimate penalty is appalling. Roberval strands the couple and Damienne on an unsettled island in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, allowing them only what they can carry. They scrabble together a shelter, and fashion a mattress made of peat. A flock of birds ensure they do not starve: "Ravenous, we sniffed flesh roasting and watched skin crackle in the flames, and when, at last, the bird was ready, we savored breast, wings, back, every bit." Ironically, this exile affords the couple a version of the freedom they desired -- a life that feels almost Edenic, despite its painful beginnings. "This place is a strange lesson," Marguerite concedes. "We ate fresh meat but slept outside, as beggars did at home. We had property and yet we were impoverished. On this island, we were rulers and our own subjects too."</answer>
