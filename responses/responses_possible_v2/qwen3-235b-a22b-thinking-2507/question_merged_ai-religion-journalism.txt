<other>For question 1, the article mentions Jay Cooper as a pastor in Austin, Texas who questioned if God can speak through AI and focused on theological dilemmas.

<other>For question 5, the reporter states he "tried using A.I. clones to fix my dating life," indicating personal difficulties in dating.
