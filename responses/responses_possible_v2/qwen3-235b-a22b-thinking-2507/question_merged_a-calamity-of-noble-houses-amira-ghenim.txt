<other>The article provides factual information about "A Calamity of Noble Houses" and mentions other books/titles in passing (e.g., "We Do Not Part," "Presumed Guilty," "Useful Phrases for Immigrants"), but contains no details about the content, themes, or narratives of those other works beyond their titles and authors. All questions ask for specific hypothetical connections, thematic parallels, or creative extrapolations involving elements not described in the article (e.g., what Tahar Haddad would find ironic, how Rusty Sabich would defend a character, what traumatic event Okorafor would explore). Since the article lacks any substantive information about the plots, themes, or narrative techniques of the other books (beyond minimal mentions in the "Back to the Courtroom" section), none of the questions can be answered with facts from the text. The questions require speculation or external knowledge not present in the provided article.</other>
