No additional analysis or inference beyond explicit statements is permitted per instructions.</other>
<other>Question 1 requires identifying a paradoxical social structure contradicting 16th-century hierarchies using specific elements. The article states Marguerite called herself "rulers and subjects" on the island, mentions Roberval's financial manipulations, and quotes the queen about endurance teaching. However, it does not connect these to form or describe any paradoxical social structure contradicting French hierarchies. No such structure is identified in the text.</other>

<other>Question 2 asks about juxtaposition of narrative voices creating tension regarding class identity and primal adaptation. The article notes Marguerite describes bear survival "instructive[ly]" and states "I occasionally wished for a more visceral register" about seabird consumption, but it does not describe her actual descriptions of seabirds as "visceral" nor link this to class identity or primal adaptation. No thematic tension on these points is stated.</other>

<other>Question 3 requests three distinct textual evidence points showing Roberval's punishment was strategically delayed. The article states Roberval was "slow to mete out his punishment" and "allowed me the illusion I was free," but provides only one clear evidence point about delay. It does not offer three distinct points proving strategic psychological control beyond surface appearances.</other>
