<other>For question 1, the article states: "We see Karl Schwarzschild of the Schwarzschild radius, the equation describing the size of a black hole, making his discovery while suffering from painful, chronic skin blisters as a soldier in World War I." This directly matches the question's description.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Karl Schwarzschild</answer>
<other>For question 2, the article states: "we glimpse Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar of the Chandrasekhar limit, a way to identify the stars that might someday become black holes, doing his calculations by starlight on the deck of a steamship bound for Cambridge." Starlight implies nighttime, and the Chandrasekhar limit identifies potential future black holes.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Chandrasekhar limit</answer>
<other>For question 3, the article states: "No wonder Einstein never believed in black holes" and explains that Einstein's theory of general relativity "gave birth to a monster that he never escaped: the black hole." This shows Einstein rejected the implications of his own work.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Albert Einstein</answer>
<other>For question 4, the article's conclusion states black holes are "vibrant, spinning hearts around which star matter whirls, coaxing the growth of galaxies and forming a path for the emergence of planets, even life itself." This directly describes them facilitating planetary formation.</other>

<answer>black holes</answer>
<other>For question 5, the article states that in 2015, gravitational waves from "two black holes 'locked in a death spiral'" were detected, providing "direct proof that black holes exist." The phenomenon observed was gravitational waves.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>gravitational waves</answer>
<other>For question 6, the article mentions "the despair that astronomers felt when the first images from the Hubble Space Telescope came back blurry." This indicates the Hubble Space Telescope initially had image quality issues.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Hubble Space Telescope</answer>
<other>For question 7, the article states: "Karl Schwarzschild of the Schwarzschild radius, the equation describing the size of a black hole." The Schwarzschild radius defines the dimensional parameters.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Schwarzschild radius</answer>
<other>For question 8, the article states: "Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar of the Chandrasekhar limit, a way to identify the stars that might someday become black holes, doing his calculations by starlight on the deck of a steamship." He developed the method during maritime travel.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar</answer>
<other>For question 9, the article explicitly states: "How does the average reader comprehend, for example, that inside a black hole, 'space and time become so distorted that they effectively swap places'?" This is presented as challenging to comprehend.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>space and time swap places</answer>
<other>For question 10, the article describes black holes initially as "the stuff of physicists' nightmares" and "destructive monsters," but concludes they are "vibrant, spinning hearts" that "coaxing the growth of galaxies." The entity transforming is black holes.</other>
