<other>The article discusses Lord Dunmore as the colonial governor who created a "floating town" and issued a proclamation liberating certain enslaved people, with Lawler reevaluating him as complex. The 1777 investigation attributed most Norfolk building destruction to patriots. George Washington condemned Dunmore as "that arch traitor." Dunmore's decision to remove gunpowder led to the floating town. The Ethiopian Regiment wore "Liberty for Slaves" uniforms. The burning of Norfolk occurred on January 1, 1776. Dunmore's Proclamation was issued in November 1775. The lithograph error was dating Washington's image to 1797 instead of 1852. George Washington is the planter discussed. Lund Washington's phrase "Liberty is sweet" encapsulates the paradox.</other>
