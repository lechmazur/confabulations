<other>For question 2, the article states Mike Colter appears in "Evil" (2019-24) but gives no running time for Chester's hypothetical presence in that series. The film "Alarum" has a running time of 1 hour 35 minutes, but this is unrelated to Chester in "Evil".</other>

<other>For question 4, the article references "Black Cinema's Time Revolution" with directors chronicling Black life at a different speed, but does not name a specific genre.

<other>For question 5, the article discusses "The Extravagance of TV Title Sequences" but provides no rating (e.g., score or grade) assigned to them. The film "Alarum" is rated R, but this refers to content restrictions, not a critique of title sequences.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>For question 7, the article states "Alarum" is rated R for violence and surgery, and lists streaming platforms including Disney+ which is known for family-friendly content. Disney+ would be least likely to feature an R-rated film, making this logically inferable from the text.</other>

<other>For question 8, the article describes Tom Green's earlier work as "MTV prank show and surreal brand of comedy". The "sapling-like beauty" critiques serious action, so "surreal comedy" is the incompatible aspect directly stated.</other>

<answer>surreal comedy</answer>
<other>For question 9, the article explicitly states "Alarum" has a running time of "1 hour 35 minutes", which is the duration representing the film's length as metaphorically described in the question.</other>

<answer>1 hour 35 minutes</answer>
<other>For question 10, the article associates Tom Green with "surreal brand of comedy" as his comedic presentation. The "nondescript suits" discussing critical reception would deem this the polar opposite of "Alarum"'s serious action tone, as directly stated.</other>
