<other>Processing question 1: The article states light drinkers (up to one drink per day) had a 30% higher chance of esophageal cancer, 17% for oral cavity/pharynx, and 5% for breast cancer compared to non-drinkers. Esophageal cancer shows the highest percentage increase (30%) and is not the most common alcohol-related cancer in absolute lifetime risk (breast cancer is more common per the article's data).</other>

<answer>esophageal cancer</answer>
<other>Processing question 2: The article provides absolute lifetime breast cancer risks: reference group (less than one drink/week) is 11%, two drinks daily is 15.3%. The question asks for "precise percentage increase" which requires calculation ((15.3-11)/11*100 â‰ˆ 39.1%), but the article does not state this calculated percentage increase anywhere. Only absolute risks are given, so the precise percentage increase is not provided.</other>

<other>Processing question 3: The article states one drink per day (7 drinks/week) corresponds to 19% lifetime risk of any alcohol-related cancer for women. A standard drink of wine is defined as 5 ounces. Weekly wine volume = 7 drinks * 5 ounces = 35 ounces.</other>

<answer>35 ounces</answer>
<other>Processing question 4: Calculating absolute lifetime risk gaps: Reference group (<1/week): women 17% - men 10% = 7% gap. One drink/day: women 19% - men 11% = 8% gap. Two drinks/day: women 22% - men 13% = 9% gap. The gap increases with consumption level, and two drinks/day shows the largest gap (9%) reported in the article. Higher levels aren't compared for gender gap.</other>

<answer>two drinks per day</answer>
<other>Processing question 5: The article lists cancers for light drinking: mouth, pharynx, breast. For heavy drinking (4+ drinks/day): mouth, oropharynx, larynx, esophagus, breast, colorectal, liver, stomach, gall bladder, pancreas. "Oral cavity and pharynx" (light drinking) overlaps with "mouth" and "oropharynx" (heavy drinking). The article also states drinking and smoking compounds risk for head and neck cancers, which includes oral cavity/pharynx.</other>

<other>Processing question 6: The article states one drink per day corresponds to 13.1% lifetime breast cancer risk. A standard drink of liquor is defined as 1.5 ounces. Daily consumption is therefore 1.5 ounces.</other>
