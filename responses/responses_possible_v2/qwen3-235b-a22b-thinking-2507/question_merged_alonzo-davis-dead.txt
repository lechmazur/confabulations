<other>Question 1 asks how participation in Meredith's march indirectly contributed to Brockman Gallery's thematic focus. The article states Davis walked alongside Meredith during the "March Against Fear" in 1966 and that Brockman Gallery was founded in 1967 to showcase artists responding to events like the Watts riots. However, the text does not specify any causal link or indirect contribution between the march participation and the gallery's thematic programming. It only notes the march occurred during their cross-country trip before founding the gallery. No indirect contribution is described, so answer is N/A.</other>

<other>Question 2 asks about contradiction between "Eye on '84" being a multicultural landmark and its fate due to institutional neglect. The article states Davis intended the murals to give "a true picture of Los Angeles as a multicultural community" and be "new landmarks," but they were "covered by graffiti and worn away by freeway pollution, then painted over by the highway authority in 2007," with his triptych "lost forever." The contradiction is that the highway authority (institution) destroyed the very multicultural landmark it was commissioned to display.</other>

<answer>intended as permanent multicultural landmark but destroyed by institutional neglect (highway authority painting over it)</answer>
<other>Question 3 asks about paradoxical relationship between gallery's founding premise (showcasing responses to police brutality) and later educational programming. The article states Brockman Gallery was founded to showcase politically significant art after events like the Watts riots, and later created Brockman Productions for education/festivals. However, the text presents this expansion positively ("They did more than showcase artists") with no indication of paradox or contradiction. No paradoxical relationship is described, so answer is N/A.</other>

<other>Question 4 asks how divorce temporally coincided with professional shifts. The article states Davis's marriage to Rebecca Braithwaite "ended in divorce" but provides no divorce date. It states he left the gallery and Los Angeles in 1987 for a Sacramento job. Without any temporal link (e.g., divorce year), coincidence cannot be established from the text. Answer is N/A.</other>

<other>Question 5 asks about conservation challenges exacerbated by original site selection. The article states the murals were on the Harbor Freeway, leading to them being "covered by graffiti and worn away by freeway pollution," and Davis's works were "buried under decades of paint and soot," making restoration impossible. The site selection (freeway) directly caused the pollution and graffiti exposure, which worsened conservation efforts.</other>

<answer>exposure to freeway pollution and graffiti causing irreversible damage under layers of soot and paint</answer>
<other>Question 6 asks if academic appointments reflect deliberate departure from West Coast. The article states Davis "wanted to travel" and left Los Angeles in 1987 for Sacramento, then took roles in Hawaii/San Antonio and Memphis (1993-2002), ending in Maryland. The sequence explicitly moves eastward after leaving LA, confirming a departure from the West Coast scene he helped define.</other>
