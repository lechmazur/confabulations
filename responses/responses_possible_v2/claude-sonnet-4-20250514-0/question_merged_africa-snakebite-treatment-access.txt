<other>I need to carefully analyze each question against the information provided in the article about snakebites in Kenya and Africa. Many of these questions ask for very specific physiological or mechanistic explanations that may not be directly provided in the text.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions Beatrice's finger turned black and was amputated despite antivenom, but doesn't explain the specific physiological mechanism.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Antivenoms made in India, where kraits are most common, are useless against the black mambas or puff adders that terrorize Kenyans</answer>

<other>The article directly states this but doesn't provide the detailed geographical/venom variation mechanism the question asks for.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>While the article mentions monoclonal antibodies targeting toxin families, it doesn't specify the combination of neurotoxins and hemotoxins or explain the necessity based on research priorities.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions spitting cobras can shoot venom into eyes from 16 feet away and that traditional healers exist, but doesn't explain diagnostic confusion or treatment-seeking behaviors in the specific context asked.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>In the rainy season, flooding forces snakes out of their holes, and hot, dry seasons send snakes in search of food and water</answer>

<other>This describes seasonal patterns but doesn't fully address the interaction with agricultural practices and demographic groups as specifically asked.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions black mambas can kill within an hour and have short, erect fangs that inject neurotoxins, while puff adders have long, retractable fangs delivering hemotoxic venom, but doesn't provide three specific anatomical/behavioral characteristics or compare venom yields.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions antivenom must be kept cold and sterile, the six-hour window, and that pregnant women can have catastrophic outcomes, but doesn't explain the specific interaction between thermal instability and infrastructure affecting pregnant victims disproportionately.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Tourniquets often cause more harm than the bite itself, cutting off blood supply and leading to amputations</answer>

<other>This addresses part of the question about tourniquets causing harm, which could be considered paradoxical since they're meant to help.</other>
