<other>I need to carefully analyze each question based solely on the information provided in the article about Africa's electrification initiative, focusing on Tanzania, Husk Power Systems, and the various stakeholders mentioned.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>No</answer>

<other>The energy minister Doto Biteko justified the pricing regulations that forced Husk to leave. If he had been in charge when Husk initially entered Tanzania in 2015, the same pricing restrictions would likely have applied, preventing Husk from establishing the minigrid that powered Mwajuma Mohamed's TV.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Nigeria</answer>

<other>The Rwandan-backed rebels took Goma in Congo. The company with 70 minigrids is Husk Power Systems, which operates in Nigeria. The "Bulldozer" president John Magufuli was from Tanzania, but the question asks about the country with 70 operational minigrids, which is Nigeria.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Tanesco</answer>

<other>The village chairman Gesenda Mwise Gesenda states that with Tanesco (the state-run utility), it costs him three times as much for the same amount of power compared to Husk.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>More</answer>

<other>Raj Shah from Rockefeller Foundation said "It's the tech and the pricing" are the main drivers. The technology taking less time to deploy is solar power, enabled by China's production of inexpensive panels. Without this main enabling factor, costs would be higher, so the village chairman would pay more.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article doesn't specify how many daughters Mashavu Ali has in total, only mentioning one daughter whose grades dropped from first to third. Without knowing the total number of daughters, I cannot determine how many would be studying late.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Less</answer>

<other>The energy minister is from Tanzania (Doto Biteko). The successful regulatory environment is in Nigeria where Husk operates 70 minigrids. Gesenda currently pays three times more with Tanesco than he did with Husk, so a policy mirroring Nigeria's environment would likely result in lower costs.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>While the article mentions U.S. administration hostility to renewable energy could affect World Bank funding, it doesn't provide enough information to determine the specific impact on Gesenda's electricity costs from Tanesco.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>No</answer>

<other>The Rockefeller Foundation invests in renewable energy. If they prioritized extending existing grids instead of minigrids, and given that Tanzania's utility Tanesco has frequent power cuts and inferior service, Mwajuma Mohamed's TV would likely not be functional due to the poor grid service quality.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Later</answer>

<other>The "Bulldozer" president was John Magufuli. If he had prioritized regulatory reform over infrastructure, Husk might have remained operational, providing electricity that would allow children to study later rather than going to bed soon after sunset as they currently do.</other>
