<other>I need to analyze the article about Ali Hazelwood's book recommendations and answer questions about specific book matches based on various criteria.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>Looking for a book that combines fake dating (like the Eva/Bennett story), lottery win, and is already published. The only lottery book mentioned is about Sybil losing a lottery ticket, but this doesn't involve a material scientist and cardiothoracic surgeon dynamic.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The question asks about a novel featuring a character similar to a psychic rebel fighter that she would find least appealing due to delayed publication. The dystopian romance with Wren (psychic rebel fighter) is mentioned as not coming out until May, but the question structure doesn't match what's described in the article.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>Eva is described as a material scientist. Looking for scientific research careers excluding blurbed books. The article mentions Miri is an archaeologist, but the question asks for most similar to Eva's scientific research, and archaeology isn't the same field as material science.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The "Twelfth Night" retelling involves Veera and Deepak in a fake marriage with yearning. Looking for fake relationship, non-STEM, published before Feb 2024. Several options exist but the question asks for what she would "most likely" recommend, which requires speculation beyond the article.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>Looking for a transformation scenario similar to werewolf transformation but without negotiated kink, published before "Deep End". The werewolf book with negotiated kink comes out March 11, but no other transformation scenarios are described in the other books.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The Sapphic rom-com involves Opal and Pepper with a farm property dispute. The bartender Ahmad works at a local bar. Looking for a book set in a bar-like workplace, but no such setting is described in the other recommended books.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Captive Prince</answer>

<other>The dystopian romance involves Wren (psychic rebel) and Cross (commanding officer) with a power dynamic. The rival kingdoms book describes Prince Damen as a prisoner of Prince Laurent, which involves a similar power dynamic in a historical context.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>Looking for suspenseful elements (like Gigi the journalist) combined with archaeologist career focus (like Miri) but without rainforest expeditions. No other books combine these specific elements without the rainforest setting.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Hurricane Heroine</answer>

<other>The biologist encounters aliens after crash landing on a planet. Looking for similar premise but with hurricane setting instead. The book about Meena and Nikhil involves being stranded due to a hurricane.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Lucky in Love</answer>

<other>Jo the cardiologist gives up unrequited crush, similar to relationship dynamics exploration. Celebrity romance involves Gigi and Alec the actor. Viral video plot is in the book where Kieran and Sybil's interaction is captured in a viral video.</other>
