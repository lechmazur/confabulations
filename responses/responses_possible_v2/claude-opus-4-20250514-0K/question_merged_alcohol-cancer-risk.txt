<other>Let me analyze each question carefully based on the article.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<other>The article mentions that light drinkers (up to one drink per day) had a 30% higher chance of developing esophageal cancer, 17% higher for oral cavity and pharynx cancer, and 5% higher for breast cancer compared to non-drinkers. The highest percentage increase is 30% for esophageal cancer.</other>
<answer>esophageal cancer</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<other>The article states that at two drinks per day, the share of women who would develop breast cancer increased to 15.3%. The reference group (less than one drink per week) had 11% risk. So the increase is 15.3% - 11% = 4.3 percentage points.</other>
<answer>4.3 percentage points</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<other>The article states that women who consumed one alcoholic drink each day (seven drinks a week) had a 19% lifetime risk of developing any alcohol-related cancer. One standard drink contains 14 grams of alcohol, which is about the amount in a 5-ounce glass of wine. So 7 drinks per week Ã— 5 ounces = 35 ounces of wine per week.</other>
<answer>35 ounces</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<other>Looking at the data provided:
- Less than one drink per week: Women 17%, Men 10% (gap = 7%)
- One drink per day: Women 19%, Men 11% (gap = 8%)
- Two drinks per day: Women 22%, Men 13% (gap = 9%)
The article doesn't provide data for four or more drinks per day broken down by sex, so I can't determine if the gap continues to increase.</other>
<answer>two drinks per day</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<other>The article mentions that cancers of the mouth, throat (which includes oral cavity and pharynx) appear in the light drinking category. It also states that heavy drinking is linked to cancers of the mouth. The article specifically mentions that "Drinking and smoking cigarettes, for instance, is known to compound the risk of head and neck cancers."</other>
<answer>mouth cancer</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<other>The article states that women who consumed one alcoholic drink each day had a 13.1% lifetime risk of breast cancer. One standard drink is defined as a 1.5-ounce shot of liquor.</other>
