<other>Let me analyze each question carefully based solely on the information provided in the article.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions these challenges but doesn't explicitly identify which single operational constraint was the most critical limitation for expansion plans. The text discusses Boeing production delays and the inability to get replacement aircraft from Airbus, but doesn't rank these constraints or identify one as "most critical."</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article doesn't provide a precise sequence of events involving all three elements (Boeing issues, Airbus backlog, and Pratt & Whitney engine problems). It mentions Boeing issues and Airbus backlogs, and separately mentions "some Airbus planes were afflicted by an engine problem," but doesn't establish a chronological sequence or specify Pratt & Whitney, nor does it discuss disproportionate effects on airlines with older fleets.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>While the article mentions Southwest making changes to lower costs and increase profits, and JetBlue adding premium seats, it doesn't juxtapose these strategies or discuss them as responses to the same market pressures in the fourth and eighth paragraphs specifically.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article doesn't discuss a critical path dependency involving these specific elements, nor does it make distinctions between carriers with widebody fleets versus those reliant on narrowbody aircraft orders.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>While the article mentions various crises (Boeing safety issue, technology outage, Spirit bankruptcy), it doesn't explicitly state that these three specific crises all directly contributed to improved pricing power through their collective impact on capacity management.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article quotes an analyst saying "For the last five years, it's felt like every bird in the sky was a black swan," but doesn't present this as conflicting with 2025 projections. The article doesn't analyze cumulative effects across the specific elements mentioned in the question.</other>
