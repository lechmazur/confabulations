<other>Looking at question 1: I need to find a cruise line developing a private beach at the same port that will host the sister ship of the world's largest cruise vessel. The article mentions that the Star of the Seas is the sister of the world's largest cruise ship (Icon of the Seas) and will launch from Port Canaveral, Florida. Royal Caribbean is developing a private beach club in Nassau, the Bahamas. These are different locations, so this doesn't match. The article doesn't mention any private beach development at Port Canaveral.</other>

<other>For question 2: I need to find a cruise company creating a land-based amenity at the same location where a different operator's 1,095-day voyage was meant to make port calls. The article mentions a 1,095-day cruise with 382 port calls, but doesn't specify where these port calls were. It mentions Carnival developing a private beach on Grand Bahama and Royal Caribbean developing one in Nassau, but there's no connection stated between these locations and the 1,095-day cruise port calls.</other>

<other>For question 3: I need a vessel launching in 2024 that combines water-based attractions with ground-based entertainment while maintaining European hospitality influence. The article mentions MSC's World America will begin sailing in April (doesn't specify the year), has water slides, ropes course, bumper cars, roller rinks. MSC is mentioned as having European influence in design and food. However, the article doesn't specify that World America is launching in 2024.</other>

<other>For question 4: I need a vessel that shares characteristics with Icon of the Seas and is scheduled to operate from the same state as a new 17-acre private beach development. The Star of the Seas shares many features with Icon of the Seas and will launch from Port Canaveral, Florida. The 17-acre private beach development mentioned is in Nassau, the Bahamas, not in Florida.</other>
