<other>Let me go through each question carefully, looking for information in the article.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<other>Looking for a character that was originally developed from an improvised stage moment in San Francisco and involves birthday greetings. The article mentions Sally O'Malley by Molly Shannon, who talks about doing "backyard Sally O'Malleys for friends a lot, where I'll wish people happy birthday doing the character." But I need to check if this was from San Francisco. Actually, the article mentions Church Lady came from improvising "at the second show and interview people in the audience" at "the Other Cafe in Haight-Ashbury" which is in San Francisco, and this reoriented the comedian's career. Let me verify this matches all criteria.</other>
<answer>Church Lady</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<other>Looking for a Dana Carvey character where a statement was extended to "Na ga da it". The article states: "The one that took the longest was 'Not gonna do it,' George Bush Sr. [As Bush] 'Not gonna do it, wouldn't be prudent at this juncture.'... I eventually extrapolated the syntax from 'Not gonna do it' to 'Na gana da it,' and on. By the end the cue card just said 'Na ga da it.'"</other>
<answer>George H.W. Bush</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<other>Looking for a character identifiable by pursed expression without verbal commentary that was involved in religious satire. The article says about Church Lady: "Even though she's a fountain of catchphrases, the Church Lady is recognizable without even opening her mouth: All she needs are those pursed lips set hard to one side and she's ready to start judging you." It also mentions she "came along at a perfect time for religious satire, when scandal-prone televangelists and their tingling nether regions were making national news."</other>
<answer>Church Lady</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<other>Looking for a 1992 call-in show character centered on a celebrity diva, associated with "like buttah" and Ben & Jerry's. The article mentions Linda Richman from 1992, devoted to Barbra Streisand, using "like buttah" as high praise. However, the Ben & Jerry's flavor is mentioned in connection with Pete Schweddy, not Linda Richman. Let me re-read... The article says Pete Schweddy's "success yielded a namesake Ben & Jerry's flavor" but this isn't connected to the 1992 call-in show or "like buttah".</other>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<other>Looking for a Season 12 character who was a washed-up British singer-songwriter and did a vegetable-related musical improvisation. The article mentions Derek Stevens by Dana Carvey who debuted in Season 12 as "a washed-up British singer-songwriter who's antsy to 'bloody score'" and performed a song that "has gone down in pop history as 'Choppin' Broccoli'".</other>
<answer>Derek Stevens</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<other>Looking for which cast member's restaurant sketch gave birth to the Olympia diner. The article states: "Don't expect a tuna salad sandwich, an egg breakfast or anything other than this menu item at the Olympia diner operated by John Belushi, and inspired either by Chicago's Billy Goat Tavern or a real-life restaurant owned by Belushi's father (depending on who's telling the tale)."</other>
<answer>John Belushi</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<other>Looking for the character portrayed by Chris Rock who hosted "The Dark Side With Nat X". The article states: "Chris Rock plays the host -- 'so Black they counted him four times at the Million Man March' -- of 'The Dark Side With Nat X.'"</other>
<answer>Nat X</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<other>Looking for the sketch about a recording session with "more cowbell". The article mentions: "That's the premise of the supposed making of '(Don't Fear) the Reaper' by Blue Oyster Cult, with Christopher Walken as the renowned hitmaker Bruce Dickinson (please use his full name) and Will Ferrell as Gene, the only musician who can fulfill his producer's weirdly rustic demand."</other>
<answer>(Don't Fear) the Reaper</answer>
