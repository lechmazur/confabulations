<other>The article states that the author was in a vogueing house with five members in 1991. It further states: "By 1992, two out of the five members of the house were dead from AIDS, and one was H.I.V. positive." This means that by 1992, there were 5 - 2 = 3 members still alive, one of whom was HIV positive.

The event in question ("the author's newspaper editor was sitting on her lap during editorial meetings") occurred "By the time I finished college... at the Montreal newspaper where I worked". The author started college in 1991. Assuming college took a few years, this newspaper job would have been sometime after 1992 (e.g., mid-1990s).

The article provides the number of living members "by 1992" (which was 3). It does not provide an update on how many of these three members were still alive by the later time she was working at the newspaper. While one of the three living members was HIV positive in 1992, the article does not state whether this person, or any of the other two, died between 1992 and the period she worked at the newspaper. Therefore, the exact number of living members at that specific later point in time is not provided in the article.</other>
