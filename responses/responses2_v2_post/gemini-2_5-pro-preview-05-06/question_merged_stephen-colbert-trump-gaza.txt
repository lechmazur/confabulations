<other>The user is asking about what a Democratic congressman decided to file against President Trump after Trump announced his plan for Greenland, according to Jimmy Fallon.
I need to locate the part of the article where Jimmy Fallon speaks about a Democratic congressman and Trump's plans.
The article states: "After Trump announced his plan for Gaza, a Democratic congressman said he is filing articles of impeachment against him. Good luck with that. There's a better chance of turning Gaza into the Riviera of the Middle East." -- JIMMY FALLON.
This quote from Jimmy Fallon mentions a Democratic congressman filing articles of impeachment. However, it specifies that this was after Trump announced his plan for *Gaza*, not Greenland.
The question specifically asks about the plan for *Greenland*.
While another quote from Jimmy Fallon mentions Greenland ("Trump wants to take over Greenland, Canada and now the Gaza Strip."), it is not linked to the Democratic congressman's action of filing articles of impeachment.
The article only links the filing of articles of impeachment by a Democratic congressman (as mentioned by Jimmy Fallon) to Trump's plan for *Gaza*.
Therefore, the article does not provide information about a Democratic congressman filing anything in response to Trump's plan for *Greenland* as mentioned by Jimmy Fallon.</other>
