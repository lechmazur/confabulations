<other>The question asks for the total projected cost of two policies: extending the 2017 tax cuts and implementing a 20% universal tariff, over the next decade, based on figures in the text.

The article provides the following figures:
1.  Cost of extending the 2017 tax cuts: "Continuing the tax cuts is expected to cost more than $4 trillion over the next decade..."
2.  Revenue from a 20% universal tariff: "...a 20 percent universal tariff would raise $3.3 trillion from 2025 through 2034." The period "2025 through 2034" is a decade, aligning with "over the next decade."

To find the "total projected cost of both," I need to calculate the net fiscal impact. The tax cuts are a cost, and the tariffs generate revenue (which can be considered a negative cost).
So, Total Cost = (Cost of tax cuts) - (Revenue from tariffs).

Cost of tax cuts = More than $4 trillion.
Revenue from tariffs = $3.3 trillion.

Total Projected Cost = (More than $4 trillion) - ($3.3 trillion).
Let C_tax_cuts = $4 trillion + x, where x > 0.
Total Projected Cost = ($4 trillion + x) - $3.3 trillion
Total Projected Cost = ($4 trillion - $3.3 trillion) + x
Total Projected Cost = $0.7 trillion + x.
Since x > 0, the total projected cost is "more than $0.7 trillion."

This is a logical inference based on the figures provided in the text, similar to calculating a remaining percentage. The article also mentions Mr. Trump's view that tariff revenue could "cover the cost" of tax cuts, supporting the idea of netting these figures.
The question asks "What is the total projected cost...", implying a calculation based on the provided figures.
The timeframes for both figures are "over the next decade".</other>
