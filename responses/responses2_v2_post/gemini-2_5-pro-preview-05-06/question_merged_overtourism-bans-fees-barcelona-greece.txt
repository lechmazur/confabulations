merged_overtourism-bans-fees-barcelona-greece.txt
<other>The question asks for a specific measure Amsterdam implemented in 2016, similar to Barcelona's 2012 tourist tax. The article states, "In Amsterdam, which began targeting overtourism in 2016, arrivals are expected to climb to 26 million in 2026." It also mentions, "By the middle of the last decade, cities like Amsterdam and Barcelona had begun taking tentative steps to relieve tourism's impacts..." However, the article does not specify what particular measure Amsterdam implemented in 2016, nor does it state that any measure taken by Amsterdam in 2016 was similar to Barcelona's tourist tax. The article mentions Amsterdam imposed a measure to halt new hotel construction in 2024 and another measure in November (presumably 2024) regarding accommodations, but these are not from 2016. Barcelona implemented its first tourist tax in 2012. The article does not provide information about a specific 2016 Amsterdam measure that was similar to Barcelona's tourist tax.</other>
