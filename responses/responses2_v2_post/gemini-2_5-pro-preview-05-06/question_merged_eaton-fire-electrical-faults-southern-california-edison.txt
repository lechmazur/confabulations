<other>For question 1, I need to find information about a fire, other than the Eaton fire, whose origin point was stated by Edison in a report to state regulators to be about five miles away from a substation. The article mentions Edison registered a fault at its Gould substation, "a facility about five miles away from what is believed to be the origin point of the fire" (referring to the Eaton fire). The question asks for *another* fire. The article mentions the Hurst fire, stating "Edison has said that it did measure a large fault on a transmission line related to a separate fire, the Hurst fire...". However, it does not state that Edison reported to state regulators that the Hurst fire's origin point was about five miles away from a substation. The article says Edison "later reported to state regulators that a preliminary analysis showed that as a result of the fault at the Gould substation, there was 'a momentary and expected increase in current on SCE's transmission system.'" This report is about the Gould substation fault, linked to the Eaton fire, not another fire with the specified distance characteristic. Therefore, the information for another fire matching this specific description is not in the article.</other>

<other>For question 2, I need to identify an Austin, Texas-based company whose sensors detected electrical problems leading to the discovery of the Eaton fire's cause. The article states, "The network at Whisker Labs, a technology company based in Germantown, Md., began measuring electrical problems at homes throughout the Los Angeles region using sensors...". Whisker Labs is identified as the company whose sensors detected the problems, but it is based in Germantown, Md., not Austin, Texas. The article mentions Mikal C. Watts, "a lawyer based in Austin, Texas," but he is a lawyer, not a company with sensors. Since the company identified (Whisker Labs) is not Austin, Texas-based, and no other company fitting the description is mentioned, the answer is N/A due to the incorrect premise about the company's location.</other>
