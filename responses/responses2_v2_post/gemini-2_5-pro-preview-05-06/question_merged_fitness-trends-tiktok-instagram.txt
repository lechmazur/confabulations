<other>The question asks for the maximum number of weekly strength training sessions recommended by a Chicago-based coach for full-body conditioning without equipment.
The article mentions Robyn LaLonde, "the head coach and owner of Edge Athlete Lounge in Chicago."
She recommended to "practice a full-body strength training routine twice a week."
The article also states, "If you prefer to work out at home, you can still build strength with little or no equipment," which connects to the idea of training without equipment.
The recommendation is for "twice a week." The question asks for the "maximum number ... recommended." The article states that Robyn LaLonde recommended "twice a week," but it does not explicitly state that this is the *maximum* number she recommends. It is a specific recommended frequency. According to the instructions, if the answer is not provided or cannot be logically inferred directly, the answer should be "N/A". The article does not use terms like "at most," "maximum," or any phrasing that would explicitly define "twice a week" as the upper limit of her recommendation. Therefore, the maximum number recommended is not explicitly stated.</other>
