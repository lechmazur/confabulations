<other>The question asks for the number of exceptions Rebecca Makkai made to her "no blurbs" policy in the year she decided to protect her time (2023).
The article states: "First, I had decided that 2023 would be the year when I protected my time and blurbed next to nothing. And yet I ended up with 18 books to blurb in the summer and fall alone."
This indicates that her policy for 2023 was to "blurb next to nothing," and she blurbed 18 books, which are deviations from this policy.
The article further states, regarding a request from a friend: "I was willing to make one of those exceptions at what was otherwise an extremely busy time." The phrase "one of those exceptions" implies that the 18 books blurbed (when she intended to blurb "next to nothing") are the "those exceptions" being referred to. The friend's book, for which she made an exception, would be one of these 18.
Therefore, the 18 books she ended up blurbing represent 18 exceptions to her policy of blurbing "next to nothing" in 2023. The article also mentions her realization: "If I make one exception, I'll make 50," which suggests that "one exception" typically corresponds to one instance of agreeing to blurb a book. Thus, 18 books blurbed against her policy imply 18 exceptions made.</other>
