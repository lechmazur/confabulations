<other>The article states: "The film captures this destruction between 2019 and 2023 and in archival footage from Adra's family."
The period "between 2019 and 2023" includes the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. This is a span of 5 consecutive years.
The article also mentions "archival footage from Adra's family." However, it does not specify the year(s) this archival footage is from, nor does it state whether this archival footage is consecutive with the 2019-2023 period to form a single, longer block of consecutive years.
For example, if the archival footage was from 2018 and shown as such, leading into 2019, then 6 consecutive years would be shown. If the archival footage was from a much earlier, non-contiguous period (e.g., 2010), then the film would show destruction from 2010 and then separately from the 5 consecutive years of 2019-2023. In that case, the longest single block of consecutive years shown would be 5.
The question asks "How many consecutive years... are shown," implying a single number for a continuous span. Since the article does not provide enough information to determine if the archival footage extends the 5-year period (2019-2023) into a longer single consecutive span, or what the total length of such a span would be, the exact number of consecutive years shown (encompassing both types of footage as one continuous block) cannot be determined from the text. We only know for sure that 5 consecutive years (2019-2023) are shown. We don't know if the archival footage makes it more than 5 *consecutive* years in a single block.</other>
