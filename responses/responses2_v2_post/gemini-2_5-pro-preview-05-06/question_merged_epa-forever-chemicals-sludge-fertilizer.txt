<other>The question asks to identify a federal agency whose 2019 testing protocol was criticized by Consumer Reports for a specific failure rate (80%) in detecting PFAS in organic milk. I need to find information in the article that links Consumer Reports, a federal agency, a 2019 testing protocol, PFAS, organic milk, and an 80% failure rate.

The article states: "The Food and Drug Administration does not set limits on PFAS levels in food. Since 2019, however, the agency has tested nearly 1,300 samples of food and said a vast majority were free of the types of PFAS the agency is able to screen for. Some public health experts and advocacy groups have questioned the testing methodology, and the agency itself says that 'PFAS exposure from food is an emerging area of science and there remains much we do not yet know.' Consumer Reports said last year that it had detected PFAS in some milk, including milk from organic brands."

The article mentions:
1.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) tested food since 2019.
2.  "Some public health experts and advocacy groups" (not specifically Consumer Reports) questioned the FDA's testing methodology.
3.  Consumer Reports detected PFAS in some milk, including organic brands.

The article does not state that Consumer Reports criticized the FDA's (or any other federal agency's) 2019 testing protocol for "failing to detect PFAS in 80% of organic milk samples." The 80% figure is not mentioned in relation to Consumer Reports or any agency's testing protocol. While Consumer Reports found PFAS in milk and the FDA's methodology was questioned, the specific claim in the question (Consumer Reports criticizing a specific agency's 2019 protocol for an 80% failure rate) is not directly supported by the text. The text says Consumer Reports *detected* PFAS, not that they criticized an agency for *failing to detect* it at a specific rate.</other>
