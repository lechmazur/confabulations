<other>The article states that "Mr. Musk started buying up Twitter stock in late January 2022" and "did not disclose his stake until April 4". It then says, "After he announced his position, Twitter's stock shot up more than 27 percent." This 27 percent increase occurred *after* the disclosure on April 4. The question asks for the increase *between* the initial purchases in January and the disclosure in April. The article does not provide this specific information. It only states that because Mr. Musk did not disclose his position, he was able to continue buying Twitter stock at an "artificially low price". This implies the price was lower before the disclosure than it would have been, but it doesn't state the actual price increase, if any, between January and the moment of disclosure on April 4.</other>
