<other>The article states that "The Trump administration is holding 10 migrants with suspected gang affiliations in the same prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba that has housed men accused of being members of Al Qaeda". It then separately mentions that "U.S Forces are also preparing a tent city to house as many as 30,000 migrants." The article does not state that the 10 migrants with suspected gang affiliations are being held in the tent city, nor does it state how many, if any, are currently in the tent city which is described as being "prepared".</other>
