<other>The question asks about a specific type of early music instrument mastered by David Munrow that Ms. van Kampen featured in the pit band for the Broadway production of "Farinelli and the King."

First, I need to identify the instrument mastered by David Munrow. The article states: "She gained an interest in Renaissance music during her girlhood thanks to meeting David Munrow, a charismatic recorder player who studied and performed early music." So, David Munrow was a recorder player.

Next, I need to check if the recorder was featured in the pit band for the Broadway production of "Farinelli and the King."
The article describes "Farinelli and the King": "She had musicians and audience members sit onstage, as if they were all gathered at a royal court. The goings-on were lit partly by candles." It mentions the music was by Handel and Porpora. It does *not* list the specific instruments used in the pit band for "Farinelli and the King."

The article *does* list instruments for other productions: "Under her direction, the show featured a pit band of musicians who played Elizabethan instruments like the shawm, sackbut, theorbo, hurdy-gurdy, cittern, tabor and rauschpfeife." This list is for the productions of "Twelfth Night" and "Richard III" that opened at the Belasco in 2013.

The question specifically asks about an instrument mastered by Munrow (recorder) *and* featured in "Farinelli and the King." The article confirms Munrow played the recorder. However, it does not state that the recorder was part of the pit band for "Farinelli and the King." It only lists instruments for different productions ("Twelfth Night" and "Richard III").

Therefore, the article does not provide the information to confirm that the recorder (Munrow's instrument) was featured in "Farinelli and the King."</other>
