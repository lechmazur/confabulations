<other>The question asks for the month in which the legislative body (Congress) approved the TikTok ban bill. The article states: "President Biden signed the TikTok ban bill into law in April after it passed Congress with bipartisan support." This sentence indicates that President Biden signed the bill in April, and this signing occurred *after* Congress had passed it. However, the article does not specify the exact month in which Congress passed the bill. It only states that the passing happened before the signing in April. It could have been earlier in April, or in a preceding month like March. Since the article does not explicitly state the month of Congressional approval, and it cannot be definitively inferred from the provided text, the answer must be N/A.</other>
