<answer>"Great Galloping Gottschalk"</answer>

<other>Note: The article mentions this was a ballet for American Ballet Theater in 1982, and while Anna Kisselgoff from The New York Times (not the New York Post) called it a "whopping success with the public", the critic herself was mixed in her review. The article specifically quotes Kisselgoff as saying it was "primarily a surface crowd-pleaser".</other>
