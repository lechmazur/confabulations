<other>The user wants me to answer question 1 based solely on the provided article.
The question asks what a Democratic congressman filed against President Trump after his plan for Greenland, as mentioned by Jimmy Fallon.
I need to find information in the article about:
- Democratic congressman
- filing something against Trump
- related to a plan for Greenland
- mentioned by Jimmy Fallon

The article states: "After Trump announced his plan for Gaza, a Democratic congressman said he is filing articles of impeachment against him." This is attributed to Jimmy Fallon.
The article also mentions Jimmy Fallon saying Trump wants to take over Greenland, Canada, and the Gaza Strip.

The article links the filing of articles of impeachment to the plan for *Gaza*, not the plan for *Greenland*.
The question specifically asks about the plan for *Greenland*.
Since the article does not state that a Democratic congressman filed something against Trump specifically after the plan for Greenland, I must answer N/A.</other>
