<other>The user wants me to answer question 1 based solely on the provided article.
The question asks for the number of exceptions the author of "The Great Believers" made to her "no blurbs" policy in the year she decided to protect her time.
The article identifies Rebecca Makkai as the author of "The Great Believers".
The article states that 2023 was the year she decided to protect her time and blurb "next to nothing" or have a "hard-line no blurbs policy".
The article states that she "ended up with 18 books to blurb in the summer and fall alone" in that year.
These 18 blurbs are the instances where she wrote a blurb despite her policy of writing "next to nothing". Therefore, these are the exceptions.
The answer is 18.</other>
