merged_trump-first-week.txt
<other>The user wants me to find the combined market capitalization of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins on the specific day of Trump's inauguration, based only on the provided article. The article states the coins were introduced "just days before President Trump's inauguration" and had a combined market cap of "about $6 billion as of Friday". Friday occurred during Trump's first week in office, which means it was after the inauguration day. The article does not provide the market cap value specifically for the inauguration day itself.</other>
