<other>The user wants me to answer a question based on the provided article. The question asks about the number of migrants with suspected gang affiliations held in the Guantanamo Bay *tent city*. I need to carefully read the relevant part of the article. The article states: "The Trump administration is holding 10 migrants with suspected gang affiliations in the same prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba that has housed men accused of being members of Al Qaeda, U.S. defense officials said. U.S Forces are also preparing a tent city to house as many as 30,000 migrants." This text says the 10 migrants are held in "the same prison", not the "tent city". The tent city is mentioned as being prepared separately. Therefore, the article does not state how many migrants accused of gang affiliations are held in the tent city itself.</other>
