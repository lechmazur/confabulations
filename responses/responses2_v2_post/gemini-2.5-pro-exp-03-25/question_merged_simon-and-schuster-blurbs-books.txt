<other>The user wants me to answer a question based only on the provided article. The question asks for the specific number of exceptions Rebecca Makkai made to her "no blurbs" policy in 2023, the year she decided to protect her time. The article states: "First, I had decided that 2023 would be the year when I protected my time and blurbed next to nothing. And yet I ended up with 18 books to blurb in the summer and fall alone." This tells us the number of books she blurbed in summer and fall 2023, but not the total number for the entire year 2023. Since the question asks for the number of exceptions made *in the year* (implying the full year), and the article only provides a partial count for "summer and fall alone", the exact number for the whole year cannot be determined from the text.</other>
