<other>The user wants me to determine the number of living members of the author's vogueing house at the specific time she endured editorial meetings sitting on her editor's lap.
The article states: "In 1991, when I was 18 and starting college, I was in a vogueing house that won Montreal's first vogue ball." It also states: "By 1992, two out of the five members of the house were dead from AIDS, and one was H.I.V. positive." This means 3 members were alive in 1992.
The article then states: "By the time I finished college... This wisecracking persona was nearly necessary at the Montreal newspaper where I worked, and where I endured more than one editorial meeting sitting on the lap of my editor." This incident occurred *after* she finished college, which would be sometime after 1992.
The article does not provide information on the status (alive or dead) of the remaining 3 members between 1992 and the time she worked at the newspaper and experienced the editor incident. Therefore, the exact number alive *at that specific time* cannot be determined from the text.</other>
