<other>The user wants me to answer a question based on the provided article only. The question asks what a Democratic congressman decided to file against President Trump after his plan for Greenland was announced, according to Jimmy Fallon. I need to check the article for mentions of Jimmy Fallon, President Trump's plan for Greenland, and a Democratic congressman's reaction.</other>
<other>The article mentions Jimmy Fallon quoting: "Trump wants to take over Greenland, Canada and now the Gaza Strip." It also mentions Fallon quoting: "After Trump announced his plan for Gaza, a Democratic congressman said he is filing articles of impeachment against him." The article states the congressman's action was in response to the Gaza plan, not the Greenland plan, according to Fallon.</other>
