<other>I need to find the specific information requested in the question within the provided article. The question asks about a specific criticism by Consumer Reports regarding a specific federal agency's 2019 testing protocol and a specific percentage (80%) related to organic milk samples. I will scan the text for mentions of "Consumer Reports", "federal agency", "2019", "testing", "PFAS", and "organic milk". The article mentions the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) started testing food samples in 2019. It also mentions Consumer Reports detected PFAS in some milk, including organic brands, last year. It further states that "Some public health experts and advocacy groups have questioned the testing methodology" of the FDA. However, the article does not state that Consumer Reports specifically criticized the FDA's 2019 protocol for failing to detect PFAS in 80% of organic milk samples that Consumer Reports later found contaminated. The link between Consumer Reports' findings and a critique of the FDA's 2019 protocol, especially involving the 80% figure, is not present in the text.</other>
