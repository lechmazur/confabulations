Okay, let's tackle question 1. The user is asking for the total amount Twitter's stock price increased between Musk's initial purchases in January 2022 and his disclosure in April.

Looking at the article, I need to find specific numbers related to the stock price during that period. The article mentions that after Musk disclosed his stake on April 4, the stock "shot up more than 27 percent." However, the question is about the increase between his initial buying in January and the disclosure in April. The 27% jump happened right after the disclosure, not the entire period from January. The article doesn't provide the stock price before his purchases started in January or the exact increase over the three months. It only states the 27% rise following the disclosure. Since the question asks for the increase between January and April, and the article doesn't give data points for those exact months, the answer isn't directly provided. Therefore, the answer should be N/A.
