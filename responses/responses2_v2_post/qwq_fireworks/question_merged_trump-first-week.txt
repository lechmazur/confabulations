Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the combined market cap of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins on the day of Trump's inauguration. 

First, I need to check the article for information related to these cryptocurrencies. Scanning through, there's a section that mentions: "The $TRUMP and $MELANIA cryptocurrency tokens, introduced just days before President Trump's inauguration, had a combined market cap of about $6 billion as of Friday." 

The key points here are the timing and the value. The coins were introduced just before the inauguration, and the market cap is given as $6 billion "as of Friday." The question specifies the day of the inauguration. The article doesn't explicitly state the exact market cap on the inauguration day itself, but it says "as of Friday," which was the day mentioned in the article's context. Since the coins were introduced days before the inauguration and the market cap is noted around that time, it's reasonable to infer that the $6 billion figure is the closest available data. 

However, the question asks specifically for the day of the inauguration. The article says "as of Friday," but it's not clear if that Friday was the inauguration day or a day after. But since the coins were introduced just days before the inauguration, and the market cap is given around that time, the answer is likely $6 billion. The instructions say to use the article as the only source. Since the article states the combined market cap was about $6 billion around that time, even if not explicitly on the exact day, it's the closest data provided. Therefore, the answer should be 6.
