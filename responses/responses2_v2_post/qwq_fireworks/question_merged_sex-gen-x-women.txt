Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how many members of the author's vogueing house, which won Montreal's first vogue ball, were still alive by the time the author's newspaper editor was sitting on her lap during editorial meetings.

First, I need to find the relevant parts of the article. The author mentions their vogueing house in this section: "In 1991, when I was 18 and starting college, I was in a vogueing house that won Montreal's first vogue ball. By 1992, two out of the five members of the house were dead from AIDS, and one was H.I.V. positive." So, in 1992, two had died, leaving three alive (since 5 - 2 = 3). However, the question is about the time when the editor was sitting on her lap during meetings. 

Next, when did the editor's action occur? The author describes working at a Montreal newspaper and the editor's behavior in the context of the 1990s. Specifically, she mentions "One Halloween, a fellow journalist showed up at a party in only tight white underwear and a cape, claiming to be dressed as 'Rape Man.' This was not an environment I often questioned." The Halloween incident isn't dated, but the author was in college starting in 1991, so likely this was in the early 90s. The editor's actions would have been during her time at the newspaper, which started around 1991. 

The key point is the timeline: the house had five members. By 1992, two were dead, so three remained. The question asks about the time when the editor was sitting on her lap. Since the editor's actions were during the author's time at the newspaper (which started in 1991), and the deaths happened by 1992, by the time the editor was doing that, it would be around 1991-1992. So, by 1992, two were dead, so three were alive. But the question is phrased as "by the time the editor was sitting..." which is likely around 1992. Therefore, the answer would be 3. Wait, but the question says "still alive" at that time. The article says "by 1992, two out of the five members of the house were dead from AIDS," so three were alive. So the answer is 3. But need to confirm if the editor's actions were after 1992. The author was starting college in 1991, so working at the paper around that time. The deaths happened by 1992. So if the editor's behavior was during that time (1991-1992), then by the time of the editor's actions, the two had already died. Therefore, three were still alive. So the answer is 3.
