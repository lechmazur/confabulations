Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the title of the ballet described as a "whopping success" by a New York Post critic, which established Ms. Taylor-Corbett's reputation. 

First, I need to look through the article for mentions of her ballets and any critic reviews. The article mentions "Great Galloping Gottschalk" from 1982 as her breakout ballet. The text says that while the review by Anna Kisselgoff in The New York Times was mixed, it was called a "whopping success with the public." Wait, the question specifies the New York Post critic, but the article mentions The New York Times reviewer Anna Kisselgoff. That's a discrepancy. The article says Kisselgoff wrote that it was a "whopping success with the public" but also noted it's a "surface crowd-pleaser." The critic's newspaper here is The Times, not the Post. But the question mentions the New York Post. Since the article only references The New York Times review, not the Post, maybe that's a trick. But the title in the article that matches is "Great Galloping Gottschalk". The user might have made a mistake in the newspaper name, but the answer should be based strictly on the article's info. Since the article doesn't mention the New York Post, but the success is tied to that ballet, perhaps the answer is still that title. The question's mention of the Post might be an error, but since the article's info is the only source, the answer is "Great Galloping Gottschalk".
