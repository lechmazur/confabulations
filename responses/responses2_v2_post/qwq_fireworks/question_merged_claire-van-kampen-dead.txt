Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about a specific type of early music instrument that David Munrow mastered, which Ms. van Kampen featured in the pit band for the Broadway production of "Farinelli and the King." The question ties her childhood interest to the instruments used in that production.

First, I need to find where David Munrow is mentioned. The article states that during her girlhood, Claire van Kampen developed an interest in Renaissance music after meeting David Munrow, a charismatic recorder player. So, the instrument associated with Munrow is the recorder.

Next, the question asks which instrument she featured in the Broadway pit band for "Farinelli and the King." The article mentions that in her productions, like the 2013 Belasco productions of "Twelfth Night" and "Richard III" (which were on Broadway), the pit band used Elizabethan instruments such as shawm, sackbut, theorbo, hurdy-gurdy, cittern, tabor, and rauschpfeife. However, the Broadway production of "Farinelli and the King" is specifically noted to have a pit band with these instruments. The recorder isn't listed among those specific instruments in the pit band for those shows. 

Wait, the question is about "Farinelli and the King," which was the play she wrote. The Broadway version of "Farinelli" is mentioned, but the pit band details are from the 2013 Belasco productions of Shakespeare plays. The article doesn't explicitly mention the instruments used in "Farinelli and the King" on Broadway. The only pit band details given are for the 2013 shows. Since "Farinelli" is her play, maybe the instruments there are the same? The article doesn't specify. 

The question connects her childhood interest (Renaissance music via Munrow's recorder) to the instruments in that specific production. Since the pit band for her earlier Shakespeare plays used those Elizabethan instruments, but "Farinelli" might be different. However, the article doesn't state which instruments were used in "Farinelli and the King" specifically. The only direct mention of instruments in the Broadway production of her play isn't there. The article does say she arranged Tudor-era music for "Wolf Hall," but that's another project. 

Therefore, since the question specifically asks about "Farinelli and the King" and the instruments in its pit band, and the article only lists the Elizabethan instruments for the 2013 shows (not the 2014 play), the answer might be N/A. Alternatively, maybe the same instruments were used, but that's an assumption. Since the article doesn't explicitly state the instruments for "Farinelli," the correct answer would be N/A because the question's specifics aren't met.

<other>The article states that David Munrow was a recorder player who influenced her interest in Renaissance music. However, the pit band for "Farinelli and the King" is not explicitly listed in the text. The instruments mentioned for her work are from the 2013 Belasco productions of "Twelfth Night" and "Richard III," not "Farinelli and the King." Since the question specifically asks about "Farinelli and the King," the answer cannot be confirmed and must be N/A.</other>
