Okay, let's tackle the first question. The user is asking how many exceptions the author of "The Great Believers" made in the year she decided to protect her time. 

First, I need to confirm who the author is. The article starts by mentioning Rebecca Makkai as the author, and she's the one who wrote "The Great Believers." So she's the one in question here.

The question refers to the year she decided to protect her time. In the article, Rebecca mentions that in 2023, she had planned to protect her time and blurb next to nothing. However, she ended up with 18 books to blurb that summer and fall. Then she says she needed a hard-line no-blurbs policy because if she made one exception, she'd make 50. 

Looking further, she talks about a specific instance where a friend requested a blurb through their publisher. She was willing to make an exception for this friend despite her busy schedule. That's one exception. The text doesn't mention any other exceptions beyond that. The key part here is that she made at least one exception (for her friend), but the question is asking how many exceptions she made in that year when she was trying to protect her time. 

The article says she had 18 books to blurb even though she intended to do almost none. But the exception she explicitly mentions is the one for her friend. The other 17 might be part of her usual workload or other requests, but the question is about exceptions to her policy. The only exception she explicitly talks about making is the one for her friend. 

Therefore, the answer should be 1. The article doesn't state more than one exception, so I can't infer there were more. The question is straightforward here.
