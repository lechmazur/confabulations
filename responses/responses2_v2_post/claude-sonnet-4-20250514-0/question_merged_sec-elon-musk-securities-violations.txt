<other>I need to look for information about Twitter's stock price changes between Musk's initial purchases in January 2022 and his disclosure in April 2022.</other>

<other>The article states that Musk started buying Twitter stock in late January 2022, and he disclosed his stake on April 4. After he announced his position, Twitter's stock shot up more than 27 percent. However, this only tells me about the increase after his disclosure, not the total increase from his initial purchases to his disclosure.</other>

<other>The article doesn't provide information about what the stock price was when he started buying in January versus what it was when he disclosed in April. It only mentions the 27% increase that happened after his April 4 disclosure.</other>
