<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions Edison registered a fault at its Gould substation about five miles away from what is believed to be the origin point of the Eaton fire, but this is describing the Eaton fire itself, not another fire. The article mentions the Hurst fire but doesn't provide information about its distance from a substation.</other>

<other>The company with sensors is Whisker Labs, which is based in Germantown, Md., not Austin, Texas. The Austin, Texas-based entity mentioned is lawyer Mikal C. Watts who is representing wildfire victims, not a company with sensors.</other>
