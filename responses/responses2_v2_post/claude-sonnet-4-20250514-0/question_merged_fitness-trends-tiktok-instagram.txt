<other>I need to look for information about weekly strength training sessions recommended by a Chicago-based coach for full-body conditioning without equipment.</other>

<other>Looking through the article, I see Robyn LaLonde is mentioned as "the head coach and owner of Edge Athlete Lounge in Chicago." The article states: "practice a full-body strength training routine twice a week, said Robyn LaLonde, the head coach and owner of Edge Athlete Lounge in Chicago. If you prefer to work out at home, you can still build strength with little or no equipment."</other>

<other>The recommendation is "twice a week" which equals 2 sessions per week. This is specifically about full-body strength training and mentions it can be done with little or no equipment.</other>
