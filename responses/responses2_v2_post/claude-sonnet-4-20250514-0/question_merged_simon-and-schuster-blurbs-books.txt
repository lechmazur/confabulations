<other>I need to find information about how many exceptions Rebecca Makkai made to her "no blurbs" policy in the year she decided to protect her time.</other>

<other>Looking at the text, it mentions that she decided 2023 would be the year when she protected her time and blurbed next to nothing. However, she ended up with 18 books to blurb in the summer and fall alone. The text doesn't specifically state how many exceptions she made to her policy - it only mentions that she ended up blurbing 18 books in summer and fall, but doesn't clarify if these were exceptions to a policy or if she hadn't yet implemented the hard-line policy.</other>
