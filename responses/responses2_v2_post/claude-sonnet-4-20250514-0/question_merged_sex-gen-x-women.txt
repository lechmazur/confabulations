<other>I need to find information about the vogueing house and the author's newspaper job to determine the timeline and calculate how many members were still alive.</other>

<other>From the text: In 1991, when the author was 18 and starting college, she was in a vogueing house that won Montreal's first vogue ball. By 1992, two out of the five members of the house were dead from AIDS, and one was H.I.V. positive. This means 2 members were alive by 1992 (5 total - 2 dead - 1 who was H.I.V. positive but still alive = 2).</other>

<other>The author mentions working at a Montreal newspaper where she endured editorial meetings sitting on the lap of her editor. However, the text doesn't specify exactly when this newspaper job occurred in relation to the 1992 timeframe when 2 members of the vogueing house were confirmed alive.</other>

<other>Since I cannot determine the exact timing of when the editorial meetings occurred relative to the 1992 status of the vogueing house members, I cannot definitively answer how many were still alive at that specific time.</other>
