<other>I need to look for information about what a Democratic congressman filed against President Trump after he announced his plan for Greenland, as mentioned by Jimmy Fallon.</other>

<other>Looking through the article, I can see Jimmy Fallon's quotes. The relevant quote is: "After Trump announced his plan for Gaza, a Democratic congressman said he is filing articles of impeachment against him." However, this quote mentions Gaza, not Greenland specifically.</other>

<other>The question asks specifically about what was filed after Trump announced his plan for Greenland, but the Jimmy Fallon quote only mentions filing articles of impeachment after the Gaza plan announcement. Since the question is specifically about the Greenland plan and the article only mentions the filing in relation to the Gaza plan, I cannot directly answer this question.</other>
