<other>I need to find information about David Munrow's instrument and what instruments were used in "Farinelli and the King." The article mentions David Munrow was a recorder player who studied early music, and this influenced Ms. van Kampen's interest in Renaissance music. However, the article does not specify which instruments were used in "Farinelli and the King" - it only mentions the Elizabethan instruments used in the 2013 productions of "Twelfth Night" and "Richard III" at the Belasco.</other>
