<other>I need to find information about the combined market capitalization of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, but specifically on the day of Trump's inauguration. Let me search through the article for this information.</other>

<other>The article mentions: "The $TRUMP and $MELANIA cryptocurrency tokens, introduced just days before President Trump's inauguration, had a combined market cap of about $6 billion as of Friday." However, this gives the market cap "as of Friday" rather than specifically on inauguration day. The question asks specifically for the market cap on the day of Trump's inauguration, not on Friday.</other>
