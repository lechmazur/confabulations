<other>I need to carefully read the final section about immigration and Guantanamo Bay to find information about migrants with gang affiliations.</other>

<other>The article states: "The Trump administration is holding 10 migrants with suspected gang affiliations in the same prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba that has housed men accused of being members of Al Qaeda, U.S. defense officials said. U.S Forces are also preparing a tent city to house as many as 30,000 migrants."</other>

<other>The question asks specifically about migrants in the tent city, but the article says the 10 migrants with gang affiliations are being held "in the same prison" that housed Al Qaeda members, not in the tent city. The tent city is being prepared for up to 30,000 migrants, but no specific number of gang-affiliated migrants in the tent city is mentioned.</other>
