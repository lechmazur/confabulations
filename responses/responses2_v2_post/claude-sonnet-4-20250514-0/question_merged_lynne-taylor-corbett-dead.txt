<other>I need to look for information about a ballet that was described as a "whopping success" by a New York Post critic. Let me examine the article carefully.</other>

<other>The article mentions "Great Galloping Gottschalk" (1982) as her breakout ballet. It says this received a review from Anna Kisselgoff in The New York Times, and that Ms. Kisselgoff acknowledged it was "cheerful and uplifting" and a "whopping success with the public." However, the question specifically asks about a New York Post critic, but the article only mentions a New York Times critic making this comment.</other>
