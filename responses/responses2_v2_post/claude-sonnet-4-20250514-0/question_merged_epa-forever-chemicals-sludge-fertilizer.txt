<other>I need to look for information about Consumer Reports criticizing a federal agency's 2019 testing protocol for failing to detect PFAS in 80% of organic milk samples. Let me examine the article carefully.</other>

<other>The article mentions that "The Food and Drug Administration does not set limits on PFAS levels in food. Since 2019, however, the agency has tested nearly 1,300 samples of food and said a vast majority were free of the types of PFAS the agency is able to screen for. Some public health experts and advocacy groups have questioned the testing methodology, and the agency itself says that 'PFAS exposure from food is an emerging area of science and there remains much we do not yet know.' Consumer Reports said last year that it had detected PFAS in some milk, including milk from organic brands."</other>

<other>The article mentions FDA testing since 2019 and Consumer Reports detecting PFAS in milk including organic brands, but it does not specifically state that Consumer Reports criticized the FDA's 2019 testing protocol for failing to detect PFAS in 80% of organic milk samples. The question asks for very specific details that are not provided in the article.</other>
