<other>I need to find information about the cost of extending the 2017 tax cuts and the revenue from a 20% universal tariff to calculate the total projected cost.</other>

<other>From the article: "Continuing the tax cuts is expected to cost more than $4 trillion over the next decade" and "The Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank, estimates that a 20 percent universal tariff would raise $3.3 trillion from 2025 through 2034."</other>

<other>The question asks for the total projected cost, but the tariff would raise revenue (not cost money), so this would offset some of the tax cut costs. However, the question specifically asks for "total projected cost of both" which doesn't make sense since one is a cost and one generates revenue. The question seems to have an incorrect premise.</other>
