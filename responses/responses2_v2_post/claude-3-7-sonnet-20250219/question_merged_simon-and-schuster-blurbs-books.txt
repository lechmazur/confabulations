<other>Let me check what the article says about the author making exceptions to her "no blurbs" policy. The article states: "First, I had decided that 2023 would be the year when I protected my time and blurbed next to nothing. And yet I ended up with 18 books to blurb in the summer and fall alone." It also mentions "Second, I got a blurb request for a friend through their publisher. This friend is someone I admire, who did something nice for me once, and I was willing to make one of those exceptions at what was otherwise an extremely busy time." So it seems she made at least one explicit exception, but the article doesn't clearly state how many of the 18 books were exceptions versus how many were commitments made before her decision.</other>
