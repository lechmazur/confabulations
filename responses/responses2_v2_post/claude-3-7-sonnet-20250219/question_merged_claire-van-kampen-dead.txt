<other>The article mentions that David Munrow was "a charismatic recorder player who studied and performed early music" and that Ms. van Kampen gained an interest in Renaissance music during her girlhood thanks to meeting him. The article also lists instruments used in the pit band for productions of "Twelfth Night" and "Richard III" at the Belasco in 2013, including "shawm, sackbut, theorbo, hurdy-gurdy, cittern, tabor and rauschpfeife." However, the article doesn't specifically state which of these instruments (if any) were featured in "Farinelli and the King" or which one Munrow mastered that influenced van Kampen's choices for that production.</other>
