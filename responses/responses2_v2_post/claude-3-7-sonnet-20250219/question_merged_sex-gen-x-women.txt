<other>The article states: "In 1991, when I was 18 and starting college, I was in a vogueing house that won Montreal's first vogue ball. By 1992, two out of the five members of the house were dead from AIDS, and one was H.I.V. positive." However, the article doesn't specify when the author's newspaper editor was sitting on her lap during editorial meetings. It mentions she worked at a Montreal newspaper after college, but doesn't connect these two time periods directly. Therefore, I cannot determine how many members were still alive at the specific time of the lap-sitting incident.</other>
