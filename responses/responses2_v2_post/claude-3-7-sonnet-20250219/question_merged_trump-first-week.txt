<other>Let me check the article for information about the market capitalization of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins on the day of Trump's inauguration. The article states: "The $TRUMP and $MELANIA cryptocurrency tokens, introduced just days before President Trump's inauguration, had a combined market cap of about $6 billion as of Friday." However, this refers to their value as of Friday after the inauguration, not specifically on the day of inauguration itself.</other>
