<other>The article mentions that Amsterdam began targeting overtourism in 2016 but does not specify the exact measure taken at that time. It only references later actions in 2024, such as restricting hotel room additions, but not the 2016 measure. Barcelona's 2012 tourist tax is cited as a separate example, and no direct equivalent for Amsterdam in 2016 is provided.</other>
