<other>The article mentions David Munrow as a recorder player but does not explicitly state that the recorder was featured in the pit band for "Farinelli and the King." The listed instruments include shawm, sackbut, theorbo, etc., but not the recorder. Since the question requires a direct answer from the text, the specific instrument linked to Munrow's mastery in this context is not confirmed.</other>
