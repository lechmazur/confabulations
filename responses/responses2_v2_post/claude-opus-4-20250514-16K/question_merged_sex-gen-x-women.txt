<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article states that by 1992, 2 out of 5 members of the vogueing house were dead from AIDS, leaving 3 alive at that time. However, the newspaper job where the lap-sitting occurred was after the author finished college (sometime after 1991), and the article doesn't specify what happened to the remaining vogueing house members between 1992 and when she worked at the newspaper.</other>
