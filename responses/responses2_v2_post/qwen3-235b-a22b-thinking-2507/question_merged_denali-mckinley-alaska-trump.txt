<other>The article states that "U.S Forces are also preparing a tent city to house as many as 30,000 migrants" in the final section, but it specifies that the 10 migrants with suspected gang affiliations are being held "in the same prison in Guantanamo Bay," not in the tent city. The tent city is described as being prepared, indicating it is not yet operational and no migrants are currently held there. The question asks for the number of migrants accused of gang affiliations currently held in the tent city, which is not provided in the text and cannot be inferred as the tent city is not in use. Since the premise of migrants being held in the tent city is incorrect based on the article, the answer is N/A per instructions for incorrect premises.</other>
