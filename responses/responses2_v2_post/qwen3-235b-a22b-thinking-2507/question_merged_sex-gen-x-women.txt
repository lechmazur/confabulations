<other>First, I need to find information about the author's vogueing house and when the editorial meetings occurred. The article states: "In 1991, when I was 18 and starting college, I was in a vogueing house that won Montreal's first vogue ball. By 1992, two out of the five members of the house were dead from AIDS, and one was H.I.V. positive." This means 2 members were dead by 1992, leaving 3 alive (1 HIV positive + 2 HIV negative). The editorial meetings where the editor sat on her lap happened "by the time I finished college" which would be after 1992 (since she started college in 1991 at age 18). The article doesn't specify what happened to the HIV-positive member between 1992 and when she finished college. We only know for certain that 2 members (the HIV-negative ones) were still alive by the time of the editorial meetings. The HIV-positive member's status is unknown, so we can only confirm 2 members were still alive.</other>
