<other>The article states that after Musk disclosed his stake on April 4, Twitter's stock increased by more than 27 percent. However, the question asks for the stock price increase between Musk's initial share purchases in late January 2022 and his disclosure in early April 2022. The text does not provide any specific information about the stock price change during this period, only mentioning that Musk bought shares at an "artificially low price" and underpaid by at least $150 million, which refers to the financial impact on Musk rather than the stock price increase amount. Since the exact increase (in percentage or dollar terms) from January to April is not stated or logically inferable, the answer is N/A.</other>
