<other>Looking at the article for figures on the cost of extending the 2017 tax cuts and the cost of implementing a 20% universal tariff. The article states that extending the tax cuts "is expected to cost more than $4 trillion over the next decade." For the tariff, it says a 20% universal tariff "would raise $3.3 trillion," which is revenue, not a cost. The question asks for the "total projected cost" of both, but implementing the tariff generates revenue, so there is no "cost" figure provided for it in the text. Additionally, the tax cuts cost is given as "more than $4 trillion," not an exact number, and the total combined cost is not specified or logically inferable as a single figure. Since the premise of a "cost" for implementing the tariff is incorrect (it's revenue) and no specific total is provided, the answer should be N/A.</other>
