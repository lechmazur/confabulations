<other>The article states that Jimmy Fallon mentioned a Democratic congressman filing articles of impeachment against President Trump after Trump announced his plan for Gaza, not Greenland. The question incorrectly references a "plan for Greenland," which the article does not associate with the impeachment filing; Greenland is only mentioned by Fallon as part of a separate joke about Trump's desires, not an actual announced plan. Since the premise of the question is factually incorrect based on the text, the answer must be N/A.</other>
