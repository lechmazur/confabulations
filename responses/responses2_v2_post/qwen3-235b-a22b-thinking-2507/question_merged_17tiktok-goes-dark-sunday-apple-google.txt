<other>The question asks for the month when the legislative body (Congress) approved the bill that Biden signed into law. The article states: "President Biden signed the TikTok ban bill into law in April after it passed Congress with bipartisan support." This indicates Biden signed it in April, but the text does not specify the month when Congress passed/approved the bill. The phrase "after it passed Congress" confirms Congress approved it before April, but the exact month of congressional approval is not provided. Since the question specifically asks for the month of legislative body approval and the article only gives the signing month (April), the answer is N/A.</other>
