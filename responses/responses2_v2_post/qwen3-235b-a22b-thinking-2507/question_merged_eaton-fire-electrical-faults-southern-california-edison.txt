<other>For question 1, the article states Edison reported the Gould substation was "about five miles away from what is believed to be the origin point of the fire" specifically for the Eaton fire. It mentions the Hurst fire as a "separate fire" but provides no distance information about its origin point relative to any substation. No other fire is described with an origin point located about five miles from a substation in Edison's report.</other>

<other>For question 2, the article identifies Whisker Labs as the company with sensors detecting electrical problems, stating it is "based in Germantown, Md." The only Austin, Texas reference is to lawyer Mikal C. Watts, not a sensor company. The question premise incorrectly states the sensor company is Austin-based, but the article specifies Maryland as Whisker Labs' location. No Austin-based company is described as having these sensors.</other>
