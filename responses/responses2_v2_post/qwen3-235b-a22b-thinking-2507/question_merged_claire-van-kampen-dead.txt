<other>The article states that David Munrow was "a charismatic recorder player who studied and performed early music," indicating he mastered the recorder. However, for the Broadway production of "Farinelli and the King," the article describes the musical elements as featuring "period arias by Handel and Porpora" and mentions that "musicians and audience members sit onstage," but it does not specify any instruments used in the pit band for this play. The instrument list provided (shawm, sackbut, theorbo, hurdy-gurdy, cittern, tabor, rauschpfeife) is explicitly for the 2013 productions of "Twelfth Night" and "Richard III," not for "Farinelli and the King." Since the text lacks direct information about the pit band instruments for "Farinelli and the King," the specific instrument cannot be identified, and the answer must be N/A per the instructions.</other>
