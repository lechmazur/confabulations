merged_overtourism-bans-fees-barcelona-greece.txt
<other>The question asks for the specific measure Amsterdam began implementing in 2016 to address overtourism, similar to Barcelona's tourist tax in 2012. The article states that Amsterdam "began targeting overtourism in 2016" but does not specify any particular measure implemented that year. While Barcelona's actions are detailed (tourist tax in 2012, short-term rental restrictions in 2015, hotel construction cap in 2017), no equivalent specific measure for Amsterdam in 2016 is mentioned. The article references Amsterdam imposing measures in 2024 related to short-term rentals, but this is not relevant to 2016. Since the text lacks information on what specific action Amsterdam took in 2016, and it cannot be logically inferred from the given facts, the answer must be N/A.</other>
