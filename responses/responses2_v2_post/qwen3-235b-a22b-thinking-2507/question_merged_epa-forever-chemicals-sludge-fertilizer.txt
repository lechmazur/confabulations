<other>The question asks about a federal agency's 2019 testing protocol criticized by Consumer Reports for failing to detect PFAS in 80% of organic milk samples. The article mentions the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) tested food since 2019 and that Consumer Reports detected PFAS in some milk, including organic brands. However, the article does not specify any percentage (such as 80%) for the detection failure, nor does it state that Consumer Reports criticized the FDA's protocol for this specific reason with that figure. The 80% claim is not present in the text and cannot be logically inferred, so the answer is N/A.</other>
