<other>The question asks about the number of exceptions made to the "no blurbs" policy by the author of "The Great Believers" (Rebecca Makkai) in the year she decided to protect her time. The article states: "I had decided that 2023 would be the year when I protected my time and blurbed next to nothing... I got a blurb request for a friend through their publisher... I was willing to make one of those exceptions." It explicitly describes her making one exception for a friend's book. The phrase "If I make one exception, I'll make 50" is a hypothetical warning, not a statement of additional exceptions actually made that year. No other specific exceptions are mentioned as having been carried out in 2023.</other>
