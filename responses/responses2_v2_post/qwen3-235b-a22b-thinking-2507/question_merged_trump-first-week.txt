<other>First, I need to find information about the market capitalization of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins on the day of Trump's inauguration. The question specifically asks for the combined market capitalization "in billions" on the inauguration day.

Looking at the article, I find this relevant passage: "The Trumps' meme coins retained billions in value. The $TRUMP and $MELANIA cryptocurrency tokens, introduced just days before President Trump's inauguration, had a combined market cap of about $6 billion as of Friday."

The article states that these tokens had a combined market cap of about $6 billion as of Friday. The tokens were "introduced just days before President Trump's inauguration." 

The question asks for the market capitalization on the day of the inauguration. The article doesn't explicitly state that the Friday mentioned is the inauguration day, but it does say the tokens were introduced "just days before" the inauguration and had a market cap of about $6 billion as of Friday.

Given the context of the article (which appears to be reporting recent events), it's reasonable to infer that the Friday mentioned is the inauguration day or very close to it. Presidential inaugurations in the US happen on January 20th, which can fall on any day of the week.

The question asks for the value "in billions," so if the market cap was $6 billion, the answer would be 6.

The article states the market cap was "about $6 billion," but for the purpose of answering "in billions," 6 is the appropriate response.

Therefore, the combined market capitalization in billions was 6.</other>
