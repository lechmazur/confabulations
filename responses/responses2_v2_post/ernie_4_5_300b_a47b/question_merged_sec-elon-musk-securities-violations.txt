<other>First, I will review the article for any information related to the total amount Twitter's stock price increased between Musk's initial share purchases in January 2022 and his disclosure in April. The article mentions that after Musk announced his position, Twitter's stock shot up more than 27 percent. However, it does not provide specific figures for the total dollar increase or the stock price at the time of initial purchases. Without this information, I cannot calculate the total amount of increase.</other>
