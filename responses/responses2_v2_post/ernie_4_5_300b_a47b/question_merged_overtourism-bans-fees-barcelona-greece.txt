<other>First, I will identify the relevant parts of the article that discuss Amsterdam's measures to address overtourism. The article mentions that Amsterdam began targeting overtourism in 2016. It also discusses measures like capping new hotel construction and a tourist tax. The question asks for a specific measure similar to Barcelona's initial tourist tax in 2012, which was implemented to address overtourism. From the article, it is clear that Amsterdam implemented a tourist tax as part of its early attempts to manage tourist impacts.</other>
