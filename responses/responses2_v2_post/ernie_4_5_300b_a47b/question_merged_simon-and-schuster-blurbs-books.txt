<other>First, I will identify the relevant section of the article that discusses the author's "no blurbs" policy and exceptions. The author mentions deciding to protect her time and having a "hard-line no blurbs policy" but also describes making an exception for a friend's book. She explicitly states that making one exception would lead to more, so she needed a strict policy. The article then mentions the single exception she made for her friend.</other>
