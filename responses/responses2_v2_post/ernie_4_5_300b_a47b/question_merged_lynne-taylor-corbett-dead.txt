<other>First, I need to find the ballet title that was described as a "whopping success" by a critic. The article mentions Anna Kisselgoff's review in The New York Times, not The New York Post, but it refers to a ballet called "Great Galloping Gottschalk" as a "whopping success with the public." Since the question specifies a *New York Post* critic, but the article only mentions The New York Times, I need to confirm if this is the intended answer or if there's another ballet mentioned. The article does not mention any ballet reviewed by The New York Post, so the closest match is "Great Galloping Gottschalk" from The New York Times review.</other>
