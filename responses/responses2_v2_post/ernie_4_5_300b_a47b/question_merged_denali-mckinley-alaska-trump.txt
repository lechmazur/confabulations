<other>First, I will review the article to find information related to the question about migrants held in Guantanamo Bay. The relevant section mentions that the Trump administration is holding 10 migrants with suspected gang affiliations in the same prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. It does not mention a tent city but rather a prison. The question specifically asks about the tent city, which is not described in the article.</other>
