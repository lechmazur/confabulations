<other>First, I need to find information about the author's vogueing house and the editorial meetings. The article states: "In 1991, when I was 18 and starting college, I was in a vogueing house that won Montreal's first vogue ball. By 1992, two out of the five members of the house were dead from AIDS, and one was H.I.V. positive." This means by 1992, 2 members were dead, 1 was HIV-positive (but alive), and 2 were alive and presumably not HIV-positive. The editorial meetings happened later, when the author worked at the Montreal newspaper after finishing college. Since the mortality update is from 1992 and the editorial meetings occurred after college (post-1991), the status described in 1992 applies to the time of the meetings. Therefore, 2 members were still alive.</other>
