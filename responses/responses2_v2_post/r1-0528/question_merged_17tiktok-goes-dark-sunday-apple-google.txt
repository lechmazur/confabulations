<other>I am considering the article text. The article states: "President Biden signed the TikTok ban bill into law in April after it passed Congress with bipartisan support." This mentions the month the bill was signed (April) and that it passed Congress, but it does not specify the month when Congress passed/approved the bill. The question specifically asks for the month the legislative body approved the bill, not the month it was signed. Since the text does not provide the month of Congressional approval, the answer must be N/A.</other>
