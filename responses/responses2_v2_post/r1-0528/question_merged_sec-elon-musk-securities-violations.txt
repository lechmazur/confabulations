<other>I need to answer only based on the article provided. The question asks for the total amount Twitter's stock price increased between Musk's initial share purchases in January 2022 and his disclosure in April. The article states: "After he announced his position, Twitter's stock shot up more than 27 percent." This describes the increase *after* the disclosure announcement, not the total increase between January (when purchases began) and April (when disclosure happened). The article does not provide a figure for the total price change across that entire January-April period. Therefore, the exact information requested is not available in the text.</other>
