<other>I need to answer based solely on the article provided. The question asks about a specific federal agency's 2019 testing protocol criticized by Consumer Reports for failing to detect PFAS in 80% of organic milk samples. The article mentions the FDA testing food samples since 2019 and Consumer Reports detecting PFAS in some milk, including organic brands. However, it does not specify any criticism by Consumer Reports about the FDA's testing protocol failing to detect PFAS in 80% of organic milk samples. The article also doesn't mention any other federal agency's testing protocol for milk in 2019. Therefore, the exact information required to answer this question is not present in the article.</other>
