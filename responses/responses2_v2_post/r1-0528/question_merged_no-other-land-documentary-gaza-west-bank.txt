<other>I need to determine the number of consecutive years of home demolitions shown in "No Other Land" based solely on the article. The article states: "The film captures this destruction between 2019 and 2023 and in archival footage from Adra's family." The phrase "between 2019 and 2023" indicates a time span. Calculating the consecutive years: 2019 to 2020 is the first year, 2020 to 2021 is the second, 2021 to 2022 is the third, and 2022 to 2023 is the fourth. This totals 4 consecutive years. The archival footage is included but not dated separately, so the explicit 2019-2023 range is used. Therefore, the answer is 4.</other>
