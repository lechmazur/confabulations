merged_simon-and-schuster-blurbs-books.txt

<other>I need to find information about exceptions to the author's "no blurbs" policy in the year she decided to protect her time. The article states: "I realized I needed a hard-line no blurbs policy. If I make one exception, I'll make 50." It later mentions making "one of those exceptions" for a friend's book. However, the question asks for the number of exceptions made *in the year she decided to protect her time*, and the text doesn't specify how many exceptions were actually made under this policy. The 18 blurbs mentioned occurred *before* she established the hard-line policy. Therefore, no specific number of exceptions under the policy is provided.</other>
