<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The text provides the cost of extending the 2017 tax cuts ($4 trillion) and the revenue generated from a 20% universal tariff ($3.3 trillion) separately, but it does not provide a total projected cost for both actions combined. Therefore, we cannot directly calculate the total cost as the question implies a simple addition which may not be the case as one is a cost and the other is revenue.</other>
