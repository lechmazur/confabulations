<other>The article states that by 1992, two out of the five members of the author's vogueing house were dead from AIDS, and one was H.I.V. positive. So, 5 - 2 - 1 = 2 were still alive by 1992. However, the article does not provide a direct timeline between the events described (winning Montreal's first vogue ball in 1991 and the editorial meetings). It is mentioned that the author finished college before working at the newspaper where she endured editorial meetings sitting on her editor's lap. Assuming the events are in the described order and not too far apart in time, we can infer that there were at least 3 members alive when the author was in college and started working at the newspaper, but the exact timing is not certain.</other>
