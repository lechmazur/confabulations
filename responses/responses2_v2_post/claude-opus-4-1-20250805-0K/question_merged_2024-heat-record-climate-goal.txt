<other>The question asks about a specific funding mechanism that was mentioned indirectly in relation to a country that never backed the goal. The article mentions that China and India never backed the 1.5-degree goal. The article also mentions that "Rich countries that were struggling to cut their own emissions began choking off funding in the developing world for fossil-fuel projects that were economically beneficial." However, this doesn't specify what the funding mechanism was - it just says "funding" was choked off for fossil-fuel projects. The question asks for a specific funding mechanism, which is not provided in the text.</other>
