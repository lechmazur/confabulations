<other>The article states that continuing the tax cuts is expected to cost more than $4 trillion over the next decade. It also states that a 20 percent universal tariff would raise $3.3 trillion from 2025 through 2034. The question asks for the total projected cost of both extending the tax cuts AND implementing the tariff. However, the tariff would raise revenue, not cost money. So the question seems to be asking for incompatible things - a cost for the tax cuts and a cost for the tariff, when the tariff generates revenue. The article doesn't provide a "cost" for implementing the tariff, only the revenue it would generate.</other>
