<other>The question asks about a specific measure Amsterdam began implementing in 2016, similar to Barcelona's tourist tax from 2012. Let me check what the article says about Amsterdam in 2016.</other>

<other>The article states: "In Amsterdam, which began targeting overtourism in 2016, arrivals are expected to climb to 26 million in 2026." This mentions Amsterdam began "targeting overtourism" in 2016 but doesn't specify what specific measure similar to Barcelona's tourist tax was implemented.</other>

<other>The article also mentions Amsterdam imposed measures like halting new hotel construction in 2024 and preventing accommodations from adding more rooms or beds in November, but these are from 2024, not 2016.</other>

<other>The article doesn't specify what exact measure Amsterdam implemented in 2016 to address overtourism that would be similar to Barcelona's tourist tax.</other>
