<other>The article mentions that Rebecca Makkai, who is the author of "The Great Believers," decided that 2023 would be the year when she protected her time and blurbed next to nothing. However, she ended up with 18 books to blurb in the summer and fall alone. The article doesn't specify that all 18 were exceptions she made - it just says she "ended up with" 18 books to blurb. It doesn't explicitly state how many exceptions she made to her policy.</other>
