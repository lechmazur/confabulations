<other>Looking at the final section of the article about immigration. It states that the Trump administration is holding 10 migrants with suspected gang affiliations in the same prison in Guantanamo Bay that has housed Al Qaeda suspects. It also mentions that U.S. Forces are preparing a tent city to house as many as 30,000 migrants. The question asks specifically about migrants accused of gang affiliations held in the tent city. The article says 10 migrants with suspected gang affiliations are held in a prison at Guantanamo Bay, not in the tent city. The tent city is being prepared to house up to 30,000 migrants, but the article doesn't specify how many of those would be accused of gang affiliations or how many are currently there.</other>
