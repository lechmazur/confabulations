<other>Looking at question 1: The article mentions Edison reported to state regulators about a fault at the Gould substation, which was about five miles away from what is believed to be the origin point of the fire. However, the question asks about which other fire's origin point was located about five miles from a substation according to Edison's report. The article doesn't say that Edison reported any other fire's origin point being five miles from a substation - it only says the Gould substation was five miles from the Eaton fire's believed origin point.</other>

<other>Looking at question 2: The article mentions Whisker Labs as a technology company based in Germantown, Md., that has sensors detecting electrical problems. The question asks for an Austin, Texas-based company, but Whisker Labs is described as being based in Germantown, Maryland, not Austin, Texas. There is no Austin, Texas-based company mentioned that has sensors detecting electrical problems.</other>
