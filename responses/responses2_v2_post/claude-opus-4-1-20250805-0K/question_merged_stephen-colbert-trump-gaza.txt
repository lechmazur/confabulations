<other>The question asks about what a Democratic congressman filed after Trump announced his plan for Greenland. However, the article states that "After Trump announced his plan for Gaza, a Democratic congressman said he is filing articles of impeachment against him." This is about Gaza, not Greenland. The article does mention Trump wanting to take over Greenland, but the impeachment filing is specifically mentioned in relation to the Gaza announcement, not Greenland.</other>
