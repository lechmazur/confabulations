<other>The question asks about the combined market capitalization of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins on the day of Trump's inauguration. The article states: "The $TRUMP and $MELANIA cryptocurrency tokens, introduced just days before President Trump's inauguration, had a combined market cap of about $6 billion as of Friday." However, this says "as of Friday" not specifically "on the day of Trump's inauguration." The article doesn't provide the specific market cap on inauguration day itself.</other>
