<other>I need to find information about the vogueing house members and when the editorial meetings occurred. The article states that in 1991, when the author was 18, she was in a vogueing house that won Montreal's first vogue ball. By 1992, two out of five members were dead from AIDS, and one was H.I.V. positive. So by 1992, there were 3 members still alive (5 total minus 2 dead). The article mentions the author worked at a Montreal newspaper where she endured editorial meetings sitting on her editor's lap, and this was after she finished college. However, the article doesn't specify exactly when these editorial meetings took place, making it impossible to determine how many vogueing house members were alive at that specific time.</other>
