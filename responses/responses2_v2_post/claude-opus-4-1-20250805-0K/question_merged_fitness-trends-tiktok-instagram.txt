<other>Looking at the article for information about strength training recommendations. I found that Robyn LaLonde, who is described as "the head coach and owner of Edge Athlete Lounge in Chicago," recommends practicing "a full-body strength training routine twice a week." The question asks about the maximum number recommended, and the article states "twice a week" which means 2 sessions per week.</other>
