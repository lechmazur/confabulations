<other>I need to find information about the vogueing house members and when the author worked at the newspaper with the editor.</other>

<other>From the text: "In 1991, when I was 18 and starting college, I was in a vogueing house that won Montreal's first vogue ball. By 1992, two out of the five members of the house were dead from AIDS, and one was H.I.V. positive." So there were 5 members total, 2 dead by 1992, and 1 H.I.V. positive (but still alive).</other>

<other>The newspaper job where she sat on her editor's lap happened after she finished college, which would be around 1995 since she started college in 1991.</other>

<other>By 1992, 3 members were still alive (1 H.I.V. positive + 2 others). However, the text doesn't provide information about what happened to these remaining members between 1992 and when she worked at the newspaper around 1995.</other>
