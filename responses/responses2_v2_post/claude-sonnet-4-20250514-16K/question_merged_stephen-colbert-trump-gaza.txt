<other>I need to look for information about what a Democratic congressman filed against President Trump after he announced his plan for Greenland.</other>

<other>The article mentions that Jimmy Fallon said "After Trump announced his plan for Gaza, a Democratic congressman said he is filing articles of impeachment against him." However, this is specifically about Gaza, not Greenland.</other>

<other>The article mentions Trump wanting to take over Greenland, Canada and Gaza Strip, but the Democratic congressman's filing is only mentioned in relation to the Gaza plan, not the Greenland plan.</other>
