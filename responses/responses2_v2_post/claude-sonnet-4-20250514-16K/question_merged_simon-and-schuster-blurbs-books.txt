<other>I need to identify the author of "The Great Believers" and find information about her "no blurbs" policy exceptions.</other>

<other>Rebecca Makkai is identified as the author of "The Great Believers." The article mentions she decided 2023 would be the year to protect her time and blurb next to nothing, but ended up with 18 books to blurb. She then realized she needed a hard-line no blurbs policy, saying "If I make one exception, I'll make 50."</other>

<other>The article doesn't specify exactly how many exceptions she made to her "no blurbs" policy. It mentions she was willing to make exceptions and describes one instance with a friend, but doesn't give a specific count of exceptions made.</other>
