<other>I need to look for information about the market capitalization of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins specifically on Trump's inauguration day.</other>

<other>The article mentions: "The $TRUMP and $MELANIA cryptocurrency tokens, introduced just days before President Trump's inauguration, had a combined market cap of about $6 billion as of Friday." However, this gives the market cap "as of Friday" but doesn't specify if Friday was the inauguration day or when exactly the inauguration occurred relative to Friday.</other>
