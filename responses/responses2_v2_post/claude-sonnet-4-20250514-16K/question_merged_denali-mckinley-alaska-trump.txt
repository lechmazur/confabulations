<other>I need to carefully examine the final section of the article about immigration and Guantanamo Bay to answer this question.</other>

<other>The article states that 10 migrants with suspected gang affiliations are being held in the same prison in Guantanamo Bay, and that U.S. Forces are preparing a tent city to house as many as 30,000 migrants. However, the article does not specify that migrants accused of gang affiliations are currently held in the tent city specifically - it mentions they are in the prison, while the tent city is being prepared for migrants generally.</other>
