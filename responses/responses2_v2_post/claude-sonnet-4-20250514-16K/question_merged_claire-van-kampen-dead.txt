<other>I need to look for information about David Munrow's instrument mastery and what instruments were used in the Broadway production of "Farinelli and the King."</other>

<other>The article mentions David Munrow was a recorder player. However, when I look for specific instruments mentioned for the "Farinelli and the King" Broadway production, I only find instruments listed for the 2013 "Twelfth Night" and "Richard III" productions at the Belasco, not for "Farinelli and the King."</other>
