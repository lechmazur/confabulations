<other>I need to analyze the article for information about tension between rich and poor countries over the 1.5-degree target and any specific funding mechanism that was choked off.</other>

<other>Looking at the relevant section: "China and India never backed the goal, since it required them to curb their use of coal, gas and oil at a pace they said would hamstring their development. Rich countries that were struggling to cut their own emissions began choking off funding in the developing world for fossil-fuel projects that were economically beneficial."</other>

<other>The article mentions that funding was choked off for fossil-fuel projects, but it doesn't specify what particular funding mechanism was used - just "funding" in general terms.</other>
