<other>I need to look for information about Twitter's stock price movement between January 2022 when Musk started buying shares and April 2022 when he disclosed his position.</other>

<other>The article mentions that Musk started buying Twitter stock in late January 2022 and disclosed his stake on April 4. It states that "After he announced his position, Twitter's stock shot up more than 27 percent." However, this describes the increase that happened after the disclosure, not the total increase from January to April.</other>

<other>The article does not provide information about the stock price when Musk started buying in January versus the price right before his disclosure in April. It only mentions the post-disclosure increase.</other>
