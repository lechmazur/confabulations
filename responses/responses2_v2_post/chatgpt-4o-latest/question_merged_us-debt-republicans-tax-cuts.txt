<other>First, I will extract the relevant figures from the article. The article states that extending the 2017 tax cuts is expected to cost more than $4 trillion over the next decade. It also states that a 20% universal tariff would raise $3.3 trillion from 2025 through 2034. Since the question asks for the total projected cost, I will sum these two figures.</other>

<answer>$4 trillion</answer>

<other>The article states that the 20% universal tariff would raise $3.3 trillion, not cost that amount. Since the question asks for the total projected cost, only the $4 trillion from extending the tax cuts qualifies as a cost.</other>
