<other>First, I will consider the information provided in the article. It mentions that Claire van Kampen had an interest in Renaissance music due to meeting David Munrow, a charismatic recorder player. However, the article does not specify that the recorder was featured in the pit band for the Broadway production of "Farinelli and the King." Instead, it lists other instruments like the shawm, sackbut, theorbo, hurdy-gurdy, cittern, tabor, and rauschpfeife for the productions of "Twelfth Night" and "Richard III." Since the question specifically asks about the Broadway production of "Farinelli and the King," and there is no mention of the recorder being used in that production, I must conclude that the answer is not available.</other>
