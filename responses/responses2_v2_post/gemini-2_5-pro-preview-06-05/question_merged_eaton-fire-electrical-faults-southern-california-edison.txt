<other>I will analyze the first question. The article states that Edison registered a fault at its Gould substation, which is "about five miles away from what is believed to be the origin point of the fire." The context makes it clear this refers to the Eaton fire. The question asks for another fire with this specific characteristic. The article mentions the Hurst fire but does not state its origin point was five miles from a substation. Therefore, the information is not in the article.

For the second question, I will look for the name of the company with the sensors and its location. The article says, "The network at Whisker Labs, a technology company based in Germantown, Md., began measuring electrical problems at homes throughout the Los Angeles region using sensors...". The question asks for the name of an "Austin, Texas-based company". The article identifies the company as Whisker Labs but states it is based in Germantown, Maryland. The only mention of Austin, Texas is in reference to a lawyer, Mikal C. Watts. Since the company mentioned is not based in Austin, Texas, the premise of the question is incorrect according to the article. Therefore, the answer is N/A.</other>
