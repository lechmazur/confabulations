<other>The user wants me to answer a question based on the provided article. The question asks for a specific instrument mastered by David Munrow that was featured in the pit band for "Farinelli and the King".

First, I will identify what instrument David Munrow played according to the article. The article states he was a "charismatic recorder player".

Second, I will look for information about the pit band for "Farinelli and the King". The article describes the staging of this play: "She had musicians and audience members sit onstage, as if they were all gathered at a royal court." However, it does not list the specific instruments used in the production of "Farinelli and the King".

The article *does* list instruments for other productions: "Under her direction, the show featured a pit band of musicians who played Elizabethan instruments like the shawm, sackbut, theorbo, hurdy-gurdy, cittern, tabor and rauschpfeife." This list is for the productions of "Twelfth Night" and "Richard III", not "Farinelli and the King".

Since the article does not state which instruments were used in the pit band for "Farinelli and the King," it is impossible to confirm if the recorder was one of them. The question's premise that an instrument mastered by Munrow was featured in that specific play's pit band is not supported by the text. Therefore, the answer is not available in the source text.</other>
