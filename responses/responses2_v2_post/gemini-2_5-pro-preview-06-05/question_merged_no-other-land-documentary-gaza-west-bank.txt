<other>The user wants me to answer a question based on the provided article. The question asks for the number of consecutive years of home demolitions shown in the film "No Other Land," including both original and archival footage.

I will scan the article for the relevant information. The article states, "The film captures this destruction between 2019 and 2023 and in archival footage from Adra's family."

The period "between 2019 and 2023" represents a consecutive span of 5 years (2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023). However, the question requires including the archival footage in the count. The article does not specify the year or years of the archival footage. Without knowing the dates of the archival footage, it is impossible to determine if it is consecutive with the 2019-2023 period or what the total number of consecutive years shown is. For example, if the archival footage was from 2018, the consecutive period would be 6 years. If it was from 2010, the longest consecutive period shown would be 5 years. Since this information is not provided, I cannot answer the question. Therefore, the answer is N/A.</other>
