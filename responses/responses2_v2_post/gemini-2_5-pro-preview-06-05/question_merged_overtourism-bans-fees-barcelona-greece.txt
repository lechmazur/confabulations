merged_overtourism-bans-fees-barcelona-greece.txt
<other>I will analyze the question to identify the core fact being asked for. The question asks for the specific measure Amsterdam began implementing in 2016. I will search the article for information about Amsterdam's actions in 2016. The article states, "In Amsterdam, which began targeting overtourism in 2016, arrivals are expected to climb to 26 million in 2026." This sentence indicates that Amsterdam started addressing overtourism in 2016, but it does not name a specific measure implemented in that year. Other mentions of Amsterdam's measures refer to 2024 and a later measure in November. Since the article does not specify what measure was implemented in 2016, the answer is not available in the provided text.</other>
