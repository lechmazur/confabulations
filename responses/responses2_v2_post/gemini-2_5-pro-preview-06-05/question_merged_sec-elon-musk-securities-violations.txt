<other>I need to find the total amount Twitter's stock price increased between January 2022 and April 2022. The article states that "Mr. Musk started buying up Twitter stock in late January 2022" and "did not disclose his stake until April 4". It then says, "After he announced his position, Twitter's stock shot up more than 27 percent." This 27 percent increase happened *after* the disclosure on April 4, not during the period between January and April. The article does not state the stock price change during that specific period. Therefore, the answer is not available in the text.</other>
