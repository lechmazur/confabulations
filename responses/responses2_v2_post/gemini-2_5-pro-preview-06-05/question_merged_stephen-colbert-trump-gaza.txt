<other>I will carefully read the question and the article to find the answer. The question asks what a Democratic congressman decided to file against President Trump after he announced his plan for Greenland, as mentioned by Jimmy Fallon. I will look for mentions of "Democratic congressman," "Greenland," and "Jimmy Fallon" in the text. The article quotes Jimmy Fallon saying, "After Trump announced his plan for Gaza, a Democratic congressman said he is filing articles of impeachment against him." This quote connects the filing of articles of impeachment to the plan for Gaza, not the plan for Greenland. The question is specifically about the plan for Greenland. Therefore, the article does not provide this information.</other>
