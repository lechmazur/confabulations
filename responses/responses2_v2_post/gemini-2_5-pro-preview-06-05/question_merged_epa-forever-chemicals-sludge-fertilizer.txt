<other>I will carefully read the question and the article to find the answer. The question asks which federal agency's 2019 testing protocol was criticized by Consumer Reports for a specific failure rate (80%) in organic milk samples. I will look for mentions of "Consumer Reports," "2019," "organic milk," and "80%." The article mentions the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) started testing in 2019 and that its methodology was questioned by "some public health experts and advocacy groups." It also mentions that "Consumer Reports said last year that it had detected PFAS in some milk, including milk from organic brands." However, the article does not state that Consumer Reports criticized the FDA's protocol, nor does it mention a failure rate of 80%. The question contains specific details not present in the text. Therefore, the answer is not available in the provided article.</other>
