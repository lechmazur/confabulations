<other>I will read the question carefully and locate the relevant section in the article. The question asks about a specific funding mechanism that was choked off in the developing world, in the context of tensions between rich and poor countries. The article states: "Rich countries that were struggling to cut their own emissions began choking off funding in the developing world for fossil-fuel projects that were economically beneficial." This sentence directly answers what was choked off, and it is in the paragraph discussing the tension and mentioning countries like China and India that did not back the 1.5-degree goal. The phrase "funding for fossil-fuel projects" is the description of what was choked off, which I will use as the answer.</other>
