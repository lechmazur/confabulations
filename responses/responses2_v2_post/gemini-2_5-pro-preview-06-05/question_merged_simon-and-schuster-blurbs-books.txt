<other>The user wants me to answer a question based on the provided article. The question asks for the number of exceptions the author made to her "no blurbs" policy in the year she decided to protect her time.

The article states: "I had decided that 2023 would be the year when I protected my time and blurbed next to nothing. And yet I ended up with 18 books to blurb in the summer and fall alone. I realized I needed a hard-line no blurbs policy. If I make one exception, I'll make 50."

The author's decision for 2023 was to blurb "next to nothing," not a strict "no blurbs" policy. The "hard-line no blurbs policy" was a realization she came to *after* ending up with 18 books to blurb. The article also mentions being "willing to make one of those exceptions" for a friend, but it does not provide a total count of exceptions made to her initial decision. It states she "ended up with 18 books to blurb," but does not explicitly label these as 18 exceptions. Since the exact number of exceptions is not stated, I cannot provide a specific number. Therefore, the answer is N/A.</other>
