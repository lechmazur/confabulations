<other>The user wants me to answer a question based on the provided article. The question asks for the "total projected cost" of two policies: extending tax cuts and implementing a universal tariff. I will look for the figures for each policy in the article. The article states that extending the tax cuts is "expected to cost more than $4 trillion over the next decade". It also states that a "20 percent universal tariff would raise $3.3 trillion from 2025 through 2034". The tariff is presented as a revenue source, not a cost to the government budget. The question asks for a "total projected cost" of both items. The article does not provide a single, combined figure for the "total cost" of these two policies. It provides a cost for one and a revenue for the other. Since the article does not provide the specific figure requested (a combined total cost), and because the question incorrectly frames the tariff revenue as a "cost" in the context of the government budget, the correct answer according to the instructions is "N/A".</other>
