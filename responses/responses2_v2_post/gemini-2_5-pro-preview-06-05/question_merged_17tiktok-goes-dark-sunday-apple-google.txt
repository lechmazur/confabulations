<other>The user wants me to answer a question based on the provided article. The question asks for the month in which the legislative body approved the TikTok bill. I will scan the article for information about the bill's passage through Congress. The article states, "President Biden signed the TikTok ban bill into law in April after it passed Congress with bipartisan support." This sentence specifies the month the bill was signed into law (April), but it only states that this happened *after* Congress passed it. It does not specify the month in which Congress passed the bill. It could have been April, or a previous month. Since the exact month of the congressional vote is not provided, I cannot answer the question directly from the text. Therefore, the correct response is "N/A".</other>
