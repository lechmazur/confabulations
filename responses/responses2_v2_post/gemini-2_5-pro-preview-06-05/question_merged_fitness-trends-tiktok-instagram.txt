<other>I will locate the part of the article that mentions a Chicago-based coach and their recommendations for strength training. The article states, "...practice a full-body strength training routine twice a week, said Robyn LaLonde, the head coach and owner of Edge Athlete Lounge in Chicago. If you prefer to work out at home, you can still build strength with little or no equipment." The coach recommends "twice a week". The question asks for the maximum number. Since the recommendation is a specific number, that is the only number provided, and thus it is the maximum number recommended in the text.</other>
