<other>Analyzing the article: The author is Rebecca Makkai, who wrote "The Great Believers." She decided in 2023 to protect her time and blurb next to nothing, but ended up blurbing 18 books in summer and fall 2023. She then realized she needed a hard-line "no blurbs" policy. She mentions making one exception for a friend's book, but the year of this exception is not specified. The question asks specifically for the number of exceptions to the "no blurbs" policy in the year she decided to protect her time (2023). Since the timing of the policy's start and the exception relative to 2023 is not clearly stated, and no number is directly given for exceptions to that specific policy in 2023, the answer is N/A.</other>
