<other>The article mentions that Rebecca Makkai (author of "The Great Believers") decided that 2023 would be the year when she protected her time and blurbed next to nothing. However, she ended up with 18 books to blurb in the summer and fall alone. The article doesn't specify if all 18 were exceptions or if she had initially planned to do some blurbing. It only states she "decided that 2023 would be the year when I protected my time and blurbed next to nothing" but then "ended up with 18 books to blurb." The exact number of exceptions is not clearly stated.</other>
