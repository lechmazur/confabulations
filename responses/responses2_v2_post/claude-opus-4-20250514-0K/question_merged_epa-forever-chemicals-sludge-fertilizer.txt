<other>Let me analyze the article for information about Consumer Reports criticizing a federal agency's 2019 testing protocol for failing to detect PFAS in organic milk samples.</other>

<other>The article mentions that "Since 2019, however, the agency has tested nearly 1,300 samples of food and said a vast majority were free of the types of PFAS the agency is able to screen for." The agency referred to here is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</other>

<other>The article also states: "Some public health experts and advocacy groups have questioned the testing methodology" and "Consumer Reports said last year that it had detected PFAS in some milk, including milk from organic brands."</other>

<other>However, the article does not specifically state that Consumer Reports criticized the FDA's 2019 testing protocol for failing to detect PFAS in 80% of organic milk samples. The article only mentions that Consumer Reports detected PFAS in some milk including organic brands, and that some groups questioned the FDA's testing methodology, but it doesn't provide the specific claim about 80% of organic milk samples.</other>
