<other>Let me examine the article for information about David Munrow and the instruments used in "Farinelli and the King".</other>

<other>The article mentions that Ms. van Kampen "gained an interest in Renaissance music during her girlhood thanks to meeting David Munrow, a charismatic recorder player who studied and performed early music." So David Munrow was a recorder player.</other>

<other>Regarding the pit band for "Farinelli and the King", the article does not mention any specific instruments used in that production. The article does mention instruments used in other productions like "Twelfth Night" and "Richard III" at the Belasco in 2013, which featured "Elizabethan instruments like the shawm, sackbut, theorbo, hurdy-gurdy, cittern, tabor and rauschpfeife." However, this was not for "Farinelli and the King".</other>

<other>The question asks specifically about instruments in the pit band for "Farinelli and the King" on Broadway. Since the article does not provide this information, I cannot answer the question.</other>
