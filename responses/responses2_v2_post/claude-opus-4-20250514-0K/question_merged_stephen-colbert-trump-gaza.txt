<other>Let me carefully read the article to find information about what a Democratic congressman filed against Trump according to Jimmy Fallon.</other>

<other>Looking through the article, I can see Jimmy Fallon is quoted saying: "After Trump announced his plan for Gaza, a Democratic congressman said he is filing articles of impeachment against him. Good luck with that. There's a better chance of turning Gaza into the Riviera of the Middle East."</other>

<other>The question asks specifically about Trump's plan for Greenland, but Jimmy Fallon's quote is about Trump's plan for Gaza, not Greenland. The article does mention Trump wanting to take over Greenland, Canada and Gaza, but the impeachment filing mentioned by Fallon is specifically stated to be after Trump announced his plan for Gaza.</other>
