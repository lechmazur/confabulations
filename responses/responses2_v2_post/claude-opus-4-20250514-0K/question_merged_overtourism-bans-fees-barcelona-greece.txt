<other>The article states: "In Amsterdam, which began targeting overtourism in 2016, arrivals are expected to climb to 26 million in 2026." This indicates Amsterdam began targeting overtourism in 2016, but doesn't specify what exact measure was implemented.</other>

<other>The article also mentions various measures Amsterdam has taken, including imposing restrictions on new hotel construction in 2024 and passing another measure in November preventing accommodations from adding more rooms or beds. However, these are from 2024, not 2016.</other>

<other>The article does not specify what particular measure Amsterdam implemented in 2016 to address overtourism.</other>
