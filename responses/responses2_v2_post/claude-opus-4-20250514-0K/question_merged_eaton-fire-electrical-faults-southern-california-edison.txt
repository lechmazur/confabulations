<other>Looking at question 1, it asks about another fire besides the Eaton fire whose origin point was located about five miles away from a substation according to Edison's report. The article mentions that Edison reported to state regulators about a fault at the Gould substation, which was "about five miles away from what is believed to be the origin point of the fire" - but this is referring to the Eaton fire itself, not another fire. The article mentions the Hurst fire as another fire, but doesn't say it was five miles from a substation.</other>

<other>For question 2, it asks about an Austin, Texas-based company whose sensors detected electrical problems. The article mentions Whisker Labs as the company with sensors that detected electrical problems, but states it is "based in Germantown, Md." not Austin, Texas. There is a mention of Mikal C. Watts, "a lawyer based in Austin, Texas," but he's not associated with a sensor company.</other>
