<other>The text mentions that continuing the tax cuts is expected to cost more than $4 trillion over the next decade. It also states that a 20% universal tariff would raise $3.3 trillion from 2025 through 2034. However, the question asks for the total projected cost of both extending the tax cuts AND implementing the tariff. The tariff raises revenue rather than costing money, so I would need to subtract the tariff revenue from the tax cut cost. But the text doesn't explicitly state what the combined net cost would be.</other>
