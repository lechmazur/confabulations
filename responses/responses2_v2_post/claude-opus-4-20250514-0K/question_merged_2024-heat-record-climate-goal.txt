<other>Looking at the article for information about funding mechanisms that were choked off. The article mentions that "Rich countries that were struggling to cut their own emissions began choking off funding in the developing world for fossil-fuel projects that were economically beneficial." However, the question asks about a "specific funding mechanism" that was "mentioned indirectly in relation to a country that never backed the goal." The article mentions China and India never backed the 1.5-degree goal, but doesn't mention any specific funding mechanism in relation to these countries. The article only mentions funding being choked off in general terms, not a specific mechanism.</other>
