<other>Looking at the article for information about strength training recommendations. I need to find what a Chicago-based coach recommends for full-body conditioning.</other>

<other>I found a relevant passage: "Instead of hunting for one move that can do it all, practice a full-body strength training routine twice a week, said Robyn LaLonde, the head coach and owner of Edge Athlete Lounge in Chicago."</other>

<other>The question asks about the maximum number of weekly sessions recommended. Robyn LaLonde, who is a Chicago-based coach, recommends practicing a full-body strength training routine twice a week.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>twice a week</answer>
