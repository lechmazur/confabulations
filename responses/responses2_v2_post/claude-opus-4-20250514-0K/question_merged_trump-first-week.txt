<other>Let me look for information about the market capitalization of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins on the day of Trump's inauguration. The article mentions these coins were "introduced just days before President Trump's inauguration" and gives their combined market cap as of Friday, but I need to check if it specifically states their value on inauguration day.</other>

<other>The article states: "The $TRUMP and $MELANIA cryptocurrency tokens, introduced just days before President Trump's inauguration, had a combined market cap of about $6 billion as of Friday." However, this is the value as of Friday, not specifically on the day of Trump's inauguration. The article does not provide the market capitalization value on inauguration day itself.</other>
