<other>Looking at the final section of the article about immigration and Guantanamo Bay. The article states "The Trump administration is holding 10 migrants with suspected gang affiliations in the same prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba that has housed men accused of being members of Al Qaeda" and then mentions "U.S Forces are also preparing a tent city to house as many as 30,000 migrants." The question asks specifically about migrants in the tent city, but the article only mentions 10 migrants in the prison, and that a tent city is being prepared. It doesn't say any migrants are currently in the tent city.</other>
