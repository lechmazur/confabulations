<other>The article mentions that "Great Galloping Gottschalk" (1982) was described as a "whopping success with the public" by Anna Kisselgoff in The New York Times, not by a New York Post critic. Since the question specifically asks about a New York Post critic, I cannot provide the answer based on the article.</other>
