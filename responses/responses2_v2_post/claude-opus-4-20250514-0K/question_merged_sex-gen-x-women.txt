<other>The author mentions that in 1991, when she was 18, she was in a vogueing house that won Montreal's first vogue ball. By 1992, two out of the five members were dead from AIDS, and one was H.I.V. positive. This means 2 members were still alive (5 total - 2 dead - 1 H.I.V. positive who may or may not have been alive = at least 2 alive). However, the article doesn't specify when the editor was sitting on her lap during editorial meetings - it only mentions this happened at "the Montreal newspaper where I worked" after she finished college. The timeline isn't clear enough to determine how many were alive at that specific time.</other>
