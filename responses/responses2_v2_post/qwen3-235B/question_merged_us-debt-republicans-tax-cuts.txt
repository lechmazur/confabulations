<answer>$7.3 trillion</answer>
<other>The text states that extending the 2017 tax cuts would cost over $4 trillion and a 20% universal tariff would raise $3.3 trillion. However, the question asks for the "total projected cost" of both actions. Since the tariff generates revenue (not a cost), combining the $4 trillion cost of tax cuts with the $3.3 trillion revenue from the tariff would not logically yield a total "cost." The text does not explicitly provide a combined figure for these two policies' fiscal impact, nor does it clarify whether the tariff revenue is intended to offset the tax cuts. Therefore, the correct response should be "N/A" because the text does not directly answer the question as phrased.</other>
