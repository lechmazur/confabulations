Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about a specific funding mechanism that was choked off in the developing world, related to countries that didn't back the 1.5-degree target. The article mentions that rich countries started choking off funding for fossil-fuel projects that were economically beneficial but would hinder the climate goal.

The key part here is the funding mechanism. The text says, "Rich countries that were struggling to cut their own emissions began choking off funding in the developing world for fossil-fuel projects..." So the mechanism here is funding for fossil-fuel projects. The question specifies the mechanism mentioned indirectly in relation to countries that never backed the goal (like China and India). The answer should be "funding for fossil-fuel projects" or similar. Since the exact term used in the article is "funding... for fossil-fuel projects," that's the direct answer. I need to make sure there's no other specific mechanism named. The article doesn't mention a named mechanism like the Green Climate Fund, just the general action of cutting funding for those projects. So the answer is "funding for fossil-fuel projects."
