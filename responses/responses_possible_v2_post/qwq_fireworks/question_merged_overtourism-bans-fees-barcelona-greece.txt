Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The question is asking about a specific measure Amsterdam began implementing in 2016 to address overtourism, similar to Barcelona's 2012 tourist tax. The user also mentions the conflict in Copenhagen and the UN's focus on arrivals, but the key part here is the measure in Amsterdam from 2016.

Looking back at the article, I need to find where Amsterdam is mentioned. The article states: "Amsterdam, which began targeting overtourism in 2016, arrivals are expected to climb to 26 million in 2026." Wait, that's a mention of when they started, but what specific measure? Let me check again.

Further down, there's a part: "Amsterdam, after imposing a similar measure in 2024, only to discover that some accommodations were exploiting a loophole, passed another measure in November that prevents them from adding more rooms or beds to their offerings." Hmm, that's 2024, not 2016. 

Looking again, the article mentions Barcelona's actions: "Barcelona began restricting short-term rentals in 2015 and capped new hotel construction in 2017." But the question is about Amsterdam's 2016 measure. Let me scan again. 

Wait, here's another part: "In Amsterdam, which began targeting overtourism in 2016..." but the specifics? The article also says "Amsterdam... passed another measure in November [2024] that prevents them from adding more rooms or beds." But that's after 2016. The question is about what they did in 2016. 

Wait, maybe I missed another part. Let me check the section again. The article says: "Amsterdam, after imposing a similar measure in 2024, only to discover that some accommodations were exploiting a loophole, passed another measure in November that prevents them from adding more rooms or beds to their offerings." So the 2024 measure was about adding rooms/beds. The 2016 measure isn't explicitly named here. 

Wait, the user is asking for a measure similar to Barcelona's 2012 tourist tax. Barcelona's first action was a tourist tax in 2012. So the question is, what did Amsterdam do in 2016 that's similar (like a tax or restriction). The article mentions that in 2016, Amsterdam started targeting overtourism, but the specific measure isn't listed. The only specific measures mentioned for Amsterdam are the 2024 actions. 

Wait, maybe in another part. Let me check again. The article says: "In Amsterdam, which began targeting overtourism in 2016, arrivals are expected to climb to 26 million in 2026." But no specific measure given for 2016. The only specific measures mentioned for Amsterdam are the 2024 ones. 

Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A because the article doesn't specify the 2016 measure. But the question says "similar to Barcelona's initial tourist tax in 2012"—so Barcelona's first step was a tax. The question is asking what Amsterdam did in 2016, similar to that. The article says that in 2016 Amsterdam began targeting overtourism, but the specific measure isn't named here. The only specific actions mentioned for Amsterdam are the 2024 ones. Therefore, perhaps the answer is N/A because the article doesn't state the specific 2016 measure. Wait, but maybe I missed it. Let me read again carefully.

Wait, looking at the section after: "Barcelona, for example, implemented its first tourist tax in 2012, began restricting short-term rentals in 2015 and capped new hotel construction in 2017. Yet tourists continued to arrive..." Then later, "Amsterdam, which began targeting overtourism in 2016, arrivals are expected to climb..." The article doesn't mention what specific action Amsterdam took in 2016. Since the question asks for the specific measure similar to Barcelona's 2012 tax (a tourist tax), but the article doesn't say that Amsterdam implemented a tourist tax in 2016. The only Amsterdam measures mentioned are the 2024 ones (preventing adding rooms/beds after a loophole). Therefore, the answer would be N/A because the text doesn't specify the 2016 measure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "restricting short-term rentals" but that's what Barcelona did in 2015. Wait, the question says "similar to Barcelona's initial tourist tax in 2012"—so the first step for Barcelona was a tax. The question is asking what Amsterdam did in 2016 as their initial step. Since the article doesn't specify, the answer must be N/A.
