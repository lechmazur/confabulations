Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one. 

First question: Besides the Eaton fire, what other fire's origin point was located about five miles away from a substation, according to Edison's report to state regulators?

Looking through the article, there's a part where Edison mentions a fault at the Gould substation, which is about five miles from the Eaton fire's origin. But the question is asking for another fire. Wait, later in the article, it says Edison reported a fault related to a separate fire called the Hurst fire. The text says, "Edison has said that it did measure a large fault on a transmission line related to a separate fire, the Hurst fire, north of Altadena." But does it mention the distance from a substation for the Hurst fire? Let me check again. The exact sentence about the Gould substation's distance is in the context of the Eaton fire. The Hurst fire part mentions the Sylmar area, but the article states that the Gould substation is five miles from Eaton's origin. The question is about another fire's origin being five miles from a substation. Wait, the article says "Edison later reported to state regulators that a preliminary analysis showed... the Gould substation, a facility about five miles away from what is believed to be the origin point of the fire [Eaton]." The other fire mentioned is the Hurst fire, but the article doesn't state the distance from a substation for that one. Hmm, maybe I missed something. Let me scan again. The part about the Hurst fire says: "Edison has said that it did measure a large fault on a transmission line related to a separate fire, the Hurst fire, north of Altadena. That power line, in the Sylmar area of Los Angeles County, fell to the ground, though it is unclear whether a power line caused the fire." There's no mention of a substation's distance here. So perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, the question is about another fire besides Eaton where the origin was five miles from a substation. The only mention of a substation's distance is the Gould substation related to Eaton. The other fire (Hurst) isn't linked to a substation's proximity in the text. So maybe the answer is N/A?

Wait, hold on. The question says "according to Edison's report to state regulators". The article states: "The utility later reported to state regulators that a preliminary analysis showed that as a result of the fault at the Gould substation, there was 'a momentary and expected increase in current on SCE's transmission system.' But the company has given no indication that it registered a large, transmission-level disruption of the kind shown in the new data in relation to the Eaton fire." Here, the Gould substation is related to Eaton. The Hurst fire's mention doesn't involve a substation's distance. Therefore, the answer might be N/A because there's no other fire mentioned in Edison's report as being five miles from a substation besides Eaton. So first question answer: N/A?

Wait, maybe I missed another part. Let me check again. The article says about the Hurst fire: "Edison has said that it did measure a large fault on a transmission line related to a separate fire, the Hurst fire..." but no mention of a substation's proximity. So first question answer is N/A.

Second question: What is the name of the Austin, Texas-based company whose sensors detected electrical problems at homes throughout the Los Angeles region, leading to the discovery of the Eaton fire's cause?

The article mentions Whisker Labs as the company with sensors. The article says: "Whisker Labs, a technology company based in Germantown, Md." Wait, Germantown, Md. is their location, not Austin. The question asks for an Austin-based company. Wait, the lawyer Mikal C. Watts is based in Austin, but the company is Whisker Labs in Maryland. So the answer would be N/A because the company is in Maryland, not Austin. Wait, the question says "Austin, Texas-based company" but the text says Whisker Labs is in Germantown, Md. So the answer is N/A. But wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again: "Whisker Labs, a technology company based in Germantown, Md." So the answer is N/A because the company isn't in Austin. The question is incorrect in stating Austin, so the answer is N/A. 

Wait, the second question asks for the name of the Austin-based company, but the text says the company is in Maryland. Therefore, the answer is N/A because the article states the company is in Maryland, not Austin. The lawyer is in Austin, but the company isn't. So both answers are N/A?
