Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the maximum number of weekly strength training sessions recommended by a Chicago-based coach for full-body conditioning without equipment. 

First, I need to look through the article for mentions of a Chicago-based coach and their recommendations. The article mentions Robyn LaLonde as the head coach and owner of Edge Athlete Lounge in Chicago. She says, "Instead of hunting for one move that can do it all, practice a full-body strength training routine twice a week..." 

So, the key point here is "twice a week." The question specifies "maximum number," but the article states "twice a week" as the recommendation. Since there's no mention of a higher number, the maximum here would be twice. The coach is based in Chicago, so that matches. Also, the routine is full-body and can be done at home with little or no equipment, which fits the question's parameters. 

Therefore, the answer should be twice a week, so the number is 2. The question asks for the maximum, but since the article doesn't mention anything higher, 2 is the correct answer here.
