Okay, let's tackle the first question. The user is asking for the month when the legislative body overwhelmingly approved the bill that President Biden signed into law, leading to TikTok's current situation.

Looking at the article, the relevant part says: "President Biden signed the TikTok ban bill into law in April after it passed Congress with bipartisan support." The key point here is that the bill passed Congress before April, which is when Biden signed it. The question is about the month the legislative body approved it. Since it passed Congress with bipartisan support before April, but the exact month isn't specified. Wait, the article says "after it passed Congress with bipartisan support" in the same sentence as the signing in April. The article doesn't explicitly state the month Congress passed it, only that it was before April. The user wants the month, but the text doesn't provide that detail. So the answer should be N/A because the exact month isn't mentioned. The article only mentions April as when Biden signed it, not when Congress passed it.
