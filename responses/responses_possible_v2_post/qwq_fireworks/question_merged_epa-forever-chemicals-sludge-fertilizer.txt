Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which federal agency's 2019 testing protocol was criticized by Consumer Reports for failing to detect PFAS in 80% of organic milk samples that were later found to be contaminated. 

First, I need to look through the article for mentions of Consumer Reports, PFAS in milk, and any federal agencies involved in testing. The article states that Consumer Reports detected PFAS in some milk, including organic brands. It also mentions the FDA's testing: "Since 2019, however, the agency has tested nearly 1,300 samples of food and said a vast majority were free of the types of PFAS the agency is able to screen for. Some public health experts and advocacy groups have questioned the testing methodology, and the agency itself says that 'PFAS exposure from food is an emerging area of science and there remains much we do not yet know.'" 

The "agency" here refers to the FDA since the context is about food testing. The question specifies Consumer Reports' criticism of a 2019 testing protocol. The article says Consumer Reports found PFAS in milk, implying that the FDA's tests might have missed them. The FDA is the federal agency mentioned here. The exact wording in the question is about the agency whose 2019 testing was criticized by Consumer Reports. The article connects Consumer Reports' findings with the FDA's testing, so the answer should be the FDA.
