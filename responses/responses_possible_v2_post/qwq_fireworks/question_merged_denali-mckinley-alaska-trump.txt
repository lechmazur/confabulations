Okay, let's tackle the first question. The user is asking about the number of migrants accused of gang affiliations held in the Guantanamo Bay tent city mentioned in the final section of the article.

First, I need to find the relevant part of the article. The final section under "Immigration" mentions: "The Trump administration is holding 10 migrants with suspected gang affiliations in the same prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba that has housed men accused of being members of Al Qaeda, U.S. defense officials said. U.S Forces are also preparing a tent city to house as many as 30,000 migrants."

The question specifically asks about the number in the "tent city." The article says the tent city is being prepared to house up to 30,000, but the 10 migrants are in the prison, not the tent city. The tent city hasn't been used yet for holding those migrants; it's just being prepared. So the current number in the tent city isn't mentioned. The question is about how many are "currently held" there, which the text doesn't state. The 10 are in the prison, so the answer would be N/A because the tent city's current occupancy isn't provided.
