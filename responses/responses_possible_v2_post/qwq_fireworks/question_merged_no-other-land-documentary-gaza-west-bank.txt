Okay, let's tackle the first question. The user is asking about the number of consecutive years of home demolitions in Masafer Yatta shown in "No Other Land," including both original and archival footage. 

Looking at the article, the relevant part says: "The film captures this destruction between 2019 and 2023 and in archival footage from Adra's family." So the original footage is from 2019 to 2023. That's five years: 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023. But the question also includes archival footage. The article mentions archival footage from Adra's family, but it doesn't specify the years covered by that archival material. However, the question is about the total number of consecutive years shown in the film. Since the main period is 2019-2023 (5 years), and the archival footage's timeframe isn't specified, maybe the answer is based only on the stated period. The question says "consecutive years," so even if the archival is from earlier, unless it's part of the same consecutive span, it might not add. But the article says "between 2019 and 2023" for the main footage, and the archival is separate. Since the question includes both, but the archival's years aren't given, maybe the answer is the 5 years from 2019-2023. The exact wording is "between 2019 and 2023," which is four years if it's inclusive? Wait, 2019 to 2023 is five years (2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023). So the answer should be 5. The archival might not add to the consecutive count since their years aren't specified. The question is about the total shown, including both, but the consecutive part would be the 2019-2023 period. So the answer is 5 years.
