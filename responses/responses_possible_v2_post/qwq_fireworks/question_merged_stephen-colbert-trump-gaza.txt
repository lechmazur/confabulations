Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking what the Democratic congressman decided to file against President Trump after he announced his plan for Greenland, as mentioned by Jimmy Fallon.

First, I need to check the article for any mention of a Democratic congressman filing something related to Trump's plan. The article states that Trump mentioned taking over Gaza, not Greenland. Wait, the question says Greenland, but the article's context is about Gaza. Let me re-read the relevant parts.

Looking at the article, there's a part where it says: "President Trump also suggested taking over Gaza. His first project: opening a gentlemen's club called The Gaza Strip." Then further down, under Jimmy Fallon's quotes, it says: "After Trump announced his plan for Gaza, a Democratic congressman said he is filing articles of impeachment against him. Good luck with that. There's a better chance of turning Gaza into the Riviera of the Middle East." 

Wait, the question mentions Greenland, but the article's reference is about Gaza. The user might have mixed up the locations here. The question says "plan for Greenland," but in the text, the plan mentioned by Trump is about Gaza. The part about Greenland is from a different quote by Jimmy Fallon: "Trump wants to take over Greenland, Canada and now the Gaza Strip. He's like everyone at 2 a.m., drunk-ordering off Amazon..." So Fallon mentions Greenland as part of Trump's past ideas, but the specific plan announced was Gaza. The impeachment mention is tied to the Gaza plan, not Greenland. 

The question asks about the plan for Greenland, but the article doesn't mention any specific announcement about Greenland by Trump recently. The congressman's action is in response to the Gaza plan. Since the question incorrectly ties the congressman's action to the Greenland plan (which isn't in the text as an announced plan), the answer would be N/A because the text doesn't connect the impeachment filing to Greenland. The correct trigger was the Gaza announcement. Therefore, since the question's premise is incorrect (mixing up Gaza with Greenland), the answer is N/A as per instructions.

<other>The question references President Trump's plan for Greenland, but the article states the Democratic congressman's action followed Trump's announcement about Gaza. Since the text does not mention a plan for Greenland being announced or a filing related to it, the answer is N/A.</other>
