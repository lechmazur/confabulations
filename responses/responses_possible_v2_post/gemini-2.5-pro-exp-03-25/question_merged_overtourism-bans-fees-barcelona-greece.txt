merged_overtourism-bans-fees-barcelona-greece.txt
<other>The user wants me to identify the specific measure Amsterdam implemented in 2016 to address overtourism, based only on the provided article. The article states, "In Amsterdam, which began targeting overtourism in 2016, arrivals are expected to climb to 26 million in 2026." However, it does not specify *what* measures were taken in 2016. It mentions measures taken later (halting new hotel construction in 2024, preventing adding rooms/beds in November), but not the initial 2016 actions. Therefore, the specific measure from 2016 is not mentioned.</other>
