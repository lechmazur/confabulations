<other>The user wants me to answer a question based only on the provided article. The question asks about a specific instrument played by David Munrow that was featured in the pit band for "Farinelli and the King". I need to check the article for mentions of David Munrow, the instruments he played, the play "Farinelli and the King", and the instruments used in its pit band. The article mentions David Munrow was a recorder player who inspired Ms. van Kampen. It describes "Farinelli and the King" and mentions musicians were onstage, but it does not list the specific instruments used for that play's pit band. It lists instruments (shawm, sackbut, theorbo, hurdy-gurdy, cittern, tabor, rauschpfeife) used for the productions of "Twelfth Night" and "Richard III", but not for "Farinelli and the King". Therefore, the article does not state whether the recorder (Munrow's instrument) was used in the pit band for "Farinelli and the King".</other>
