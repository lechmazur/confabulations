<other>I need to find the cost of extending the 2017 tax cuts and the cost/revenue of implementing a 20% universal tariff, based only on the article, and then determine the total cost of both.
The article states the cost of extending the tax cuts is "more than $4 trillion over the next decade".
The article states that a 20% universal tariff "would raise $3.3 trillion from 2025 through 2034". This is revenue, not a cost.
The question asks for the "total projected cost of both". The article provides a cost for one policy and revenue for the other. It does not provide a single figure representing the "total cost" of implementing both policies together. Calculating a net cost (cost minus revenue) or summing the figures requires interpretation beyond directly stating a fact present in the text. Therefore, the specific answer requested is not available in the article.</other>
