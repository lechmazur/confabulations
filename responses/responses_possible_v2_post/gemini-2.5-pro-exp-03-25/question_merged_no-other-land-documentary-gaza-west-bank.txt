<other>The user wants me to determine the number of consecutive years of home demolitions shown in the film "No Other Land", based only on the provided article. The article states the film captures destruction between 2019 and 2023, which is a period of 5 consecutive years. It also mentions the inclusion of archival footage from Basel Adra's family, who have been witnesses "for years". However, the article does not specify the exact years covered by the archival footage or state whether these years are immediately preceding 2019, thus forming a longer consecutive period. Without this information, I cannot determine the total number of consecutive years shown including the archival footage. Therefore, the answer is N/A.</other>
