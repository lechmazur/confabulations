<other>The user wants me to identify a specific ballet based on several criteria mentioned in the question, using only the provided article. The criteria are: choreographed by Lynne Taylor-Corbett, described as a "whopping success" by a *New York Post* critic, and established her reputation for emotionally resonant works. I need to check the article for a ballet matching all these criteria. The article mentions "Great Galloping Gottschalk" as her breakout ballet and quotes Anna Kisselgoff from *The New York Times* acknowledging it was a "whopping success with the public". However, the critic mentioned is from *The New York Times*, not the *New York Post* as specified in the question. Therefore, the article does not provide the answer that exactly matches the question's constraints.</other>
