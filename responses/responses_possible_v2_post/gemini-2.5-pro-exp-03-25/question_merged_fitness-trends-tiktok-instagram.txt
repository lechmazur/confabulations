<other>I need to find the recommendation from the Chicago-based coach mentioned in the article regarding the frequency of full-body strength training sessions, specifically considering the context of doing it without equipment and looking for the maximum number mentioned.</other>
<other>The article mentions Robyn LaLonde, the head coach and owner of Edge Athlete Lounge in Chicago. She recommends practicing a full-body strength training routine twice a week. The article then says, "If you prefer to work out at home, you can still build strength with little or no equipment." This suggests the recommendation of "twice a week" applies even without equipment. The question asks for the maximum number. The article only states "twice a week" as the recommended frequency, not a range or a minimum. Therefore, based solely on the text, the number recommended is 2.</other>
