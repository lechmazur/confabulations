<other>I will answer question 1 based on the provided article.
According to the article, extending the 2017 tax cuts is expected to cost more than $4 trillion over the next decade.
According to the article, a 20% universal tariff would raise $3.3 trillion from 2025 through 2034, which is approximately the next decade.
The question asks for the total projected cost of both.  It is likely asking for the sum of the cost of tax cuts and the revenue from tariffs.
Total projected cost = Cost of tax cuts + Revenue from tariffs = $4 trillion + $3.3 trillion = $7.3 trillion.
I will now provide the answer in the requested format.</other>
