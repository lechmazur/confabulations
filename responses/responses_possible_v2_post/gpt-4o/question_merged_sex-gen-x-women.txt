<other>First, I will consider the information provided in the article. The article mentions that in 1991, the author's vogueing house won Montreal's first vogue ball. By 1992, two out of the five members of the house were dead from AIDS, and one was HIV positive. This implies that two members were still alive by 1992. The article does not provide a specific timeline for when the author's newspaper editor was sitting on her lap during editorial meetings, but it does mention that this occurred after she finished college. Since the article does not specify any further deaths of the vogueing house members after 1992, I will infer that the number of members still alive by the time of the editorial meetings was two.</other>
