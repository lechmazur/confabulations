<other>The article states that two out of the five members of the house were dead from AIDS, and one was HIV positive. Therefore, 5 - 2 - 1 = 2 were still alive. However, the question asks how many were alive when the author's editor was sitting on her lap, and the article states that this happened at the newspaper where she worked. The article does not state when this happened relative to the deaths of the vogueing house members, but it does state that the author integrated her sexual history into a tough persona *at* the newspaper. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the two surviving members were still alive at that time. However, the question asks how many members were alive, not how many surviving members there were. Therefore, the answer is 3.</other>
