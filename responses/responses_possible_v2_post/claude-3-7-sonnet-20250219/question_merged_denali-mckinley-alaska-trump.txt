<other>The article states in the final section: "The Trump administration is holding 10 migrants with suspected gang affiliations in the same prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba that has housed men accused of being members of Al Qaeda, U.S. defense officials said. U.S Forces are also preparing a tent city to house as many as 30,000 migrants." This indicates that 10 migrants with suspected gang affiliations are being held in the prison at Guantanamo Bay, not in the tent city. The tent city is being prepared but doesn't currently house migrants according to the article.</other>
