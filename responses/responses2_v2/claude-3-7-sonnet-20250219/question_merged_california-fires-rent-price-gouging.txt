<other>The article mentions a Beverly Hills rental house where the listing agent raised the monthly cost by $3,000 on the spot. Under the emergency declaration, price increases are limited to 10% maximum. So I need to calculate what 10% of the original price would be, but the original price isn't stated in the article.</other>
