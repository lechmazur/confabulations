<answer>Rio Tinto</answer>
<other>The article mentions Rio Tinto as "a historically important mining site in southwestern Spain" (not northern Spain as the question states), but doesn't specifically state it produced the highest concentration of lead particles in Greenland ice samples.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions Rio Tinto as one scenario in their models, but doesn't provide a percentage of how much silver production occurred there.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article doesn't mention any specific month when lead emissions peaked during the Pax Romana.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that 3,300 to 4,600 tons of lead were emitted annually from Roman silver-mining operations overall, but doesn't break this down by region or specify emissions from Middle Eastern territories.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>While the article mentions that lead exposure has been linked to "reduced cognitive functioning in old age," it doesn't provide specific data on the average reduction in cognitive function among elderly Romans.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article doesn't provide any mathematical formula used to calculate the relationship between blood lead levels and IQ reduction.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article doesn't connect Orsted and Equinor's wind development to Roman silver production, nor does it provide Dr. Cory-Slechta's calculations about Rio Tinto's percentage of production.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions Dr. Delile confirming "the extent of lead pollution resulting from Roman mining and metallurgical activities" but doesn't describe his primary method for determining this.</other>

<question_number>11</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article provides estimates in tons (3,300 to 4,600 tons annually) but not in liters, and doesn't make the specific connection requested in the question.</other>

<question_number>12</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article doesn't describe any specific geoarchaeological technique used by Dr. Lanphear to assess the impact of airborne lead on preterm births.</other>

<question_number>13</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article doesn't connect Greenland's ice core samples to the U.S. energy grid's coal contribution or provide IQ decline data from the ice samples themselves.</other>

<question_number>14</question_number>
<answer>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</answer>
<other>The article states that the research was reported "in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences" and mentions that Dr. McConnell called Roman mining "the earliest example of widespread industrial pollution."</other>

<question_number>15</question_number>
<answer>3,300,000 to 4,600,000 kilograms</answer>
<other>The article states that "3,300 to 4,600 tons of lead were being emitted into the atmosphere each year by Roman silver-mining operations." Converting tons to kilograms (1 ton = 1,000 kg) gives 3,300,000 to 4,600,000 kilograms. The question includes irrelevant information about coal units.</other>

<question_number>16</question_number>
<answer>Silver</answer>
<other>The article mentions that the Roman economy relied on silver coinage which required huge mining operations, though it doesn't specifically state that Dr. Lanphear determined this was the primary cause of reduced cognitive functioning.</other>
