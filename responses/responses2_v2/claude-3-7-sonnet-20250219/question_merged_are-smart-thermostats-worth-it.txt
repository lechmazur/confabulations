<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The Canadian study mentioned that smart thermostats can save about $3.50 on a utility bill in a typical month by redistributing energy loads, but doesn't specify how many hours per day participants needed to shift their energy consumption to achieve this.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>Dr. Clapp's 2022 study found no statistically significant differences between households with and without smart thermostats, but doesn't report a specific percentage of users with increased energy consumption during peak summer months.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article doesn't discuss any correlation between Wi-Fi connectivity issues and reduced energy savings in multi-story homes for any smart thermostat brand.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article doesn't provide a specific payback period for smart thermostats installed in homes with traditional furnaces built before 1990.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The Department of Energy states that turning heating or cooling back by seven to 10 degrees Fahrenheit during eight hours can slash up to 10 percent from utility bills, but doesn't specify the kilowatt-hour savings.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The Georgia Institute of Technology study doesn't attribute any specific percentage of energy savings to the smart thermostats' motion sensor technology alone.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions the EPA estimates about 8% savings on bills with approved smart thermostats (compared to manufacturer claims of up to 26%), but doesn't specify during which months the highest discrepancy was observed.</other>

<question_number>11</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>No study in the article concluded that households with smart thermostats showed a 12% increase in energy consumption due to frequent user overrides.</other>

<question_number>12</question_number>
<answer>About $3.50 per month</answer>
<other>The article states: "According to a Canadian study published this month, this feature can save the equivalent of about $3.50 on a utility bill in a typical month." This refers to the ability to redistribute energy loads throughout the day.</other>

<question_number>13</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article doesn't identify any specific factor unrelated to regional climate conditions that had no measurable effect on smart thermostat efficiency in the University of Chicago's 2022 analysis.</other>

<question_number>14</question_number>
<answer>They take a long time to heat up</answer>
<other>The article states: "Basically, smart thermostats 'are less effective with systems that take a long time to heat up,' said Hunter Mack, a professor of energy engineering at the University of Massachusetts Lowell." The article also mentions that radiant systems that warm up floors or walls don't work as well with smart thermostats as traditional systems.</other>

<question_number>15</question_number>
<answer>21 years</answer>
<other>The article states that based on EPA's estimate of $50 savings per year, smart systems could take 5 to 26 years to pay off. The highest installation cost scenario would be 26 years, which is 21 years longer than the lowest payback estimate of 5 years.</other>
