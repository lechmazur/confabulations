<answer>Rancho Santa Fe</answer>
<other>The article states: "Rancho Santa Fe, a wealthy suburb of San Diego, has tried to solve the problem by keeping most of its residential roads clear at all times. No street parking is allowed if the street isn't wide enough for fire trucks to get in and out." This contrasts with Los Angeles, which "prohibits street parking in some neighborhoods on windy days, when fire risk is high."</other>
