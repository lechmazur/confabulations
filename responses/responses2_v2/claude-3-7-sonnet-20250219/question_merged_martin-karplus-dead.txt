<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions that at IBM Watson Scientific Laboratory, Karplus "continued his research on NMR and also began to investigate creating models to explain chemical reactions." However, it doesn't directly state that a specific breakthrough at IBM led to his Nobel Prize. His Nobel Prize work developed over time, particularly at Harvard where "he started to concentrate on biological reactions" which "would lead to the creation of CHARMM and to his Nobel Prize."</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that Karplus supervised close to 250 graduate and doctoral students who are collectively known as Karplusians and that "most of whom have gone on to successful academic careers." However, it doesn't mention if any of them won Nobel Prizes.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions that one teacher told Martin it would be a waste of time to enter the competition, and that "he found another teacher who was willing to proctor his test for the competition." However, the article doesn't name this teacher, nor does it mention that the teacher encouraged him specifically after seeing work on quantum physics. The article only mentions his project was on alcids, an aquatic bird.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions that CHARMM was created in 1983, but doesn't specify when it first demonstrated ability to accurately predict enzyme folding patterns.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>While the article mentions that Karplus shared the Nobel Prize with Arieh Warshel, it doesn't specify what modification Warshel made to Karplus's original approach.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article describes a conflict between Karplus and Delbruck during Karplus's presentation on vision research, but doesn't mention a fundamental principle that Karplus discovered. The disagreement was about Delbruck not understanding Karplus's presentation, not about a scientific discovery.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions that Karplus and his team created CHARMM in 1983, but doesn't provide the title of any paper that introduced it.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>While the article mentions that Karplus met Einstein at Princeton, it doesn't describe any conversation between them that influenced Karplus's career direction.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article doesn't specify which particular biological process Karplus's models first successfully simulated that convinced the Nobel committee.</other>

<question_number>11</question_number>
<answer>Max Delbruck</answer>
<other>The article clearly describes an incident where Dr. Delbruck repeatedly interrupted Karplus's presentation on vision research, saying he didn't understand, which led to Delbruck later telling Karplus he could no longer work with him.</other>

<question_number>12</question_number>
<answer>Harvard University</answer>
<other>The article states: "At Harvard University, where Dr. Karplus spent most of his career, he and his research team in 1983 created a program for simulating molecular interaction, calling it Chemistry at Harvard Macromolecular Mechanics (CHARMM)."</other>
