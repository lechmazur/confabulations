<answer>Approximately 0.15 millimeters per minute</answer>
<other>The article states that a mushroom coral moved 220 millimeters over the course of 24 hours. Converting this to minutes: 220 mm ÷ (24 × 60 minutes) = 220 mm ÷ 1440 minutes ≈ 0.15 mm per minute.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions that the idea of roving corals was first proposed in 1992 and documented in 1995, but doesn't name who first documented the jellyfish-like pulsing mechanism in shallow coastal waters during the 1992 studies.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article doesn't specify how many different species of solitary corals were tested in Dr. Lewis's experiments.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article doesn't provide any statistics on the percentage of mushroom coral populations that successfully complete their migration.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article doesn't specify at what water depth the mushroom corals showed the strongest locomotion response to blue light wavelengths.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Several hours</answer>
<other>The article states: "Dr. Lewis said, the mushroom corals spend a long time inflating the tissues on the outermost edge of their bodies before releasing them quickly." And "In real time, it can take several hours for a mushroom coral to move just over an inch."</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article doesn't provide any information about mortality rates among juvenile mushroom corals during migration.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions toxic sponges as potential competitors that mushroom corals might want to escape from, but doesn't describe any chemical signals or experimental setup related to toxic sponges.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article doesn't provide any measured increase in reproductive success rates for mushroom corals that successfully migrated.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article doesn't specify what color of light was used to initially document the roving corals behavior in 1992.</other>

<question_number>11</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article identifies Dr. Hoeksema as a coral taxonomist but doesn't specify what marine organisms related to corals he likely studied extensively.</other>

<question_number>12</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article doesn't provide information about which university's research program would likely investigate this specific interaction.</other>

<question_number>13</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions that the idea of roving corals was first proposed in 1992, but doesn't reference any earlier study that proposed colonial corals exhibiting movement similar to mushroom corals.</other>

<question_number>14</question_number>
<answer>White light</answer>
<other>The article states that one side of the aquarium had "a sliver of white light, like you would find in shallow coastal habitats." However, the corals actually preferred the blue light, not the white light.</other>

<question_number>15</question_number>
<answer>Brett Lewis</answer>
<other>The article identifies Brett Lewis as the marine ecologist who used time-lapse cameras to reveal the biomechanics of mushroom coral movement.</other>

<question_number>16</question_number>
<answer>Coral trafficking</answer>
<other>The article mentions that "Jason Bittel previously reported on federal efforts to manage illegal coral trafficking."</other>

<question_number>17</question_number>
<answer>44 centimeters</answer>
<other>The article states that a mushroom coral moved 220 millimeters over 24 hours. For 48 hours, that would be 440 millimeters, which equals 44 centimeters.</other>

<question_number>18</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>While the article mentions environmental conditions like being bombarded by waves, being buried under sand, being toppled over, or being near toxic sponges, it doesn't specify which condition might prompt faster movement than observed by Dr. Hoeksema.</other>
