Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I don't look anywhere else and strictly follow the instructions. Let's start with question 1.

1. The first question asks how many billions Trump's net worth increased after Melania's memecoin caused $Trump's price surge. The article mentions that when Melania announced her memecoin, the price of Trump's dropped, causing his net worth to lose value. Wait, actually, the article says that after Trump announced his memecoin, sales spiked, adding tens of billions to his net worth. Then Melania's announcement made the price collapse. So the question is about the increase before the collapse. The exact number isn't given, but it says "tens of billions". Since the question is in billions, maybe "N/A" because it's not a specific number. The article says "tens of billions" which is vague, so maybe N/A?

Wait, the question is after Melania's announcement caused the surge. Wait no: the sequence is Trump's announcement first caused a spike, adding tens of billions. Then Melania's announcement caused the price to collapse. So the question is about the surge caused by Melania's announcement? Wait no, the article says: "Sales of the cryptocurrency immediately spiked, adding tens of billions... The price collapsed two days later, after Melania Trump announced that she was offering a memecoin, too." So Melania's announcement caused the price to collapse, not surge. The surge was from Trump's announcement. The question is phrased as "after Melania Trump's memecoin announcement caused the price of $Trump to surge". Wait that's conflicting. The article says Melania's announcement caused the price to collapse. So the question has an incorrect premise. Therefore, the answer would be N/A because the premise is wrong. So answer N/A.

2. The second question: Which former crypto skeptic did Trump appoint to lead the working group? The article mentions David Sacks as the one overseeing AI and crypto policies. The working group is part of the executive order, but the article says Trump appointed David Sacks to oversee AI and crypto. The working group is mentioned as part of the executive order, but the leader isn't named. The article says the working group would be created, but the chair of the SEC was mentioned as someone who worked with crypto companies. The skeptic part: Trump was a skeptic before. The question asks who was appointed to lead the working group, who was a former skeptic. The article says David Sacks is a crypto enthusiast. The former skeptic might be the SEC chair? Wait, the article says "he picked a new chair of the S.E.C. who has worked closely with crypto companies." Not sure if that person is a skeptic. The only named person is David Sacks, who is described as a venture investor and crypto enthusiast. The former skeptic isn't named here. The article doesn't mention who leads the working group. So the answer is N/A.

3. Third question: What percentage of WLFI sales goes to Trump? The article says "Mr. Trump is not a direct owner of World Liberty Financial, but he receives a cut of the sales of WLFI". It doesn't specify the percentage. So N/A.

4. Fourth question: How many members in the federal cryptocurrency stockpile oversight committee? The article mentions a working group on digital assets but doesn't specify the number of members. So N/A.

5. Fifth question: Market cap of World Liberty when Bitcoin hit $109k. The article says that Bitcoin surged to over $109k hours before Trump's inauguration. But nothing about WLFI's market cap at that time. N/A.

6. Sixth question: Which bank did David Sacks work for before? The article doesn't mention where David Sacks previously worked. So N/A.

7. Seventh question: What regulatory changes did the new SEC chair implement? The article says the SEC rolled back accounting guidance that had deterred banks from getting involved with crypto. The timing is after the executive order. The new SEC chair was appointed by Trump, so that rollback might be the action. So answer: rolled back accounting guidance.

8. Eighth question: How many crypto executives were at the Bitcoin conference where Trump spoke? The article mentions the conference but doesn't give a number. N/A.

9. Ninth question: Minimum holding period for government employees trading crypto? The article doesn't mention any such requirement. N/A.

10. Tenth question: Which international exchange partnered with WLFI? The article doesn't mention any specific exchange. N/A.

11. Eleventh question: Which agency's action reinforced the banking access promise? The SEC rolling back accounting guidance is mentioned as happening shortly after the order. So the answer is the SEC rolled back accounting guidance.

12. Twelfth question: Who linked AI and crypto policies? David Sacks was appointed to oversee both. So his name is the answer.

13. Thirteenth question: Which family venture has a direct financial tie to the regulatory initiatives? World Liberty Financial and WLFI, since Trump's executive order supports crypto, and he has a stake in WLFI.

14. Fourteenth question: What financial outcome from the memecoin announcement? The price collapsed after Melania's announcement, leading to a loss for Trump's net worth on paper. The emphasized outcome is the price collapse causing his net worth to drop, but the question is about the result of the memecoin announcement. The article says "the price collapsed two days later, after Melania Trump announced..." So the surge was from Trump's, then collapse from Melania's. The question is about the financial outcome from the memecoin announcement (presumably Trump's), which was a spike adding tens of billions. But the question says "the memecoin announcement" but the article says the price collapsed after Melania's. The question might be referring to the initial surge, so the answer is "adding tens of billions to net worth" but the exact wording in the question is tricky. The article emphasizes that the price collapsed, leading to a drop. The question asks for the single financial outcome emphasized. The article says "Sales of the cryptocurrency immediately spiked, adding tens of billions... The price collapsed two days later..." So the result of the memecoin announcement (Trump's) was the spike, but the article's emphasis on the outcome might be the subsequent crash. The question says "as a result of the memecoin announcement"—the announcement caused the surge, but the collapse was from Melania's. The question might be about the initial surge, so the answer is "adding tens of billions to his net worth", but the exact wording is needed. Since the question is about the single financial outcome emphasized, maybe the collapse? But the question says "as a result of the memecoin announcement"—the announcement was Trump's, which caused the surge. The article states "adding tens of billions to Mr. Trump's net worth, at least on paper." So the outcome is the spike. But the answer must be in the article's exact words. The article says "Sales...spiked, adding tens of billions... The price collapsed..." So the result of the announcement was the spike, but the question might be looking for the collapse. Wait the question says "as a result of the memecoin announcement"—the announcement caused the price to surge, then later Melania's caused it to drop. The question's wording is about the memecoin announcement (Trump's) causing the surge. The emphasized result is the spike. But the question might be referring to the overall outcome including the collapse? The article says the episode prompted outrage because traders felt burned by the back-to-back announcements and chaotic price movement. The financial outcome emphasized could be the volatility, but the question asks for a single outcome. The article mentions the price collapsed after Melania's announcement, but the question is about the memecoin announcement (Trump's), which caused the surge. The answer should be "adding tens of billions to his net worth" but the question is phrased as the outcome of the announcement. However, the exact wording in the question is: "what single financial outcome is emphasized as a result of the memecoin announcement in the article?" The article says the price collapsed after Melania's, but the initial announcement caused the spike. Since the question refers to the memecoin announcement (Trump's), the outcome is the spike. The answer would be "adding tens of billions to his net worth." However, the answer must be exact. The article says "adding tens of billions of dollars to Mr. Trump's net worth, at least on paper." So the answer is "tens of billions added to his net worth." But the question asks for the outcome emphasized. Alternatively, the collapse is mentioned as a result of Melania's, but the question might have a typo. Since the user's question is about the memecoin announcement (the one Trump made), the answer is the spike. But the question says "as a result of the memecoin announcement"—so the direct result is the surge. So the answer is "tens of billions added to his net worth." But the question asks for "how many billions" in the first question. Wait, the question here is 14, which is different. The exact wording: "what single financial outcome is emphasized as a result of the memecoin announcement in the article?" The article says the price collapsed after Melania's, but the initial announcement (Trump's) caused a surge. The article emphasizes the collapse as part of the episode, but the question is about the memecoin announcement's result. Since the question is about the memecoin announcement (Trump's), the financial outcome is the spike. But the article says "the price collapsed two days later..." so the overall outcome might be the volatility, but the question wants the single emphasized. The article states "Sales of the cryptocurrency immediately spiked, adding tens of billions..." so that's the direct result. The answer would be "adding tens of billions to his net worth". But the question wants the outcome emphasized. The article's emphasis is on the subsequent collapse causing traders to feel burned, but the question is about the announcement's result. Since the question is about the memecoin announcement (Trump's), the answer is the spike. However, the exact answer must be in the text. The article says "adding tens of billions of dollars to Mr. Trump's net worth, at least on paper." So the answer is "adding tens of billions to his net worth" but since the question asks for the financial outcome, perhaps "a surge in price" or "spike in sales". The question might expect "adding tens of billions" but the answer format requires the exact wording if possible. Alternatively, the article says "the price collapsed" as a result of Melania's announcement, but the question's phrasing might have a mistake. Since the user's question is about the memecoin announcement (Trump's), the answer is "adding tens of billions". But the first question was about the increase after Melania's, which is incorrect. Here, question 14 is about the memecoin announcement (Trump's) leading to the surge. The answer is "adding tens of billions".

15. Fifteenth question: Which entity gains most from the policy moves? The article says crypto industry lobbied for legislation to defang the SEC and boost prices. The policies support crypto, so the industry benefits. The answer is "the crypto industry".

16. Sixteenth question: Overall shift in policy. The article says Trump is ending Biden's crackdown, rolling back regulations, so the shift is towards deregulation. The answer is "deregulatory" or "deregulation".

Now, let's go through each answer again carefully:

1. The question is: How many billions did Trump's net worth increase after Melania's announcement caused the price surge? Wait the article says Melania's announcement caused the price to collapse. The price surged when Trump announced his memecoin, then collapsed when Melania did hers. So the question's premise is wrong (Melania's announcement caused a surge?), so the answer is N/A.

2. The working group leader isn't named. The article mentions David Sacks oversees AI and crypto policies but not the working group. So N/A.

3. No percentage given → N/A.

4. No member count → N/A.

5. No WLFI market cap mentioned at that time → N/A.

6. David Sacks's prior employer not stated → N/A.

7. SEC rolled back accounting guidance → that's the action.

8. No number given → N/A.

9. No holding period mentioned → N/A.

10. No exchange named → N/A.

11. The SEC's rollback of accounting guidance → that's the action.

12. David Sacks is the one overseeing both → answer is David Sacks.

13. The venture is World Liberty Financial's WLFI, which ties to his regulatory moves → answer is World Liberty Financial.

14. The financial outcome from the memecoin (Trump's) announcement was the spike adding tens of billions. The article emphasizes the collapse as a result of Melania's, but the question is about the memecoin announcement (Trump's), so the answer is "adding tens of billions".

15. The entity gaining most is the crypto industry → answer "the crypto industry".

16. The shift is towards deregulation → "deregulatory shift" or "deregulation".

Now, need to check exact wording for each answer:

Question 11 asks for the federal agency's action. The SEC rolled back accounting guidance, so the answer is "the SEC rolled back accounting guidance".

Question 12: the individual linking AI and crypto is David Sacks.

Question 14: The article says "adding tens of billions of dollars to Mr. Trump's net worth, at least on paper." So the answer is "adding tens of billions".

Now, writing answers in the required format, making sure each question has a number and answer. If any are missed, need to check again.
