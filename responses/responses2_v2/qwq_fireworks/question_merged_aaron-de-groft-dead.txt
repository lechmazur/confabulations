Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the strict format.

1. **Question 1**: The Muscarelle Museum of Art's role in the individual's career. The article mentions he went there after a knee injury led him to art. It says he became executive director there in 2005 with a passion for provenance. So the answer is that the Muscarelle was where he started his art career post-injury.

2. **Question 2**: The former director insisting on authenticity. The text clearly states Aaron De Groft continued to insist the works were real even after doubts. His name is given here.

3. **Question 3**: The Florida museum hosting the show. The Orlando Museum of Art is named throughout as the institution involved.

4. **Question 4**: The first name of the art historian. His full name is Aaron Herbert De Groft, so first name is Aaron.

5. **Question 5**: The analytical commentary that was later repudiated. The article mentions an analysis by a Basquiat expert who later disavowed it. The name isn't given, so answer is "a Basquiat expert".

6. **Question 6**: Senior individual dismissing staff concerns. The museum's board chairwoman and De Groft threatened staff. The board chairwoman is the one mentioned here.

7. **Question 7**: The shipping company's typeface. The FedEx typeface was used in the painting, which wasn't used until 1994.

8. **Question 8**: His birth year. The text states he was born in 1965.

9. **Question 9**: College where he first took interest in art. He went to William & Mary, where he started taking art classes after his injury.

10. **Question 10**: Year the storage unit was foreclosed. The article says 2012.

11. **Question 11**: Law enforcement agency that raided. The FBI is mentioned multiple times, including the raid.

Now, double-check each to ensure answers are directly from the text and no inferences beyond what's stated. For example, question 5 specifies the expert was disavowed, so the answer is "a Basquiat expert" as per the article. All others seem straightforward. Make sure no N/A answers are needed here since all questions have direct answers in the text.
