Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions beyond that.

1. **Question 1:** Which automaker's EV sales decline prompted them to introduce the $199 monthly lease program for their Model Y? The article says Tesla offers the $199 lease. But the question mentions a decline in EV sales leading to this. Wait, Tesla's US sales fell 6% in 2024, but the article mentions the lease offer as part of their incentives. However, the question is about a sales decline prompting the program. Since Tesla's sales did decline, maybe that's the answer. But the article states the incentives are due to the tax credit, not their own sales decline. Hmm, but the question says "prompted them" because of a decline. The article says "Tesla's U.S. sales fell 6 percent in 2024" but the lease was mentioned as part of the tax credit incentives. Maybe the answer is N/A because the article doesn't explicitly link Tesla's decline to the lease offer. Wait, the article says "Tesla is offering..." but the reason given is the tax credit. So maybe N/A here?

Wait, the question is phrased as "which automaker's EV sales decline prompted them to introduce...". The article says Tesla's U.S. sales fell 6%, but the lease offer is part of the tax credit incentives. The article doesn't state that Tesla's own sales decline caused them to offer the lease. So maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong. Let me check again. The article says "Tesla, for example, is offering a three-year lease on its Model Y..." and later mentions that the tax credit is part of the reason for incentives. The sales decline is separate. So the answer is N/A because the article doesn't link Tesla's sales decline to their lease offer. 

2. **Question 2:** How much did Rivian's EV sales increase after the $6B loan? The article mentions the loan but doesn't say anything about Rivian's sales increase. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Honda's Q4 sales growth percentage from EVs. The article says Honda's overall sales rose 9%, but no breakdown on EV contribution. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Which governor announced matching the federal tax credit? The article mentions California's Newsom saying they'll provide rebates if the federal credit is removed. So answer is Gavin Newsom.

5. **Question 5:** Number of electric mail trucks ordered. The article mentions "new electric mail trucks" but no numbers. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Monthly payment difference between Kia's EV6 and Tesla's Model Y lease including installation. The article says Kia offers $159 and Tesla $199. The question includes installation costs. Ford offers free home charging installation, but the question is about Kia vs Tesla. The article doesn't mention installation costs affecting the lease price. The difference is $40. But since the question includes installation costs, but the article says Ford provides free installation, not Kia or Tesla. So the $159 vs $199 is the lease, but the installation isn't part of the monthly cost. So the difference is $40. But the question says "including installation costs"â€”since Ford's offer includes installation, but Kia and Tesla's leases may not. The question is comparing Kia and Tesla's leases with installation. Since the article doesn't mention installation costs for those two, maybe the answer is N/A because the difference isn't given. Alternatively, the $159 vs $199 is the lease without installation. Since the question adds installation costs, but we don't have data, N/A.

7. **Question 7:** How much did consumer sentiment improve? The article says "consumer sentiment... adding to demand" but no percentage. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** GM's EV sales attributed to partnership with Chinese manufacturers. The article mentions China's price war but no info on GM's partnerships. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Number of charging stations Ford installed. The article says Ford provides free home stations but no number. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Price difference between EVs and gas cars per Cox. The article states "E.V.s are somewhat more expensive" but no exact figure. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Cox's projected sales increase for the year after GM's 21% Q4 gain. The article says Cox expects 2025 sales to grow 2.8% to 16.3M. So answer is 2.8%.

12. **Question 12:** Combined non-Tesla EV market share when Ford had 16% EV growth. The article says Tesla had ~50% of EV sales, so non-Tesla is 50%. The question's timing is when Ford's EV sales grew 16%, which was in the same quarter (since Ford's 16% is in Q4). But the annual data says total EV sales were 1.3M, Tesla had under half, so non-Tesla is 50%. So answer 50%.

13. **Question 13:** Leading automaker (GM) vs. the manufacturer whose US sales decreased by same % as Tesla's worldwide. Tesla's worldwide sales fell 6%, so the automaker with 6% decrease in US sales. Looking at the article: "Stellantis reported its sales fell 7%", Toyota 3%, so no one at 6%. But the article says "Tesla's U.S. sales fell 6%", so the US sales decrease of 6% would be Tesla's own US sales. But the question says "the manufacturer whose U.S. sales were estimated to have decreased by the same percentage as Tesla's worldwide sales decline". Tesla's worldwide decline was 6%, so find a US automaker with 6% US sales decrease. The article says "Toyota posted a 3 percent decline in quarterly sales, while Stellantis... fell 7 percent." No one at 6%, so N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to Tesla's US sales (6% decline) being same as their worldwide? Wait, the article says "Tesla's worldwide sales in 2024, its first annual decline ever" which was a slight drop. The US sales were down 6%, so the worldwide decline is "a slight drop", but exact % isn't given. So can't compare. Answer N/A.

14. **Question 14:** What alternative incentive in CA? The article says Newsom will provide rebates. So answer: rebates.

15. **Question 15:** Total EVs sold by the company with same % decline as Tesla's US sales (6%). Tesla's US sales fell 6%, so which company had 6% decline? The article says Stellantis down 7%, Toyota 3%, so N/A. Unless the question refers to another automaker not mentioned. So N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Kia's EV6 lease price vs GM's EV sales doubling. Kia's offer is $159, which is lower than Tesla's $199, but the question says "the company whose EV sales more than doubled" (GM). So answer $159.

17. **Question 17:** Loan amount to Rivian ($6B) vs tax credit ($7,500). So answer 6,000,000,000.

18. **Question 18:** Automaker with same Q4 growth as Honda (9% Honda, same as Ford's 9%? Wait Honda's growth was 9%, Ford's was 9%? Wait the article says "Honda Motor reported a gain of 9 percent in the fourth quarter, while Hyundai and Nissan each said their sales climbed 10 percent. Not every company... Ford Motor sold... a gain of nearly 9 percent." So Ford and Honda both had ~9% growth. The question asks the automaker with same as Honda's (Ford) had 9% increase. The answer is 9%.

19. **Question 19:** Automaker after GM in sales (Toyota with 2.3M vs Ford 2.1M). So Toyota. The question says "followed GM" so Toyota. The answer is 2.3 million. The question asks total sold by this automaker (Toyota) compared to another. Wait the question is: "the automaker that followed General Motors in total sales, and whose quarterly sales performance contrasted with Stellantis'?" Stellantis had a 7% decline, so the automaker with contrast (maybe Toyota had 3% decline, but they were followed by Toyota? The leading is GM, next Toyota, then Ford. The quarterly sales performance contrasting with Stellantis (which fell 7%) would be Toyota, which had a 3% decline. So the automaker is Toyota, which sold 2.3M. The question asks "how many more vehicles did the leading automaker (GM: 2.7M) sell compared to Toyota (2.3M). The difference is 400,000.

20. **Question 20:** Ford's other incentive besides free charging. The article mentions "free home charging stations and installation" but asks for another incentive. The article says Ford's EV sales climbed 16% with those incentives. The question asks for another incentive besides charging. The article mentions "incentives and discount plans" in general, but specifically for Ford, only the charging is mentioned. So N/A? Or maybe "discount plans" but not specified. So answer N/A.
