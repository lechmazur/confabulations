Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and answer exactly what's asked. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks about the French poetry collection Isabel shares with Mia. Looking at the article's section on "MAKE ROOM FOR LOVE," it mentions "gloriously filthy Latin poetry." Wait, the question specifies French poetry, but the text says Latin. Since there's no mention of French poetry here, the answer should be N/A.

2. Next, question 2 asks how many autopsies Dr. Holyoke performed before finding the murderer. The article says the book features "so many more beheadings than I was expecting!" and mentions autopsies but doesn't specify a number. So, N/A.

3. Question 3 is about Elia's family disapproving of his magical ability in fashion shows. The text says Elia's family runs a vampire fashion empire, but it doesn't mention specific magical abilities they disapprove of. So N/A again.

4. Question 4: Which sibling brought the first French cheese equipment? The article mentions Kate's siblings, including John Mary who speaks French and lives in the woods. Maybe he brought the equipment? The text doesn't explicitly say, though. It just says Kate is making French-style cheeses. Since there's no direct info, N/A.

5. The fifth question asks for the nightclub where Sebastien meets Elia. The article states Sebastien went to a club, but the name isn't given. So N/A.

6. How does Pierre the rabbit help solve the murders? The article mentions Pierre as a power-mad pet rabbit but doesn't detail his role in solving the mystery. N/A.

7. Dr. Holyoke's medical condition preventing surgery. He was injured from military wounds, so maybe that's it. The text says he's recovering from injuries, so his injury is the condition. Answer: his injuries from being shot or wounded.

8. Mia's union organizing campaign. The article mentions "union organizing" in her story but doesn't name the campaign. So N/A.

9. Anne's secret business with the neighboring farm. The article says she's pretending to work there but getting money from elsewhere. The exact arrangement isn't specified, so N/A.

10. Number of vampire fashion houses competing with Elia's. The text only mentions his family's empire, not competitors. N/A.

11. The ebook with French cheese and soldier twin leading to murders. That's "A BLOOMY HEAD" as described. The title is given here.

12. The hesitant character in the graphic novel after a club encounter. Sebastien is the one who panics after meeting Elia. So Sebastien.

13. The self-published title about Mia. The article says "MAKE ROOM FOR LOVE" is self-published and follows her story. Correct.

14. The columnist's name is Olivia Waite, as stated at the start.

15. The soldier twin central to the drama. Henry is Kate's twin who brought the injured doctor. So Henry.

16. The narrative with vampire family and publicist's career. That's Elia's story in "LES NORMAUX." The title is the answer.

17. The ebook with the vicar sibling. The Gravenor farm's story includes Peter, the feared vicar. The title is "A BLOOMY HEAD."

18. The graphic novel with the rabbit and hesitant romance. "LES NORMAUX" again, with Pierre the rabbit.

19. The courtroom book with the retired prosecutor. The article mentions Scott Turow's "Presumed Guilty" with Rusty Sabich taking a new case. The title is "Presumed Guilty."

20. The autobiographical work by Nnedi Okorafor. The article states her novel explores a traumatic event autobiographically, titled "We Do Not Part."
