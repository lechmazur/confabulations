Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer strictly based on that. Let's start with the first question.

1. The first question asks for the precise temperature of the meteorite when it landed, according to "Minerals From Earth and Sky". I remember the article mentions a sulfuric smell but not the temperature. The entry describes Bush as "badly frightened" but no temperature data. So that's N/A.

2. Next, how many paintings are in the "Unnatural Constellation" series based on the Ebony magazine spread? The article says there are paintings based on the spread, but doesn't specify the number. It mentions two paintings titled "Unnatural Constellation" with bullet holes. Wait, the first gallery has a set of paintings based on the Ebony spread. The exact number isn't given, so maybe N/A? But the question is about the total. Hmm. The article says "a set of paintings", but no number. So N/A.

3. Which museum has the Baldwyn meteorite? The article mentions the Cape York meteorite fragments are in the American Museum of Natural History. But the Baldwyn meteorite isn't specified as being there. The text only says the meteorite in the exhibit is "an actual meteorite" but not which museum it's from. So N/A.

4. Judge Cox's reaction? The article says the 1922 entry in the book mentions Cox but Bush was anonymized. The text doesn't say Cox's reaction, just that he owned the land. So N/A.

5. When did Simpson first encounter the book? The article says "several years ago" but no exact month. So N/A.

6. Material for silvery effect before acrylic wash. The article says she starts with gesso-coated fiberglass, then screenprints, then adds acrylic wash. The silver might come from the paint. Wait, the question is what material before the wash? The fiberglass with gesso, then maybe the screenprinted images? Or the silver paint? The text says "silver paint" is used in "Unnatural Constellation" for bullet holes. For meteorite paintings, she uses acrylic wash over the screenprints. Wait, the meteorite paintings start with gesso-coated fiberglass, then screenprints of meteorites, then acrylic wash. The silvery effect might be from the screenprinted images or the gesso. The question is about the material used to create the silvery effect before the acrylic wash. The article says "silver paint" is used in some paintings, but for the meteorite ones, maybe the gesso and fiberglass base? Or perhaps the screenprinted images are in silver? The article mentions "stellar silvers and penumbral grays" in her palette. Maybe the silver comes from the acrylic wash? Wait, the answer is "silver paint" but the question is about the material before the acrylic wash. Let me check again: "she screenprints images of meteorites from various catalogs and archives. Finally, she adds layers of acrylic wash..." So the base is fiberglass with gesso, then screenprinted images (maybe in silver?), then the wash. The silver might be part of the screenprint or the initial layers. The article says "silver paint" in another context (bullet holes). For the meteorite paintings, perhaps the screenprinted images are in silver, but the question is about the material used for the silvery effect before the wash. The gesso is white, but maybe the fiberglass's surface? The article says "gesso-coated fiberglass" and then screenprinted images. The silvery effect might come from the screenprinted images' ink. Since the question is about the material, maybe the screenprinting ink is silver, but the article doesn't specify. Alternatively, the answer might be "fiberglass" or "gesso". Wait, the article says "silver paint" is used in another series. For meteorites, the silvery effect might be from the acrylic wash. Hmm, this is tricky. The question is about the material used before the acrylic wash. The process is fiberglass (with gesso) → screenprint → acrylic wash. The screenprint might be in a different color. The article says the meteorite paintings have an iridescent haze from the wash. Maybe the silver comes from the screenprint's ink, but the article doesn't say. Since the question is about the material, perhaps the answer is "silver paint" but I'm not sure. Wait, the first part mentions "painterly language of stellar silvers and penumbral grays" in her work. Maybe the base layers (before the wash) use silver paint. Alternatively, the screenprint might be in black, and the wash creates the silver. Since the article doesn't explicitly state, maybe it's N/A. Wait, looking again: "she screenprints images of meteorites from various catalogs and archives. Finally, she adds layers of acrylic wash..." So the screenprinting is part of the process. The article mentions "silver paint" in the context of bullet holes in "Unnatural Constellation". For the meteorite paintings, the silvery effect might come from the wash's iridescence. The question is about the material before the wash. The screenprinted images are of meteorites, but their color isn't specified. Since the question is about the material used to create the silvery effect, and the article doesn't mention it, maybe N/A? Alternatively, maybe the gesso-coated fiberglass is the base. Not sure. Hmm. Maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "screenprinted images of meteorites" but doesn't specify the ink color. The silvery effect comes from the wash. So the material before the wash might not be silver. So the answer is N/A?

Wait, the question says "what material did Simpson use to create the silvery effect in her meteorite paintings before applying the acrylic wash?" The silvery effect is created by the acrylic wash? Or before? The article says the wash forms an iridescent haze. Maybe the silver comes from the wash. Then the material before is the screenprint and fiberglass. So the answer would be N/A. Hmm. I might have to go with N/A here.

7. How many Inuit survived after Peary brought them? The text says "four of whom soon fell ill and died." So he brought six, four died, so two survived. So answer is 2.

8. Weight of Cape York fragments? The article doesn't mention weight. N/A.

9. Chemical compounds for sulfuric smell? The article mentions the smell but doesn't say Simpson recreated it. It was part of the meteorite's landing, not part of the exhibit. So N/A.

10. Distance between Bush and the meteorite? The article says it struck feet from him. So "just feet" but no exact measurement. So N/A.

11. Medium for Cape York's journey? The article mentions the title tells the story, but the medium isn't specified. The question is about the artistic medium. The 26-line title is part of the painting's title, so maybe the answer is N/A. The medium isn't mentioned for that specific depiction beyond the title. So N/A.

12. Inuit remaining in Greenland after Peary's expedition? The text says he brought six Inuit to NY, four died. It doesn't say how many stayed in Greenland. So N/A.

13. Decade for "Darkening" paintings? The article says "Darkening," her first solo show in 2019. So that's 2010s. The question is about when "Darkening" was created. Since it was her first show there in 2019, the paintings were made around then. So the decade is 2010s. Answer: 2010s.

14. Material for bullet holes besides fiberglass? The process for "Unnatural Constellation" is screenprinted images on... the article says for meteorite paintings she uses fiberglass with gesso, but for the bullet hole paintings, maybe similar? The question is about the bullet holes in "Unnatural Constellation". The text says "screenprinted images of bullet holes are exposed under silver paint." So the surface might be the same as the meteorite ones (fiberglass/gesso), but the question asks for another material besides fiberglass. The gesso is part of the fiberglass's coating. So the material is gesso, but the question says "other than fiberglass". So maybe gesso? But gesso is applied on fiberglass. Alternatively, perhaps the canvas? The article doesn't specify. Since it's not mentioned, maybe N/A? Wait, the first part says she uses gesso-coated fiberglass for meteorite paintings. For bullet holes, maybe she uses the same? The question is about the material used for the bullet hole paintings. The answer would be gesso-coated fiberglass, but since fiberglass is excluded, the other material is gesso. But the question asks for material other than fiberglass. So the answer is gesso. But does the article mention that for the bullet hole paintings? It might be the same process. The article says "screenprinted images of bullet holes are exposed under silver paint." The surface could be the same as meteorites, so fiberglass with gesso. So the material besides fiberglass is gesso. So answer: gesso.

15. Celestial event similar to Baldwyn in 2024? The article mentions a "mini-moon" discovered in 2024 near Earth, thought to be from the Moon. So that's the answer.

16. Other emotion in the fragmented poem besides the listed words? The text says charged words like "frightened," "attracted," and "struck" are isolated. The question asks for another emotion. The article doesn't list others, so N/A.

17. Celestial body other than meteorite in her paintings? The show's title is "Earth & Sky" and she depicts meteorites. The article mentions "celestial hues" and "cosmic" but doesn't specify other celestial bodies like planets or stars. However, the bullet holes are abstracted into star maps. The question asks for a specific type depicted. The article says "Unnatural Constellation" has bullet holes evoking a star map. So stars? But the question asks for a celestial body other than meteorite. The answer would be "stars" or "constellations"? The question specifies "type of celestial body", so maybe stars or constellations. The article says "shape that evokes a map of the stars", so stars. Answer: stars.

18. Organization similar to Hauser & Wirth mentioned in connection with a test flight explosion? The article mentions SpaceX's test flight explosion investigated by FAA, and Blue Origin. So the other organization is Blue Origin.

19. Color besides silver and gray reflecting sulfuric smell? The article mentions "celestial hues" and "stellar silvers and penumbral grays". The sulfuric smell is mentioned but not linked to color. The meteorite's depiction might have other colors from the wash, but the question is about color reflecting the smell. The article doesn't connect a color to the smell. So N/A.

20. Legal professional in the original entry? The Baldwyn meteorite entry in the book names Cox (judge) and Bush is anonymized. So the legal professional is Judge Allen Cox. Answer: Judge Allen Cox.
