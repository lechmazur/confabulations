Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each question exactly as asked. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which Queens neighborhood barbershop Irv Gotti first met Jay-Z in while selling mixtapes as a teenager. The article says he sold mixtapes at a local barbershop, but doesn't mention the specific neighborhood or the barbershop's name. So, it's N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many platinum records did Murder Inc. produce before changing its name? The article mentions they had a "stack of platinum records" but doesn't specify a number. So, N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The name of the high school talent show judge who connected Irv with Mic Geronimo isn't mentioned. The article just says they met at a talent show, so judge's name is N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The year Lyor Cohen promoted Irv to A&R head after their meeting. The article says after the meeting, Cohen hired him to scout talent. There's no specific year given here, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The selling price of Murder Inc. when Island Def Jam cut ties. The article says ties were cut post-acquittal but doesn't mention a price. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Number of episodes of "Tales" with Irv's music. The show ran three seasons but the exact episode count isn't provided. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The Manhattan studio where Ashanti recorded her debut. The article mentions the studio was called "the Crack House." So answer is "Crack House."

8. **Question 8:** Model year of the Maybach Irv bought after DMX's success. The article just says a Maybach, no model year. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Royalty percentage from the 28 Hot 100 hits. Not mentioned, so N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Months to recoup the $3M investment. The article doesn't state the time taken, so N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Years from inception to FBI raid. Murder Inc. started in 1998, raided in 2003. That's 5 years. So answer is 5.

12. **Question 12:** Mic Geronimo's album that led to Irv's job. The article says he helped produce "The Natural" in 1995, which led to Cohen's interest. So "The Natural."

13. **Question 13:** BET series after "Tales." The article mentions "Tales" ran three seasons, but no subsequent series named. N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Drug gang leader accused in laundering. The name is Kenneth McGriff, known as Supreme. So answer is "Supreme" or full name? The question asks for the name, so "Kenneth McGriff" or "Supreme." The article says "Supreme" is his known name. So "Supreme."

15. **Question 15:** Def Jam's investment amount. The article says $3 million from Island Def Jam. So $3 million.

16. **Question 16:** Barbershop name where he sold mixtapes. Not mentioned, so N/A.

17. **Question 17:** Legal strategy leading to severed ties. The defense argued they needed protection and street cachet. The article says the brothers dropped "Murder" from the name, leading to the label becoming "the Inc." The severing was due to the trial, but the strategy itself was their defense. However, the question is about the legal strategy that caused the severing. The article says Island Def Jam cut ties despite the acquittal. Maybe the strategy was the defense's argument, but the answer might be the name change. The question is tricky. The article says they dropped "Murder" to scrub image but still got cut. The strategy was their defense, but the question is about the legal strategy that led to the severance. Maybe the answer is N/A because the severance was due to the trial and name change, not the legal argument itself. Hmm. The defense's argument was their strategy, but the severance was because of the investigation. The question says "legal strategy... led to the severing of ties". The article states that after the acquittal, Island Def Jam had already cut ties. The defense's strategy might not have been the cause, but the FBI raid and accusations were. So perhaps N/A.

18. **Question 18:** Peak chart position of a Gotti-produced song. The article says his records reached Billboard Hot 100, but specific peak isn't given. Some albums debuted at #1, like DMX's first album, which was executive produced by him. The question is about a song, not an album. The article mentions "28 Hot 100 hits" but no specific peak. So N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Follow-up to Ashanti's debut. The article mentions "Chapter II" as the follow-up. So "Chapter II."

20. **Question 20:** Podcast where Gotti revealed his five-year plan. The article mentions a 2022 video interview with "Earn Your Leisure" podcast. So the podcast's name is "Earn Your Leisure."

Wait, let me check again for each:

1. N/A (no barbershop name)
2. N/A (no number)
3. N/A (no judge's name)
4. N/A (no year)
5. N/A (no price)
6. N/A (no episode count)
7. Crack House
8. N/A (no model year)
9. N/A (no percentage)
10. N/A (no months)
11. 5 (1998-2003)
12. The Natural
13. N/A (no subsequent series mentioned)
14. Supreme/Kenneth McGriff. The question asks for the name of the gang leader, so "Kenneth McGriff" or "Supreme"? The article says "Kenneth McGriff, known as Supreme," so the name is Kenneth McGriff. But the question says "what was the name of the drug gang leader...", so full name is correct. So answer: Kenneth McGriff.
15. $3 million
16. N/A (no barbershop name)
17. The legal strategy: The defense argued they needed protection and street cachet. The question is what strategy led to the severing. The severance was due to the label's troubles from the case, not the defense's argument. So maybe N/A because the legal strategy itself didn't cause the severance, but the case did. Alternatively, maybe the defense's strategy was part of the trial that led to the label's troubles. The article says after the acquittal, Island Def Jam had already cut ties. So the strategy might not be the cause. Thus N/A.

18. N/A (no specific song's peak)
19. Chapter II
20. Earn Your Leisure
