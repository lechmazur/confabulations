Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I'm only using the information from the text and not anything else. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. The first question asks which character has a vendetta rooted in their past and declared a family estate's demise in three months. The article mentions Winifred Notty as the governess who says everyone in the house will be dead in three months. So the answer should be Winifred Notty.

2. The second question is about the day she culminates her plan. The text says "By Christmas morning, Winifred is ready to wreak her stylish havoc..." So Christmas Day is the answer here.

3. The third question asks for the number of pages of the novel. The article states "Victorian Psycho | By Virginia Feito | Liveright | 195 pp." So 195 is the answer.

4. The fourth question is about which part of a butchered animal she consumes. The text says she "bites into the discarded face of a butchered calf." So the face of a calf.

5. The fifth question refers to a thematic device from her debut. The debut is "Mrs. March," and the article mentions both books use a macabre sense of humor and transforming mundane things into violent underpinnings. The device here might be her "grotesque veil" that transforms observations. The answer should be the "grotesque veil."

6. The sixth question asks her reason for being fat. The text says she tells her wards she's "fat from eating fat children." That's the answer.

7. The seventh question is about the barnyard animal in the anecdote. The story mentions a "wicked chicken" that pecked others. So chicken.

8. The eighth question counts how many Feito novels are referenced. The review mentions "Victorian Psycho" and her debut "Mrs. March," so that's two.

9. The ninth question asks who aligned her style with Ellis and Bloch. The review says "Virginia Feito's relentlessly gory novel... delivers unrelenting gore and shock in the vein of those earlier novels by Bret Easton Ellis and Robert Bloch." So the answer is Virginia Feito.

10. The tenth question is about the sci-fi writer with an autobiographical project. The article mentions Nnedi Okorafor, who explores a traumatic event in her most autobiographical novel. So Nnedi Okorafor.

I need to check each answer against the text to ensure accuracy. Let me verify each point again quickly. 

1. Winifred's declaration is directly quoted. Correct.
2. Christmas morning is mentioned as the start of her havoc. Yes.
3. 195 pages stated clearly. Right.
4. The calf's face. Yes.
5. The "grotesque veil" is mentioned as transforming observations. Correct.
6. Eating fat children. Exact quote. Correct.
7. The chicken anecdote. Yes.
8. Two novels mentioned. Correct.
9. The author herself, Feito, is the one aligning her style. The text says her novel lives up to the namesakes. So Feito is the answer.
10. Nnedi Okorafor is the sci-fi writer. Correct.

All answers seem to be directly from the text. No N/A needed here.
