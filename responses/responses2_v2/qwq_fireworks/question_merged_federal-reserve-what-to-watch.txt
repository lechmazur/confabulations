Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks about the percentage of tariffs Trump announced on China unless migration policies changed. Looking at the article, there's a part where it mentions Trump imposing "10 percent tariffs on China" along with 25% on Canada and Mexico. So the answer is 10%.

2. The Fed's consecutive rate cuts in 2024 before pausing in 2025. The article states they cut rates over three meetings, so that's three. 

3. Scott Bessent's specific inflation target. The article says Bessent's team argues that tariffs won't raise prices because foreign manufacturers might lower prices, but there's no specific numerical target mentioned. So N/A.

4. The month when the Fed indicated possible rate cuts if labor weakens. Powell mentioned they aren't on a pre-set course and need to see progress on inflation or labor weakness. The article doesn't specify a month, so N/A.

5. Unemployment threshold mentioned by Powell. The text doesn't give a specific number for unemployment, just mentions "some weakness in the labor market." So N/A.

6. The deadline for Canada and Mexico is February 1, as stated in the article. 

7. Total 2024 rate cuts. The Fed lowered by a full percentage point (100 basis points) across three meetings. So 100 basis points.

8. The numerical change in basis points making policy less restrictive. Powell said it's 100 basis points less restrictive after the cuts. 

9. The official who said strong labor allows postponing adjustments. Powell is the one quoted talking about the strong labor market allowing them to take their time. 

10. Country with 10% tariff is China, as per the question 1 info. 

11. The term for the monetary stance after cuts was "meaningfully less restrictive."

12. The meeting where they held the rate constant was the first meeting of 2025, mentioned in the article. 

13. The financial instrument affecting spending is U.S. government bonds, as rising yields help dampen spending. 

14. The inflation target is 2 percent. 

15. The referenced presidential term is his second term. 

16. The month when forecasts were adjusted. The article says in December officials scaled back forecasts, so December. 

17. The sector affected by high rates is housing. 

Let me check each answer again to ensure they're all directly from the text and no assumptions. For question 3, Bessent didn't cite a specific number. Question 4's month isn't mentioned. Question 5's unemployment threshold isn't given. The rest seem covered. Okay, that's all.
