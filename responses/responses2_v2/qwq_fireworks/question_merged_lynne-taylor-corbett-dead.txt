Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each exactly as per the instructions. Let's start with the first question.

1. **Which Broadway musical did Lynne Taylor-Corbett choreograph that featured traditional Native American dance forms and earned her a Tony nomination?**

Looking through the article, "Swing!" is mentioned as a Broadway musical revue she choreographed and directed. However, the article doesn't mention Native American dance forms there. The Native American-themed work mentioned is "Distant Thunder," which she created with her son. But the question asks about a Broadway musical with Native American dances that earned a Tony nomination. Since "Distant Thunder" had a limited Off Broadway run and the Tony nominations were for "Swing!", this might be a trick question. The article states "Swing!" had no dialogue and included a bungee number, but nothing about Native American dances. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

2. **How many years did Lynne Taylor-Corbett serve as the principal choreographer for the Theater Dance Collection before founding her own dance company?**

The article mentions she helped found the Theater Dance Collection in 1972. It doesn't specify how long she was there before founding her own company. Since the question asks for the duration before founding her own company, and there's no info on when she left, answer N/A.

3. **What role did Dorothy Johnson play in developing the bungee number choreography for "Swing!" that garnered critical acclaim?**

Dorothy Johnson is Lynne's mother, a concert pianist. The article says Lynne's mother was a music teacher and pianist. The bungee number's development isn't linked to Dorothy. The article doesn't mention Dorothy's role in the choreography. So N/A.

4. **During which performance at the New York State Theater did George Balanchine personally mentor Taylor-Corbett in adapting his choreographic style?**

The article mentions she observed Balanchine's work while working as an usher, but there's no mention of him mentoring her personally. The only reference to Balanchine is his original choreography for "Seven Deadly Sins". So N/A.

5. **What was the name of the jazz composition that inspired Taylor-Corbett's breakthrough work with the Alvin Ailey company during their Middle East tour?**

The article says she toured with Alvin Ailey but doesn't mention any specific jazz composition. Her breakthrough ballet was "Great Galloping Gottschalk" based on Louis Moreau Gottschalk's work, but that's for American Ballet Theater. So N/A.

6. **Which Hollywood director approached Taylor-Corbett to recreate Balanchine's original choreography for the film adaptation of "Seven Deadly Sins"?**

The article mentions her work on the ballet "Seven Deadly Sins" for New York City Ballet, but there's no mention of a film adaptation or a director approaching her for that. The film "Footloose" was directed by Herbert Ross, but that's separate. So N/A.

7. **What was the attendance figure for the premiere performance of "Great Galloping Gottschalk" that prompted the "delirious reception" mentioned by Anna Kisselgoff?**

The article states the ballet had a "full house" but doesn't give specific attendance numbers. The critic Kisselgoff noted the reception, but no figure is provided. Answer N/A.

8. **How many female choreographers did Taylor-Corbett mentor through her leadership program at Carolina Ballet?**

The article mentions she worked with Carolina Ballet for over 25 years but doesn't specify a leadership program or the number of female choreographers mentored. N/A.

9. **What was the box office revenue generated by "Swing!" during its initial Broadway run that justified its exclamation point according to Ben Brantley?**

The article doesn't mention box office numbers for "Swing!". Brantley's review comments on its "squeaky-clean" nature but not revenue. N/A.

10. **What musical instrument did Taylor-Corbett master at Juilliard before switching her focus to dance choreography?**

Dorothy, her mother, was a Juilliard-educated concert pianist. The article doesn't state that Lynne herself attended Juilliard or mastered an instrument there. So N/A.

11. **How many Tony Awards did Ms. Taylor-Corbett win for her direction of "Swing!", a show praised for its linear narrative structure?**

The article says she was nominated for Tonys for choreography and direction for "Swing!", but it doesn't mention if she won any. Also, Ben Brantley criticized its non-linear structure. So N/A.

12. **Given her work with Alvin Ailey and her Broadway experience, what role did Ms. Taylor-Corbett play in the original Broadway production of "A Chorus Line," alongside her understudy duties?**

The article states she was an understudy for the Cassie role in "A Chorus Line". No other role mentioned. So the answer is understudy for Cassie.

13. **After her time with the School of American Ballet, and before founding the Theater Dance Collection, what position did Ms. Taylor-Corbett hold at the New York State Theater, allowing her to observe Balanchine's ballets?**

She worked as an usher at the New York State Theater, which let her observe choreographers like Balanchine. So the position was usher.

14. **Building on her experience choreographing "Footloose," what subsequent Herbert Ross film did Ms. Taylor-Corbett choreograph, solidifying her reputation for translating small-town stories to the big screen?**

The article mentions she choreographed "Footloose" directed by Herbert Ross, but no other films with him are listed. So N/A.

15. **What was the name of the Mafia-owned establishment where Ms. Taylor-Corbett, inspired by the work of Jerome Robbins, honed her choreographic skills while working as a waitress?**

The article says she worked as a hatcheck girl for a Mafia club. The name isn't provided. So N/A.

16. **In what year did Ms. Taylor-Corbett receive her first Tony nomination, recognizing her groundbreaking work as the first female director of a major Broadway musical?**

Her first Tony nomination was for "Swing!" which is mentioned as having nominations. The article states "Swing!" was in 1999. But the exact year of the nomination isn't given, but the show opened in 1999, so the nominations would be around that time. However, the question asks for the year of the first Tony nomination. The article says she was nominated for Tonys for "Swing!", but doesn't specify the year. So N/A.

17. **What was the title of the ballet, described as a "whopping success" by a *New York Post* critic, that established Ms. Taylor-Corbett's reputation for creating emotionally resonant works for major ballet companies?**

The article mentions "Great Galloping Gottschalk" was a "whopping success with the public" per the review, but the critic mentioned is Anna Kisselgoff of The New York Times, not the Post. Since the question specifies the Post, it's N/A. The ballet in question is "Great Galloping Gottschalk", but the source is different. So N/A.

18. **What specific dance style, central to the narrative of "Swing!", did Ms. Taylor-Corbett incorporate into her choreography for "Footloose," showcasing her versatility across different dance genres?**

"Swing!" is about swing dancing. "Footloose" involved a different style (the film's dance is more modern/contemporary). The article doesn't connect swing to "Footloose". So N/A.

19. **Drawing from her experience with "Distant Thunder," what earlier Off-Broadway production, featuring a predominantly Native American cast, did Ms. Taylor-Corbett direct, exploring themes of cultural identity and displacement?**
