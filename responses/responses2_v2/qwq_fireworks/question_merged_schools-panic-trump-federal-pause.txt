Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. 

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks how many days the State Department initially paused foreign aid before terminating the Thailand grant. The article mentions that Meredith Dank received an email on Friday evening pausing aid, and then on Saturday evening, she heard the Thailand grant was terminated. So from Friday to Saturday is one day. The answer should be 1 day.

2. **Question 2**: Katherine Baicker's directive was due to the Trump administration's funding pause. The article says she asked researchers to pause spending because the university was unsure if expenditures would be covered. The trigger was the administration's directive.

3. **Question 3**: The program affecting 800k kids is Head Start. The text states Head Start's cash flow was cut off before clarification.

4. **Question 4**: Besides Pell Grants, the article mentions the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) as exempt, alongside Title 1. So the answer is Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.

5. **Question 5**: The Berkeley researcher (Fuller) was told not to post new material without approval. The action taken was stopping web/social media posts. The answer is "cease web postings" or similar.

6. **Question 6**: The Thailand grant was the only one terminated. The question asks what percentage of the $4M program was terminated. Since it's one out of five projects, but the Thailand grant is specifically mentioned as terminated. Wait, the question says "focused on LGBTQ..." which was the Thailand grant. The entire Thailand project was terminated, so 100% of that specific grant, but the question is about the percentage of the total $4M? Wait, the article says "the $4 million, five-year program to be terminated was..." but actually, the Thailand grant was one of the five. The total program is $4M over five years, but the Thailand part was just a portion. However, the question states the Thailand grant was the only one specifically focused on LGBTQ, so the answer is 100% of that specific project. But the question says "percentage of the five-year, $4 million program". Hmm. The article says the Thailand grant was terminated, but the total program's funding might be split. But the question specifies the program focused on LGBTQ, which was the Thailand grant, so 100% of that part. But the question is phrased as "percentage of the five-year, $4 million program...", so if the Thailand grant was part of the total $4M, then the answer is 20% (since there were five projects). Wait, the article says "five projects... Thailand... was terminated. That grant was the only one specifically focused on LGBTQ..." So the $4M is the total for all five, so terminating one (Thailand) would be 20%? But the question is about the program focused on LGBTQ, which is the Thailand grant. The question says "focused on LGBTQ...", so the entire Thailand grant (which was part of the $4M total) was terminated. The question is asking what percentage of the $4M program (the total) was terminated? Or the percentage of the LGBTQ-focused part? The wording is tricky. The question says "the $4 million, five-year program to be terminated was heartbreaking". Wait, the grant in Thailand was terminated, so the Thailand grant's portion. Since there were five projects, maybe each was about $800k, so 20%? But the article doesn't specify the exact amount for each. The question might be asking for the percentage of the total program that was LGBTQ-focused, but the answer is unclear. Wait, the question is "what percentage of the five-year, $4 million program, focused on LGBTQ..." — no, the Thailand grant was the only one focused on LGBTQ. The total program's focus includes that, so the entire Thailand grant (part of the total $4M) was terminated. But without knowing the exact amount for Thailand, we can't say the percentage. The article says "the $4 million, five-year program to be terminated was heartbreaking" — perhaps the Thailand grant was the entire $4M? No, the five projects were in different countries. The total program is $4M, split into five parts. So each is $800k, so 20%? But the article doesn't specify, so maybe it's N/A. Wait, the question says "focused on LGBTQ individuals...", which is the Thailand grant. The total program (the $4M) includes other projects, so the Thailand grant's portion is part of that. But the question is about the percentage of the LGBTQ-focused program. Since the Thailand grant was the only one focused on that, the entire LGBTQ part (the Thailand grant) was terminated. But the question is phrased as "percentage of the five-year, $4 million program...", so if the Thailand grant was, say, 20%, then 20%. But since the article doesn't specify the breakdown, maybe the answer is 100% of the LGBTQ-focused part, but the question is about the total program's percentage. Hmm. The article says "the $4 million, five-year program to be terminated was heartbreaking". Wait, maybe the entire $4M program was terminated? But the initial email was a pause, then the Thailand grant was terminated. Wait, the article says "the grant in Thailand had been terminated. That grant was the only one specifically focused on L.G.B.T.Q. individuals..." So the Thailand grant was part of the $4M total. So the terminated part is the Thailand grant's portion. Without exact numbers, maybe it's N/A? Or perhaps the question is a trick, and the answer is 100% of the LGBTQ-focused part, but the question is about the total program's percentage. Since the total program is $4M and the Thailand grant is one of five, perhaps 20%. But since the article doesn't specify, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "focused on LGBTQ individuals...", so the Thailand grant was that specific part, so the entire part (100% of that specific project) was terminated. But the question is about the percentage of the total $4M program. Since the total program is $4M, and the Thailand grant was part of that, but we don't know the exact amount, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the entire program being terminated, but the article says the Thailand grant was terminated, others were on hold. The question says "the $4 million program to be terminated", so maybe the answer is 100%? Wait, the article says "the $4 million, five-year program to be terminated was heartbreaking". Wait, the exact wording is: "the grant in Thailand had been terminated. That grant was the only one specifically focused on L.G.B.T.Q. individuals who were at risk or had been sex trafficked," she said. For the $4 million, five-year program to be terminated was 'heartbreaking', Dr. Dank said." Wait, maybe the entire $4M program was terminated? Because the article says "the $4 million, five-year program to be terminated was heartbreaking". Wait, but earlier it said "all foreign aid was being paused for 90 days... Then, on Saturday evening, she heard that the grant in Thailand had been terminated." So the Thailand grant was terminated, but others were paused. The total program is $4M across five countries. The Thailand grant's termination is part of that. But the question is specifically about the program focused on LGBTQ, which is the Thailand grant. The question is asking what percentage of the $4M program (the total) was terminated. Since only Thailand's part was terminated, but the total program's funding is $4M, unless the Thailand grant was a portion. Since there are five countries, perhaps each is $800k (20% each), so 20%? But since the article doesn't state the exact amounts, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick where the answer is 100% because the Thailand grant was the only one focused on LGBTQ, so the entire LGBTQ-focused part (the Thailand grant) was terminated, so 100% of that specific part. But the question is about the percentage of the total program. Hmm. The question is a bit ambiguous. Since the article doesn't specify the amount for Thailand, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "focused on LGBTQ...", which is the Thailand grant. The question is asking what percentage of the total $4M program (which includes other grants) was the terminated part. Since the Thailand grant was one of five, maybe 20%, but without numbers, perhaps N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting 100% because the entire Thailand grant was terminated, but as part of the total, it's unclear. Since the article says "the grant in Thailand had been terminated," and that grant was part of the $4M total, but the exact percentage isn't given, I'll go with N/A. But maybe the question is simpler. The question says "the $4 million program to be terminated" — perhaps the entire $4M was terminated? But the article says "the grant in Thailand had been terminated" implying others were on hold. So maybe the answer is N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The American Council on Education's concern was Pell Grants. The president (Ted Mitchell) said their priority was ensuring Pell grants continued. The school superintendents were worried about school meals. So the primary concern was Pell Grants.

8. **Question 8**: The university president not in "freakout mode" is Jim Henderson of Louisiana Tech. He said they'd appeal to the state's congressional delegation if needed. The question asks for the name of the president, so Louisiana Tech's president is Jim Henderson.

9. **Question 9**: The pause was initially intended to last until mid-February. The article says "pause funding at least until mid-February".

10. **Question 10**: The organization is the American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU), mentioned by its president Charles L. Welch. The webinar was by the American Council on Education, but the question refers to the organization expressing concern, which is AASCU.
