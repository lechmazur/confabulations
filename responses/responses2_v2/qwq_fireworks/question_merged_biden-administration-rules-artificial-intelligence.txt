Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I use only the information from the provided article and follow the strict format. Let me start by going through each question carefully.

1. **First question**: The percentage of Nvidia's stock decline linked to the European Commission's statement. The article mentions that Nvidia's stock dipped nearly 2% on Monday. However, it doesn't explicitly state that this decline was due to the European Commission's statement. The Commission's statement is mentioned as a separate concern. Since the question ties the 2% drop specifically to the EU's statement, but the article doesn't make that causal link, the answer is N/A.

2. **Second question**: The specific Huawei equipment Jason Oxman was concerned about. The article says G42 eliminated Huawei equipment. But Oxman's letter is about the timing and input from industry. The question asks what equipment Oxman was concerned about, but the article doesn't mention Oxman discussing Huawei equipment. So N/A.

3. **Third question**: Maximum percentage in Switzerland. The rules require companies to keep 75% within allied countries and no more than 7% in any single other nation. Since Switzerland is a tier 2 (needs agreements), the max in Switzerland would be 7%.

4. **Fourth question**: Number of Chinese companies besides Huawei added to the military blacklist. The article mentions "new Chinese companies" but doesn't name any. Since no specifics are given, N/A.

5. **Fifth question**: SIA's concern about timing related to Mexico. The article says Neuffer mentions timing and input from industry, but the question asks specifically about Mexico. The article states concerns about U.S. allies like Mexico facing restrictions, but the SIA's primary concern was the rushed timing without input. The answer here is the "lack of meaningful input from industry," but the question asks about Mexico. Since the article links the timing to affecting allies like Mexico but doesn't explicitly state that Mexico is the reason, maybe N/A. Wait, the question is about the reason related to Mexico. The SIA's concern about Mexico isn't directly stated as the reason for opposing timing. So N/A.

6. **Sixth question**: Jake Sullivan mentioned offshored items besides batteries. He said "chips and batteries" so the other is chips. Wait, the question asks for another besides batteries. The answer is chips, but the question might be looking for "chips" as the answer. Yes.

7. **Seventh question**: Specific cyberattack type. The article says "cyberattacks" in general but doesn't specify a type. So N/A.

8. **Eighth question**: Emirati firm partnering with Microsoft. The article mentions G42, so that's the answer.

9. **Ninth question**: Other regulation besides the executive order. The article says new rules to keep chips out of China, specifically responding to Huawei getting components from a Taiwanese firm. The answer is "new rules that aim to keep the most cutting-edge chips out of China."

10. **Tenth question**: Total pages of the rules. The article says over 200 pages, so 200+ but exact number isn't given. Since it's over, but the question asks for total, it's N/A.

11. **Eleventh question**: EU institution with joint initiatives. The article says the European Commission made a statement about Germany and France, but there's no mention of new joint initiatives with Middle East. The question combines two elements not linked in the text. So N/A.

12. **Twelfth question**: Percentage for accreditations. The rules require 75% within allied countries, so that's the threshold.

13. **Thirteenth question**: Company with 5% drop. The article says Nvidia dipped nearly 2%, not 5%. So N/A.

14. **Fourteenth question**: Numerical cap for Switzerland. The article says tier 3 countries (most of the world) have caps, but Switzerland is in tier 2 (needs agreements). The article doesn't specify exact numbers for each country, so N/A.

15. **Fifteenth question**: Chinese company collaborating with Microsoft. The article mentions Huawei's violation, but the partnership was with G42 under U.S. guidance. The question asks which Chinese company collaborated with Microsoft? The answer might be Huawei, but the article says G42 removed Huawei's equipment, so maybe not. The question is tricky. The article states that G42 eliminated Huawei equipment. The Chinese company involved in the collaboration is Huawei? Or Microsoft partnered with G42, not a Chinese company. The question is phrased as "collaborated with Microsoft on removing Huawei equipment from Emirati data centers". The answer is Huawei isn't the collaborator; G42 did. So N/A.

16. **Sixteenth question**: Number of unrestricted countries. The article lists the U.S. and 18 partners, including Britain, Canada, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan. So total is 19? The question says "explicitly named". The article names some but not all. The exact count isn't given beyond 18 plus the U.S. So total is 19, but since the question asks how many are explicitly named, the answer is N/A because only examples are listed, not the full list.

17. **Seventeenth question**: Agency referenced by Oxman. The question is about which agency he mentioned. The article says he asked Congress to step in, so the agency isn't named. The answer is N/A.

18. **Eighteenth question**: Percentage threshold in non-allied nations. The rules say no more than 7% in any single other nation. So 7%.

19. **Nineteenth question**: Middle Eastern country linked to Huawei's violation. The article mentions Emirati firm G42, so UAE?

20. **Twentieth question**: Component from Taiwan. The article mentions components for A.I. chips made by a leading Taiwanese chip firm. The specific component isn't named, so N/A.
