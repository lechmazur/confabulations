Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions beyond that.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions Dr. Gearhardt's research comparing UPF ingredients to addictive substances like alcohol and nicotine. However, it doesn't specify a percentage increase in dopamine response. The exact percentage isn't provided, so the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Dr. Johnson analyzed the raspberry jam's smell and noted a "deep cooked-fruit smell." The article doesn't list specific chemical compounds, so N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The 2019 study says participants on the UPF diet consumed 500 extra calories a day compared to whole-food diets. The question asks for the whole-food calorie intake, but the article only states the extra 500, so the exact number isn't given. N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The article mentions that some UPFs are dry to stay shelf-stable, but no temperature threshold is specified. N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The author compared several foods, and the yogurt vs. jam example showed differences. The article doesn't state which had the highest discrepancy, so N/A.

6. **Question 6**: No information on palate cleansing duration. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The "initial crackle or crunch" is described but no measurement tool mentioned. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The article doesn't list specific neurotransmitters measured by Dr. Gearhardt's team. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The study says UPF eaters consumed faster, but the exact time difference isn't provided. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The plain yogurt had a "mildly fruity, slightly green flavor, like underripe green apple." The fruit mentioned elsewhere is "raspberry" in the yogurt example. Wait, the question says Dr. Johnson identified a flavor that reminded her of a fruit mentioned in a different context. The article mentions "raspberry" in the yogurt and jam, but the plain yogurt's flavor compared to underripe green apple. The question's answer might be "green apple," but the article says "underripe green apple" in the yogurt's description. Since the question asks for the fruit mentioned elsewhere, maybe the answer is "raspberry"? Wait, no. The jam's smell was deep cooked-fruit (raspberry), and the yogurt had underripe green apple. The question is about the plain yogurt's flavor that reminded her of a fruit mentioned elsewhere. The article mentions "raspberry" in the context of the jam and the yogurt's comparison. The underripe green apple isn't mentioned elsewhere, so maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to another fruit, but I can't find it. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The study says UPF diet had 500 extra calories, so whole-food would be 500 less. But the question asks how many extra on whole-food? That's the opposite. The article says "subjects consumed more -- an average of 500 extra calories a day -- and ate the food more quickly" on UPF. So on whole-food, they consumed 500 less. The question is phrased as "how many extra calories... on the whole-food diet?" which would be negative, but since they ate more on UPF, the answer is N/A because the question is incorrect in context.

12. **Question 12**: Dr. Gearhardt compares UPF to alcohol and nicotine. The question asks another substance similar to refined oils. The article doesn't link refined oils to the addictive substances. The addictive substances mentioned are alcohol and nicotine. The answer is N/A.

13. **Question 13**: The author's article mentions "legume pasta" as something experts weighed in on. The question asks which type of pasta, so "legume pasta."

14. **Question 14**: The author used a "makeshift UPF charcuterie board," so the kitchen item is a charcuterie board.

15. **Question 15**: The author took an antacid after the experiment, so the answer is "antacid."

16. **Question 16**: The author writes the weekly Well newsletter. The question is answered directly as "The Well newsletter."

17. **Question 17**: The study mentioned is a "small 2019 study" that monitored both diets. The name of the study isn't given, so N/A.
