Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the strict instructions given.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks which reality TV personality started a shift in real estate by buying a big estate to stay close to her family. The article mentions Yolanda Hadid's arrival in 2017, as she was on "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills." She bought a farm near New Hope to be closer to her daughters. So the answer should be Yolanda Hadid.

2. **Question 2**: The second question is about a restaurant and cabaret venue run by a French poetess that became a modern hotel. The text says Odette Myrtil ran Chez Odette's, which closed in 2007. The new hotel, River House at Odette's, was built on its site. So the answer is Chez Odette's.

3. **Question 3**: The venue relocated after floods and now is vacant. The article mentions Odette's building was moved but now sits empty. So the answer is Chez Odette's again? Wait, the question says the venue that was relocated. The text says the stone building that housed Chez Odette's was relocated and now sits empty. So yes, Chez Odette's.

4. **Question 4**: The musician who wanted to escape New York's pretentiousness. The article mentions Michael Arenella, a musician who moved to Bucks County to avoid New Yorkers. He said Bucks County isn't as pretentious. So his name is Michael Arenella.

5. **Question 5**: The bar with Big Sue, the tall bartender. The text refers to John and Peter's bar where Big Sue worked. The answer is John and Peter's.

6. **Question 6**: Vintage shop on Bridge Street where Bella Hadid shopped. The article says Ditto Vintage on Bridge Street, where Bella bought items. So Ditto Vintage.

7. **Question 7**: Asking price for a condo replacing a Victorian home. The article states a unit is $3.5 million. So $3.5 million.

8. **Question 8**: Inn in NJ renovated with a gourmet café. Stockton Inn in NJ had a two-year renovation and opened Stockton Market. So Stockton Inn.

9. **Question 9**: Actor-director who bought a gentleman's farm. Bradley Cooper bought a 33-acre farm. So Bradley Cooper.

10. **Question 10**: Upscale dining on former cabaret grounds linked to a hotel. The River House at Odette's has a restaurant, and the former Odette's site is part of it. But the question mentions a dining establishment. The article says Northridge Restaurant is part of Woolverton Inn's renovation, but that's separate. Wait, the text says River House at Odette's includes the restaurant. The question asks for the dining place associated with the hotel. So maybe the restaurant at River House? The article says "in-house restaurant" at River House. The exact name isn't given, but the question might be referring to the restaurant at River House. Alternatively, the Northridge Restaurant is part of the Woolverton Inn's barn. Hmm, the question says "built on the former grounds of an iconic cabaret (Odette's) and associated with a noted hotel." The River House was built on Odette's site, so the restaurant there would be the answer. The article says "its in-house restaurant" but doesn't name it. Wait, the question says "which upscale dining establishment..." but maybe the answer is River House at Odette's? Or perhaps the Northridge isn't connected. Let me check again. The article says: "River House at Odette's, where the average nightly rate... and the private rooftop club..." and "Philadelphia magazine cited the hotel and its in-house restaurant as the most glaring example..." So the restaurant's name isn't specified, but the question might accept the hotel's name as the establishment. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Northridge Restaurant? No, that's at Woolverton Inn. Wait, the question says "built on the former grounds of an iconic cabaret and associated with a noted hotel". The cabaret was Odette's, and the hotel is River House. So the restaurant at River House is the answer, but since it's unnamed, maybe the hotel's name is acceptable. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the restaurant in the Stockton Inn? No, Stockton's cafe is the Market. Hmm, maybe the answer is the restaurant at River House at Odette's, but since it's not named, perhaps the answer is River House at Odette's. The question says "dining establishment", so maybe the restaurant's name is not given, so perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, no. The question says "which upscale dining establishment, built on the former grounds of an iconic cabaret and associated with a noted hotel, is highlighted..." The cabaret was Odette's, so the hotel is River House, and the dining place is its in-house restaurant. The article doesn't name it, but the question might accept the hotel's name as the establishment. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "the in-house restaurant at River House at Odette's" but the question requires a proper name. Since the article doesn't name it, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but the article says "its in-house restaurant" so perhaps the answer is the hotel's name, but the question specifies a dining establishment. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Northridge Restaurant? No, that's at Woolverton. Wait, the question might be referring to the restaurant at River House, even if unnamed. Since the question says "highlighted as a symbol of transformation", the article mentions the hotel and its restaurant as the example. So the answer is the restaurant at River House at Odette's, but since it's not named, perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, but the question says "which upscale dining establishment", so maybe the answer is the restaurant's name is not given, so N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the hotel's name? The question might consider the hotel as the establishment. Let me check again. The article says "Philadelphia magazine cited the hotel and its in-house restaurant as the most glaring example of 'the new New Hope.'" So the restaurant is part of the hotel. The question asks for the dining establishment, so perhaps the answer is the in-house restaurant of River House at Odette's, but since it's unnamed, perhaps the answer is N/A? Or maybe the question allows the hotel's name as the establishment. The question says "dining establishment", so maybe the answer is N/A because the restaurant isn't named. Wait, no. The article says "its in-house restaurant" but doesn't name it. So perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the restaurant in the Stockton Inn? No, that's the Market. Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me recheck the article for the 10th question's answer. The article says: "River House at Odette's, where the average nightly rate for a Saturday in November was $560 and the private rooftop club charges members $1,250 a year. Philadelphia magazine cited the hotel and its in-house restaurant as the most glaring example of 'the new New Hope.' Opened in 2020 by a group of investors that includes Ed Breen, the executive chairman of DuPont, it was built on the former site of Chez Odette's..." So the dining establishment is the in-house restaurant of River House at Odette's, but since it's not named, perhaps the answer is the hotel's name? The question asks for the dining establishment's name. Since it's not provided, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question might accept the hotel's name as the establishment. Alternatively, maybe I missed another part. The article mentions Northridge Restaurant as another high-end place, but that's part of Woolverton Inn's barn. The 10th question's key points are "built on the former grounds of an iconic cabaret (Odette's)" and associated with a noted hotel. The only place fitting that is River House's restaurant. Since the name isn't given, perhaps the answer is N/A. But the question might expect River House at Odette's as the answer even though it's a hotel, not a dining place. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the restaurant at River House, even if unnamed. Since the question says "dining establishment", and the article refers to its in-house restaurant, but without a name, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the restaurant at the Stockton Inn? No, that's the Market. Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should go with River House at Odette's as the answer, even if it's a hotel, because it's the establishment on the former cabaret site. The question says "dining establishment", but the hotel has a restaurant. Maybe the answer is the in-house restaurant of River House at Odette's, but since it's not named, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question might not require the name of the restaurant, just the establishment. Maybe the answer is the hotel's name. Alternatively, I might have missed something. Let me see other parts. The article mentions the Northridge Restaurant as another high-end place but that's part of Woolverton Inn's barn. The question specifically mentions the former cabaret (Odette's) site, so only River House fits. So perhaps the answer is the in-house restaurant of River House at Odette's, but since it's unnamed, I have to put N/A. Wait, but maybe the question expects the hotel's name as the dining establishment? That's possible. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's see the other questions first and come back to this.

Now, proceeding with the others and then revisit question 10.

10. **Question 10**: The answer is likely River House at Odette's, but since it's a hotel, not a dining place. Alternatively, the restaurant there but unnamed. Since the question specifies "dining establishment", perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "its in-house restaurant" but doesn't name it. Therefore, the answer might have to be N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question accepts the hotel's name as the establishment. Hmm. Let me think again. The question says "which upscale dining establishment..." so it needs a name. Since it's not provided, maybe N/A. Alternatively, the article might mention another place. Wait, the article says "Northridge Restaurant, opened last month after a three-year transformation of a weathered barn on the property of the Woolverton Inn." But that's not connected to Odette's site. The only one connected is River House's restaurant. Since it's unnamed, I'll go with N/A unless there's another part. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the restaurant at River House at Odette's, even without a name. Since the question doesn't require the name of the restaurant but the establishment (the restaurant itself), perhaps the answer is "the in-house restaurant at River House at Odette's" but since the question asks for the name, it's N/A. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The article says: "Philadelphia magazine cited the hotel and its in-house restaurant as the most glaring example of 'the new New Hope.'" So the restaurant is part of the hotel. Since the question asks for the name of the dining establishment, but it's not given, the answer must be N/A. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the restaurant as the hotel's in-house one, so the answer is the hotel's name. But that's not precise. Since the question is tricky, I might have to put N/A here, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I missed a part where the restaurant's name is mentioned. Let me scan again. The article says "River House at Odette's, where the average nightly rate..." and mentions the restaurant but no name. So I think the answer is N/A for question 10.

Wait, but maybe the answer is the Northridge Restaurant? No, that's at Woolverton Inn. Let me confirm the 10th question again: "which upscale dining establishment, built on the former grounds of an iconic cabaret and associated with a noted hotel, is highlighted as a symbol of New Hope’s transformation?" The cabaret was Odette's, and the hotel is River House. The dining establishment is the in-house restaurant there. Since it's not named, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, the question might consider the hotel itself as the establishment, but that's a stretch. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed and see. Let me answer all others first.

Other answers seem straightforward except this one. Let's proceed.

So, compiling answers:

1. Yolanda Hadid
2. Chez Odette's
3. Chez Odette's
4. Michael Arenella
5. John and Peter's
6. Ditto Vintage
7. $3.5 million
8. Stockton Inn
9. Bradley Cooper
10. N/A (since the restaurant's name isn't given)

Wait, but the article says "its in-house restaurant" but no name. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the River House at Odette's, but it's a hotel. The question specifies "dining establishment", so the restaurant is part of it. Since the name isn't given, it's N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the restaurant's name is the same as the hotel? Unlikely. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the Northridge Restaurant? No, that's not connected to Odette's. 

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the article. Let me check again. The article says: "the stone building that housed it was painstakingly relocated to another lot, where it now sits empty." The "it" refers to Chez Odette's. So the venue that was relocated is Chez Odette's building, which is now empty. So for question 3, the answer is Chez Odette's.

Back to question 10: The answer is the in-house restaurant at River House at Odette's. Since it's unnamed, perhaps the answer is N/A. But the question might accept the hotel's name as the dining establishment's parent, so maybe the answer is River House at Odette's. The question says "dining establishment", so perhaps the answer is N/A because the name isn't provided. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is looking for the restaurant at the Carversville Inn? No, that's a different project. 

Hmm, maybe I should go with N/A for question 10. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the restaurant at River House at Odette's even without the name. Since the question says "which", it might require a proper name. Since it's not given, I'll go with N/A.

Alright, proceeding to list all answers now.
