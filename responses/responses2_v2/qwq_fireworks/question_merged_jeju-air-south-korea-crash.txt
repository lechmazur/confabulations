Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by reading through the questions again and then check the article for each answer.

1. **Maintenance issue identified in last overseas inspection prior to crash?** The article says Mr. Kim stated maintenance checks found no problems. So the answer should be N/A because there's no mention of any specific issue found.

2. **Southeast Asian countries explicitly named?** The article mentions Jeju Air added routes across Asia, including stops outside traditional hubs to serve South Koreans. But no specific Southeast Asian countries are named. So N/A.

3. **Percentage workforce laid off despite 90% requirement?** The article says they received a loan on condition of maintaining 90% workforce. It doesn't state the actual layoffs. So N/A.

4. **Boeing model in 40-plane deal?** The article states Jeju Air wants to purchase up to 40 new planes from Boeing. The current fleet uses Boeing 737-800, but the deal's model isn't specified. Wait, the article says they want to modernize their fleet which currently uses 737-800. Maybe the new planes are the same model? But the text doesn't explicitly say. So N/A.

5. **AK Holdings subsidiary managing Jeju Air operations?** The article says Jeju Air is majority-owned by AK Holdings, which sells detergent and toothpaste. But it doesn't mention a subsidiary managing operations. So N/A.

6. **Safety rating from transport ministry?** The article discusses maintenance practices but doesn't mention a numerical rating. N/A.

7. **European cities prioritized in route allocation?** The article mentions government plans to give priority to budget airlines in awarding new international routes to Europe and Asia, but no specific European cities. N/A.

9. **Event triggering 10% stock drop?** The article says the stock fell 10% since the disaster (the crash on Dec 29). So the crash is the primary event. Answer: Jeju Air Flight 7C2216 crash.

10. **Cost-control measure scrutinized related to maintenance?** The article mentions outsourcing maintenance overseas is under scrutiny. So answer: outsourcing maintenance overseas.
