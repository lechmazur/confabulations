Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question is asking for the percentage of rocks submitted to the University of Alberta's meteorite reporting system that turn out to be meteorites. The article says, "About 99.9 percent of the rocks that people have submitted to the reporting system have turned out not to be meteorites." So if 99.9% are not meteorites, then the remaining 0.1% must be. So the answer should be 0.1%.

2. The second question is about the celestial body the Charlottetown meteorite could have originated from, excluding the Moon. The article mentions the "mini-moon" as coming from the Moon, but the meteorite itself is a space rock. The article doesn't specify another origin, so maybe it's from an asteroid? But the article doesn't say. Since there's no info, I should put N/A.

3. The third question asks how many days after the FAA investigation into SpaceX's explosion did Dr. Herd use a kitchen scale. The article says the FAA began an investigation of a SpaceX test flight explosion that rained debris over the Caribbean and suspended Starship liftoffs. Then it mentions Dr. Herd went on a family vacation and took a side trip. But the article doesn't mention the timeline between the FAA's action and Dr. Herd's measurement. So N/A.

4. The fourth question is about another astronomical event captured on video with sound, alongside Blue Origin's rocket launch. The only event mentioned with video and sound is the Charlottetown meteorite. The article doesn't mention another one, so N/A.

5. The fifth question asks for the name of Dr. Herd's son's girlfriend. The article mentions he went with his wife, older son, and his son's girlfriend, but doesn't provide her name. So N/A.

6. The sixth question asks how many meteorites have been registered in Canada, including Charlottetown. The article states "Only 69 meteorites have been found and registered in the country, and this was the first recorded in Prince Edward Island." Since Charlottetown is the 69th? Wait, the article says "this was the first recorded in Prince Edward Island," implying it's the 70th? Wait, no. The total was 69 before, and adding this one would make it 70? Wait, the wording is: "Only 69 meteorites have been found and registered in the country, and this was the first recorded in Prince Edward Island." So the total is now 70? The question is "how many days after..." no, the question is "how many meteorites, including the one found on Prince Edward Island, have been registered in Canada since the Meteoritical Society began its records?" The article says "Only 69 meteorites have been found and registered in the country, and this was the first recorded in Prince Edward Island." So before this one, there were 69, so adding this makes it 70? Wait, maybe the 69 includes it? Let me check again. The article says "this was the first recorded in Prince Edward Island, according to the Meteoritical Society, an organization that records all known meteorites." So the total registered in Canada was 69 before this one. Therefore, including Charlottetown, it's 70. But the question says "since the Meteoritical Society began its records?" The article says "Only 69 meteorites have been found and registered in the country, and this was the first recorded in Prince Edward Island." So the total is now 70. But the question is phrased as "how many meteorites, including the one found on Prince Edward Island, have been registered in Canada since the Meteoritical Society began its records?" The article says "Only 69 meteorites have been found and registered in the country, and this was the first recorded in Prince Edward Island." So the Charlottetown is the 70th? Therefore, the answer is 70. But I need to confirm. Wait, the wording says "this was the first recorded in Prince Edward Island," which might mean that before, there were 69 in Canada excluding this one. So total would be 70. So answer is 70?

7. The seventh question asks for the specific type of debris rained over the Caribbean during the SpaceX event. The article says "the F.A.A. began an investigation of a SpaceX test flight explosion that rained debris over the Caribbean." The debris is just called debris, so the answer is debris. But the question says "similar to that found on the walkway." The walkway had dusty debris. But the article doesn't specify the type beyond "debris," so the answer is debris.

8. The eighth question is the breed of the dogs walked by Velaidum and Kelly. The article doesn't mention the breed, so N/A.

9. The ninth question asks what specific feature of the walkway was altered by the debris, prompting the review. The article says they found a "burst of dusty debris on their walkway" which made them check the footage. So the altered feature was the walkway's tidiness. The question says "what specific feature... described as tidy before..." The feature was the walkway's cleanliness, so the answer is "dusty debris" or "debris on the walkway." Wait, the question says "what specific feature... was altered by the dusty debris." The feature was the walkway's surface, but the article just mentions "dusty debris on their walkway." The answer might be "the tidy walkway" had debris, so the feature altered was the walkway's tidiness. The question is phrased as "what specific feature... was altered by the dusty debris." The article says the walkway was "tidy" before, and the debris was on it. So the altered feature is the tidiness, but the question might want the answer as "dusty debris" but that's the debris itself, not the feature. Maybe the answer is N/A because the article doesn't name a specific feature like a flower bed or something. It just says "dusty debris on their walkway." So perhaps the answer is "dusty debris" but that's the debris, not the feature. Hmm. Since it's asking what feature was altered, maybe "the walkway's surface" but the article doesn't specify. So maybe the answer is N/A.

Wait, the question says "what specific feature of the walkway, described as tidy before the meteorite impact, was altered by the dusty debris..." The feature is the tidiness. So the answer would be "tidiness" or "the tidy condition." But the article says "the tidy walkway where the mystery splotch was." So the feature altered was the tidiness, making it untidy. But the question wants the specific feature, which was the walkway's tidiness. But the article says "a burst of dusty debris on their walkway," so the altered feature is the walkway's surface being covered in debris. Since the question asks for the feature, perhaps the answer is "the walkway's surface" but the article doesn't specify. Alternatively, since it's just described as "tidy walkway" and the debris was on it, maybe the answer is "the walkway" itself. But the question is looking for a specific feature like "the driveway's surface" but not mentioned. Since the article doesn't specify beyond "walkway" and "dusty debris," perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "the space rock lands in Canada. A geologist said it was a rare recording. By Amanda Holpuch A couple in Canada were returning home from walking their dogs some months ago when they found a burst of dusty debris on their walkway." So the altered feature is the walkway's tidiness, but the question wants the specific feature. Since the article doesn't name a specific feature beyond the walkway itself, perhaps the answer is N/A.

10. The tenth question is the year the "mini-moon" was discovered. The article says "Scientists think our planet's 'mini-moon,' a small rock discovered near Earth in 2024..." So the answer is 2024.

11. The eleventh question asks the sound compared to crackling ice, and another event with similar auditory. The meteorite's sound was like "crackling ice or glass," and the SpaceX explosion might have a similar sound? The article mentions the meteorite's sound as resembling crackling ice or glass. The other event with a similar sound? The article mentions the SpaceX test flight explosion, but it's not stated to have a crackling sound. So the other event is not mentioned. So the answer for the first part is "crackling ice or glass," but the question says "which other celestial event..." but the article doesn't mention another event with that sound. So maybe N/A for the second part. Wait, the question says "what type of sound did the security camera capture that Dr. Herd compared to the meteorite's impact, and which other celestial event mentioned in the article involves a similar auditory phenomenon?" The first part is "crackling ice or glass." The second part: the other event is the SpaceX explosion? The article says "F.A.A. began an investigation of a SpaceX test flight explosion that rained debris over the Caribbean," but it doesn't mention the sound of that explosion. So the answer for the second part is N/A. But the question requires both parts. Since the second part can't be answered, the answer would be N/A. Alternatively, maybe the first part's answer is "crackling ice or glass" and the second part is N/A, but the question combines both. Since the question is a single question, if either part is missing, the whole answer is N/A. So I'll say N/A.

Wait, the first part is about the meteorite's sound, which is crackling ice or glass. The question asks for the type of sound (so that's "crackling ice or glass"), and the second part asks which other celestial event mentioned has a similar sound. Since no other event with that sound is mentioned, the second part is N/A, so the whole question's answer is N/A.

12. The twelfth question asks which organization verifies the meteorite and handles the SpaceX investigation. The Meteoritical Society verifies the meteorite, and the FAA handles the SpaceX investigation. The article says the Meteoritical Society records meteorites and the FAA investigated the SpaceX explosion. So the answer is "F.A.A." for the SpaceX part and "Meteoritical Society" for the meteorite, but the question asks for an organization that does both. Since they are separate, the answer is N/A.

13. The thirteenth question asks which of the 69 Canadian meteorites was previously misidentified due to resembling crackling ice. The article says Dr. Herd mentioned that the video showed a sound like crackling ice, but it's the first time a meteorite hit was recorded with sound. The article doesn't mention any previous misidentification. So N/A.

14. The fourteenth question asks which regulatory body handled both the Starship suspension and Blue Origin's certification. The FAA is mentioned for the SpaceX suspension. Blue Origin's rocket launch was noted, but the article doesn't say the FAA certified it, only that Blue Origin sent a rocket into orbit. The FAA's role here is only the investigation. So maybe the answer is F.A.A. since they handled both the suspension and the certification? The article says "the F.A.A. began an investigation... and suspended additional liftoffs by Starship." Blue Origin's rocket launch was done by Blue Origin, but the FAA might certify rockets. The article says "Blue Origin, owned by Jeff Bezos, sent its first rocket into orbit," but doesn't mention FAA certification. Since the question is about the regulatory body handling both, and the FAA is the only one mentioned related to both, maybe the answer is F.A.A.

15. The fifteenth question asks the precise time interval between Velaidum leaving the walkway and the meteorite impact. The article says "just before the meteorite hit, Mr. Velaidum and his partner... had left the home to walk their dogs... 'I was standing literally over the exact spot where the meteorite hit just a couple minutes later,' Mr. Velaidum said." So the time is "a couple minutes later," but the question wants the exact interval from the timestamp. The article doesn't give an exact time, just "a couple minutes," so the answer is N/A.

16. The sixteenth question is which university's system received footage of an explosion proven terrestrial during the same week the meteorite was registered. The Charlottetown meteorite was registered, and the article mentions the University of Alberta's system received the video. The question asks for another university's system that received footage of a terrestrial explosion. The article doesn't mention another submission, so N/A.

17. The seventeenth question is the percentage of confirmed meteorites in the same year the mini-moon was discovered (2024). The article says 0.1% of submissions are meteorites, but doesn't specify the year. Since the mini-moon was in 2024 and the meteorite's video was July 25, 2024, maybe the percentage is the same 0.1% that year. But the question is whether the 0.1% was in 2024. The article states "About 99.9 percent of the rocks... have turned out not to be meteorites," but doesn't tie it to a specific year. So the answer is N/A.

18. The eighteenth question asks the temperature of the smoke. The article doesn't mention temperature, so N/A.

19. The nineteenth question is the measured weight using the kitchen scale. The article says Dr. Herd used a kitchen scale and teaspoon but doesn't state the weight. N/A.

20. The twentieth question is the duration of the crackling noise. The article doesn't mention the duration, so N/A.

21. The twenty-first question repeats the dog breed, which wasn't mentioned. N/A.

22. The twenty-second asks the time of day of the impact. The article says the video was from July 25, 2024, but no time is given. N/A.

23. The twenty-third question: besides the kitchen scale, what tool did Dr. Herd use? The article says "teaspoon," so the answer is "teaspoon."

24. The twenty-fourth asks the speed of the meteorite. The article doesn't provide speed, so N/A.

25. The twenty-fifth question: Blue Origin's launch month. The article says "in 2024" but not the month. N/A.

26. The twenty-sixth asks the color of the smoke. The article mentions "a puff of smoke," but no color. N/A.

27. The twenty-seventh question: distance from Charlottetown to Dr. Herd's vacation spot. The article says he was going there for a family vacation, but doesn't give the distance. N/A.
