Okay, I need to tackle these questions based solely on the provided article. Let me go through each one step by step.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks which brand of tea bags Lori Gottlieb recommends as safe from microplastic shedding. The article mentions "Some tea bags shed microplastics. Which ones are safe?" but doesn't name any specific brands. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many years has Lori been writing the column? The article says her first column was published and it's twice monthly, but there's no mention of duration. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The organic molecules from Bennu linked to mental health via Gottlieb's therapy. The article says Bennu's samples had organic molecules related to life's origins, but not mental health. N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The podcast hosted by Jancee Dunn? The article states Lori hosts "Dear Therapists," and Jancee writes the newsletter. No podcast by Jancee mentioned. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Swimming lessons and reducing afternoon slumps? The swimming lesson is Erik's anecdote, and the slump section is a separate article. No direct correlation stated. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Percentage of couples not taking ownership. The article mentions research on apologies but no specific percentage. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Vitamin deficiency causing strained relationships? Citrus has health benefits but not linked to vitamin deficiencies and boundaries. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Health tips on heated workouts for sleep. The article mentions heated workouts' effectiveness but not sleep specifically. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Childhood trauma in her memoir. The memoir is about her therapy experience, but no specific trauma mentioned. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Workplace boundary example like adult children's limits. The article talks about adult children setting boundaries but doesn't give a workplace example. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The column by the therapist with a podcast. The answer should be "Ask the Therapist" as mentioned in the article. Yes, that's correct.

12. **Question 12:** The term for mental well-being as part of health. She says "health, and not as a separate entity" and mentions "emotional heart attack" metaphor. The term is "health" but the question asks for the term she uses. Wait, the exact phrase was "think of their mental well-being as 'health, and not as a separate entity.'" So the term is "health."

13. **Question 13:** Focus in apologies instead of excuses. She says focus on how the words landed, not intent. The answer is "how your actions or words landed with them."

14. **Question 14:** Innate human experience vs active decision. Forgiveness is active, compassion is innate. Answer: compassion.

15. **Question 15:** Boundaries as relationship dynamics. The article says boundaries are a bid for connection. Answer: bid for connection.

16. **Question 16:** Metaphor for delaying mental health care. She mentions "emotional heart attack" as the crisis. The metaphor is "emotional heart attack."

17. **Question 17:** Overarching theme for balanced living. The newsletter includes sleep, mental health, etc., promoting overall well-being. Answer: balanced living? Wait, the question asks what theme is subtly promoted. The article's focus on mental and physical health integration suggests nurturing mental well-being as part of health, so maybe "mental well-being as part of health" but the exact term might be "balanced living" as per the question's phrasing. Hmm, need to check. The article's conclusion mentions various topics but the main theme is taking care of mental and physical health, so the answer might be "mental well-being" or "health as a whole." Wait, the question says "subtly promoted as vital for achieving balanced living." The article's emphasis on mental well-being as part of health, so maybe the theme is "mental well-being" but not sure. Alternatively, the article's sections like heart health, sleep, etc., suggest overall health. Maybe "nurturing mental and physical health." But the exact answer might be "mental well-being" as per the therapist's advice. Alternatively, the question might expect "health as a whole" but I'm not certain. Let me check the text again. The article's section on Gottlieb says she wants people to see mental well-being as health, so the overarching theme is "health" as a whole. But the question asks what's subtly promoted as vital for balanced living. Maybe "balanced living" is the theme, but the answer should be inferred. Alternatively, the answer might be "mental well-being." Hmm. Since the question is vague, but the article's main points are about integrating mental health into overall health, the answer could be "mental well-being as part of overall health." But the question might want a single term. Alternatively, the answer might be "nurturing mental well-being" but the exact phrasing isn't there. Maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the instructions say if it can be logically inferred, but I'm not sure. Let me note this as needing to check again.

18. **Question 18:** Approach for addressing impact of words/actions. She says focus on how they landed, not intent. The approach is to focus on the impact.

19. **Question 19:** Central aspect to nurture. The article emphasizes mental well-being and physical health, so "mental well-being" or "health" in general. The therapist's quote says mental well-being is part of health, so the central aspect is "mental well-being."

20. **Question 20:** Professional offering advice on emotional hurt and parenting. That's Lori Gottlieb, as she's the therapist discussed in the article and mentioned in the newsletter. The answer is her name.

Going back to question 17. The article ends with various health tips, and the newsletter's focus is on overall health, so the overarching theme is "health" as a holistic concept. The question says "subtly promoted as vital for balanced living." The article's emphasis on mental well-being as part of health suggests the theme is integrating mental and physical health. Since the question is about the overarching theme, the answer is "mental well-being as part of overall health" but the exact term from the article is "health" as in the therapist's quote. Alternatively, maybe "balanced living" is the theme, but the article doesn't state that term. The closest is the therapist's view that mental well-being is health, so the theme is "health as a whole." But the question asks what's promoted as vital for balanced living. Since the articles cover sleep, mental health, fitness, etc., the theme is "balanced living through holistic health practices," but the answer must be inferred. Since the question says "subtly promoted," perhaps the answer is "mental well-being" as the central aspect. Alternatively, the answer could be "health" but the exact phrasing isn't there. Let me check the article again for the concluding tips: "35 Simple Health Tips Experts Swear By" and others. The main theme is taking care of all aspects of health. The therapist's advice is part of that. The question is tricky. Maybe the answer is "health" but I'll proceed with "health" as the article's focus is on various health aspects. Alternatively, since the question says "subtly promoted as vital for achieving balanced living," the answer might be "balanced living" but that's the phrasing of the question. Hmm. Maybe the answer is "mental well-being" because that's the therapist's focus. Alternatively, the article mentions "health, and not as a separate entity," so the theme is "health as a whole." Let me tentatively put "health" as the answer here.

Now, compiling all answers with N/A where applicable.
