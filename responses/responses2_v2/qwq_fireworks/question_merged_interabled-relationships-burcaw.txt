merged_interabled-relationships-burcaw.txt
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let's start with question 1.

1. What percentage of their social media followers did the Burcaws gain after moving to Los Angeles? The article mentions they have over four million followers across social media, but there's no info on how many they had before moving or the percentage gained after moving. So N/A.

2. How many years did it take for Shane to propose after Hannah first emailed him, having seen the YouTube documentary? The article says Hannah emailed him in 2016 and they married in 2020. That's 4 years. Wait, but the question is about proposing, not marriage. The article doesn't specify when he proposed exactly, just that they married in 2020. So maybe N/A? Hmm, but the timeline from 2016 to 2020 is 4 years, so maybe the answer is 4? The article says "received an email... in 2016" and married in 2020. Assuming the proposal was before the marriage, so 4 years. Let me check again. The question is about the time between the email and the proposal. The article doesn't say when he proposed, only that they married in 2020. So maybe N/A because we don't know when the proposal happened exactly. So N/A.

3. What was the name of the history major who quoted Shakespeare and became Wendy Lu's husband? The article says "a history major who loved to quote Shakespeare and would eventually become my husband." Since Wendy Lu is the author, the answer is her husband's name isn't provided. The article doesn't mention his name. So N/A.

4. In what year did Shane write the blog post expressing his doubts about finding a partner, while managing his nonprofit and working as a motivational speaker? The blog "Laughing at My Nightmare" was from nearly a decade ago when the author was in her 20s. The author is Wendy Lu, who mentions she was in her 20s when she discovered the blog. The article was written now, but the blog started "nearly a decade ago" from when? The current year isn't given. The Burcaws married in 2020, and the interview was at the end of last year (the article's publication isn't clear, but assuming recent, maybe 2023?), so "nearly a decade" would be around 2013-2014. But the question is about the specific blog post. The article says Shane wrote that particular quote in his blog, but the exact year isn't given. So N/A.

5. What is the title of the short documentary Hannah Aylward watched about Shane Burcaw's life before emailing him? The article says she watched a short documentary but doesn't name it. So N/A.

6. What is the circulation of the Vermont publication where the personals section is thriving, according to Wendy Lu? The article mentions the personals section in Vermont is thriving but doesn't mention circulation numbers. N/A.

7. How many couples, excluding Lexi and Eric, did the Burcaws interview for their essay collection after receiving over 600 submissions in the first day? The article says they got over 600 submissions but doesn't state how many were chosen. The example given is Lexi and Eric, but others aren't mentioned. So N/A.

8. What specific Shakespearean quote, mentioned by Wendy Lu, did her future husband frequently use? The article states her husband "loved to quote Shakespeare" but doesn't specify which quote. So N/A.

9. What was the name of Shane Burcaw's blog, which he started while living in Minneapolis? The blog is mentioned as "Laughing at My Nightmare." The article says he started it while in Minneapolis? Wait, the article says "In a new essay collection... the influencer couple Shane and Hannah Burcaw... Shane Burcaw, a motivational speaker... It was raw, hilarious and unfiltered, but between the toilet jokes..." The blog's name is "Laughing at My Nightmare." So the answer is that.

10. Besides emotional support, what is the other type of caregiving that Shane provides for Hannah, as mentioned in the context of their household management? Hannah says Shane manages household things like bills. So "managing household bills" or "manages everything for our household." The exact phrasing from the article: "he manages everything for our household. You know, like -- what do you do, Shane? Like bills." So the answer is "managing bills" or "managing household bills."

11. By synthesizing details from their seasonal locations, online presence, and personal lifestyles, which city do the couple call home during the colder months? The article says they spend winters in Los Angeles and summers in Minneapolis. So colder months (winter) they are in LA? Wait, no. Wait: "they spend their winters in Los Angeles. (In the warmer months, they live in Minneapolis.)" So winter = colder months, so Los Angeles is their winter home. So the answer is Los Angeles.

12. Integrating his early motivational work and public narrative, what mobility aid is emphasized in the article as essential to Shane’s daily life? He uses a power wheelchair due to spinal muscular atrophy. The article mentions "requires him to use a power wheelchair." So power wheelchair.

13. Bringing together the discussion on relationship definitions, caregiving roles, and the essay collection, what is the single criterion used by the couple to label a relationship as interabled? The article states: "However, either one or both identify as disabled. So that, in our definition, makes them interabled." So the criterion is "one or both partners identify as disabled."

14. Linking the theme of unsolicited online scrutiny and misconceptions about intimacy, what inquiry do strangers repeatedly make that implies a financial transaction in their relationship? The article says strangers ask "whether Shane pays Hannah to be with him." So the question is "whether he pays her to be with him" or "do you pay her?"

15. Connecting the elements of personal medical equipment and the distinct challenges of the partners, which device is associated with assisting one partner’s breathing? Wendy Lu mentions she has a tracheostomy tube. The question is about the device for breathing assistance. So tracheostomy tube.

16. Reflecting on the narrative of emotional support and daily household management, which personal quality of Shane does Hannah highlight as essential in nurturing their bond? Hannah mentions his humor and emotional support. Specifically: "my favorite trait about him is his sense of humor" and he's a great emotional caregiver. The question asks for the quality she highlights as essential. The answer is "sense of humor" or "humor."

17. By merging early online interactions with the timeline of their personal connection, in what year did Hannah reach out to Shane after watching a documentary about his life? The article says she emailed him in 2016 after watching a documentary. So 2016.

18. Taking into account the shared personal narratives on love, disability, and caregiving, what is the title of the published collection featuring experiences from varied interabled couples? The essay collection is titled "Interabled: True Stories About Love and Disability."

19. Combining instances of everyday intimacy and practical support, what is the exact request Shane makes during a moment of closeness that demonstrates the blend of caregiving with romance? The article says when they're cuddling, Shane might ask, "Hey, can you slide my leg to the left?" That's the exact request mentioned.

20. Integrating the progression of their long-distance relationship and subsequent domestic changes, what pivotal change in their living arrangements in 2018 contributed to a more natural development of caregiving in their relationship? They moved in together in 2018. The article states: "when we moved in together in 2018."
