Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article. I'll go through each question carefully to ensure I'm not missing any details.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions the software used by the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies. It says, "Sentry, assesses the possible orbits of known near-Earth objects..." So the answer is Sentry.

2. **Question 2**: Radar can provide a more accurate size estimate during the 2028 flyby. The closest approach in 2032 is mentioned, but the radar opportunity is in December 2028. The question asks how many days after the 2032 approach? Wait, the article says "during the December 2028 flyby". The 2032 approach is the potential impact, so the radar is in 2028, not related to the 2032 approach. The question might be a trick here. Wait, the exact wording: "the resulting tsunami could devastate nearby coasts. The Center... uses software... Sentry. ... radar, but that won't be possible until the asteroid makes another close, but perfectly safe, pass by Earth on Dec. 17, 2028." So radar is available in 2028, which is 4 years before 2032. But the question is days after the 2032 closest approach? Wait, the question says "how many days after its closest approach to Earth in 2032 will radar be able..." but radar is in 2028, which is before 2032. So this would be impossible. The question might have a mistake. The article says radar isn't possible until 2028, which is before 2032. So the answer would be N/A because the radar is in 2028, not after the 2032 approach. Wait, but maybe I misread. The question says "how many days after its closest approach to Earth in 2032 will radar be able..." but the radar opportunity is in 2028, so the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The question mentions SpaceX. The article says "F.A.A. began an investigation of a SpaceX test flight explosion..." So the F.A.A. is involved with SpaceX. If there's an asteroid impact, would the FAA coordinate? The article doesn't explicitly say, but since the question ties it to SpaceX's mentioned agency, the FAA is the answer.

4. **Question 4**: The author wrote a book about planetary defense. The article says "Robin George Andrews has written a book about the science of planetary defense..." The title? The article mentions "How to Kill an Asteroid" as his book. The method to alter path is crashing a spacecraft, which is discussed in the book. So the answer is "How to Kill an Asteroid".

5. **Question 5**: The organization for designing a deflection mission. The article mentions Andy Rivkin at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab. So the answer is Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.

6. **Question 6**: The University of Arizona's David Rankin said odds will plummet to zero. The article states: "Mr. Rankin said. 'The most likely outcome is that further observations will rule out an impact'". So his name is David Rankin.

7. **Question 7**: The celestial body that had an ancient impact causing the mini-moon. The article says the mini-moon was "hurled into space by an ancient impact on the lunar surface." So the Moon.

8. **Question 8**: What event in the 2025 calendar might be overshadowed? The article mentions a calendar of "2025 event that's out of this world" like rocket launches, meteor showers, etc. If there's an impact in 2032, maybe those 2025 events would be overshadowed. But the question is specific to a tsunami's attention. The answer would be events like rocket launches, but the question asks for the specific type. The article lists examples: rocket launch, meteor shower, eclipse. The answer would be "rocket launch" or similar. Wait the question says "what specific type of event... mentioned in the context of the 2025 calendar". The exact phrase is "Never miss a rocket launch, meteor shower, eclipse or other 2025 event..." So the answer could be "rocket launch" but the question asks for the type overshadowed. The answer is any of those, but the question wants the specific one mentioned. Since it's a list, perhaps the first one is acceptable, but the question might expect "meteor shower" or "eclipse". Alternatively, the answer is "N/A" if it's not specified which one. Wait the article says "Test your knowledge here" at the end, but the events are listed as examples. The question is which specific event type, so the first one mentioned is rocket launch. But the question might expect "N/A" if it's not directly stated. Hmm. The article says "Never miss a rocket launch, meteor shower, eclipse or other 2025 event that's out of this world with our space and astronomy calendar." So the events listed are examples. The question asks for the type, so one of those. But since the answer needs to be exact, maybe "rocket launch" but the question might be looking for a different approach. Alternatively, maybe "N/A" because the article doesn't say which one would be overshadowed. Hmm. The question might be tricky. Since the question says "specific type of event... mentioned in the context of the 2025 calendar", the answer is one of the listed events. The first one mentioned is rocket launch, so perhaps that's acceptable. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "N/A" because the article doesn't specify which event would be overshadowed. Wait, the question says "what specific type of event, mentioned in the context of the 2025 calendar..." The events are listed as examples of things in the calendar. So the answer is any of the listed types, but since the question asks for one, perhaps the first one. But the exact wording is "what specific type", so maybe "rocket launch". Alternatively, maybe "N/A" because it's not specified. Hmm. I'll go with "N/A" because the article doesn't say which event would be overshadowed, just lists possible events in the calendar.

9. **Question 9**: The book by Robin George Andrews about evacuation strategies. The article says he wrote "How to Kill an Asteroid" about planetary defense. The question asks about evacuation, which is part of planetary defense. The book's title is given as "How to Kill an Asteroid".

10. **Question 10**: Compare to Chelyabinsk. The article says the asteroid is 130-330 feet. The Chelyabinsk meteor was about 20m (66 feet). So 2024 YR4 is larger, so energy release would be greater. The article mentions the Tunguska event (1908) as comparable to the lower end. Chelyabinsk was smaller. So the answer is "greater than the Chelyabinsk meteor event". But the question asks how it compares. The article doesn't explicitly state, but from size, it's bigger, so the answer is "greater".

11. **Question 11**: Critical event in 2026 to refine trajectory. The article mentions the 2028 flyby as the next opportunity. 2026 isn't mentioned. So the answer is N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Telescope system not mentioned in the article for tracking smaller NEOs. The article mentions ATLAS and NASA's systems. The question asks for one not mentioned. The answer would be N/A because the article doesn't mention others. Unless it's referring to something like Pan-STARRS or NEOWISE, but since it's not in the text, answer N/A.

13. **Question 13**: International agency for coastal evacuation. The article mentions the European Space Agency's Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre. But for evacuation protocols, maybe the UN or another body? The article doesn't specify which agency is responsible for evacuation. The answer is N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Other celestial phenomenon in Andrews' research. The article says he wrote about planetary defense and "space objects visiting the Earth". Maybe comets or asteroids, but the question asks for another phenomenon. The article mentions "space object behavior", so maybe comets? The article says David Rankin is a comet and asteroid spotter, but Andrews' expertise is planetary defense, which includes asteroids. The article doesn't mention other phenomena like meteor showers or solar flares. So N/A.

15. **Question 15**: Technique to measure reflectivity. The article says the size range is based on sunlight reflection. The method would be "reflectivity measurements" or "albedo estimation". The exact term isn't given, so N/A.

16. **Question 16**: 2028 flyby's feature for testing deflection. The article says the 2028 flyby allows radar, which can give better data. The deflection tech might be tested during that approach. The answer is the "close, safe pass" or the radar opportunity. The article says "during the December 2028 flyby" they can get more data, so the feature is the close approach itself. Answer: "close, perfectly safe pass".

17. **Question 17**: Torino Scale Level 9 vs 10. The Torino Scale says 10 imperils civilization, 9 is catastrophic but not global. The article states: "Torino Scale... 10 (a collision is certain and may imperil all of human civilization). 2024 YR4 currently sits at 3: a close encounter... Level 9 would be a collision capable of causing regional devastation but not global, while Level 10 is global. Wait, the article says "10 (a collision is certain and may imperil all of human civilization)" and "9 would be catastrophic but not global? The article doesn't specify the exact difference, but the question asks what Level 9's consequence is that distinguishes from 10. The answer is "regional devastation" vs "imperil all civilization". So the answer is "regional devastation" or similar. The article says "10 imperils all civilization", so 9 is "may cause regional devastation but not global catastrophe". So the answer is "regional devastation".
