Okay, let me start by reading through the questions and the article carefully. I need to make sure I answer each question based solely on the information provided in the article. Let me go step by step.

1. The first question asks which city's recent elimination of parking minimums enabled the redevelopment of a Lutheran church's parking into affordable housing before the policy change. The article mentions Austin, Texas, specifically in the first paragraph. It says the St. Martin's Lutheran Church's parking lot is being redeveloped into affordable housing, and Austin became the largest U.S. city to eliminate parking minimums. So the answer should be Austin.

2. The second question is about a 2022 study linking reduced parking requirements to more low-income housing. The article states that the Regional Plan Association did a 2022 study finding more low-income housing in NYC areas with reduced parking. So the answer is Regional Plan Association.

3. The third question refers to an urban planner at Rice School of Architecture (Christof Spieler) arguing about managing diagonal street parking. The article quotes Spieler saying managing street parking is key. The question mentions Houston, but the text doesn't specify Houston as the location for that argument, just that he's based there. Wait, the exact quote is about managing street parking well, but the example given is about Dallas or Austin? Wait, the part where residents mention parking in Austin being a nightmare is in the Facebook comments. The question is about Houston's planner arguing about diagonal spots causing driveway blockages. Wait, the article says Spieler argues that it's about management, but the example about diagonal spots is in the last paragraph where he mentions "readily available parking, that easy-to-pull-into diagonal spot". The question says he argued that eliminating minimums in Houston would require better management of diagonal spots to avoid blockages. But the article doesn't explicitly tie that to Houston's policy. Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The article says Spieler is at Rice in Houston, and in the quote about management, but the specific mention of diagonal parking is part of his general point. The question might be a trick because the article doesn't directly say Houston's policy, but since he's there, maybe that's the answer. Wait, the question says "argued that eliminating parking minimums in Houston would require..." but the article doesn't mention Houston's policy changes, only Dallas. So maybe this is N/A? Wait, the article mentions that in response to Dallas moving to eliminate, residents had issues. Spieler's comment about management is general, not specific to Houston's policy. Therefore, maybe this is N/A? Wait, the question is about urban planner at Rice (Houston) arguing that eliminating in Houston would require managing diagonal spots. The article doesn't say he was talking about Houston specifically. The part about diagonal spots is in the last quote where he says "we want that readily available parking, that easy-to-pull-into diagonal spot". But the question's specific point about driveway blockages comes from the resident's complaint in Dallas? Hmm. Maybe the answer is N/A because the article doesn't explicitly link Spieler to Houston's policy in that context. Alternatively, the question might have a typo, but I have to stick to the text. Since the article doesn't say he made that argument specifically about Houston's policy, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "argued that eliminating parking minimums in Houston would require better management...", but the article doesn't mention him addressing Houston's specific policy. The answer might be N/A here. Wait, but the question is about the urban planner at Rice (in Houston) making that argument. The article does mention that Spieler is in Houston and made the management point. So maybe the answer is Christof Spieler? Wait, the question is asking for the urban planner's name? Wait no, the question is asking what the planner argued, but the answer should be the answer to the question's main point. The question's main point is the argument he made regarding Houston's policy and diagonal spots. Since the article doesn't state that he was talking about Houston's specific case, maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, tricky. Let me hold on and check again. The article says Spieler is at Rice in Houston. The part where he talks about management is in the context of the Dallas example, but he's making a general point. The question's specifics might not be present. So perhaps N/A.

Wait, the question is: "argued that eliminating parking minimums in Houston would require better management of diagonal street parking spots to avoid driveway blockages?" The article says Spieler argues that managing street parking is important, but does he specifically mention Houston? The article says he's based there, but the argument might be general. Since the question is about Houston, and the article doesn't tie his statement to Houston's policy, maybe it's N/A. I'll tentatively mark this as N/A but need to double-check later.

4. The fourth question asks in which year Seattle's reforms first expanded to include transit areas, leading to 70% of post-2017 housing being illegal. The article says Seattle in 2012 started in central areas, then in 2018 expanded further. The 70% figure is from a 2023 study about Buffalo, but wait, the article says Seattle's 2018 expansion. The question mentions the 70% relates to post-2017 housing. Wait, the article says "nearly 70 percent of the housing built in Buffalo after 2017 would have been illegal under the old parking rules." Wait, that's Buffalo's data. The question is about Seattle's year. The expansion to more areas in Seattle was in 2018. The question's second part might be a distractor. So the answer is 2018.

5. The fifth question asks about architectural features of historic neighborhoods complicating parking policy, as per Dallas councilman Chad West. The article mentions narrow streets that predate cars and lack existing parking lots. So the answer is narrow streets.

6. Sixth question: Which California city in 2022 repealed parking minimums alongside Raleigh and Lexington, but faced backlash over bowling alleys needing five spaces. The article lists San Jose, Raleigh, and Lexington as 2022 repeals. The part about bowling alleys is mentioned in the paragraph about parking minimums for different towns. The example given is three California towns with varying requirements (two to five spaces per lane). The backlash over bowling alleys is in the Dallas/Facebook example, but the question says "faced resident backlash over traffic congestion near bowling alleys requiring five spaces per lane". The California city that repealed in 2022 is San Jose. The backlash part refers to the example of the three towns, but the backlash mentioned in the article for San Jose isn't specified. Wait, the backlash in the text about bowling alleys is in the example of three California towns, but the question is about the city that faced backlash over that specific issue. Since the backlash example is about three towns, but the question is asking which city (San Jose, Raleigh, or Lexington) faced backlash related to bowling alleys. The article says "parking minimums for bowling alleys in three California towns..." but doesn't link that to San Jose's backlash. The backlash mentioned in the text for cities like Dallas or Austin. So perhaps the answer is N/A? Or maybe the question is referring to the three towns as part of the example, but the cities that repealed are San Jose, etc. Since the question says "faced resident backlash over traffic congestion near bowling alleys requiring five spaces per lane", and the example is about three CA towns, but the city that repealed in 2022 is San Jose. Since the article doesn't explicitly state that San Jose had backlash over bowling alleys, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but the article says "parking minimums for bowling alleys in three California towns of similar size and within 25 miles of one another range from two to five spaces per lane". This example is used to show variability, not necessarily linked to a specific city's backlash. The backlash in the text for a city like Dallas had residents complaining about parking in their neighborhood, but not specifically bowling alleys. So maybe this is N/A. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick, and the answer is San Jose because it's the CA city listed, even if the article doesn't directly connect it. Since the backlash part isn't explicitly tied to San Jose, but the question is about the city that had the repeal and faced backlash related to bowling alleys, maybe it's N/A. Hmm, tricky again.

7. Seventh question: Which professor's 2021 study on Buffalo's post-2017 developments was cited by Sightline to advocate for eliminating mandates in cities with young drivers. The article mentions Daniel Hess, a professor at Buffalo, whose 2021 study found half the developments had fewer parking spaces. The Sightline study was about Buffalo's 70% figure. The question mentions "high concentrations of young drivers"â€”the article says that residents in areas with older people or young children are concerned. So the professor is Daniel Hess.

8. Eighth question: NYC policy change tied to surge in market-rate housing near transit, contradicting fears about cyclists' safety. The article says NYC reduced parking requirements in some areas, leading to more housing. The resident fears included unsafe conditions for pedestrians and cyclists. The policy that caused a surge would be the reduction, so the answer is the 2022 policy. The question is about the specific policy name? The article just says "in December, New York City lawmakers put policies in place that reduced or eliminated parking requirements..." So the answer is the 2022 policy, but the question asks for the policy name. Since it's not named, maybe just answer "reducing or eliminating parking requirements".

Wait, the question says "which policy change in NYC was directly tied..." but the article doesn't name it, just describes it. Since the question asks for the policy's name, and the article doesn't provide a specific name, maybe N/A. Alternatively, the answer is the 2022 policy, but the question might expect the answer to be the reduction/elimination of parking minimums. Since the question requires the exact name, perhaps N/A. Alternatively, the article might refer to it as "December 2023" but the article says "in December, New York City lawmakers put policies in place that reduced or eliminated parking requirements for new housing in some parts of the city." So the policy is the December 2023 policy. But the question says "in New York City" and the answer would be the December 2023 policy, but the article doesn't give it a name. The question might be looking for the action taken (reducing parking minimums), but since it's asking for the policy's name, perhaps N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the December 2023 policy. Hmm, tricky again.

9. Ninth question: The total parking spots area compared to a state. The article says "two billion parking spots... an area about the size of West Virginia." So the answer is West Virginia.

10. Tenth question: Which city transformed a Lutheran church parking lot into affordable housing as part of policy changes. The first paragraph mentions Austin's St. Martin's Lutheran Church, so Austin again.

11. Eleventh question: Post-WWII requirement adopted by cities over 25k by 1969. The article states that parking requirements were nearly universal by 1969 for many buildings, including bowling alleys, beauty salons, etc. So the answer is parking minimums.

12. Twelfth question: Urban risk from asphalt/concrete related to water. The article mentions "flooding risks" from excess asphalt and concrete. So flooding.

13. Thirteenth: Which institute's analysis showed 70% of Buffalo's post-2017 housing would be illegal. The article says "Sightline Institute" found nearly 70% in Buffalo. So Sightline Institute.

14. Fourteenth question: Economic impact on tenants from parking mandates, as per Brookings and a professor. The article quotes Jenny Schuetz (Brookings) saying costs are passed to tenants. So the answer is increased costs (or higher rents).

15. Fifteenth: Policy tactic proposed by Dallas councilman Chad West for preserving historic structures while easing parking. The article says Chad West proposed easing parking requirements in exchange for preserving historic buildings. So the answer is offering reduced parking requirements as an incentive for preservation.

16. Sixteenth question: Non-automobile mode promoted by reducing parking. The article mentions walkability and less car reliance, so walking (or walking). The question asks for the mode, so walking.

17. Seventeenth: Recurring concern from residents about eliminated parking mandates. The article mentions traffic congestion, circling for parking, blocked driveways, unsafe conditions. The question asks for the recurring concern. The main one is increased traffic congestion and difficulty finding parking. The article says residents are concerned about less parking leading to traffic and congestion. So the answer is traffic congestion.

18. Eighteenth question: Unintended market mechanism reducing demand for mandated parking. The article says parking minimums require spaces the market doesn't want. So the answer is over-provision (or excess supply beyond demand).

Now, going back to the earlier tricky ones:

Question 3: The article mentions Spieler from Houston, but the question is about him arguing that in Houston eliminating minimums would require managing diagonal spots. The article's Spieler quote is general, not specific to Houston's policy. So maybe N/A? But the question says "argued that eliminating parking minimums in Houston would require..." but the article doesn't state he made that argument specifically for Houston. The answer might be N/A.

Question 6: The backlash part. The three California towns example is used to show variability in bowling alley requirements, but the city that repealed in 2022 is San Jose. The question asks which city faced backlash over traffic congestion near bowling alleys requiring five spaces. Since the backlash example given is about Dallas residents, not specifically San Jose, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, the question might be referring to the three towns, but they weren't the ones that repealed in 2022. So N/A.

Question 8: The NYC policy's name. Since it's not named, the answer might be "reducing or eliminating parking requirements" but the question asks for the policy change, which is that. But the format wants concise answers. The article says "reduced or eliminated parking requirements for new housing in some parts of the city". So the answer could be the 2022 policy, but the question says "which policy change", so perhaps the answer is "reducing parking requirements" but the exact name isn't given. Since the question requires the exact policy name and it's not provided, maybe N/A. Alternatively, the answer is the December 2023 policy, but the article mentions December 2023 as when NYC did it. Wait the article says "in December, New York City lawmakers put policies in place that reduced or eliminated parking requirements for new housing in some parts of the city." So the policy is the December 2023 policy. The question is asking for the policy's name, but since it's not named, perhaps the answer is "reducing parking requirements" but the question might expect the month/year. However, the question asks for the policy change's name, which isn't given. So N/A.

Let me adjust the answers accordingly.
