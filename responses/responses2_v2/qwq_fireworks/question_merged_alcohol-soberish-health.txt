Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly based on the text and not use any external knowledge. Let me go through each question step by step.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks which social media influencer coined "soberish" in 2021. The article mentions Katie Nessel started her account in 2022. The term "soberish" is also linked to the podcast "Soberish Uprising," but the article doesn't say who coined it or if Katie did. Since it says she started her account in 2022, not 2021, the answer might be N/A. Wait, the question is about who "first coined the term" and "launched the movement through viral posts in 2021." The article says Katie's account was in 2022. So the answer would be N/A because the timing doesn't match.

2. **Question 2**: Percentage points decrease in blood pressure. The article says studies found a drop in blood pressure when cutting back, but no specific numbers. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Christine Mosley's anti-anxiety medication. The article mentions Kayla Lyons used Klonopin with alcohol. Christine isn't linked to that. So N/A. Wait, the question is about Christine Mosley, but the text says Kayla Lyons used Klonopin. So answer N/A for Christine.

4. **Question 4**: Dr. Barbara Wood's research on minimum alcohol-free days. The article doesn't mention specific numbers of days required. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Medical journal for the study on moderate drinking and liver function. The article states studies found improved liver function from moderating use, but doesn't name the journal. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Dawn Murray's reason for rejecting soberish. The article says when she drank, it worsened her autoimmune symptoms. She asked why she was still drinking and realized it was a poison. So the primary reason was that alcohol worsened her autoimmune symptoms and "hangziety."

7. **Question 7**: Katie Nessel's followers in first month. The article says she has over 200k followers now, but not the first month's number. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Dr. Humphreys' patients maintaining soberish for a year. The article doesn't provide percentages. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Number of Soberish Uprising episodes before host went sober. The article doesn't mention the number of episodes. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Autoimmune condition Dawn Murray had. The text says her autoimmune diseases and arthritis were worsened by alcohol. The specific term is "autoimmune diseases" plural, so maybe just "autoimmune diseases" is the answer, but the question asks for the condition's name. Since it's plural, perhaps it's N/A unless a specific one is mentioned. Wait, the article says "symptoms of her autoimmune diseases and arthritis," so the answer would be "autoimmune diseases" but the question asks for the name of the condition. Since it's plural and not specified, maybe N/A? Wait, the question is "what autoimmune condition did Dawn Murray attribute..." but she had more than one. However, the question might expect "autoimmune diseases" as the answer. Alternatively, maybe it's N/A because no specific name is given. Hmm. The exact wording is "symptoms of her autoimmune diseases and arthritis." Since it's plural, perhaps the answer is N/A as no specific condition is named. Alternatively, "autoimmune diseases" could be acceptable. Let me check the text again: "It worsened the symptoms of her autoimmune diseases and arthritis..." So the autoimmune condition is "autoimmune diseases" (plural), but the question asks for the name of the condition. Since it's plural, maybe the answer is N/A because it's not a single named condition. Alternatively, the question might accept "autoimmune diseases" as the term she used, but the question specifies "autoimmune condition," so maybe "N/A" is better.

11. **Question 11**: Katie Nessel's followers. The article states she has more than 200,000 followers. So the answer is "200,000" (but it says "more than," so exact number isn't given. Wait, the question says "currently have, according to the article?" The article says "more than 200,000 followers", so the answer would be "200,000" (since it's the figure mentioned, even if it's "more than"). But the question says "how many followers," so maybe "more than 200,000" but the instructions say to answer with the exact number if possible. Since it's "more than," perhaps N/A? Wait, the exact wording is "more than 200,000 followers". The question is asking for the current number according to the article, so the answer is "200,000" (since the article states "more than 200,000", but the question might require the exact figure. However, the article doesn't give the exact number, so maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "more than 200,000 followers", so the answer is "200,000" because that's the number mentioned, even if it's "more than". Alternatively, since it's "more than", the exact number isn't given, so N/A. Hmm. The instructions say if it's not provided, answer N/A. Since the article says "more than 200,000", but doesn't state the exact current number, so N/A? Or is "200,000" acceptable because it's the lower bound? The question asks for the current number according to the article, which states "more than 200,000", so the exact number isn't there. So answer N/A. Wait, but maybe the question is asking for the figure mentioned, so the answer is "200,000". The article says "more than 200,000 followers", so the answer is "200,000" because that's the number cited. I think the answer is 200,000.

12. **Question 12**: The app Dawn Murray subscribed to. The article says she used Reframe. So the answer is "Reframe".

13. **Question 13**: Health metric improved by reducing binge drinking. The article mentions blood pressure, liver function, quality of life, and anxiety symptoms. The question asks for the specific metric. The exact wording is "improved liver function and a better quality of life. Heavy drinkers can reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease from moderating their alcohol use. A small study showed that anxiety symptoms also improved." So the answer could be "blood pressure", "liver function", "quality of life", "cardiovascular disease risk", or "anxiety symptoms". The question says "what specific health metric improved". Since the question is singular, I need to pick the one explicitly mentioned. The first study mentioned is "drop in blood pressure, improved liver function and a better quality of life". The question is about reducing binge drinking leading to which metric? The article says "Studies have recently found that people who cut back on their drinking or binge drink less often experience a drop in blood pressure, improved liver function and a better quality of life." So the options are those three. The question asks for the specific metric. Since it's asking for one, maybe the first one mentioned? Or maybe the answer is "blood pressure", but the question says "specific health metric improved in individuals who reduced binge drinking". Since all three are mentioned, but the question might expect one of them. The exact wording is "what health metric improved", so any of the three. The first one listed is "drop in blood pressure", so maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, the answer could be "blood pressure" or "liver function", but since the question is asking for the specific one cited, perhaps "blood pressure" is the first one. Alternatively, the answer is "blood pressure" because it's listed first. The question says "what specific health metric improved", so the answer is one of them. Since the question is asking for any, but needs to be specific, the answer is "blood pressure" (the first mentioned). Alternatively, the article says "improved liver function" as well. Wait, the exact question is "what specific health metric improved in individuals who reduced binge drinking, according to studies cited in the article?" Since multiple are listed, but the question asks for the specific, perhaps all three are valid, but since the answer must be a single term, perhaps the first one. Alternatively, the answer is "blood pressure" as one of them. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "blood pressure, liver function, and quality of life" but the question asks for "what" (singular). Hmm. The question might accept any of them. The first one mentioned is blood pressure. Let me check the exact sentence again: "Studies have recently found that people who cut back on their drinking or binge drink less often experience a drop in blood pressure, improved liver function and a better quality of life." So three metrics. The question asks for one, so perhaps the answer is "blood pressure" (the first one listed). Alternatively, the question might have a trick, but the article says all three. Since the question is "what specific health metric", maybe the answer is "blood pressure" as the first one. Alternatively, the answer could be any of them, but the instructions say to answer with the exact answer from the text. Since the question is asking for one of them, perhaps the first one is acceptable. But the problem is the question says "what specific", so maybe it's expecting a list? But the instructions say to answer with sentence fragments or words. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "blood pressure" because it's explicitly mentioned. I'll go with "blood pressure".

14. **Question 14**: When Christine Mosley first adopted soberish. The article says she decided to try soberish "more recently" after her initial failed attempt at sobriety. The initial attempt was last year when she had the hangover. But the exact year isn't given. The article was written in 2023 (since Kayla's book is 2023). The article says "last year" for her initial decision to never drink again, which would be 2022 if the article is 2023. Then "more recently" she tried soberish, so maybe 2023. But the question asks the year she first tried soberish after her initial failed attempt. Since the article mentions "more recently" without a year, the answer is N/A.

15. **Question 15**: Kayla Lyons' medication. The article states she used alcohol and Klonopin. So the answer is "Klonopin".

16. **Question 16**: AA symbol tattoo. The article says she got the organization's symbol (AA) tattooed on her forearm. The symbol is the AA logo, which is a triangle with three circles inside? Or the 12 steps? The exact symbol isn't named, but the article says "the organization's symbol", so the answer is "AA's symbol" or "Alcoholics Anonymous symbol". Since the question asks for the term, perhaps it's "the triangle symbol" but the article doesn't specify. The article just says "the organization's symbol", so the answer is "Alcoholics Anonymous symbol".

17. **Question 17**: Term for Dawn's anxiety due to hangovers. The article says she called it "hangziety". So the answer is "hangziety".

18. **Question 18**: Health condition linked to moderating alcohol. The article says heavy drinkers can reduce risk of cardiovascular disease. So the answer is "cardiovascular disease".

19. **Question 19**: Year CDC data showed alcohol deaths began doubling. The article states between 1999 and 2020, deaths more than doubled. The question asks when they "began to double". The data is from the CDC analysis, but the article doesn't specify the starting year of the doubling. The period is 1999-2020, so the answer is N/A because it's over the entire period, not a specific start year. Alternatively, maybe 1999 is the start, but the question is about when the doubling began, not the time frame. Since the article only states the period and the doubling occurred over those years, the exact start year isn't given. So N/A.
