Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions that Meta's policy prohibits the sale of pharmaceutical drugs without proper certification. The providers were accused of not following this. The exact certification isn't named, but the policy refers to "proper certification." Since the question asks for the specific certification required, but the article doesn't name it, maybe it's "certification" itself? Wait, the article says "without proper certification." So the answer is "proper certification." But maybe the question expects "certification for pharmaceutical sales" or something. Wait, the exact term used is "rules that prohibit the sale of pharmaceutical drugs on its platforms without proper certification." So the required certification is "proper certification." But maybe the answer is "certification for pharmaceutical sales" but the article doesn't specify beyond "proper certification." Hmm, maybe the answer is "proper certification." Let me check again.

2. **Question 2**: The article says providers in states where abortion is legal have been mailing pills to states with bans under shield laws. But the question is how many states with shield laws were specifically named. The article doesn't name any states with shield laws. It just mentions "twelve states have banned abortion" but doesn't name states with shield laws. So the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The internal policy document linked to reduced content moderation and abortion-related misinformation isn't mentioned. The article talks about Zuckerberg's changes but doesn't name a specific document. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The FDA permits mifepristone and misoprostol. The question asks for a third medication. The article only mentions these two. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Aid Access was blocked from Facebook since November, but the exact date isn't given. The article says "since November," so no specific date. Answer N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The Community Standards mentioned are "guns, drugs and other restricted goods." The question asks which category besides drugs and firearms was listed. The article says "guns, drugs and other restricted goods," so "other restricted goods" is the third. But the question asks which prohibited item category was applied to Women Help Women. The article says their accounts were suspended for not following "Community Standards on guns, drugs and other restricted goods." So the category is "other restricted goods," but maybe "restricted goods" as a category. The answer is "other restricted goods" or "restricted goods"? The exact wording is "guns, drugs and other restricted goods," so the third is "other restricted goods." So the answer is "other restricted goods."

7. **Question 7**: The Supreme Court overturned Roe in 2022. The article says since then there's been an uptick in removals. But how many days after? The article doesn't give a specific date for when Meta changed policies post-Roe. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The question is about legislation conflicting with state shield laws. The article mentions 12 states banned abortion and more have restrictions on mail-order pills. The article doesn't name a specific federal law conflicting with shield laws. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The article doesn't mention the percentage of followers lost by Hey Jane. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The closing sections mention Silicon Valley workers' protests. The article says they used "subtle acts of defiance" but doesn't name specific tactics. The exact tactic isn't specified, so N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The CEO mentioned is Mark Zuckerberg, as he announced the speech policy changes, and Meta said the suspensions weren't related to that. So answer is Mark Zuckerberg.

12. **Question 12**: Aid Access had posts blurred on Instagram and blocked from Facebook since November. The article says "Aid Access... said some posts were removed on its Facebook account and blurred out on its Instagram account since November, with more posts blurred in recent days. The abortion pill service said it has been blocked from accessing its Facebook account since November..." So the answer is Aid Access.

13. **Question 13**: The article mentions Instagram hiding accounts from search. Hey Jane's account was invisible in Instagram search. Also, Women Help Women and others were suspended. The article says "Instagram also suspended the accounts of several abortion pill providers and hid the providers from appearing in search and recommendations." So Instagram is the platform. The answer is Instagram.

14. **Question 14**: The advocacy organization is the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), with Lisa Femia quoted. So answer is Electronic Frontier Foundation.

15. **Question 15**: The providers suspended and restored include Women Help Women and Just the Pill, and Hey Jane's account was invisible. The explicit mention is "the Instagram accounts of other abortion pill providers, including Women Help Women and Just the Pill, were also suspended in recent days. The providers said the reason... Both accounts were restored on Thursday." So the answer could be Women Help Women or Just the Pill. The question asks for a provider noted as suspended recently before restoration. Either is correct, but the question says "explicitly noted"—since both are mentioned, but the question is singular. Maybe the first one mentioned? The question says "explicitly noted as having been suspended recently on Instagram before later being restored" – both are examples. The article says "the Instagram accounts of other abortion pill providers, including Women Help Women and Just the Pill, were also suspended in recent days. The providers said the reason that Meta gave them for the suspensions was that their accounts did not 'follow our Community Standards on guns, drugs and other restricted goods.' Both accounts were restored on Thursday." So the answer is either, but since the question says "which provider's account" (singular), perhaps the first one listed, Women Help Women.

16. **Question 16**: The policy is Meta's Community Standards on guns, drugs, and other restricted goods. The answer is "Community Standards."

17. **Question 17**: The reinstatements happened on Thursday, as per "Meta restored some of the accounts and posts on Thursday, after The New York Times asked about the actions." So answer is Thursday.

18. **Question 18**: The technology correspondent covering Facebook and Silicon Valley is Mike Isaac. The article says "Mike Isaac is a technology correspondent for The Times based in San Francisco. He regularly covers Facebook and Silicon Valley."

19. **Question 19**: The first drug listed is mifepristone. The article says "mifepristone and misoprostol."

20. **Question 20**: The AI firm mentioned is DeepSeek. The article's closing sections mention "DeepSeek's Rise: The little-known artificial intelligence firm..."
