Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article and answer strictly based on that. Let's go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks which Democratic senator praised Bessent's experience in agricultural policy while questioning his stance on minimum wage. The article mentions Senator Bernie Sanders (independent from Vermont) asked about the minimum wage. But the praise part... Wait, the article says Bessent mentioned his South Carolina roots and owning farmland in North Dakota to counter the oligarchy implication. But the specific praise from a Democratic senator isn't mentioned. The question might be a trick. The article says Wyden called him a case in point, but no praise on agricultural policy. So maybe N/A?

Wait, actually, the article states that Bessent referred to himself as a rare Treasury nominee who listens to farm radio. But no senator praised his experience in agricultural policy. The question is asking for a senator who did that while questioning the minimum wage. Since the minimum wage question came from Sanders, but there's no mention of any Democratic senator praising his agri experience, so N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many billions Bessent proposed for IRS computer systems. The article says he supported upgrades to antiquated systems but no specific amount. The CBO mentioned $4 trillion over a decade for tax cuts, but that's different. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Percentage reduction in Chinese import prices. The article says Bessent suggested exporters would lower prices but no percentage. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Former Treasury Secretary he cited for sovereign wealth fund. The article says he mentioned a sovereign wealth fund but didn't name any former secretary. Yellen is mentioned for the tax agreement, but not as inspiration. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Total amount of farm products China failed to buy. The article says he would press China to buy products they promised and make up for over four years, but no specific amount. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Month in 2023 when he met Senate Finance Committee. The hearing was mentioned but no date. The article is about his confirmation hearing, but the exact month isn't given. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Number of jobs created in first year. The article mentions a "golden age" creating jobs but no specific number. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Interest rate threshold for digital currency. No mention of interest rates related to digital currency. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** European nation benefiting from Yellen's tax deal. The article says the international tax deal could allow European nations to tax US companies, but no specific country. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Revenue target for sovereign wealth fund. The article mentions generating revenues but no specific target. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Percentage increase in federal revenue from the fund. No numbers given. N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Soybeans in metric tons demanded. The article mentions farm products but no specific volume. N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Barrels per day reduction for Iranian oil. The article says "Make Iran poor again" and sanctions on oil, but no specific barrels. N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Interest rate threshold for debt ceiling. The article says he'd explore abandoning the debt limit if Trump called for it, but no interest rate mentioned. N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Dollar amount added to tax burden. He called it the "largest tax increase in history" but no specific figure. The CBO mentioned $4 trillion over ten years, but per family? Not specified. N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Percentage of global profits in low-tax jurisdictions. The article mentions the tax agreement aimed to stop profits in low-tax countries but no percentage. N/A.

17. **Question 17:** Budget for IRS computer systems. The article says he supported upgrades but no specific billions. N/A.

18. **Question 18:** Agricultural commodity price index cited. He mentioned farm radio but no specific index. N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Tax code section referenced by Wyden. The article says Democratic staff reviewed his tax returns and mentioned IRS litigation, but no specific section. N/A.

20. **Question 20:** Unemployment rate from minimum wage hike. The article has Bessent opposing the minimum wage but no specific unemployment rate. N/A.

All questions require exact figures or names not present in the text. So all answers are N/A except maybe question 1? Wait, the first question again. Let me check again for question 1.

Question 1: "Which Democratic senator specifically praised Bessent's experience in agricultural policy while questioning his stance on minimum wage increases?"

The article says Senator Bernie Sanders (independent from Vermont) asked about the minimum wage. But the praise part: "He referred to himself as a rare Treasury secretary nominee who listens to farm radio on the weekends." The article says he defused the implication from Democrats that he's part of the oligarchy by mentioning his farm roots. But no Democratic senator is mentioned as praising his agricultural experience. The question is whether any senator did that while questioning the minimum wage. Since the minimum wage question came from Sanders, but there's no mention of a senator praising his agri experience. So the answer is N/A.

So all answers are N/A except maybe none. Wait, let me check the article again for question 17: "What specific budget allocation, in billions of dollars, did he endorse for upgrading the agency's antiquated computer systems?" The article says he supported upgrades to antiquated computer systems but no specific amount. So N/A.

Therefore all answers are N/A.
