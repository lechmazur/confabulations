Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks for the total monetary gain over 40 years from the FDA's nicotine plan. The article mentions "$30 trillion in benefits would accrue over 40 years." That seems straightforward. The answer should be 30 trillion.

2. The second question is about the health official who referenced his cardiology patient experience. The article says Dr. Robert Califf, the FDA commissioner, talked about treating cardiology patients. So his name is Robert Califf.

3. The third question asks which nonprofit's president urged moving the nicotine rule, linking it to fighting cancer and cardiovascular disease. The article mentions Yolonda C. Richardson from the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. So the organization is Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.

4. The fourth question is about the product exempt from the nicotine limits. The rule applies to cigarettes, roll-your-own, pipe tobacco, and cigars except "premium cigars." So the exempt product is premium cigars.

5. The fifth question is about the incoming chief of staff with a lobbying background for a cigar company. The text says Susie Wiles, Trump's chief of staff, was a lobbyist for Swisher, a cigar maker. So the answer is Susie Wiles.

6. The sixth question asks which group faces revenue loss from reduced cigarette sales. The article mentions convenience store retailers opposing the proposal due to revenue decline. So the answer is convenience store retailers.

7. The seventh question is about the year a House subcommittee tried to block FDA funding. The article states in 2023, a subcommittee passed a measure to prevent funding. The answer is 2023.

8. The eighth question asks for the estimated deaths prevented by 2060. The article says 1.8 million by 2060. So that's the number.

9. The ninth question links a nation with critical minerals and status comments. The article mentions Canada in relation to critical minerals and Trump's state comments. So the answer is Canada.

10. The last question is about the number of young people avoiding smoking by 2100. The article states 48 million. So that's the figure.

Let me double-check each answer against the text to ensure accuracy and that I didn't miss any details. All answers seem to be directly from the article without needing inference beyond what's stated. No questions require guessing or external knowledge. Okay, I think that's all covered.
