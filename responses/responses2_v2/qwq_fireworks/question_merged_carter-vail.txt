1. Which record label ultimately signed Carter Vail after the bidding war mentioned in the article? Hmm, the article says he was in a bidding war but doesn't mention which label won. So the answer here is N/A.

2. How many followers did Carter Vail have on social media before releasing "Dirt Man"? The article states he now has over two million followers combined on Instagram and TikTok after "Dirt Man" helped build that. But before? The article doesn't say, so N/A.

4. During which month in 2024 did Carter Vail release "Dirt Man"? The article says "Seven months ago" from the time of the interview. But the article doesn't specify the current date or the year. It mentions 2025 in the context of being a content creator in 2025. If the interview is in 2025, then seven months before would be 2024? Wait, the article says "By Alyson Krueger" and mentions "in 2025". So if the article is written in 2025, "seven months ago" would be 2024's month?
