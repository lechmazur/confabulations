Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly based on the text and not infer anything beyond what's stated.

1. The question asks which prominent employee left due to the Sam Altman controversy. The article says OpenAI lost several employees, including Ilya Sutskever, the chief scientist and co-founder, after the CEO's firing and reinstatement. So the answer is Ilya Sutskever.

2. SoftBank's investment in the October funding round: The article mentions that in October, OpenAI completed a $6.6B funding round valuing them at $157B, and SoftBank was part of that. The exact amount SoftBank contributed isn't specified, so this is N/A.

3. DeepSeek's technical innovation allowing fewer chips isn't detailed. The article states they built it at lower cost and with fewer chips, but the primary innovation isn't named. So N/A.

4. The Stargate partnership with Oracle's announcement date isn't given. The article mentions Stargate is a joint venture of SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, but when they partnered isn't stated. N/A.

5. The percentage allocated to OpenAI o3's development isn't in the text. The $500B is for computing infrastructure overall, but specifics on allocation aren't provided. N/A.

6. The government agency approving Stargate before the White House announcement isn't mentioned. The article only notes the White House announcement. N/A.

7. Ilya Sutskever's role in OpenAI o3 before leaving: The article says he left, but doesn't specify his role in developing o3. N/A.

8. Computing power comparison between DeepSeek and OpenAI's chatbot: The article says DeepSeek used fewer chips but doesn't state the exact percentage. N/A.

9. Valuation difference between OpenAI and SpaceX: The article says if the higher $340B valuation is used, OpenAI would be second behind SpaceX. But the exact difference isn't given. However, the question is about the valuation difference at the time of negotiations. Since the article states that $340B would make them second behind SpaceX, but no exact numbers for SpaceX are given, so N/A.

10. The investigation into DeepSeek's data harvesting is led by OpenAI, as per the text. The article states OpenAI is investigating.

11. The tool released to counter threats is "Deep Research" mentioned in the article.

12. The total Stargate investment is stated as potentially $500B from the companies involved.

13. The technology requiring more computing power unveiled in December is OpenAI o3.

14. The chatbot that sparked the AI boom is ChatGPT, released in late 2022.

15. The valuation went from $157B to nearly double in October. The previous was $6.6B round's valuation. Wait, the article says the October 2023 funding round was $6.6B which valued them at $157B, nearly double from nine months earlier. The prior valuation would be around $157B / ~2 = ~$78.5B. So the multiple is roughly 2x. But the question says if the $250B valuation is chosen, but the question is about the difference between the October valuation and nine months prior. The article says "nearly doubling the high-profile company's valuation from just nine months earlier". So the multiple is nearly 2x. The exact answer is "nearly double" but the question asks "how many times greater". Since it's "nearly", maybe the answer is 2. But the question specifies the SoftBank negotiations context, but the October round's valuation was $157B, which was double from nine months prior. So the multiple is 2 times. The answer would be 2.

16. Klarna's approach contrasts with large employers downplaying AI taking jobs. The article says Klarna is a darling of tech investors who downplay job loss, but the question is the concern they downplayed. The answer is job loss or job replacement by AI.

17. The Chinese startup with propaganda in chatbot answers is DeepSeek.

18. The October funding round total was $6.6 billion.

19. The infringement accusation is copyright infringement by The New York Times.

20. The higher valuation ($340B) would still be behind SpaceX. So SpaceX remains the higher valued private company.

21. The two valuation figures mentioned are $250B and $340B. The difference is 90 billion.

22. The total of the $100B Stargate and $25B SoftBank is 125 billion.

23. The company investigating DeepSeek's use of their data is OpenAI.

24. The controversial decision was firing Sam Altman, then reinstating him after 5 days.

25. The new tech introduced after the rival system is OpenAI o3.

26. The software company in the joint venture is Oracle.

27. The Chinese startup is DeepSeek.

28. The co-founder and chief scientist who left is Ilya Sutskever.

29. The October funding was in October.

30. The country's conglomerate is Japan (SoftBank).

Now I need to check each answer against the text again to ensure accuracy.
