Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly what's asked. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The question is about the material used for the latticed walls of the Serpentine Pavilion that reflects Escobedo's design philosophy. The article mentions that her Serpentine Pavilion had latticed walls made of gray concrete roof tiles. Since she values materials that age well, this fits. So the answer should be gray concrete roof tiles.

2. **Question 2:** The circular sloping stage at the Lisbon Triennale is mentioned. The question asks what performance space she designed that elevates the audience as the performer grows. The article says "a circular sloping stage that elevates the performer as the audience grows." Wait, the wording here is a bit tricky. The description says the stage elevates the performer as the audience grows, so maybe the answer is the same stage? But the question is phrased as "similarly elevates the audience as the performer grows." Hmm, maybe I misread. The article states "a circular sloping stage that elevates the performer as the audience grows." The question might have a typo, but the answer would still be that same stage. But the question is phrased as "performance space did she design that similarly elevates the audience as the performer grows?" Maybe I'm misunderstanding. The article says the stage elevates the performer as the audience grows, so perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, maybe the question is referring to another project? The article doesn't mention another similar one. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "similarly elevates the audience as the performer grows" – but the original description is about the performer being elevated as the audience grows. Maybe the answer is the same stage, but the question might be a trick. Let me check again. The article says: "a circular sloping stage that elevates the performer as the audience grows." The question is asking for a performance space that elevates the audience as the performer grows. That's the opposite, so maybe N/A? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe it's a misread, and the correct answer is that stage, but the question's wording is off. Since the article doesn't mention another one, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "similarly elevates the audience as the performer grows" – maybe it's a misstatement. Since the article only mentions the Lisbon stage, perhaps the answer is N/A because the description in the text is about the performer being elevated. So maybe the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The question is about the ancient city that influenced the Serpentine Pavilion's axis. The article states that the Serpentine Pavilion's axis referred to the Prime Meridian, and mentions Huaca Pucllana and Chan Chan as influences for the Met wing. Wait, the question is about the Serpentine's axis. The article says: "Her design featured a partly enclosed courtyard framing a triangular pool, with latticed walls made of gray concrete roof tiles and a curving mirrored canopy. The axis of Escobedo's pavilion referred to the Prime Meridian, the global marker of time and distance established in 1851 at Greenwich, England." So the axis referenced the Prime Meridian, which is in Greenwich. But the question asks what ancient city she cited as an inspiration for the axis. The Prime Meridian is a geographical marker, not a city. However, the article says the axis was inspired by the Prime Meridian established at Greenwich. Greenwich is a place, but is it an ancient city? The Prime Meridian was established in 1851, so Greenwich is a modern reference. The question might be looking for an ancient city mentioned elsewhere. Wait, the article mentions Huaca Pucllana (a pyramid in Peru) and Chan Chan (pre-Columbian city) as influences for the Met wing, but for the Serpentine's axis, the article only mentions the Prime Meridian. Since the question is about the Serpentine Pavilion's axis, maybe the answer is N/A because the influence there was the Prime Meridian, not an ancient city. Alternatively, perhaps I missed something. The question might be confused between the Met and the Serpentine. Since the question is about the Serpentine, the answer is N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Sade Lythcott talks about Escobedo's ability to communicate with the future and past, and the element in Ray Harlem that amplifies community spirit. The article says: "the building had to be Frida's flagship here" and "understood the importance of built space to gather community and to amplify the spirit and the soul of a people." The project includes residential, retail, and performance spaces. The question asks what element she designed for Ray Harlem. The answer is probably the performance spaces, but the article doesn't specify a particular element. Wait, the exact quote from Lythcott is: "this building had to be Frida's flagship here." The project includes performance spaces, so maybe the performance space is the answer. The question asks for the element that amplifies the spirit, so the answer is "performance spaces".

5. **Question 5:** The Met's reassembled collection is in 70,000 sq ft of galleries. The question asks how many square feet she added. The article states: "the project also includes about 18,600 square feet of terraces, as well as a cafe and new staircases." Wait, the question is about exhibition space. The galleries are 70,000 sq ft, which is the total. But the question is "how many square feet of exhibition space did she add to showcase the reassembled collection?" The article says "70,000 square feet of galleries (the project also includes about 18,600 square feet of terraces...)" So the answer is 70,000.

6. **Question 6:** David Breslin's comment on leadership as an enlightened idea. The question asks what aspect of her personality contributes to the rigor of her designs for performance spaces. The article says: "there is a poise and equanimity that you also see in the rigor of her architecture." So the answer is "poise and equanimity".

7. **Question 7:** The installation at Museo Experimental El Eco. The article mentions "El Eco Pavilion for the Museo Experimental El Eco in Mexico City, a site-specific installation." So the answer is "site-specific installation".

8. **Question 8:** Early in her career, she used simple materials and relied on what detailing? The article says: "the idea of trying to do more with less was always present, and how to achieve that with simple materials and rather than depending on supersophisticated detailing or rich, complicated finishes." So the answer is "supersophisticated detailing" was avoided, so she relied on "simple materials" but the question is about the detailing she didn't use. Wait, the question is what detailing did she *rely on*? The article says she didn't use supersophisticated detailing. Instead, she used "rather than depending on supersophisticated detailing... it was more about the big gesture". So the answer is she relied on "simple means" or "big gesture". But the question asks for the type of detailing she used. Since she avoided supersophisticated detailing, maybe she used "simple detailing" but the exact wording is "rather than depending on supersophisticated detailing or rich, complicated finishes." So the answer is "supersophisticated detailing" is what she didn't use. The question asks what she *relied on*. The article says "how to achieve that with simple materials and rather than depending on supersophisticated detailing..." So she used simple materials and big gestures, not the sophisticated detailing. So the answer is "simple detailing" or "big gesture". Wait, the exact quote: "the idea of trying to do more with less was always present, and how to achieve that with simple materials and rather than depending on supersophisticated detailing or rich, complicated finishes. It was more about the big gesture..." So the answer is she relied on "big gesture" and simple materials. But the question is about the detailing. Since she didn't use supersophisticated detailing, the answer is she relied on "simple detailing" but the article doesn't explicitly name it. Alternatively, maybe "supersophisticated detailing" is what she avoided, so the answer is N/A? Wait, the question is asking what type of detailing did she *rely on*. Since she avoided supersophisticated detailing, perhaps she used "simple detailing" but the article doesn't state that. The closest is "simple materials" and "big gesture". The question specifies detailing, so maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "rather than depending on supersophisticated detailing..." implying she used simpler detailing. Since the question is about what she relied on, maybe "simple detailing" is the answer, but the article doesn't explicitly say that. Alternatively, the answer is "supersophisticated detailing" is what she didn't use, so the question's answer is N/A. Hmm, tricky. The article says she used "simple materials" and "big gesture" instead of the sophisticated detailing. So the detailing she used would be the opposite, but the article doesn't name it. So perhaps the answer is "simple detailing" but since it's not explicitly stated, maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "what type of detailing did she rely on to achieve..." The answer is "supersophisticated detailing" is what she didn't rely on, so the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe "simple detailing" is the correct answer even if not explicitly stated. Hmm, the article says "rather than depending on supersophisticated detailing...", so she used something else. The answer might be "simple detailing" but since it's not explicitly named, perhaps N/A. Alternatively, since the article says "the idea of trying to do more with less was always present, and how to achieve that with simple materials and rather than depending on supersophisticated detailing...", the detailing she used was the opposite, so maybe "simple detailing" is implied. I'll go with "supersophisticated detailing" is not used, so the answer is she relied on "simple means" but the question is about detailing. Maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, the question might expect "supersophisticated detailing" as the one she avoided, so the answer is N/A. Hmm. Let me check again. The question is: "what type of detailing did she rely on to achieve interesting and engaging designs early in her career?" The article says she didn't use supersophisticated detailing. So she relied on something else, but the article doesn't specify the type, only that she used simple materials and big gestures. Since the question is about detailing, and the article says she avoided supersophisticated detailing, perhaps the answer is "simple detailing" but that's an assumption. Since it's not explicitly stated, maybe N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "simple detailing" but I'm not sure. Hmm. Maybe better to put N/A here.

9. **Question 9:** The question asks what previous design for the wing was rejected due to cost, mentioned by Hollein's father. The article states: "David Chipperfield, whose earlier design for the wing had ballooned in price to as much as $800 million (hers is expected to cost $550 million)." So the answer is David Chipperfield's design was the rejected one. The question says "mentioned by Hollein's father", but the article doesn't say the father mentioned it. Hollein is the Met director, whose father was Hans Hollein, a Pritzker winner. The article says "Hollein, whose father, Hans Hollein, was a Pritzker Prize-winning architect." The question might be implying that Hollein's father's opinion influenced the choice, but the rejected design is David Chipperfield's. So the answer is David Chipperfield's design.

10. **Question 10:** The prestigious award in 2019 before the Pompidou overhaul. The article says in 2019 she received the International Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects and Domus' 100+ Best. So the answer is "International Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects".

11. **Question 11:** Original cost of David Chipperfield's design was up to $800 million as per the article. So the answer is $800 million.

12. **Question 12:** The question is about the National Black Theater's new building designed with Handel Architects, and what Bauhaus artist's patterns are in the facade. The article mentions Anni Albers as an influence for the Met's Tang Wing: "Among the architect's influences were the Bauhaus textile artist Anni Albers..." But the question is about the National Black Theater project. The article doesn't mention Anni Albers in relation to that project, so N/A? Wait, the question might be mixing up projects. The article says: "the axis of Escobedo's pavilion referred to the Prime Meridian..." and mentions Anni Albers as an influence for the Met wing. The National Black Theater project with Handel isn't linked to Anni Albers in the text. So answer N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Material used in Hotel Boca Chica's renovation later in the Met's Tang Wing. The article says Hotel Boca Chica had a renovation, but doesn't mention specific materials. The Met's Tang Wing uses limestone lattice. The article doesn't link materials between the two projects, so N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Hans Hollein's architectural principle influencing his son's choice. The article states Hollein's father was a Pritzker winner, but doesn't mention his principles influencing the choice. The reason given is Escobedo's understanding of art and public space. The question asks which of Hans Hollein's principles Max cited. Since the article doesn't mention any specific principles from Hans, the answer is N/A.
