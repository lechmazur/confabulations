Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. The first question asks about another piece by Schumann that Janowski conducted in those cities besides Symphony No. 3. The article mentions he conducted Schumann's Symphony No. 3 multiple times but doesn't list any other works by Schumann. So I should answer N/A here.

2. The second question refers to Janowski's physical ailment before rehearsals. He mentioned feeling a bit tired before rehearsals but says he forgets it once starting. The Richard Strauss quote is about not sweating but making the audience warm. The question asks for the physical ailment mirroring the audience's desired state. The audience should get warm (not sweaty), so maybe the conductor's tiredness is the ailment. But the question is about the ailment he experiences. The text says he sometimes feels tired before, so the answer is "tiredness".

3. Third question asks for the specific radio program they listened to for alerts. The article says they got information from the radio about aircraft attacks but doesn't name a specific program. So N/A.

4. Fourth question: Janowski said he could now live without conducting, unlike 20-30 years ago. The exact activity is conducting. The answer is "conducting".

5. Fifth question: What equipment did he hold in his mouth? The text says he had conducting batons in his teeth. So "conducting batons".

6. Sixth question: Nationality ascribed to the "disease" of nationalism. The article says nationalism is a wave through countries, not specific nationality. So N/A.

7. Seventh question: Original year before pandemic. The article says the 2020 engagement was postponed, so the original was 2020.

8. Eighth question: Composer other than the three mentioned he named. The Strauss quote is about the conductor not sweating, but the composer mentioned is Richard Strauss. Wait, the question asks for a composer he mentioned by name in the context of serving the composer. The article's last question mentions serving the composer, but the only other named composer in the interview is Richard Strauss. Wait, but the program includes Schumann, Mendelssohn, Weber. The question is about another composer he mentioned. The only other is Richard Strauss from his quote. But the question is about serving the composer, so maybe not. Alternatively, the article's interview excerpts don't mention another composer. Hmm, maybe N/A.

Wait, the article says in the conversation part: "What Richard Strauss said: 'The conductor should not sweat. He should make the audience get warm.'" So he mentioned Richard Strauss by name. But the question is about a composer he mentioned in the context of serving. Since the question is about serving the composer, perhaps the answer is N/A because he didn't mention another composer besides the ones in the program. Wait, but the question allows any composer he named in the interview. Since he mentioned Strauss, but Strauss isn't part of the program. The question says "other than Schumann, Mendelssohn, and Weber", so the answer would be Richard Strauss.

Wait, the question says "emphasizing the importance of the audience's emotional response" â€“ the Strauss quote is about making the audience warm (emotional response). So the composer he mentioned by name in that context is Richard Strauss. So the answer is Richard Strauss.

9. Ninth question: Mode of transportation they missed due to delayed info. The text says they couldn't leave the house to go to the shelter. So the transportation isn't specified. They might have walked, but the article doesn't mention any specific mode. So N/A.

10. Tenth question: Venue he conducted at in the 80s/90s. The article says he was often at the Metropolitan Opera during that time. So answer is "Metropolitan Opera".

11. Eleventh question: Composer's opera at Bayreuth. The article mentions he has appeared at Bayreuth Festival, but doesn't specify which composer's opera. Bayreuth is known for Wagner, but the article doesn't state it. So N/A.

12. Twelfth question: Years after Met debut to Philharmonic invitation. The article says in his late 70s he thought he wouldn't conduct Philharmonic, but when the invitation came, he was surprised. The article doesn't specify when he debuted at the Met. So can't calculate years. N/A.

13. Thirteenth question: Principal cellist in Dresden mentoring him. The article mentions his positions but doesn't name a cellist. N/A.

14. Fourteenth question: Health condition affecting stamina. The text says he sometimes feels tired before rehearsal but doesn't name a condition. N/A.

15. Fifteenth question: Political ideology blamed for displacement. The article says nationalism is a disease, but his family's displacement during WWII might be due to war, not specifically nationalism. The question asks what he directly blames. The text says he worries about nationalism as a wave. The displacement in WWII might be due to war, but the question is about his direct blame. The article says he was born in Poland, moved to Germany. His father disappeared in Poland. Maybe nationalism, but the question is about the political ideology he blames. The article states "nationalism is not touching one country. It's a wave through all these countries. It's like a disease, an infection." So the answer is "nationalism".

16. Sixteenth question: Rare instrument he studied as a child. The article doesn't mention any instrument he studied before conducting. N/A.

17. Seventeenth question: Composer's work for 2020 debut. The article says the 2020 engagement was rescheduled, but doesn't name the composer. N/A.

18. Eighteenth question: Number of declined invitations in 1990s. The article doesn't mention how many times he declined. N/A.

19. Nineteenth question: Trauma from Dresden bombing affecting Weber. The article mentions Weber's works but doesn't link to Dresden bombing. N/A.

20. Twentieth question: Unique conducting technique with Radio France. The article says he held top positions there but doesn't describe a technique. N/A.

Now I'll structure the answers accordingly.
