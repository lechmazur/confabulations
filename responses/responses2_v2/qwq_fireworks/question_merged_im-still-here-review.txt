Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I use only the information from the provided article. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and cross-referencing the article.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about Walter Salles' primary film genre based on his approach. The article mentions he directed "I'm Still Here," which is a drama about historical events. It also references other films like "Azor," "The Eternal Memory," and "Argentina, 1985" as part of a trend exploring dictatorship-era disappearances. So, the genre here is probably historical drama or political drama. The article doesn't explicitly state his primary genre, but the context suggests it's political/historical drama. Wait, but the question is about his approach as described. The article says he uses cinema as "instruments against forgetting," so maybe the genre is drama. The answer might be "drama," but I need to check the text again. The article doesn't mention his primary genre, only the themes. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "based on his approach to filmmaking as described." The approach includes reconstructing memory through cinema. The article mentions "skillfully crafted and richly shot," but genre isn't specified. Since it's about a true story related to historical events, maybe the genre is "historical drama." But the article doesn't explicitly state his primary genre. The question might be a trick. Let me think again. The article says "South American countries... explore the personal impact of the mass disappearances under military dictatorships." So the genre here is political drama. But the question is about his primary genre. Since the article only discusses this film and others like it, perhaps the answer is "political drama" or "historical drama." But the exact term isn't in the text. Wait, the article says "skillfully crafted and richly shot," but that's style, not genre. Maybe the answer is N/A because the article doesn't state his primary genre. Hmm, I'm confused here. Let me check again. The question is about Walter Salles' primary genre based on his approach. The article says he directed "I'm Still Here," which is a historical drama. Since the question is about his approach, maybe the answer is "drama." But I'm not sure if the article specifies genre. Let me hold that thought and move on to see if I can find it elsewhere.

2. **Question 2**: The question asks for the name of the Swiss ambassador whose kidnapping led to Rubens Paiva's arrest. The article states: "news of left-wing activists kidnapping the Swiss ambassador breaks, kicking off a period of instability..." So the name isn't provided. The question asks for the name, but the article only mentions "Swiss ambassador" without a name. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The Super 8 family memories' cinematic technique. The article says, "Throughout the story, Salles repeatedly shows the family shooting photographs and Super 8 film that preserve their memories." The technique here is Super 8 film, but the question is about what technique was used to convey enduring connection. Since Super 8 is mentioned as the medium they used, perhaps the answer is "Super 8 film." But the question asks for the cinematic technique employed during filming of those memories. The article says "repeatedly shows the family shooting photographs and Super 8 film," so maybe the technique is "Super 8 film stock." The answer should be "Super 8 film."

4. **Question 4**: The specific award "I'm Still Here" won, mirroring Fernanda Torres's Golden Globe. The article says her performance "won a Golden Globe and is aiming at an Oscar nomination." The film's own award isn't mentioned except that it's a "Critic's Pick." The question asks what award the film won, but the article only mentions the Golden Globe for Torres. So the film's award isn't stated. Answer is N/A unless the Critic's Pick counts, but that's not an award. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The final verdict in the 2014 charges related to Rubens Paiva's death. The article says "it took until 2014 for anyone to be charged with his death." The question is about the verdict, but the article doesn't mention the outcome of the charges, only that charges were filed. So the answer is N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The object in the father's room representing illusion of intimacy. The article describes Nalu leading to the father's room, and the last conversation. The scene with the actor's improv is mentioned, but the object isn't named. Wait, the text says: "This is an improv created on the spot with actor Luiz Bertazzo He begins to peek into the family's intimacy." Maybe "peeking" is the action, but the object? The question might be referring to the curtains being shut? Or something else. Wait, in the scene where the daughter enters, it's mentioned that the father's room is where the last conversation happens. The article doesn't mention an object there. Maybe the curtains? Earlier, subtraction of light as curtains are shut. But the question is about an object in the father's room. Since the text doesn't specify an object, answer is N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Political office Jair Bolsonaro held before the attempted coup. The article says "details emerged of a plotted coup to keep former President Jair Bolsonaro... in power after he lost the 2022 election." So he was the former president. The answer is "President."

8. **Question 8**: Film stock used for the majority to create distance. The article mentions "cinema reconstructs memory" and the family uses Super 8, but the question is about the majority of the movie's film stock. The article says "repeatedly shows the family shooting photographs and Super 8 film," but the film's own stock isn't specified. Maybe "Super 8" is used for the memories, but the majority might be another stock. The article doesn't mention the film's stock, so answer N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Legal action Eunice advocated for beyond compensation. The article states she wanted the country to "clarify and judge all crimes committed during the dictatorship." The answer is "clarify and judge all crimes."

10. **Question 10**: Year the memoir was adapted into a screenplay. The memoir is from 2015, but the article doesn't mention when it was adapted. The film was released in 2024. So the adaptation year isn't given. Answer N/A.

11. **Question 11**: South American country with a film about disappearances where a daughter is stopped by authorities. The article mentions "Argentina, 1985" as one of the films. But the question refers to the film where the daughter is stopped. In "I'm Still Here," Vera is stopped. The question asks which country's film this is. Since "I'm Still Here" is Brazilian, the answer is Brazil. But the question says "South American countries, but especially from South American countries, seem particularly attuned..." The example given is "Azor" (maybe Chile?), "The Eternal Memory," and "Argentina, 1985". The question is asking which country's film has the scene where the daughter is stopped. Since that's from "I'm Still Here," which is Brazil, the answer is Brazil. But the question might be a trick because the other films are from Chile and Argentina. Wait, the article says "the beautiful, gutting 'I'm Still Here' joins these with its own story, this one in Brazil." So the answer is Brazil.

12. **Question 12**: Years Rubens was in exile before returning. The article states: "Rubens (Selton Mello) has recently returned home from six years of self-imposed exile." So the answer is 6.

13. **Question 13**: Visual technique during invasion scene mirroring instability. The article says "hand-held, the camera relays the instability of the situation." So the technique is "hand-held camera."

14. **Question 14**: Political event coinciding with the film's release. The article mentions "plotted coup to keep former President Jair Bolsonaro... in power after he lost the 2022 election." The film was released in Brazil in November 2024. The coup details emerged around then. The answer is "the plotted coup to keep Bolsonaro in power."

15. **Question 15**: Technological method to preserve memories. The article says the family uses "photographs and Super 8 film." So the answer is "Super 8 film."

16. **Question 16**: Countries with accountability for military crimes. The article states "unlike Chile and Argentina -- has never officially pursued accountability." So the two countries are Chile and Argentina.

17. **Question 17**: Year the main narrative begins. The article says "begins in Rio de Janeiro in 1970." So 1970.

18. **Question 18**: Event catalyzing military intervention. The left-wing activists' kidnapping of the Swiss ambassador is the catalyst. The answer is "the kidnapping of the Swiss ambassador by left-wing activists."

19. **Question 19**: Which child brings a friend during military presence. The article mentions "Nalu, played by Barbara Luz, leads us to the father's room." The scene where the daughter enters with a friend is Nalu. So the answer is "Nalu."

20. **Question 20**: Running time. The article states "Running time: 2 hours 16 minutes." So 2 hours 16 minutes.
