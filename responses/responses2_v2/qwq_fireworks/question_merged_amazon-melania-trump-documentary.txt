Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. 

1. **Question 1**: The question asks how many millions Amazon donated to Trump's inaugural fund. The article says they donated $1 million. So that's straightforward.

2. **Question 2**: The article mentions Brett Ratner directing the doc, but there's no mention of a former Press Secretary involved. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Ann Telnaes resigned over a rejected cartoon. The article states the Post rejected her cartoon, and the reason given was avoiding repetition, not her cited reason. But the question is about what she cited. The article says she resigned because her cartoon was rejected, but her reason might be inferred as the cartoon's rejection. However, the answer should be the reason she gave. The article says she resigned after the cartoon was rejected, but her stated reason isn't directly quoted. The Post's opinion editor said the rejection was due to avoiding repetition. Since the question is about what she cited, but the article doesn't state her exact reason, maybe N/A? Wait, the article says she resigned after the cartoon was rejected. The reason she cited might be the rejection itself, but the exact reason she gave isn't stated. Hmm, tricky. The article says she resigned after the rejection. The question says "cited in her resignation letter"â€”the article mentions the cartoon was rejected because the section had already published a column on the same subject and another scheduled. The editor said "the only bias was against repetition." But the article doesn't say Ann's stated reason. So maybe N/A?

Wait, the article says "Ann Telnaes, a Post cartoonist, said she was resigning after the paper's opinion section rejected a cartoon..." So the reason she resigned was the rejection. But the exact reason she gave in her letter might be that the cartoon was rejected. But the question is asking for the reason she cited. Since the article says the rejection was due to repetition, but her reason could be that her work was rejected. However, the article doesn't explicitly state her cited reason. Since the question requires the reason she cited, and the text doesn't specify, maybe N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The memoir's sales in first week to reach NYT bestseller. The article says it became a No.1 NYT bestseller but doesn't mention copies sold. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Which platform outbid Amazon? The article says Amazon has exclusive rights, so no one outbid them. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Percentage of editorial control given to Melania. The article mentions she's an exec producer but doesn't specify a percentage. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Who replaced Ratner as Oscars producer? The article says he resigned, but no replacement named. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Value of Pentagon contract. The article mentions the contract but not the amount. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Number of women in LA Times article. The article says "six women" accused Ratner. So 6.

10. **Question 10**: Date the Post stopped endorsements. The article says in October they stopped, but exact date? The article says "in October", so maybe just October, but the question asks for the date. Since it's only the month, but the question says "date", which implies day/month/year. The article doesn't specify, so N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Director known for past controversy over 2011 event. The article mentions Brett Ratner resigned from Oscars after using an anti-gay slur. So he's the director.

12. **Question 12**: The individual who wrote the memoir and is exec producer. That's Melania Trump.

13. **Question 13**: Month filming started. The article says started in December, the month after Trump won the election. So December.

14. **Question 14**: Distribution platform with exclusive rights. Amazon Prime Video.

15. **Question 15**: Company involved in disputes with Trump over shipping and Pentagon. Amazon, as mentioned in the article.

16. **Question 16**: Founder who criticized Trump but now optimistic. Jeff Bezos.

17. **Question 17**: Reporter based in west coast innovation hub (San Francisco) covering Google/YouTube. The article ends with "Nico Grant reports on Alphabet's Google..." so Nico Grant.

18. **Question 18**: Editorial change ending presidential endorsements under Bezos. The article says the Post stopped endorsements, decided by Bezos. So stopping presidential endorsements.

19. **Question 19**: Conflict over cartoon rejection leading to resignation. The cartoon was about tech execs bending knee to Trump statue. The reason for rejection was repetition, leading to Telnaes' resignation threat. The article says the reason given was repetition, so the conflict is the rejection due to that, leading to her resignation. The question asks for the internal conflict's reason. The answer is the rejection due to repetition.

Wait, the question is about the internal conflict involving the rejection of the cartoon depicting tech execs bending knee to a statue. The article states that the cartoon was rejected because they had already published a column on the same subject and had another scheduled. So the reason was avoiding repetition. The internal conflict was the rejection leading to resignation. The question asks for what led to the resignation threat. The answer is the rejection of the cartoon due to repetition, so the reason cited by the Post was repetition. The conflict's reason is the rejection because of that.

20. **Question 20**: Relative of the president (not Melania) with a new TV role. The article mentions Lara Trump (daughter-in-law) on Fox News. So Lara Trump.

Now, let's check each again.

For question 3, the user asks what Ann cited in her resignation. The article says she resigned after the cartoon was rejected. The reason the Post gave was repetition, but her own stated reason isn't given. Since the question is about her cited reason, but the text doesn't say, so N/A.

Question 10: The article says "in October" so if the question asks for the date, which is a specific day, then N/A. But if "date" is interpreted as month, maybe October? But the question says "date" which usually includes day. Since no day given, N/A.

Question 18: The answer is the decision to stop presidential endorsements.

Question 19: The internal conflict was the rejection of the cartoon, which led to resignation. The reason for the rejection was the repetition, so the answer is "rejection due to repetition" but the exact phrasing in the article is "the only bias was against repetition". The question asks for the reason cited in the conflict. The answer should be the reason the Post gave for rejection, which is avoiding repetition. So the answer is "avoiding repetition" or "repetition". The article says "the only bias was against repetition", so the reason is repetition. So answer is "repetition".

Wait, the question says "what internal conflict... involving the rejection of a cartoon depicting... led to a resignation threat". The reason for the rejection was the repetition. So the conflict's reason is the rejection because of repetition. So the answer is "repetition".

Wait, the question is phrased as "what internal conflict... led to...", so the answer would be the reason for the rejection (repetition), but the exact wording from the article is that the rejection was because of repetition. So the answer is "repetition".

Alternatively, the article says the reason was that they had already published a column on the same subject and another was scheduled. So the reason is "to avoid repetition". But the exact quote from the editor was "the only bias was against repetition". So the answer is "repetition".

Yes, so answer is "repetition".
