Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. 

1. **Question 1:** The user is asking which Met Opera production Bryn Terfel withdrew from in 2017-18 because of a broken ankle. The article mentions that Terfel was supposed to be in Wagner's "Der Fliegende Hollander" but withdrew due to a broken ankle before the pandemic. So the answer should be "Der Fliegende Hollander".

2. **Question 2:** The question is about the minutes of applause Sondra Radvanovsky received after her Act II scene. The article doesn't mention any specific duration of applause, so this is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The conductor for the first cast's uneven performances. The article only talks about the second cast having Lise Davidsen and Freddie De Tommaso, and the third with Terfel and Radvanovsky. The first cast's conductor isn't named. Xian Zhang was in the third cast. So N/A here.

4. **Question 4:** Lise Davidsen's Met debut as Tosca. The article says she sang Tosca for the first time at the Met in the November cast, which was the second run. So the year would be 2023? Wait, the article's date isn't given. Wait, the current season is being discussed, but the exact year isn't specified. The article mentions "this season" and "the pandemic" which ended in 2021. The current performances are in the fall and November, so possibly 2023? But since the text doesn't state the year, it's N/A. Wait, the article says "this season" and mentions the pandemic as before. Maybe the November performance was in 2023? But without explicit year info, the answer is N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Bryn Terfel's costume color. The article doesn't describe his costume's color, only mentions "menacing presence" through gestures. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The aria Brian Jagde received the most applause for. The article mentions he was conventional but assured, but doesn't specify which aria got the most response. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Total duration of Xian Zhang's interpretation compared to traditional. The text says her reading was "propulsive, even cinematic... light on detail but had a death-driven thrill". No duration comparison given. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Role Quinn Kelsey did before Scarpia. The article only says Quinn Kelsey sang Scarpia in November. No prior role mentioned. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Seating capacity of the Met during this performance. The article doesn't mention capacity. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Number of curtain calls. The article doesn't state this. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Medical issue causing Terfel's withdrawal in the season he was meant to debut in McVicar's staging. The article says he withdrew to have a polyp removed from his vocal cords. That was for Scarpia in 2017-18. So answer is "polyp removal".

12. **Question 12:** The soprano known for the penetrating whisper. The article says Radvanovsky's signature was the penetrating whisper. So her name is Sondra Radvanovsky.

13. **Question 13:** Whose corpse was observed when the soprano said the line about Rome trembling. The line is after Scarpia's death. So the corpse is Scarpia's.

14. **Question 14:** The Puccini opera being reviewed. The article is about "Tosca".

15. **Question 15:** Conductor for the propulsive, cinematic interpretation. Xian Zhang led the pit in the third cast, described that way. So her name.

16. **Question 16:** Celebrated performer who had issues with Wagner due to injury. Terfel had to withdraw from Wagner's "Der Fliegende Hollander" due to a broken ankle. So Bryn Terfel.

17. **Question 17:** Role that transformed from humor to despair. The article describes Tosca's portrayal by Radvanovsky as making you laugh, then heartbreak, fear, etc. So the role is Tosca.

18. **Question 18:** Phrase from the score announcing Terfel's return with authority. The article says the score instructs "con grande autorita" (with great authority). So that's the phrase.

19. **Question 19:** Which cast was criticized for miscasting and lack of drama. The second cast (November) was described as "miscast and lacking the charge of Puccini's breathless drama". So the second cast.

20. **Question 20:** Production element with architectural ingenuity. The article mentions "forced-perspective set of David McVicar's ornately traditional production" as the consistent element. So the set design by David McVicar.
