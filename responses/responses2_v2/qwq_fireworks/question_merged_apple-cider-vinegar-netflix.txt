Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the given article.

1. The first question asks about a character with increasingly bright veneers and early grifts on mommy message boards. The article mentions Belle Gibson, played by Kaitlyn Dever, who started her scam on those boards. The veneers symbolize her recent fraud. So the answer is Belle.

2. The second question refers to someone with gnarly lesions on arms indicating prognosis. The text mentions Milla's lesions show her cancer stage. So Milla is the answer.

3. The third question is about a pseudoscientific practice besides apple cider vinegar. The article mentions "coffee enema" as being featured a lot. So that's the answer.

4. The Netflix series in question is "Apple Cider Vinegar" as stated in the first paragraph. That's straightforward.

5. The additional docudrama is "Scamanda" airing on Thursdays at 9pm on ABC. The question asks for the series name, so "Scamanda" is the answer.

6. The familial deficiency mentioned as a motivator is "absent dad" from the list given. The article says "bad mom, absent dad, rapacious need for attention".

7. The time for "Scamanda" is 9 p.m. on Thursdays. The question specifically asks for the hour, so 9 p.m.

8. The actress for Belle is Kaitlyn Dever. The article says she stars as Belle and her performance is noted.

9. The streaming platform for the main series is Netflix, since it's a Netflix series as per the title.

10. The author is Margaret Lyons, mentioned as the TV critic and newsletter contributor. That's clear in the byline.

I need to check each answer against the text to ensure accuracy. Let me go through again quickly:

1. Belle Gibson - correct. The veneers part is there.  
2. Milla - yes, lesions mentioned.  
3. Coffee Enema - yes, mentioned as pseudoscientific.  
4. "Apple Cider Vinegar" - the title of the Netflix series.  
5. "Scamanda" - correct, the docudrama.  
6. Absent dad - part of the list given.  
7. 9 p.m. - exact time from the schedule.  
8. Kaitlyn Dever - yes, she's the star.  
9. Netflix - the series is on Netflix.  
10. Margaret Lyons - the byline states that.  

All answers are directly from the article. No need for N/A here since all questions are addressed with the provided info.
