Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. 

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks which prestigious ballet company Carolyn Brown performed with before Merce Cunningham. The article mentions her training with Antony Tudor and Margaret Craske, who were associated with the Cecchetti method. However, it doesn't specify a particular ballet company she was part of before Cunningham. It does say she attended Juilliard and trained under those teachers, but Juilliard isn't a performing company. So maybe the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: How many years at Braggiotti-Denishawn School? The article states her mother trained there, but Carolyn herself was part of her mother's group, the Marion Rice Denishawn Dancers. The text doesn't mention her teaching there, so the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The documentary where she discussed regrets about children. The article says in her memoir "Chance and Circumstance" she relates telling a documentary filmmaker about regrets. The question asks for the documentary's title, but the article doesn't provide it. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Which tour dissolved her marriage. The text mentions they divorced in 1988 but doesn't link it to a specific tour. The 1968 journal entry mentions being in Mexico City, but that's a longing statement, not the divorce cause. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: John Cage's role in her technique. The article says Cage's ideas influenced her, but her technique combined Denishawn and Cecchetti from her training with Tudor and Craske. Cage isn't mentioned as directly involved in her technique. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Which work was performed at Black Mountain College first summer. The first performances in 1953 at Black Mountain are mentioned, but no specific choreographic work by Brown is named there. The article says she starred in Rauschenberg's first piece, but that's not her own work. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Dance journal where she published essays. The text mentions her memoir and some reviews of it, but not a specific journal she wrote for. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Number of students when she became dean. The article states she was dean from 1980-1982 but no student count. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Duration of "Dune Dance". The article describes the film but doesn't mention its length. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Cunningham's favorite role with her. The article mentions a duet they performed, but the specific role isn't named. It says one duet was revisited with a new partner, implying that piece was significant, but the name isn't given here. So N/A.
