Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one based strictly on the article provided. I need to make sure I don't use any outside knowledge and only rely on the text. Let me start with the first question.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks which grape variety Julien Brocard identified as most resistant to aggressive weather in Kimmeridgian soils. The article mentions that Chardonnay is the main grape in Chablis, and Brocard's comments focus on maintaining the terroir's characteristics. However, there's no specific mention of a resistant grape variety. The text states that Chablis's character comes from terroir, not a different grape. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The article says Chateau de Beru lost their entire crop to frost in 2016. The question asks how many hectoliters they lost compared to normal. The text doesn't provide production numbers, so N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The electric cables were used to warm young shoots, but the temperature threshold isn't specified. The article mentions the purpose but no exact temperature, so N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Athenais de Beru changed pruning to combat earlier vine awakening. The article doesn't name the traditional technique she abandoned, just that she adjusted pruning timing. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Domaine Picq's observed minerality increase between organic and conventional plots isn't quantified in the text. The article states they make "textbook" wines but no percentage. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Chateau de Beru noted different yeasts in August vs. October, but the number of strains isn't mentioned. The article doesn't give a figure, so N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Soil pH difference between biodynamic and conventional parcels in Vau de Vey isn't provided. The text says the biodynamic wines are better but no pH data. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The 12th-century walls around Clos Beru are mentioned as being from the estate's chateau. The article doesn't name the family who built them. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Julien Brocard's optimal vine height isn't stated numerically. The text says he lets vines grow higher but doesn't specify a measurement. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Didier Picq compares Chablis's climate to Macon 15 years ago but doesn't mention temperature difference in degrees. The comparison is qualitative, so N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The 2015 Montee de Tonnerre is from Domaine William Fevre, and they installed electric cables. Direct answer here is William Fevre.

12. **Question 12:** Julien Brocard advocates for planting 30,000 trees. The question asks who converted to organic/biodynamic and promotes trees. Yes, he's the one.

13. **Question 13:** Edouard Vocoret had to revert to chemicals in 2024 due to mildew and financial issues. He makes delicate wines. Direct answer: Edouard Vocoret.

14. **Question 14:** Didier Picq compared Chablis to Macon's past climate and mentioned uncertainty about aging. That's him.

15. **Question 15:** Athenais de Beru's estate has the 13th-century chateau and noted earlier awakening. She's the one.

16. **Question 16:** Didier Seguier of William Fevre said "Kimmeridgian is stronger than vintage." Correct.

17. **Question 17:** William Fevre (Domaine William Fevre) invested in cables in 2004 and had 90% loss in 2024. So their estate.

18. **Question 18:** Didier Picq made the comment about not dominating the vine and the climate comparison. The question's wording matches his statement.

19. **Question 19:** Julien Brocard said if vines aren't healthy, Chablis becomes just chardonnay. He emphasized the soil's role in identity.

20. **Question 20:** Julien Brocard's practices include cover crops, raised vines, reforestation, and mentions losing territory. So him again.

I need to ensure all answers are directly from the text and no assumptions. Let me double-check each one against the article to confirm.
