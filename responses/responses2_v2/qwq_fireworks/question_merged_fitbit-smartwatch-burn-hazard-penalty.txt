Okay, let me go through each question one by one and see what the article says.

1. The first question asks for the percentage of Ionic watches that had the battery defect leading to the 2014 Force wristband recall. Wait, the Force recall was in 2014, but the Ionic issue is separate. The article says the Ionic's injury reports were fewer than 0.01% of all sold. But the question is mixing Ionic with the Force recall. Since the defect in Ionic is different from the Force's skin irritation, the percentage here isn't linked. So the answer should be N/A because the question conflates two different issues.

2. The second question is about how much Google offered Ionic owners after the acquisition. The article mentions that during the 2022 recall, owners got $299 for returning and a discount code. But Google bought Fitbit in 2021. The compensation was part of Fitbit's recall, not Google's offer post-acquisition. However, the question says "after the acquisition," so maybe the $299 is the answer here. The article states that as part of the recall, which happened after the acquisition, so yes, $299.

3. The third question asks for the name of the unproven blood filter mentioned. The article mentions a start-up's unproven blood filter in Antigua, but there's no name given. So N/A.

4. The Ionic users reported burns. The Force had skin irritation. The question asks for another injury similar to Force's issue. The article says Flex wristbands had similar complaints (to Force) which were addressed with warnings. But Ionic's issue was burns, not skin irritation. Wait, the question says "besides burns, what other injury similar to Force users?" Since Force had skin irritation, maybe the Ionic didn't report that, so N/A. Wait, the Ionic's problem was burns, so maybe the answer is N/A because the other injury (skin irritation) isn't mentioned for Ionic before 2020 firmware. The article says Flex had similar complaints to Force (skin issues), but Ionic's problem was different. So the answer is N/A.

5. Bill Gates stepping back from Microsoft and an initiative like Fitbit's compliance updates. The article mentions Fitbit's compliance policies in the settlement. For Bill Gates, the text says he's taking a break from the future to examine his past, but there's no mention of a specific initiative similar to compliance policies. So N/A.

6. The CPSC's concern about Flex wristbands. The article says Fitbit avoided a Flex recall by adding warnings about nickel allergies and sizing. So the primary concern was the skin irritation from nickel allergies and tightness. So the answer is nickel allergies and sizing issues.

7. Total financial impact from Ionic and Force. The Ionic had a $12.25M penalty. The 2014 Force recall didn't mention a financial penalty, just that over a million were recalled. So total would be only the $12.25M, but the question includes both. Since Force's cost isn't mentioned, answer is N/A.

8. Year Fitbit received most third-degree burns reports coinciding with Zuckerberg and Trump. The Ionic third-degree burns were two cases, and the recall was in 2022. The article mentions Zuckerberg's embrace of Trump in the Silicon Valley workers section, but the year isn't specified. So can't link the year, so N/A.

9. The Ionic feature updated in 2020, related to DeepSeek's AI research. The article says the 2020 firmware update addressed battery overheating. DeepSeek's focus is on research, but no link given. So the feature is the firmware for battery. The answer is firmware update, but the question asks for a feature also a focus of DeepSeek. Since there's no connection, N/A.

10. Action similar to Fitbit's response to Force (recalling) vs Flex (warnings). The question is about companies responding to Trump's D.E.I. stance. The article says some companies scaled back D.E.I. efforts. Fitbit's response to Flex was adding warnings. So the similar action is scaling back programs, so answer is scaling back diversity programs.

11. Fitbit's reason for delaying the 2020 firmware. The article says they didn't report the defect quickly as required, but the reason for delaying the firmware isn't stated. So N/A.

12. Third-degree burns in the U.S. alone. The article says globally there were two third-degree burns, but doesn't specify U.S. numbers. So N/A.

13. Action for Flex instead of recall: the article says Fitbit added warnings about nickel and sizing, so that's the answer.

14. Nickel allergies in design before Ionic. The Flex's response was due to nickel, but Ionic's design changes aren't mentioned regarding nickel. The question is about prior to Ionic's release, so maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says for Flex, they added warnings about nickel, so perhaps the role was that they addressed nickel in Flex, but for Ionic's design, the article doesn't say. The question is about design modifications prior to Ionic's release, which would be the Flex's case. But the question is about the design changes before Ionic (which was released in 2017?), so the answer is that they added warnings instead of a recall for Flex, but the role of nickel in design for Ionic isn't mentioned. The question is about the role nickel played in design modifications prior to Ionic, so maybe N/A. Wait, the article says Fitbit added warnings about nickel allergies in the Flex case. So for the Flex, the issue was nickel, so the role was that they included warnings instead of a recall. But the question is about the design modifications prior to Ionic's release. Since the Ionic's issue was battery, not nickel, the role of nickel in design for Ionic isn't mentioned. So the answer is N/A? Wait, the question is about the design modifications prior to Ionic's release. The Flex was before Ionic. The action taken for Flex was adding warnings, so the role of nickel was addressed via warnings, not design changes. The question is about design modifications, so maybe they didn't change design but added warnings. So the answer is N/A because the design wasn't modified, only warnings added.

Wait, the question says "what role did nickel allergies play in the design modifications of Fitbit's wearable devices prior to the Ionic model's release?" So prior to Ionic (which was released in 2017?), the Flex and Force were earlier. The Force had skin irritation (maybe due to materials?), and Flex had nickel allergy issues. So for Flex, instead of recall, they added warnings about nickel allergies. So the design modifications for Flex would be adding warnings, but not changing the design. So the role of nickel was that they had to address it with warnings instead of recall. But the question is about design modifications, so maybe they didn't modify design but added warnings. Hence, the answer is N/A because the design wasn't modified, just warnings added. Or maybe the role was that nickel was a factor in their design considerations leading to warnings. Hmm, tricky. The question is about the role nickel played in design modifications. Since they didn't modify the design but added warnings, the answer is N/A. But the article says "adding a warning about nickel allergies and a sizing guideline to prevent users from wearing the wristbands too tightly." So the design modifications weren't done, but they added warnings. So the role of nickel was addressed through warnings, not design changes. So the answer is N/A.

15. Google's acquisition terms affecting the Ionic recall's timeline. The article says Google bought Fitbit in 2021 and agreed not to use health data for ads. The recall was in 2022. The question is whether the acquisition terms influenced the recall's timeline or scope. The article doesn't mention this connection, so N/A.
