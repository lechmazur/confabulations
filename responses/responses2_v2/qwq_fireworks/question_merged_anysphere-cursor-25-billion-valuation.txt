merged_anysphere-cursor-25-billion-valuation.txt
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I'm only using the information provided in the article. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks about Benchmark's initial investment multiple based on Anysphere's annual recurring revenue. The article mentions that Anysphere's current valuation is $2.5 billion, which is 25 times their $100 million annual recurring revenue. However, the question is about Benchmark's initial investment. The article says Benchmark participated in the latest round led by Thrive and Andreessen Horowitz, but there's no info on prior rounds or their initial multiple. So I think this is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Supermaven's primary advantage before acquisition. The article states Anysphere bought Supermaven in November. The competitive landscape includes Microsoft's Copilot, Codeium, etc. The article mentions Cursor's new feature predicting code lines and agentic features. But there's no specific info on Supermaven's advantage. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** If DeepSeek's chatbot (which has Chinese propaganda) were integrated into Cursor, the code comments might include propaganda. The article says DeepSeek's answers include propaganda, so code comments could have that. Answer: Propaganda-related comments.

4. **Question 4:** Andreessen's investment in Klarna-like A.I. The article says Klarna is mentioned in a section about A.I. skepticism. The overall A.I. VC deals were 35% of $366B in 2023. If Klarna's approach is similar, but the article doesn't link Klarna to A.I. investments. The question asks for a proportion, but Klarna's specifics aren't given. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Valuation increase from seed to Thrive-led round. The current valuation is $2.5B, up sixfold from May's last round. Seed round isn't mentioned. The question refers to seed, but the article only talks about the latest round being six times higher than May's. Since seed isn't discussed, N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Meta role impacted by code automation. Zuckerberg mentioned automating some code-writing. The role would be programmers or developers. The article says "specific role within Meta as described by Joe Rogan"â€”but the article only mentions Zuckerberg's statement on the podcast. The exact role isn't specified, so N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Feature appealing to Instagram developers. The new version's feature predicts next code lines, even 10 minutes' worth. Agentic features can complete tasks. Instagram (owned by Meta) developers might like the predictive coding speed. Answer: The feature that predicts the next line of code, filling in 10 minutes' worth.

8. **Question 8:** Weakness of Codeium highlighted by Deep Research. The article says Anysphere's Cursor uses proprietary models and others from OpenAI/Anthropic. Codeium is a competitor. The weakness could be lack of proprietary models or agentic features. Since Anysphere bought Supermaven and has agentic features, maybe Codeium lacks those. Answer: Lack of agentic task-completion features.

9. **Question 9:** Computing resource scrutinized if adopting DeepSeek's model. Anysphere controls costs, especially computing. DeepSeek's model might require more resources. The answer would be computing resources, specifically. The CEO mentioned controlling spending on computing resources. So answer: Computing resources.

10. **Question 10:** Anthropic's projected valuation. The company that turned down higher offers is Anysphere. If following their trajectory (sixfold in a round), but no data on Anthropic's numbers. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Proprietary model architecture. The article says Cursor uses proprietary models plus OpenAI/Anthropic. The question asks what they exclusively rely on. Since they use others, the answer is N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Months between acquisition and agentic features. Acquired in November. Agentic features were "quietly rolled out" but no date. The article mentions the new version was unveiled Monday (assuming the article's date is when it's published, but no exact months. So N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Start-up with $62B valuation using Cursor. The article says Databricks is valued at $62B. But it's not stated they use Cursor. Thrive's developers use Cursor, but Databricks isn't mentioned as a user. N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Benchmark's ARR multiple. Anysphere's multiple is 25x $100M. Benchmark was in the latest round. The question asks the multiple Benchmark used, which would be the same as the current valuation's multiple. So 25x. Answer: 25.

15. **Question 15:** Percentage of Klarna workforce to be replaced. The article mentions Klarna in a section about job fears but no specific percentage. N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Religious org partnering with Anysphere. The final section mentions religious leaders using A.I., but no specific org linked to Anysphere. N/A.

17. **Question 17:** VC invested in code-automation in 2023. The total A.I. VC was $366B, 35% is ~$128.1B. But the question specifies code-automation tools like Cursor. The article doesn't break that down further. N/A.

18. **Question 18:** Chinese company integrated into Cursor. The article says DeepSeek's chatbot has propaganda, but no mention of Anysphere using it. So N/A.
