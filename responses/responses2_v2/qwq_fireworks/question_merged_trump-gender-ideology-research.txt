Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer strictly based on that. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks which medical condition prompted the CDC to reinstate vaccine info statements. The article mentions that vaccine information statements were removed but some were reinstated due to backlash. However, the specific medical condition linked to reinstatement isn't stated. The reinstatement was due to backlash and concern for public health, not a specific condition. So maybe N/A?

Wait, the question is about the medical condition that prompted the reinstatement. The article says the purge included vaccine info statements which are required before immunization. The reinstatement was in part due to backlash, but the medical condition itself (like vaccines being necessary for certain conditions) isn't the reason for reinstatement. So probably N/A.

2. **Question 2**: How many academic researchers had their papers removed from Patient Safety Network? The article mentions Dr. Schiff's paper was taken down, along with others. But it doesn't specify the number of researchers. The text says "roughly 20 research papers" were taken down, but that's the number of papers, not researchers. So unless each paper had one author, but the question is about researchers. Since only Dr. Schiff is named, but others might be involved, but the article doesn't say how many. So answer N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Percentage increase in mortality rates predicted by Linda Blount? The article says she warned that without data collection, mortality rates would increase, but no specific percentage is given. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Which state's health department reported losing HIV database access? The article mentions Dr. Tim Menza in Washington State worrying about syphilis but the HIV database issue was mentioned generally. The specific state isn't named for the database loss. Wait, the HIV database was for doctors to determine testing, but the article doesn't say which state's department reported it. So N/A.

Wait, the article says "a database containing 20 years of H.I.V. data that doctors rely on... The return was not entirely smooth. Charts and tables... could be reached through a Google search, but the C.D.C.'s own portal remained broken." But no specific state is mentioned as having reported the loss. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Total budget impact of removing transgender resources? The article mentions the senior official's quote but doesn't discuss budget figures. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Which medical society filed the complaint leading to reinstatement? The article doesn't mention any specific medical society filing a complaint. It says reinstatement was due to backlash and concern from the scientific community and media. No named society, so N/A.

7. **Question 7**: How many pulse oximeter-related deaths in communities of color? The article states that the devices didn't work on dark skin, possibly contributing to higher death rates, but no specific number is given. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Deadline set by HHS for other agencies to comply? The article mentions an email with a deadline of 5 p.m. Friday for scrubbing the Patient Safety Network. But the question is about a deadline set by HHS for other agencies. The email to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality had that deadline, but is that HHS's deadline for all agencies? The article says "the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality... was given until 5 p.m. on Friday." So maybe the answer is 5 p.m. on Friday. But the question is about HHS's deadline for other agencies. Since that's the only deadline mentioned, perhaps that's it. The answer would be "5 p.m. on Friday" but need to check exact wording.

The article says: "A memo to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality... gave employees until 5 p.m. on Friday to scrub..." So the deadline was 5 p.m. on Friday. The question asks "what deadline did HHS set for other agencies". Since the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality is part of HHS, perhaps the answer is 5 p.m. on Friday. So the answer is "5 p.m. on Friday".

9. **Question 9**: Which international organization condemned the HIV database removal? The article doesn't mention any international organization condemning it. The only mention is of experts like Dr. Gostin talking about legal issues. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Replacement term for "pregnant person"? The article says terms like "pregnant person" were removed. The example given is that a search for "abortion" suggested "adoption", but the replacement term for "pregnant person" isn't stated. So N/A.

Wait, the executive order used "gender ideology" but the replacement term isn't given. The article says "transgender," "L.G.B.T." and "pregnant person" were purged. The article doesn't mention the replacement term for "pregnant person", so N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The phrase in the executive order used to justify removing pages like transgender health, etc. The article says the purge was to comply with an executive order barring material promoting "gender ideology". So the phrase is "gender ideology".

12. **Question 12**: Which directive is basis for censoring content? The article mentions executive orders on diversity, equity, inclusion, accessibility, and "defending women". The removals were under these orders, so the answer would be the executive orders on diversity, equity, inclusion, accessibility and "defending women".

13. **Question 13**: Which CDC expert expressed fear and anger? The article quotes Dr. Ina Park from UCSF as saying "I am very fearful and I am very angry...".

14. **Question 14**: Which ACA provision's webpage was taken offline and restored? The article mentions Section 1557 of the ACA was taken offline and then restored.

15. **Question 15**: Lead author on suicide risk paper with Harvard affiliation? The article mentions Dr. Gordon Schiff, director at Harvard Medical School, whose paper was taken down.

16. **Question 16**: Number of web pages removed? The article states "more than 8,000 web pages across more than a dozen U.S. government websites".

17. **Question 17**: Resource inaccessible for contraceptive counseling? The article mentions that guidelines for contraception were removed, so the answer is "contraception guidelines".

18. **Question 18**: Which search engine allowed access to HIV charts? The article says "Charts and tables... could be reached through a Google search".

19. **Question 19**: Which group had maternal mortality rates 2-3x higher? The article states "Black and Native American women are two to three times as likely as white women to die during pregnancy and after childbirth".

20. **Question 20**: Global health law expert who called it viewpoint censorship? The article mentions Larry Gostin, director of the WHO Center on Global Health Law, saying it's "classic viewpoint censorship".
