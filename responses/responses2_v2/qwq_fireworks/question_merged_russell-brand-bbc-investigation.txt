Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to go through the article carefully to find the answers. 

1. The first question asks how many women directly accused Brand of sexual assault during his time at the BBC, prompting the investigation. The article says the BBC started the investigation after four women accused him of sexual assault. But wait, the article mentions the four women's allegations led to the investigation, but the report looked into eight complaints, two during his BBC tenure. The question specifically says "during his time at the BBC." The four women's accusations might be outside the BBC. The answer here is probably N/A because the four women's accusations were "in other settings" as per the text. The two complaints during his time at BBC were not necessarily sexual assault accusations. The question is tricky. Let me check again: "four women accused Brand of sexual assault in other settings" so the direct accusations during BBC time aren't the four. The answer would be N/A for the first question?

Wait, the question says "directly accused Brand of sexual assault during his time at the BBC". The four women's accusations were in other settings, so the ones during his BBC time are the two complaints but the article doesn't specify if those were sexual assault. The report's eight complaints include two from his tenure. The specific sexual misconduct examples given in the article (like the bathroom incident, the sex with a contest winner) might be part of the eight, but the four women's accusations were separate. Hmm, the question is about the four women's accusations prompting the internal investigation. The article says the BBC's internal investigation started after the four women accused him of sexual assault. But the internal investigation looked into eight complaints, two of which were during his BBC time. The question is how many women directly accused him during his BBC time. The four women's accusations were in other settings, so the answer is N/A for question 1. Wait, but maybe the four women's accusations were the trigger, but the question is about the direct accusations during his BBC time. The answer would be N/A.

2. The second question asks what specific sanction beyond an apology the BBC imposed on the station management. The article says the BBC apologized to employees and mentioned a "high-profile editorial breach" and that some content wouldn't be broadcast today. But it doesn't mention any sanctions like firing or penalties. Lisa Nandy talks about the culture but the BBC's actions? The answer is N/A.

3. Third question: What container other than a bottle did Brand use for urination? The article says "urinated into a bottle" but the question asks another container. Wait, the staff member reported an incident where he urinated into a bottle. The question is about another container. Maybe there's another incident? The article only mentions the bottle. So answer is N/A.

4. The fourth question asks the title of the radio show the contest winner was visiting. The article mentions "visiting the BBC after winning a radio contest" but doesn't name the show. So N/A.

5. Fifth question: Year Metropolitan Police started their investigation. The BBC's internal investigation began in 2023. The police investigation is current, but the article doesn't specify the year. It says "is currently being investigated", so the year would be 2023? The BBC report was released in 2023. The police investigation probably started around the same time, but the article doesn't explicitly state the year. So N/A.

6. Sixth question: Name of the manager who received the report about Brand's urination and throwing. The article mentions the incident was reported to the employee's manager but doesn't name the manager. Answer N/A.

7. Seventh question: Primary reason the BBC didn't have better systems before 2006. The report says there should have been better systems but doesn't give a reason why they didn't exist. The reason given is the inadequate management and fear of retaliation, but the question is about why they weren't implemented before. The article doesn't state the primary reason for the lack of systems before 2006, so N/A.

8. Eighth question: Specific aspect of Brand's content that was an editorial breach. The BBC says some content "would not be broadcast today." The examples given in the report include Brand's inappropriate behavior, like the bathroom incident, but the content on his shows. The article doesn't specify exactly which content, like specific segments or types. So N/A.
