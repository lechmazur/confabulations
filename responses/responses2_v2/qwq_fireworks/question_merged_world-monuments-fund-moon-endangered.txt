Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. 

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions that Jeff Koons' sculptures were carried by a SpaceX rocket, but there's no info on damage percentage. So answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The golden olive branch's metal type isn't specified. The article only says it's golden. N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The article states the World Monuments Fund has had nominations for 30 years, and the moon was nominated this year (2025). The old city of Taiz's inclusion year isn't given, so can't calculate years. N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Michelle Hanlon helped establish For All Moonkind, not a UN agreement. The article says the UN agreement exists but lacks signatories. The question's premise is wrong, so N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The list includes the moon and others like Gaza, Kyiv, etc., but no other celestial body is named. The moon is the only one. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) division nominated the moon. The article doesn't mention who nominated Machu Picchu. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The article doesn't specify a particular instrument at risk. It mentions Tranquility Base and artifacts like the olive branch. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The Artemis Accords have 52 signatories (US +51). The question asks how many additional countries expressed interest beyond the original, but the article only states the current signatories. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The artist is Jeff Koons, as stated in the article. Jonathan Bell's quote is about the moon's symbolism, not the artist's name. Wait, the question says Jonathan Bell considers the sculptures a symbol. The article says Bell sees the moon's inclusion as an opportunity, but the artist is Koons. So answer is Jeff Koons.

10. **Question 10**: The historical building in Kyiv is endangered by the listed factors (climate, tourism, etc.), but the question asks for another threat from de Montlaur. The article doesn't mention another specific threat. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Defunct satellites could hit Tranquility Base where the olive branch is. So answer is Tranquillity Base.

12. **Question 12**: The president who called the moon a symbol is Benedicte de Montlaur of the World Monuments Fund. The group that nominated was ICOMOS. The question's wording is tricky, but the correct organization is the World Monuments Fund? Wait, the question says the president who described the moon as a symbol is actually responsible. Wait, the article says de Montlaur is the president of the World Monuments Fund, and the moon was nominated by ICOMOS's division. So the group responsible is the World Monuments Fund? Or the division? The question might be confused. The correct answer is the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) division.

Wait, the question says "which group's president—who described the moon as 'a symbol of hope and the future'—is actually responsible for advocating its protection?" The president who said that is de Montlaur of the World Monuments Fund. But the group that nominated was ICOMOS. The question is mixing up who said the quote and who nominated. The correct answer is the World Monuments Fund, but the quote is from their president. The group that advocated is the ICOMOS division. Hmm. The question might be a trick here. The answer should be the World Monuments Fund because de Montlaur is their president, but the actual nominator was ICOMOS. The question says "which group's president"—so the president's group is the World Monuments Fund. But the group responsible for advocating (nominating) is ICOMOS. The question is confusing. The correct answer based on the quote is the World Monuments Fund. Wait, the article says "Benedicte de Montlaur, the organization's president and chief executive" (of the World Monuments Fund) made the quote. The group responsible for advocating would be the World Monuments Fund through their watch list. But the actual nomination was done by the ICOMOS division. The question is asking for the group whose president made the quote and is responsible for the protection. Since the president is from the World Monuments Fund, but the nomination was done by ICOMOS. Maybe the answer is the World Monuments Fund? Or the question is a trick. The correct answer is the International Council on Monuments and Sites (as their division nominated the moon), but the president who said the quote is from the World Monuments Fund. The question is phrased to get the group whose president made the statement, so the answer is the World Monuments Fund. But the article says that the ICOMOS division nominated it. The question says "advocating its protection"—the World Monuments Fund's list is the tool. So maybe the answer is the World Monuments Fund. Alternatively, the question might be wrong, so N/A? Hmm. The article says the division of ICOMOS nominated it. The group whose president (de Montlaur) is from the World Monuments Fund. The question is asking for the group responsible for advocating (i.e., the one that nominated), which is ICOMOS. But the president who made the quote is from the World Monuments Fund. The question says "which group's president... is actually responsible for advocating its protection?" So the president's group (World Monuments Fund) is the one that put the moon on their watch list. So the answer is World Monuments Fund. Wait, but the division of ICOMOS nominated it. The article states: "A division of the International Council on Monuments and Sites devoted to aerospace heritage nominated the moon for the nonprofit watch list." So the nominator is ICOMOS division. The World Monuments Fund is the one that includes it on their list based on the nomination. The group advocating via the watch list is the World Monuments Fund, but the nominator was ICOMOS. The question is a bit ambiguous. The answer should be the International Council on Monuments and Sites (since their division did the nomination). But the question is phrased as "group's president who described..." so the president is from the World Monuments Fund. The answer might be N/A because the president's group (WMF) isn't the one that nominated, but the question is asking for the group responsible for advocating through the president's statement. This is confusing. Maybe the answer is N/A, but I'll check again. The question says "which group's president—who described the moon as 'a symbol of hope and the future'—is actually responsible for advocating its protection?" The president is de Montlaur of the World Monuments Fund. The advocacy via the watch list is done by the World Monuments Fund. So the answer is World Monuments Fund.

13. **Question 13**: The nonbinding agreement is the Artemis Accords, which mention preservation. The binding one is the UN agreement. So answer is Artemis Accords.

14. **Question 14**: The first human step site is Tranquillity Base. So answer is Tranquillity Base.

15. **Question 15**: The article corrected the earlier mistake: the nominator was the International Council on Monuments and Sites (not the Committee). So the answer is International Council on Monuments and Sites.

16. **Question 16**: The article says over 90 sites are at risk. Answer is 90.

17. **Question 17**: The binding UN agreement has few signatories. The name isn't given, but the article refers to it as "a separate binding United Nations agreement". Since it's not named, N/A? Wait, but the question asks for the entity, which is the UN. The agreement itself isn't named, so the answer is United Nations.

Wait, the article says "a separate binding United Nations agreement provided for the protection of lunar sites", so the entity is the United Nations. The name of the agreement isn't given, so the answer is United Nations.

18. **Question 18**: The extraterrestrial locale is the moon. Answer is the moon.

19. **Question 19**: Jonathan Bell is the vice president mentioned. Answer is Jonathan Bell.

20. **Question 20**: The artifact delivered by SpaceX last year is the 125 miniature sculptures by Jeff Koons. Answer is the 125 miniature sculptures by Jeff Koons.
