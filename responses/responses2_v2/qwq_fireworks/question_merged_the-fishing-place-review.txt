Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and avoid any external knowledge. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks how many times the camera circles the boat during the fishing scene. The article mentions, "the camera circles the boat," but it doesn't specify the number of times. Since the exact count isn't provided, the answer is N/A.

2. Question 2 is about the month when Anna's past with Hansen unravels. The article says the opening is set in winter, but doesn't mention a specific month. So, N/A again.

3. The third question asks for another location from "The Heroes of Telemark" referenced besides the church. The article states Tregenza "nodded at the Mann movie, including in a scene set inside the priest's church." No other location is mentioned, so N/A.

4. For question 4, the watercraft used by Hansen to bring Anna. The article describes a ghostly fishing boat, but Hansen's transportation isn't specified. The answer is N/A.

5. Question 5 inquires about the camera brand Tregenza used. The article mentions Tom Green's projects but doesn't link that to Tregenza's equipment. So N/A.

6. The sixth question asks the military rank of the prosperous resident who salutes the Nazi. The text says he salutes his guest, a Nazi officer, but doesn't give his rank. N/A.

7. Question 7 is about the cinematic technique used in the fishing scene similar to those in "Anora," etc. The article mentions power dynamics in those films through sex scenes, but the technique isn't named here. So N/A.

8. The eighth question asks the Norwegian county with the traitor's birthplace. The article clearly states Telemark is the birthplace of Quisling. Answer: Telemark.

9. The ninth question's technique in the fishing scene. The article says color manipulation (bilious green, orange-red) and camera movement (circles the boat). So combining those: color manipulation and camera circling.

10. The 1965 film referenced is "The Heroes of Telemark" with Kirk Douglas. That's directly stated, so answer that title.

11. Anna's object upon arrival is a single suitcase, mentioned in the text. So answer: a suitcase.

12. The critical flaw in the Brechtian interlude is that it was "less visually and intellectually satisfying." So answer that phrase.

13. The historical figure is Vidkun Quisling, mentioned as the traitor from Telemark. Answer his name.

Wait, let me check each again to ensure accuracy. For question 9, the answer should combine both elements: color and camera movement. The question asks for the technique, so maybe the answer is "color manipulation and camera circling" or the terms used in the article. The article says "drained of ordinary color... bilious green... hellish orange-red" and "camera circles the boat". So the answer is both aspects together. The question specifies "cinematic technique", so maybe the answer is the combination. The exact wording in the text is that the scene uses color changes and camera movement. So the answer should be both elements as per the question's requirement.

Double-checking all others. For question 3, since only the church is mentioned, the answer is N/A. Okay. That's all.
