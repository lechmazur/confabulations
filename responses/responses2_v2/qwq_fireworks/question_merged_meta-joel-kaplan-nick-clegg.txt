Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly based on that. Let's start with the first question.

1. The first question asks which former Supreme Court justice Joel Kaplan worked with before joining the Bush administration. The article says Kaplan clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia before his time in the Bush administration. So the answer should be Scalia.

2. The second question is about how many millions Meta donated to Trump's campaign before Zuckerberg's Mar-a-Lago meeting. The article mentions Meta donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund, which was after the meeting. Wait, actually the timing: the article says "just weeks after Zuckerberg met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago," so the donation was after the meeting. The question is asking for before the meeting. Since there's no mention of a donation before the meeting, the answer would be N/A. Wait, but the question is phrased as "donate to Trump's campaign" but the article says it's the inaugural fund. So maybe the question has an incorrect premise. Since it's about a campaign donation versus inaugural fund, that's different. So the answer is N/A.

3. Nick Clegg's primary achievement in reforming AI transparency policies. The article states that Clegg "pushing its agenda on open-source artificial intelligence" and mentions he worked on "increased transparency and accountability". The exact achievement might be his work on AI transparency, but the question is about his primary achievement. The article says "repairing relationships in Washington" and "campaigning in the EU". The direct mention of AI transparency is part of his work, so maybe "pushing open-source AI" is the answer. But the exact wording: "primary achievement in reforming Meta's AI transparency policies" â€” the article says he "pushed its agenda on open-source artificial intelligence, campaigning for the company in the European Union and repairing relationships in Washington." The answer might be "pushing open-source artificial intelligence" but the question is about reforming AI transparency. The article says "increased transparency and accountability" in his quote. So maybe the answer is "increased transparency and accountability in AI" but the exact wording isn't there. Wait, the article says he "proud of the work... to ensure innovation can go hand in hand with increased transparency and accountability". So the answer is "increased transparency and accountability".

4. When did Kevin Martin first join Meta's policy team? The article says Kevin Martin "has worked at Meta on policy issues for years" and "will take over Kaplan's previous role as vice president of public policy." But the exact start date isn't given. So the answer is N/A.

5. Ted Cruz praised which platform before mentioning X? The article says Cruz hoped Meta would join X (formerly Twitter) "in fighting to protect free speech for everyone." So he mentioned X, but the question is which platform he praised before mentioning X. The answer is X's predecessor, which is now called X. The article says "X, the social media app owned by Elon Musk," so the answer is X. But the question is asking which one he praised before mentioning X. Wait, the exact quote: "join X... in fighting to protect free speech". So he's praising X's actions, so the answer is X. But the question is "which social media platform did Ted Cruz specifically praise for protecting conservative voices before mentioning X?" So the answer is X. Wait, but the article says he wanted Meta to join X in doing that. So the platform he praised is X. So answer X.

6. What role did Sheryl Sandberg play in Nick Clegg's recruitment? The article states that Sheryl Sandberg, then COO, urged Kaplan to join Facebook in 2011. Wait, the question is about Nick Clegg's recruitment. Wait, the article says "Kaplan joined Facebook in 2011 at the urging of Sheryl Sandberg". But the question is about Nick Clegg. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The article says "Kaplan has many roots with conservatives... He joined Facebook in 2011 at the urging of Sheryl Sandberg". So Sheryl Sandberg urged Kaplan, not Clegg. The question is about Clegg's recruitment. The article doesn't mention Sandberg's role in Clegg's recruitment. So the answer is N/A.

7. How many employees signed the petition against Kaplan and Kavanaugh? The article mentions that Kaplan's support for Kavanaugh caused a rift, with employees voicing anger on internal message boards. But it doesn't specify the number. So N/A.

8. Transition period duration for Clegg handing over to Kaplan. The article says Clegg planned to stay for a few months. So the answer is "a few months".

9. EU regulation negotiated by Clegg. The article mentions Clegg campaigned for the company in the EU but doesn't specify a particular regulation. So N/A.

10. Joel Kaplan's role at Harvard Law Review before clerking. The article says he attended Harvard Law School and clerked for Scalia, but nothing about his role at the Law Review. So N/A.
