Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article. Let me read through the questions again and cross-reference each with the article content.

1. **Question 1:** Which European city did Clara B. Martin first begin sketching in after completing her online watercolor classes during lockdown?  
The article says Clara was in Madrid during lockdown and then after restrictions ended, the family started sketching in Amsterdam, Portugal, etc. Wait, the first city after lockdown would be when they started traveling. The text says "once restrictions were ended, the family started bringing sketchbooks along on their travels. 'It's a fantastic way to remember a place as you focus all your attention on your surroundings,' said Ms. Martin, who with her family has sketched in Amsterdam, Portugal and other spots." The first mentioned is Amsterdam. But does it specify the first one? The question is about the first European city. Since she was in Madrid during lockdown, maybe the first after lockdown would be one of the places listed. The article says they sketched in Amsterdam, Portugal, etc., but the question is about the first. The article doesn't explicitly state the first city post-lockdown. Wait, maybe the first after lockdown would be when they started, but the article says "once restrictions were ended, the family started bringing sketchbooks along on their travels. ... sketched in Amsterdam, Portugal and other spots." The first mentioned is Amsterdam. Since it's listed first, maybe that's the answer. But the question is about the first European city. Wait, Madrid is in Spain, which is European, but she was already there during lockdown. The question is about the first city they started sketching in after lockdown, so that would be Amsterdam. So answer: Amsterdam.

2. **Question 2:** How many hours per day does Alicia Aradilla recommend spending on urban sketching to fully capture a city's essence?  
The article mentions Alicia Aradilla, an illustrator from Spain, who says: "Many tourists arrive at the same place, take dozens of photos with their mobile phone and continue running to another point on the map."

4. **Question 4:** Which watercolor brand did Felix Scheinberger use to create the illustrations in his six books on urban sketching?

The text says for watercolor courses, participants can get a kit, but Clara's specific recommendations aren't detailed. The kits mentioned are White Nights ($37) or Winsor ($23), plus brushes and sketchbook. But Clara's family might have used these, but the total cost isn't calculated. The question asks for the total, but since it's not stated, N/A.
