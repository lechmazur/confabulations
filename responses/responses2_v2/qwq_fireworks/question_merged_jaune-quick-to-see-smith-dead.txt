Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked without adding any extra info or assumptions.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks about a Pulitzer Prize-winning author collaborating on a 2005 installation with Smith. The article mentions "Trade Canoe for Don Quixote" (2004) and "Trade Canoe: Don Quixote in Sumeria" (2005), which address Middle Eastern conflicts. Don Quixote is by Cervantes, but he's not mentioned in the text. The article doesn't name a collaborator here. So, N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The title of a 1987 performance with live horses critiquing Manifest Destiny. The article doesn't mention a 1987 performance or any with live horses. The closest is the 1992 "Gifts for Trading Land..." but that's not it. N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Years between first NY solo (Kornblee Gallery) and National Medal of Arts. The article says she had her first NYC solo in the 70s after the 1970s collective work. The National Medal isn't mentioned. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: French post-impressionist painter's film that inspired her 1978 lithographs. The article says she saw "Moulin Rouge" (about Toulouse-Lautrec) in 1953 and decided to become an artist. But the question is about 1978 lithographs. Toulouse-Lautrec is mentioned, but the film was about him. So answer: Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.

5. **Question 5**: Material from abandoned BIA schools in 1999 series. The article mentions "Ghosts of Assimilation" but doesn't specify materials. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: US president who collected her 1984 painting before Met. The article doesn't mention any president collecting her work. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Medicinal plant in early 90s works. The article doesn't mention specific plants. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Number of Venice Biennales between 1997 and her death. The article doesn't mention Venice Biennale participations. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Anishinaabe poet co-curated 2015 retrospective. The article talks about her curating but doesn't mention a co-curator in 2015. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Endangered animal in her final sculpture for Glacier NP. The article doesn't mention this. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Consistent hues she uses. The article says "consistent color palette of red and brown". So red and brown.

12. **Question 12**: Statement about community. The article quotes her: "I am not one. I am one among many. My community comes with me." So that's the answer.

13. **Question 13**: Icon used in outlines and for commentary. The article mentions "canoe" as a repeated motif. The Trade Canoe series uses canoes. So canoe.

14. **Question 14**: 2023 exhibition with 50 artists. The article mentions "The Land Carries Our Ancestors: Contemporary Art by Native Americans" at National Gallery in 2023 with nearly 50 artists. So that's the title.

15. **Question 15**: Sports team headgear in a 14-foot artwork. The 1992 work "Gifts for Trading Land With White People" has a Cleveland Indians baseball cap. So Cleveland Indians.

16. **Question 16**: Massachusetts institution for bachelor's. The article says she got a bachelor's from Framingham State University in 1976. Framingham State University.

17. **Question 17**: Painting alluding to Leonardo. The article mentions "Indian Drawing Lesson (After Leonardo)" with a buffalo's legs like Vitruvian Man. So that's the title.

18. **Question 18**: Medium she employed. The article states her medium was collage in the broadest sense, including mixed-media, assemblages, etc. So collage.
