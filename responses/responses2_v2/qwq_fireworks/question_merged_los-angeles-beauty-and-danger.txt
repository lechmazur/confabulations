Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I'll go through each question carefully and check the article for the exact answers.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks how many steps lead up to the Baldwin Hills scenic overlook, past the oil wells, before reaching the yucca blossoms. The article mentions "282 steps to the Baldwin Hills scenic overlook" and the oil wells are there. However, the yucca blossoms are mentioned in April on the Santa Monica mountains. The steps lead past the oil wells but the yucca isn't mentioned in that path. So maybe the answer is 282? Wait, the question says "before reaching the yucca blossoms" but the yucca is in April on the mountains. The steps path is where the oil wells are. The yucca isn't part of that path. Hmm, maybe N/A because the yucca isn't on the steps path. But the question combines steps and yucca. The article says "the yucca blossoms that will shoot up on the Santa Monica mountains in April" but not connected to the steps. So answer is N/A?

Wait, the question says "before reaching the yucca blossoms?" But the steps are to the overlook where you see the oil wells and mountains. The yucca is on the mountains. So maybe the steps are 282. The question might be a trick, but the steps are 282. The yucca isn't part of the path. The question is a bit confusing. Maybe the answer is 282, because the steps are the only number given. Let me check again. The first paragraph says "walk up the 282 steps to the Baldwin Hills scenic overlook. You pass the sagebrush and the primrose. The high rises of downtown come into view. Then, as you stand under a live oak and take a swig of water, you notice the oil wells..." So the oil wells are along the path. The yucca is mentioned later as blooming in April on the Santa Monica mountains. So the steps are 282, but the yucca isn't on the steps path. The question is about steps leading up to the overlook past oil wells before reaching yucca? Since yucca isn't there, maybe N/A? Or is the question just asking the number of steps? The first part of the question is about steps leading to the overlook, so the answer is 282. The yucca part might be a distractor. So answer is 282.

2. **Question 2:** The friend bought a house in Hollywood in 2022, and had to evacuate. The article says: "My friend bought a house on one of these hillsides, in Hollywood, in 2022. Last week, she evacuated." So answer is Hollywood.

3. **Question 3:** Zsa Zsa Gabor after the 1961 fires. The article mentions her surveying her home in a fur coat after the 1961 Bel Air fire. It doesn't mention an animal. The question asks what animal symbolizes resilience she encountered. The article says she was in a fur coat, but no animal. So N/A?

Wait, the question says "type of animal, symbolizing resilience" that Zsa Zsa encountered. The article doesn't mention any animal she encountered. She was wearing a fur coat, but that's not an animal she encountered. So answer N/A.

4. **Question 4:** "Ventura strong" signs after which event? The article says: "the Woolsey fire in 2018, which torched a swath of Ventura just a year after the Thomas fire spread nearby. In the fires' wake, the 'Ventura strong' yard signs went up..." So the Woolsey fire in 2018. But the question says "after which event" caused the signs. The answer is Woolsey fire.

5. **Question 5:** Fruit in December that's a delight. The article says "cherimoyas in December" as one of the delights. So cherimoyas.

6. **Question 6:** Infrastructure element mentioned in context of personal hardship, also location of strung-out kids. The article mentions "the strung-out kids on the Metro". So the Metro (public transport) is the infrastructure. The question asks the specific element, so Metro.

7. **Question 7:** Fire fanned by Santa Ana winds, prompting "Ventura strong" signs. The Woolsey fire was fanned by Santa Ana winds. The article says "the Santa Ana winds fanned the Woolsey fire in 2018". The Ventura strong signs came after that. So Woolsey fire.

8. **Question 8:** Flowering plant blooming in April, distracts from burn scars. The yucca blossoms in April are mentioned as shooting up, so yucca blossoms.

9. **Question 9:** Clothing Zsa Zsa wore while surveying ruins. She wore a fur coat. The oil wells have nodding donkeys (oil pumps). The question asks what clothing similar to the pumped substance. The pumped substance is oil/grease. The fur coat is clothing, but the question says similar to the material pumped (oil). Not directly related. So the answer is fur coat. The question says "similar to the material pumped by nodding donkeys" (which is oil). Fur coat isn't similar to oil, but the question might be a trick. The answer is fur coat.

10. **Question 10:** Location with taco stands. The article mentions "tube-light taco stands along Centinela". So Centinela.

11. **Question 11:** Overlook with 282 steps, revealing oil wells and mountains. The Baldwin Hills scenic overlook.

12. **Question 12:** Substance likened to nodding donkeys. The nodding donkeys are oil pumps, so the substance is oil or grease. The article says "oil wells, those nodding donkeys pumping grease out of the ground".

13. **Question 13:** Fleeting occurrence after marine layer lifts. The marine layer lifting reveals Santa Monica mountains and a monarch butterfly. The question says "fleeting natural occurrence" alongside monarch butterfly. The article says "a flash of the Pacific" and "distracted by a monarch butterfly". The flash of the Pacific is the fleeting occurrence.

14. **Question 14:** Celebrity who surveyed Bel Air ruins in 1961 fire. Zsa Zsa Gabor.

15. **Question 15:** Marine organism that endures bleaching. The article mentions corals in a study: "certain species of corals are able to withstand bleaching after they've experienced one or two bleaching events".

16. **Question 16:** Friend's neighborhood. Already answered in Q2 as Hollywood.

17. **Question 17:** Corrected year for Mumbai attack. The article says "An earlier version... stated incorrectly the year of terrorist attacks in Mumbai. It was 2008, not 2006". So 2008.

18. **Question 18:** Habit of mind for recovery. The article says "psychologists say humans who rebound after catastrophes share certain habits of mind. One of them is optimism." So optimism.

19. **Question 19:** Seasonal fruit in December. Cherimoyas.

20. **Question 20:** Public transport mentioned. "strung-out kids on the Metro" so Metro.

Wait, let me check each again quickly.

1. Steps: 282. Yucca isn't on the path, but the question says "before reaching the yucca blossoms?" but yucca is in April on the mountains. So maybe the question is a trick. The steps are 282, so answer 282.

3. Zsa Zsa had no animal encounter, so N/A.

9. The clothing is fur coat, so answer fur coat.

13. The fleeting occurrence is the flash of the Pacific.

Okay, that's all. Now, I'll format the answers with tags as required.
