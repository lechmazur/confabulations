Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. 

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks for the percentage of wrongful convictions of Black men that Kennedy attributes to the lack of standardized evidence before the kit. The article mentions that with DNA testing, fewer Black men were wrongfully convicted. But it doesn't specify a percentage. So I need to check if the text gives an exact number. The exact line is: "fewer Black men were wrongfully convicted of the rape of white women than in prior decades, per one report." No percentage is provided here, so the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The visionary behind the kit whose contributions were downplayed. The article states that Louis Vitullo's name was on the kit, but the real creator was Marty Goddard. So the answer is Martha "Marty" Goddard.

3. **Question 3**: The decade when funding was cut, leading to the backlog. The article says "during the 1990s, cities slashed funding..." So the answer is 1990s.

4. **Question 4**: Who added counseling cards and forms? The text says "She added cards that shared counseling resources, and forms for police officers to sign..." The "she" here refers to Goddard, so Marty Goddard.

5. **Question 5**: The author who interweaves her own history with the innovator's story. The book is by Pagan Kennedy, and the article mentions Kennedy's own molestation experience. So the answer is Pagan Kennedy.

6. **Question 6**: The small grooming implement in the kit. The article lists "a tiny comb for pubic hair" as part of the tools. So the answer is comb.

7. **Question 7**: The institution that acquired the kit in 2021. The first paragraph mentions the Smithsonian. So Smithsonian.

8. **Question 8**: The foundation that designed the packaging. The Playboy Foundation is mentioned as the one that designed the packaging. So Playboy Foundation.

9. **Question 9**: The male figure who objected but later embraced the kit. The article says Vitullo screamed at Goddard but then embraced the idea. So Louis Vitullo.

10. **Question 10**: The author's personal abuse. The text states Kennedy was molested as a child. So molestation.

11. **Question 11**: The personal quality driving Goddard's campaign. The article describes her as "determined" and mentions her proselytizing. The key trait here is determination. Wait, the question asks for the quality credited in the narrative. The text says "Marty Goddard had vanished... but the truth... feels beside the point. There is another narrative... Kennedy's own." Hmm, maybe the question is about what quality drove Goddard. Looking again: "Goddard, understanding that law enforcement would more readily accept... helped collaborate in her own erasure." But the question is about the quality that drove her nationwide campaign. The article says she was "determined, soft-spoken" and "proselytized for it across the country." So the quality is determination.
