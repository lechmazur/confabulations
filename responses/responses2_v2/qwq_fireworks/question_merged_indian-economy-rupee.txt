Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks which Indian airline company specifically cited low passenger demand to Sindhudurg as their reason for discontinuing service between Mumbai and Goa. The article mentions that airlines are pulling out because vacationers aren't buying enough tickets to Sindhudurg, but it doesn't name any specific airline. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The question is about how many millions of dollars India's central bank spent maintaining the rupee's fixed exchange rate during the summer quarter of 2023. The article states that the central bank was spending billions of dollars, but it doesn't specify an exact figure or the time frame of 2023's summer quarter. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Asks for the percentage increase in minimum wage proposed by V. Anantha Nageswaran. The article says Nageswaran mentioned stagnant wages and warned about not paying workers enough, but there's no specific percentage proposed. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The month in 2016 when the cash withdrawal policy was implemented. The article mentions the government withdrew cash in 2016 (Demonetization was in November 2016), but the exact month isn't stated here. Wait, the article says "in 2016" but not the month. Since the question specifies the month and the article doesn't provide it, the answer is N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Rathin Roy identified a sustainable growth rate before 2016's currency intervention. The article says that before 2016, the growth depended on unsustainable bank loans, implying that the sustainable rate was lower. The article mentions that after 2016, the economy never recovered its 8% pace. So maybe the sustainable rate was around 8%? The article says "the economy has never recovered even its 8 percent pace" post 2016. So before 2016, the sustainable rate was 8%? The question asks what Roy identified as sustainable, so the answer is 8%? Let me check again. The article states that after 2016, the economy couldn't reach the 8% pace again, which was the previous rate. So the sustainable rate before 2016's intervention was 8%? The question is asking for the rate before the 2016 intervention that was sustainable. Since the unsustainable lending led to higher growth before, but the sustainable was 8%? The article says "the economy has never recovered even its 8 percent pace since the government withdrew cash in 2016". So the sustainable rate before was 8%? So the answer would be 8%? Wait, but the question says "sustainable for Indian banks' business lending practices". The article says that the growth before 2000s depended on unsustainable bank loans. Wait, actually the article says "20 years ago, when India seemed poised to break into double-digit growth. But, Mr. Roy argued, that growth depended on banks pumping out loans to businesses at an unsustainable rate." So the unsustainable lending was in the period 20 years ago (so around 2000s). Then after that, the economy's growth rate was around 8% before 2016? The article says "the economy has never recovered even its 8 percent pace since 2016". So the sustainable rate before 2016's currency move was 8%? The question is asking for the growth rate that was sustainable before the 2016 intervention, which would be 8%? The answer is 8%.

6. **Question 6:** Number of new airports constructed between 2020-2023 under Modi's infrastructure. The article mentions the government bet on new airports but doesn't give a specific number. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Total value of foreign investment withdrawals during the six-month decline. The article says foreign investors are exiting but doesn't provide the total value. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Which credit rating agency downgraded India's outlook. The article doesn't mention any specific agency doing this. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Percentage of 130 million new investors from rural areas. The article states the number of investors grew from 22M to 150M, so 130M new, but doesn't specify rural percentage. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Kilometers of new highways completed. The article mentions infrastructure like bridges and highways but no specific numbers. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The article names airports and airlines as examples. Wait, the article says "India's government bet big on building new airports, for example. But the airlines that were set to serve them are pulling out." So the two projects are airports (explicitly named) and maybe highways? Wait, the question asks for two infrastructure projects explicitly named. The article mentions airports as one example, and highways and bridges as another. But the question is about projects that failed to attract private investment. The article says "the airlines that were set to serve them [airports] are pulling out" and also mentions highways as part of infrastructure. Wait, the exact quote: "It has focused spending on big-ticket infrastructure items, such as bridges and highways, that are supposed to entice private enterprise into making investments of their own. Indian businesses still have to contend with... The Modi government has tried to reduce those burdens, but in recent years it has focused on increasing economic supply. India's government bet big on building new airports, for example. But the airlines that were set to serve them are pulling out." So the two projects explicitly named as examples where private sector didn't participate enough are airports and maybe highways? Wait, the article says the airports example, and the other infrastructure is bridges and highways. But the question asks for two projects that failed to attract private investment. The article specifically mentions airports (airlines pulling out) and perhaps the highways/bridges? But the exact examples given are airports. The question says "explicitly name two infrastructure projects". The article explicitly mentions airports as one example. The other is "bridges and highways" as part of the infrastructure focus. Wait, the question is asking for two projects that the government invested in but private sector didn't participate enough. The article says "the airlines that were set to serve them [airports] are pulling out" and "businesses still have to contend with... The Modi government... focused on increasing economic supply. India's government bet big on building new airports...". The other big-ticket items are bridges and highways. So the two projects are airports and highways/bridges? But the question asks for two projects explicitly named. The article names airports as one, and the other is "bridges and highways" as part of the infrastructure. Since the question asks for two projects explicitly named, the answer is "airports" and "highways". Wait, but the article says "such as bridges and highways" which is an example of the infrastructure, and "new airports" as another example. So the two are "airports" and "bridges/highways". But the question wants two projects explicitly named. The article says "such as bridges and highways" and "building new airports". So the two projects are airports and bridges/highways. So the answer would be "airports and highways" but need to check exact wording. The article says "big-ticket infrastructure items, such as bridges and highways" and "bet big on building new airports". So the two projects are airports and (bridges and highways). But the question asks for two projects. So the answer is "airports" and "highways". But the article might not list two separate ones. Alternatively, maybe the two are airports and highways. The exact answer is "airports and highways" but need to check. The question says "explicitly name two infrastructure projects". The article mentions airports as one, and bridges and highways as another (together). Since the question asks for two projects, maybe they count bridges and highways as two separate? Probably not. The answer should be airports and highways (since highways are mentioned separately from bridges). Wait, the article says "bridges and highways" as one category. So the two projects are airports and (bridges and highways). But the question wants two specific projects. Since the article lists airports as a specific project and bridges/highways as another category, perhaps the answer is "airports and highways". Alternatively, maybe the answer is just airports and the other is highways, but the article groups them. Hmm. The question says "two infrastructure projects explicitly named". The article explicitly names airports and mentions bridges and highways as examples of infrastructure. Since the question asks for two projects, the answer is "airports" and "highways". But the article might not list two separate projects beyond that. Alternatively, maybe only airports are explicitly named, and the other is not. Hmm. The exact text says: "It has focused spending on big-ticket infrastructure items, such as bridges and highways, that are supposed to entice private enterprise into making investments of their own. Indian businesses still have to contend with... The Modi government has tried to reduce those burdens, but in recent years it has focused on increasing economic supply. India's government bet big on building new airports, for example. But the airlines that were set to serve them are pulling out." So the two examples given are airports and bridges/highways. Since the question asks for two projects explicitly named, the answer is "airports and highways" or "airports and bridges and highways"? The question says "two infrastructure projects", so maybe "airports" and "highways" are the two. But the article groups bridges and highways together. The exact wording is "such as bridges and highways" and "building new airports". Therefore, the two projects explicitly named are airports and highways (and bridges, but grouped). Since the question asks for two, the answer is "airports and highways". Alternatively, the answer is just "airports" and "highways" as two separate, but the article mentions them together. Hmm. Maybe the answer is "airports and highways" as two projects. I'll go with that.

12. **Question 12:** The minimum wage threshold for informal workers according to Subramanian. The article says the national minimum wage is $2 a day, but many aren't paid that. Subramanian talks about wage stagnation but doesn't give a specific threshold. The question asks for the precise numerical threshold he proposed. The article doesn't state this, so N/A.

13. **Question 13:** The exact percentage point difference between the summer quarter's 5.4% growth and the revised full-year forecast. The article says the revised outlook for the current fiscal year is 6.4%, while the summer quarter was 5.4%. The difference is 1.0 percentage points. So the answer is 1.0.
