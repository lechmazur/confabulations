Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I don't look anywhere else and stick strictly to the text. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then find the answers in the article.

1. The first question asks for the title of an opera conducted by Andris Nelsons during his early tenure with the BSO that involved a collaboration with Boston Lyric Opera before "Die Tote Stadt". The article mentions "Elektra" and "Rosenkavalier" as part of his earlier successes. Wait, the question says prior to "Die Tote Stadt", so maybe "Elektra" and "Rosenkavalier" are the ones from his early days. The article says "his extraordinary 'Elektra,' still by some distance his most enduring achievement... and his gorgeous 'Rosenkavalier.'" These were from the early days. But the question is specifically asking for one title from the early tenure that was part of a collaboration with BLO before "Die Tote Stadt". The article states that "Die Tote Stadt" was "mounted as part of a welcome new collaboration with Boston Lyric Opera". So the earlier collaborations would have included those two operas mentioned. But the question asks for the title of the opera from his early tenure that was part of that collaboration before "Die Tote Stadt". Wait, the article says "In the early days, events like these bolstered his reputation... such as these concert performances." But the specific examples given are "Elektra" and "Rosenkavalier". So the answer is "Elektra" or "Rosenkavalier"? The question is asking for one title, so maybe "Elektra" is the one specifically mentioned first. Wait, the question says "the opera conducted by Andris Nelsons during his early tenure... prior to Die Tote Stadt?" The answer is "Elektra".

2. The second question is about which orchestral section was highlighted during the scene where Paul strangles Marietta. The article says "her horrifying murder in the last act, brought out with savage power in the brass." So brass.

3. The third question asks for the visual element symbolizing the merging of Marie and Marietta's identities in Christine Goerke's portrayal. The article mentions "saw herself in Marie's portrait in the first act" but the key part is Christine Goerke's portrayal as the double role. The article says "Christine Goerke's complex, commanding account of the double role of Marie and Marietta. Lacking nothing in vocal force or subtlety, this was an exceptional portrayal that, in all its humanity and vulnerability, seemed determined to make Marietta a woman of her own, not just a figment of Paul's imagination." But the question asks for a specific visual element. Wait, maybe the article mentions a visual element? Let me check again. The article says "the ghastly, squirming breakdown of the strings as Marietta saw herself in Marie's portrait in the first act, as if the ground were sliding apart beneath her." Wait, but that's about the music. The question is about a visual element from Christine Goerke's portrayal. The article doesn't mention a specific visual element like a costume or set piece. Hmm. Wait, maybe the fact that she played both roles, but the question asks for a visual element. Since the article doesn't mention any specific visual symbol like a mirror or costume, maybe it's N/A? Wait, the article says "the soprano Christine Goerke's complex, commanding account of the double role of Marie and Marietta." But no visual element is specified. So the answer might be N/A. Wait, the question says "symbolized the merging of their identities according to the article's description of her portrayal." The article says "seemed determined to make Marietta a woman of her own, not just a figment..." which implies that her performance showed them as separate but perhaps through her acting. Since the question is about a visual element, maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, but maybe the portrait scene? The article mentions the portrait when Marietta sees herself in Marie's portrait, but that's part of the plot, not her portrayal. The answer might be N/A. Wait, maybe the article mentions a visual element in her performance? Let me check again. The article says "Christine Goerke's... portrayal... seemed determined to make Marietta a woman of her own..." but no specific visual element. So answer N/A?

Wait, maybe the article says "as if the ground were sliding apart beneath her" but that's a musical effect. Hmm. Maybe the answer is N/A here.

4. The fourth question asks which two operas performed by the BSO under Nelsons are cited as examples of declining focus compared to earlier successes like Elektra. The article says "More recent efforts at 'Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk' and especially 'Wozzeck' have only added to growing frustrations..." So the two are Lady Macbeth and Wozzeck.

5. The fifth question asks which character's aria parallels Tom Hanks' role in "You've Got Mail". The article compares Leontine's situation to Meg Ryan's role in "You've Got Mail". The article says "Leontine, like Meg Ryan in the 'Shop Around the Corner'-inspired 'You've Got Mail,' wanted it to be him so badly. They end up together, and happy." So the character would be Valcour, since Tom Hanks plays the male lead in "You've Got Mail". So Valcour's aria would parallel that. The article mentions "The most openhearted, dramatic arias are reserved for the central couple. The tenor Travon D. Walker's Valcour was by turns burning with desire..." So Valcour's aria is the parallel.

6. The sixth question asks the year of the premiere of "Die Tote Stadt" and the start of its suppression. The article states "had its premiere in 1920 and was popular for years after; it has been experiencing a revival of late, as has Korngold more generally." The suppression by the Nazis is mentioned, but when did that start? The Nazis came to power in 1933, but the article doesn't specify the exact year when suppression began. However, the question asks for the year of the premiere and the suppression start. Since the premiere was 1920, but the suppression started later, but the question says "the regime mentioned in the article" which is the Nazis. The article says "once consigned to history by Nazi antisemites and modernist opponents of late Romanticism." But the suppression by Nazis would have been during their rule, but the question wants the year when the opera was premiered AND when suppression began. Since the question is asking for the year that marks both events, but the suppression started later. Since the article only gives the premiere year as 1920, and doesn't specify when the Nazis suppressed it, the answer is 1920.

7. The seventh question asks which vocalist played the double role of the bereaved wife and doppelg√§nger dancer, noted despite misleading cues of violent affection. The article mentions Christine Goerke in the double role of Marie and Marietta. The violent affection refers to Paul's actions towards Marietta. So the answer is Christine Goerke.

8. The eighth question is about the playwright whose adaptation rendered the spoken dialogue in English for "L'Amant Anonyme". The article says "spoken dialogue was adapted into English by the playwright Kirsten Greenidge". So Kirsten Greenidge.

9. The ninth question asks who led the BSO in the revival with explosive orchestral breakdowns and indistinct passages. That's Andris Nelsons, as he's the conductor mentioned throughout the Boston section.

10. The tenth question asks who is commemorated as the composer of the only surviving opera, despite racial prejudice. The article says Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges composed "L'Amant Anonyme".

11. The eleventh question asks which recent production by Nelsons was criticized for slack rhythms and opaque textures, contrasting with the successful revival of "Die Tote Stadt". The article mentions "More recent efforts at 'Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk' and especially 'Wozzeck' have only added to growing frustrations..." So the answer is "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk" or "Wozzeck". The question says "presented in the review as a contrast to the successful revival of the opera about painful loss..." The successful one is Die Tote Stadt. The contrast is with the recent efforts like Lady Macbeth and Wozzeck. The question is asking for which one is presented as the contrast. The article says "Die Tote Stadt was better than 'Lady Macbeth' or 'Wozzeck'..." So the recent productions criticized are those two. But the question is asking for the specific one mentioned in the review as a contrast. The answer would be "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk" and "Wozzeck" but the question says "which opera", so perhaps "Wozzeck" is more criticized? The article says "especially 'Wozzeck'". So maybe "Wozzeck".

12. The twelfth question asks which opera was initially popular, then suppressed by ideological censorship, and is a testament to late Romanticism. "Die Tote Stadt" was premiered in 1920, then suppressed by Nazis and modernist opponents. So that's the answer.

13. The thirteenth question asks the venue for the co-produced "L'Amant Anonyme" likened to Bridgerton. The article says "arrived this past week at Opera Philadelphia, inside the grand Academy of Music theater".

14. The fourteenth question is the tenor who replaced Paul and was praised. David Butt Philip was the late replacement, so he's the answer.

15. The fifteenth question is which opera was revived at Opera Philadelphia after the 2020 critical edition and social movements. The article says "L'Amant Anonyme" had a critical edition in 2020 and was performed there after George Floyd's murder.

16. The sixteenth question asks which opera has characters like Brigitta and Frank/Fritz, with a scene of murder marked by brass. "Die Tote Stadt" has Brigitta (Karen Cargill as Brigitta and Elliot Madore as Frank and Fritz). The murder scene with brass is in Die Tote Stadt.
