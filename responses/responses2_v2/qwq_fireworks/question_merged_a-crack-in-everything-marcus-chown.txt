Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I use only the information from the provided article. Let me start by going through each question and checking the article for the answer.

1. The first question asks about the specific type of fuel Karl Schwarzschild determined a star must run out of before collapsing. Wait, the article mentions that Einstein's theory led to the idea of a star collapsing under its own weight after running out of fuel. But the question is about Schwarzschild. However, the article says Schwarzschild discovered the Schwarzschild radius while dealing with skin blisters in WWI. The fuel part is from Einstein's theory, not Schwarzschild's work. The article doesn't specify the type of fuel, just "fuel" in general. So maybe the answer is "fuel" but the question wants a specific type like hydrogen? The article doesn't mention a specific fuel type, so N/A?

Wait, the article states: "a star has run out of fuel and collapsed under its own weight". The question is asking what fuel Schwarzschild determined, but Schwarzschild's contribution was the radius. The article doesn't say Schwarzschild determined the fuel, so maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, but the question might be referencing Einstein's theory. But the question says "as described by Einstein's theory" so maybe the answer is "fuel", but the question wants a specific type. Since the article just says "fuel" without specifics, N/A?

2. The second question is about the fate of the "embers of dying suns" that Chandrasekhar contemplated. The article says Chandrasekhar's limit identifies stars that might become black holes. The "embers of dying suns" are the stars that could collapse into black holes. So their fate is to become black holes. So the answer is "black holes".

3. The third question: If Hubble's images were clear, which equation by Schwarzschild would be confirmed? The Schwarzschild radius equation describes the size of a black hole. So the equation is the Schwarzschild radius. The article says the equation is the Schwarzschild radius. So answer is "Schwarzschild radius".

4. The fourth question asks the maximum number of suns' mass for the entity Einstein didn't believe in. The article says black holes have the mass of "millions or billions of suns". The question is about the maximum? Wait, the question says "maximum number of suns whose combined mass could form the type..." but the article says they can be up to billions. But the question is about the maximum? Since the article says "millions or billions", maybe the answer is "billions". But the question might be a trick. Wait, the entity Einstein didn't believe in is the black hole. The article says "the mass of millions or billions of suns", so the maximum would be billions. So answer is "billions".

5. The fifth question: Name of the New Zealand mathematician who experienced despair over Hubble's blurry images. The article mentions Roy Kerr as a New Zealand mathematician, and Paul Murdin. The Hubble's blurry images caused despair, but who was involved? The article says "astronomers felt despair when the first images from the Hubble Space Telescope came back blurry". The question asks for the New Zealand mathematician. The article mentions Roy Kerr as a pioneer interviewed by Chown. So maybe Kerr? The question says "experienced the despair"â€”since the article doesn't specifically name a New Zealander linked to Hubble's issue, maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "the despair that astronomers felt when the first images from the Hubble Space Telescope came back blurry". But the question is asking for the New Zealand mathematician's name. The only New Zealand mathematician mentioned is Roy Kerr. But is there a connection? The article doesn't explicitly link Kerr to Hubble's problem. So maybe N/A.

6. Sixth question: What type of light did Chandrasekhar predict on his steamship journey? The article mentions Chandrasekhar did calculations by starlight on a steamship to Cambridge, and his limit identifies stars that might become black holes. The question asks for the light emitted by black holes he predicted. The article says black holes can be "the most brilliant beacons" when feeding, but Chandrasekhar's work was about the limit, not the light. The article doesn't mention him predicting specific light. So N/A.

7. Seventh question: The rank of brilliance of Karl's blisters. The article says black holes are "the most brilliant beacons". The question is about the rank of the blisters. Since the blisters are a skin condition, not related to brilliance, so N/A.

8. Eighth question: The instrument used during 16-hour shifts to piece together the equation (Schwarzschild's radius). The equation's discovery is Schwarzschild's. The article mentions the first picture of a black hole involved 16-hour shifts at the observatory. The instrument might be a telescope, but the article says "detectors" for gravitational waves, or the Event Horizon Telescope? The article says "the first picture of a black hole" required those shifts, but the equation (Schwarzschild radius) was discovered earlier. So maybe the answer is N/A, since the equation was theoretical, not observed via an instrument. Alternatively, the question might be about the instrument used to confirm the equation, but the article doesn't specify. So N/A.

9. Ninth question: The branch of physics Katrina Miller has a Ph.D. in. The article says she has a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Chicago. The question asks the specific branch. Since it just says "physics", the answer is "physics".

10. Tenth question: The title of Apollo publication detailing mishaps with the steamship. The article mentions the book is titled "A Crack in Everything" by Marcus Chown, published by Apollo. The mishaps with the steamship are part of Chandrasekhar's story. The question is asking for the title of the Apollo publication that details these mishaps. Since the book is "A Crack in Everything", that's the title. So answer is "A Crack in Everything".

11. Eleventh question: Researcher with skin blisters in WWI credited with a parameter describing a cosmic object's size. That's Karl Schwarzschild, who had skin blisters and discovered the Schwarzschild radius. So answer is "Karl Schwarzschild".

12. Twelfth question: Author blending poetic depictions and interviews. The book's author is Marcus Chown, as stated. So answer is "Marcus Chown".

13. Thirteenth question: Instrument that had blurry images but showed black hole light. The Hubble Space Telescope had blurry images initially, but black holes emit light when feeding. The article mentions Hubble's blurry images and the brilliant beacons. So the instrument is Hubble Space Telescope.

14. Fourteenth question: Mathematician on steamship associated with a limit for dying stars. That's Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, who did calculations on the steamship and his limit. So answer is "Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar".

15. Fifteenth question: Reviewer with Ph.D. in physics from UChicago. The reviewer is Katrina Miller, who has the Ph.D. So answer is "Katrina Miller".

16. Sixteenth question: Celestial phenomenon reimagined as gentle predator nurturing galaxies. The article ends by describing black holes as vibrant, spinning hearts that nurture galaxies and life. So answer is "black holes".

17. Seventeenth question: Phenomenon causing space-time to swap roles, described with the bowling ball analogy. The article uses the bowling ball on mattress to explain spacetime curvature, and mentions inside a black hole "space and time swap places". So the phenomenon is "black holes".

18. Eighteenth question: Space company with inaugural rocket launch mentioned alongside telescope issues. The article mentions Blue Origin's first rocket launch and SpaceX's Starship issues with Hubble. So the company is "Blue Origin".

19. Nineteenth question: Fundamental idea from Einstein's gravity redefinition leading to black holes. The article says Einstein's theory redefined gravity as spacetime curvature, leading to black holes. The idea is "gravity as the warping of space and time".

Now I need to check each answer against the article again.

1. The question is about Karl Schwarzschild determining the fuel. The article says "a star that has run out of fuel and collapsed under its own weight" but doesn't say Schwarzschild determined the fuel type. So N/A.

2. Embers of dying suns' fate: the article says Chandrasekhar's limit identifies stars that might become black holes. So their fate is to become black holes. Answer: black holes.

3. Schwarzschild's equation is the Schwarzschild radius. Hubble's clear images would confirm that equation? The article says the first image of a black hole was via the Event Horizon Telescope, but maybe the Hubble's images could confirm it? The question is hypothetical. The answer is Schwarzschild radius.

4. The maximum number of suns: the article says "millions or billions", so the maximum is billions. Answer: billions.

5. New Zealand mathematician linked to Hubble's despair: the article mentions Roy Kerr as a New Zealander but doesn't connect him to Hubble. So N/A.

6. Chandrasekhar predicted light? The article says his work was on the limit, not light. N/A.

7. Blisters' brilliance rank: N/A.

8. Instrument for Schwarzschild's equation: N/A.
