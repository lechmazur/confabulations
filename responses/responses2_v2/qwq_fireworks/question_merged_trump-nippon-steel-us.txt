Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I'll read through the article again to make sure I don't miss any details.

Question 1: What percentage of U.S. Steel did the Prime Minister mention Nippon Steel was initially acquiring? The article says the takeover bid was $14 billion but doesn't specify a percentage. So N/A.

Question 2: How many workers were to be laid off? The article mentions U.S. Steel would need to close mills and lay off workers but doesn't give a number. Answer N/A.

Question 3: The month the Biden admin blocked the deal. The article says "last month" in the context of Trump's comments on Friday. Since the article's date isn't given, but mentions a lawsuit after, it's unclear. The article's publication isn't specified, so N/A.

Question 4: Legal argument in the lawsuit. The companies claimed the CFIUS review was corrupted by politics and that blocking harmed workers and the industry. The answer is that the review was politically influenced.

Question 5: Lauren Hirsch's role. The article ends with "Lauren Hirsch contributed reporting." So her role is as a contributor.

Question 6: David McCall's alternative solution. He encouraged seeking American alternatives instead of Nippon's investment. So the answer is "seeking American alternatives."

Question 7: Treasury reporter who contributed. The article says Alan Rappeport wrote it with Lauren Hirsch contributing. The question is about the Treasury reporter, but the article doesn't mention another. N/A.

Question 8: Union's stated reason. The union's president mentions "concerns regarding Nippon's continued interest" but the exact reason isn't specified beyond ownership. The article says they opposed foreign ownership, so maybe "N/A" since the stated reason isn't directly quoted except opposition to Nippon's interest.

Wait, the union's statement says "our concerns regarding Nippon's continued interest in U.S. Steel remain unchanged." That's the reason given. So the answer is that they opposed Nippon's continued interest.

Question 9: The state mentioned. The article says U.S. Steel is based in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state. So Pennsylvania.

Question 10: Technology transfer mentioned. The Prime Minister mentioned Japanese technology would be provided for better products. The specific tech isn't named, so N/A.

Question 11: Number of mills to close. The article says "close mills" but no exact number. N/A.

Question 12: Which state's union members were key? The union is United Steelworkers, based in Pennsylvania. So Pennsylvania again.

Question 13: Legal argument in lawsuit. Same as question 4, which was about politics corrupting the process. So same answer here.

Question 14: Which entity oversees arbitration? The article says Trump would mediate and arbitrate, but the entity isn't named. Maybe CFIUS? Wait, the question is about who oversees the arbitration. The article says Trump would mediate, but the entity isn't specified. So N/A.

Question 15: Original stake percentage. The article mentions a $14B takeover but not percentage. N/A.

Question 16: Trade agreement referenced? The article mentions discussing tariffs and trade but no specific agreement. N/A.

Question 17: Previous Nippon acquisition cited? The article doesn't mention any prior acquisition by Nippon. N/A.

Question 18: Month layoffs were announced. The article says after the rejection, but no specific month. N/A.

Alright, that's all. Let me check each question again to ensure I didn't miss anything.
