Okay, I need to go through each question one by one and find the answers strictly from the provided article. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question is asking which government agency's payments to Politico were revealed to contradict Trump's claims. The article mentions that President Trump spread unfounded claims about Politico being paid for positive coverage. Then it says "Records show agencies paid for subscriptions." The exact agency isn't named here, so maybe it's N/A? Wait, the article doesn't specify which agency, just says "agencies." Since the question asks for the specific agency, and it's not mentioned, the answer should be N/A.

2. The second question is about the number of dissenting judges in the appellate court's decision. The article states that a five-judge panel affirmed the previous ruling. If they affirmed, that means all agreed, so no dissent. So the answer is 0.

3. Lara Trump's network: The article says she will host a new weekend show on Fox News. The question asks which network she joined after being associated with a different major news channel. Wait, the article only mentions Fox News here. It says "there is no precedent for the close relative of a sitting president to host a high-profile show on a major television news channel." So maybe the previous association isn't mentioned? The question might be tricky here. Since the article doesn't mention her previous network, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "after previously being associated with a different major news channel mentioned in the article?" The article mentions Fox News, but does it mention another network she was with? The text only states she's now on Fox, but her prior association isn't given here. So N/A?

Wait, maybe the question is a trick. The article says "Fox News: Lara Trump, Trump's daughter-in-law, will host a new weekend show on Fox News." So the previous association isn't mentioned here. So the answer is N/A.

4. The percentage increase in NYT subscriptions. The article says they added 350k, pushing total to over 11.4 million. But the percentage isn't given. So N/A.

5. Federal regulatory body involved in releasing the "60 Minutes" transcript: The article says "The Federal Communications Commission released the transcript..." So FCC.

6. How many other voting tech companies besides Dominion and Smartmatic were referenced in the court's analysis? The court's analysis part mentions Dominion in the context of Fox's prior settlement, but the court's decision in the Smartmatic case didn't mention any other companies. The article says the lawsuit is about Smartmatic, and the court's analysis refers to Dominion only in the prior settlement, not in the current case's analysis. So the answer is 0.

7. The financial penalty Fox proposed as an alternative to the $2.7B claim. The article mentions that Fox's legal team's report says Smartmatic's claims are implausible, but it doesn't state a specific proposed penalty. So N/A.

8. Which political party's officials were named in coordination allegations with Fox Corp? The article doesn't mention any specific party officials being named. The lawsuit is against Fox, but the question asks about party officials. The article doesn't specify, so N/A.

9. Exact date of the ruling. The article says "Thursday" but doesn't give the date. So N/A.

10. Another media conglomerate besides Fox facing legal action for election coverage. The article mentions Dominion's lawsuit against Fox, but no other conglomerate is mentioned. So N/A.

11. The corporate entity accused of directing the disinformation campaign. The court's statement says Fox Corporation directed Fox News. So the answer is Fox Corporation.

12. The voting company that settled with Fox (Dominion) versus the one with the $2.7B suit (Smartmatic). The question asks which one reached a settlement. The answer is Dominion Voting Systems.

13. Which judicial panel rejected Fox's motion? The article says "a five-judge panel in the First Department of the New York State Supreme Court's Appellate Division affirmed..." So the panel is the First Department Appellate Division.

14. The reporter covering media industry issues is Katie Robertson, as stated at the end of the article.

15. Family connection on Fox News: Lara Trump is Trump's daughter-in-law, so the answer is Lara Trump's family connection (daughter-in-law of Trump).

16. Legacy news org with 350k digital subs: The NYT added 350k, so NYT.

17. News outlet mentioned with unfounded payment claims: Politico.

18. The company with the $2.7B lawsuit going to trial: Smartmatic.

19. Which came first: Smartmatic's lawsuit (filed Feb 2021) or Fox's financial expert report (2023, since the settlement with Dominion was in 2023). The question asks if the lawsuit was initiated before the report. Since the lawsuit was in 2021 and the report is part of the defense later, the answer is the lawsuit was earlier.

20. Source Fox uses to claim damages are implausible: The article says "As a report prepared by our financial expert shows..." So the answer is the report prepared by Fox's financial expert.
