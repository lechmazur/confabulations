Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start with the first question.

1. **How many chairs did Weiss borrow from the Ontological-Hysteric Theater to use at the Brick's annex, Brick Aux?**  
Looking at the article, it says Weiss offered 38 chairs from Life World, which were the original folding chairs from the Ontological-Hysteric Theater. But wait, the question is about using them at Brick Aux. The article mentions the chairs were for "Soho Rep Is Not a Building," but the Brick's annex is Brick Aux. However, the exact use at the annex isn't specified. Wait, the article says: "I offered 38 chairs from Life World, which is this sort of comedy venue I helped run... They're the original folding chairs from the Ontological-Hysteric Theater." But the event mentioned here is Soho Rep's event. The question is about Brick's annex. Hmm. Wait, the article might not explicitly state that the chairs were used at Brick Aux. The problem is the question might be mixing details. Let me check again. The Brick and its annex are part of his responsibilities, but the chairs were for Soho Rep's event. The answer might still be 38, but I need to confirm if the article links those chairs to Brick Aux. The article says he offered them for Soho Rep, not directly the Brick. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, maybe I misread. The article says he helped run Life World, and the chairs were from there, originally from Ontological. But the question is about borrowing from Ontological to use at Brick's annex. The article doesn't explicitly state that he used them at the annex. The chairs were for Soho Rep's event. So the answer might be N/A. Wait, but the first part says "because they're moving out of their space, Soho Rep had no chairs anymore for 'Soho Rep Is Not a Building,' so I offered 38 chairs..." So those chairs were for that event, not the Brick's annex. Therefore, the answer would be N/A because the chairs were for Soho Rep, not the annex. Wait, but the question says "to use at the Brick's annex". The article doesn't mention that. So N/A? Or maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The article says "I offered 38 chairs from Life World, which is this sort of comedy venue I helped run (we're in the midst of looking for another space). They're the original folding chairs from the Ontological-Hysteric Theater." But where were these chairs used? The event mentioned is Soho Rep's event. The question is about the Brick's annex. Since there's no mention of the chairs being used at Brick Aux, the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe the Brick is part of the same organization? The user might think so, but the question is specific. So I think the answer is N/A.

2. **What type of food, prepared by Carmelita Tropicana, did Weiss consume after the "Sapphire" load-out, while watching YouTube videos?**  
Looking at the article, after the event, he mentions eating pasta. The article states: "I went home and it's a blur to me. Oh, I ate pasta, watched some videos..." The pasta wasn't prepared by Carmelita Tropicana. The question says "prepared by Carmelita Tropicana", but there's no mention of her preparing food. So the answer is N/A.

3. **What video game did Weiss successfully play after being roasted by the Zoomer performer at the "MEOW!" show at the Brick?**  
The article says after the show, he "attempted to play a video game and failed". It doesn't mention the name of the game, nor does it say he succeeded. The question asks which game he successfully played, but the text says he failed. So the answer is N/A because he didn't successfully play any.

4. **What was the name of Theresa Buchheister's replacement as the artistic director of the Brick, with whom Weiss discussed the curatorial approach for April's new works program?**  
The article says Weiss and Ann Marie Dorr are joint interim producing artistic directors. It mentions "Theresa Buchheister's legacy programming" and that Weiss helped articulate the curatorial modality for the April program. Since they're interim, there's no permanent replacement named. The answer would be Ann Marie Dorr, as they are joint interim directors. The question is about the replacement, so the answer is Ann Marie Dorr.

5. **Besides administrative work, what activity did Weiss fail at after returning home from the "MEOW!" performance, before finally going to bed?**  
The article states: "attempted to play a video game and failed". So the activity is playing a video game. The answer is "play a video game".

6. **What prop, essential to the keriah ritual, did Weiss mistakenly damage during his hosting duties with William Burke at Walkerspace?**  
The keriah ritual involves tearing a garment or ribbon. The article says Weiss ripped Carmelita Tropicana's pant leg, which was prepped for the ritual. The prop was her pant leg. So the answer is "pant leg".

7. **What flavor of Club Crackers did Weiss consume before attempting to play a video game after attending the "MEOW!" performance at the Brick?**  
The article mentions he ate "half a sleeve of Club Crackers", but no flavor is specified. So answer N/A.

8. **What was the name of the anti-fascist puppet show that was part of the Exponential festival, which Weiss attended at the Brick?**  
The article mentions "Cool Zone: The Lost Episode" at the Aux, which is part of Exponential. The description says it's an "anti-fascist puppetry drag extravaganza". The name is "Cool Zone: The Lost Episode".

9. **What role did Cameron Stuart, the operations manager at the Brick, play in the "Soho Rep Is Not a Building" event?**  
The article mentions an error in Cameron Stuart's job title: "An earlier version of a picture caption... Cameron Stuart's job title at the Brick. It is operations director, not operations manager." However, the article does not mention Cameron Stuart's role in the event. The question asks about his role in the event, which isn't covered. So answer N/A.

10. **What was the name of the coffee shop where Weiss congratulated the "Sapphire" team after their successful run at the Brick?**  
The article says he went to Poetica Coffee nearby after the event. The answer is "Poetica Coffee".
