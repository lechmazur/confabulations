Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information given in the article and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start with the first question.

But it doesn't mention when the sanctions started or ended. Since the bombing was in 1988 and al-Megrahi died in 2012, maybe the sanctions lasted until his death?
