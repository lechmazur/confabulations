Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks which Silicon Valley tech company executives attended the Bible study group. The article mentions there's a Bible study group made up of engineers from top AI companies meeting in a Silicon Valley church basement. But it doesn't name any specific companies or executives. So the answer is N/A.

2. The second question is about how many religious leaders Rabbi Fixler collaborated with to develop Rabbi Bot. The article says Rabbi Fixler worked with Muhammad Aurangzeb Ahmad. That's one person, but the question specifies "religious leaders." Since Ahmad is a researcher, not a religious leader, maybe the answer is just Rabbi Fixler alone? Wait, the question says "collaborated with," so perhaps only the rabbi and the researcher. Since the question asks for religious leaders, only Rabbi Fixler is a religious leader here. But the question says "how many religious leaders," so maybe just him? Hmm. Wait, the question says "collaborated with to develop the initial version," so he worked with the researcher. Since the researcher isn't a religious leader, the answer might be N/A. The article says "with the help of Muhammad Aurangzeb Ahmad, a Muslim AI researcher... Rabbi Fixler had created Rabbi Bot." So only one religious leader (Rabbi Fixler himself) but the question is about others he collaborated with. Since the collaborator is a researcher, not a religious leader, the answer is 0? Or maybe the question is counting the rabbis? Wait, the article says "Rabbi Oren Hayon and Rabbi Josh Fixler over Zoom in December. With the help of Muhammad Aurangzeb Ahmad..." So maybe the collaboration was with the researcher and another rabbi? Wait, no, the article says "Rabbi Fixler had created a program called 'Rabbi Bot.' Trained on Rabbi Fixler's old sermons, Rabbi Bot could write sermons in his style..." So it was him and the researcher. Since the researcher isn't a religious leader, the answer is 0? But the question says "religious leaders," so the answer is N/A because the collaborator wasn't a religious leader. So answer is N/A.

3. The third question asks which passage from Matthew Jay Cooper cited. The article says he cited a passage from the Book of John, not Matthew. So the answer is N/A.

4. The fourth question asks the month in 2021 when Rabbi Bot first delivered a sermon. The article mentions a YouTube video from two years ago, but the article was written in 2024 (since the reporter is part of the 2024-25 fellowship). If the article was written in late 2023 or 2024, then two years ago would be 2021 or 2022. However, the exact month isn't given. The article doesn't mention the month, so N/A.

5. The fifth question is about why Eli's mother's experience as a hospice chaplain influenced his approach. The article states that his mother is a longtime hospice chaplain, and his familiarity with spirituality helped in reporting. The direct reason might be that her experience provided insight into the human aspects of faith, making him better at understanding the ethical issues. The article says "being able to put together a thoughtful answer was important to building trust." So the primary reason is her experience gave him familiarity. The answer is N/A? Wait, the question is asking for the primary reason her experience influenced his approach. The article says "It's always helpful... to have some familiarity with the subject matter." So the primary reason is her experience provided familiarity. The exact wording is needed. The question is about the reason her experience influenced his approach. The article says "My mother is a longtime hospice chaplain... it's helpful to have familiarity with the subject matter." So the primary reason is her experience provided familiarity. But the question asks for the reason, so the answer would be "provided familiarity with the subject matter". But the answer must be a direct quote or fact from the article. Wait, the article says "being able to put together a thoughtful answer was important to building trust." So maybe the answer is N/A because the article doesn't state a specific reason beyond general familiarity. Hmm. The exact reason isn't specified, so maybe N/A? Or the answer is "provided him familiarity with spirituality" based on the text. Since the article says "helpful... to have some familiarity with the subject matter," the primary reason is that her experience contributed to his familiarity. So I think the answer is "provided familiarity with the subject matter" but need to check if the article says that exactly. The article says "My mother is a longtime hospice chaplain. I attended a Lutheran college... it's helpful... to have some familiarity with the subject matter." So the primary reason is that her experience contributed to his familiarity. But the question asks specifically about her experience as a hospice chaplain influencing his approach. The article doesn't directly link her job to his approach except that it's part of his background. Since the article doesn't explicitly state the reason, maybe N/A? Or the answer is "N/A" because it's not directly stated. Hmm, tricky. Maybe the answer is N/A because it's inferred but not directly stated. Wait the article says "My mother is a longtime hospice chaplain... it's helpful... to have some familiarity with the subject matter." So the reason is that her experience, along with his own background, gave him familiarity. So the primary reason is her experience as a hospice chaplain contributed to his familiarity. Since the question is about the primary reason, maybe the answer is "provided him familiarity with spirituality" but the article says "subject matter" which refers to AI in religion. Alternatively, the answer is N/A because it's not directly stated. Hmm. I'll go with N/A since the article doesn't explicitly state the reason, just that it helped with familiarity.

6. The sixth question asks which mosque in San Francisco provided evidence of AI integration. The article mentions visiting local mosques but doesn't name any specific mosque. So answer is N/A.

7. The seventh question asks the number of members in the Facebook group when Tan discovered it. The article doesn't mention the number, so N/A.

8. The eighth question is about the criteria Muhammad Aurangzeb Ahmad used to select sermons for training. The article doesn't specify the criteria, so N/A.

9. The ninth question asks the theological argument Roman officials presented. The article says Jay Cooper cited a passage where a Roman official responded with "What is truth?" So the answer is "What is truth?"

10. The tenth question is about which Lutheran college tradition inspired Tan. The article mentions he attended a Lutheran college and went to morning chapel. The tradition is morning chapel services, so the answer is "morning chapel services."

11. The eleventh question refers to a specific biblical passage indirectly referenced by the Austin pastor. The article says Jay Cooper (pastor in Austin) cited the Book of John where Jesus says "Everyone on the side of truth listens to me," and the Roman official replies "What is truth?" So the passage is John 18:38. The question asks which book, but the answer is John, not Matthew. Wait the question says "which specific biblical passage was indirectly referenced"—the passage is from John, so the answer is "John 18:38" but the question might just need the book. The question says "specific biblical passage"—the exact reference is John 18:38. But the article doesn't give the chapter and verse, just mentions the Book of John. So the answer is "Book of John" but the question might require the specific chapter. Since the article doesn't specify, maybe just "Book of John" but the question says "passage," so perhaps N/A. Wait the question says "specific biblical passage"—since the article only mentions the book (John) and not the chapter or verse, maybe the answer is "John" but the exact passage isn't given beyond that. However, the question says "indirectly referenced," so the answer is the passage in John where the Roman official says "What is truth?" So the answer is "John 18:38" but since the article doesn't state the exact verse, maybe just "Book of John" is acceptable. The question might accept that. The article says "a passage from the Book of John," so the answer is "Book of John."

Wait, the question says "specific biblical passage"—so the exact book and chapter/verse. Since the article only mentions the book (John), the answer is N/A because the specific passage isn't given beyond the book. So N/A?

Wait the article says "cited a passage from the Book of John, where Jesus... is confronted by Roman officials. Jesus says... to which a Roman official responds, 'What is truth?'" So the passage is in John, but the exact chapter and verse isn't given. The question asks for the specific passage, so without that info, it's N/A. So answer N/A.

Wait but the question says "specific biblical passage"—maybe the answer is the Book of John, but the question might require more. Since the article doesn't specify, N/A.

Hmm. Let me check again. The article says "a passage from the Book of John"—so the book is John, but the specific passage (like chapter and verse) isn't mentioned. Since the question asks for the specific passage, the answer is N/A because it's only mentioned by book, not the exact passage.

12. The twelfth question asks which program was developed with a Muslim AI researcher. The article says Rabbi Fixler worked with Muhammad Aurangzeb Ahmad (a Muslim researcher) to create Rabbi Bot. So the answer is "Rabbi Bot."

13. The thirteenth question is about the 15th-century invention mentioned. The article says a religious leader (Rabbi Hayon) discussed technologies like radio, TV, internet, and older tools like the printing press. So the answer is "printing press."

14. The fourteenth question asks from which city the reporter observed AI billboards. The article says the reporter's neighborhood in San Francisco has billboards for AI companies. So the answer is "San Francisco."

15. The fifteenth question is about the organized gathering in the church basement. The article mentions a Bible study group of engineers from top AI companies meeting in a Silicon Valley church basement. So the answer is "Bible study group."

16. The sixteenth question asks which Texas-based religious leader raised concerns. The article mentions Jay Cooper, a pastor in Austin, Texas, who questioned if God could speak through AI. So the answer is "Jay Cooper."

17. The seventeenth question is about the social media platform where the reporter found the group. The article starts by saying he found the Facebook group "A.I. for Church Leaders and Pastors." So the answer is "Facebook."

18. The eighteenth question asks the reporter's first name. The article says the reporter is Eli Tan. So the answer is "Eli."

19. The nineteenth question is about the denomination linked to his college. He attended a Lutheran college, so the answer is "Lutheran."

20. The twentieth question asks which religious tradition's liturgical heritage was used for the AI sermon generator. The article discusses Rabbi Bot, which is used in a synagogue, so the tradition is Judaism. The answer is "Jewish" or "Judaism." The article says "synagogue," so the tradition is Judaism.
