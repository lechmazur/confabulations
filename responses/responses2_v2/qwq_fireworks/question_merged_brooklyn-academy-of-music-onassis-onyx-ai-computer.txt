Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks which specific Brothers Grimm story ending was programmed into the A.I. for "The Golden Key." The article mentions that "The Golden Key" takes its name from a Brothers Grimm story that invited readers to devise their own ending. However, the text doesn't specify which exact story or ending was used. The example given in the article about food delivery drivers and galactic beings seems to be part of Marc Da Costa's demonstration, not the original Grimm story's ending. Since the specific ending isn't mentioned, the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The article states that Karen Brooks Hopkins, who retired as BAM's president in 2015, is now a board member of the Onassis Foundation's U.S. branch. She was the person ONX approached to bring the installations to BAM. The question asks who funded the collaboration. The text says the installations are "primarily funded by Onassis ONX," but the person involved in facilitating it was Hopkins. Since the question is about who funded it, but the funding is from Onassis, but the individual is Hopkins. Wait, the question says "personally funded"â€”but the article says "primarily funded by Onassis ONX." So maybe the answer is N/A because the funding is from the foundation, not personally by her. Hmm, but the question might be asking who arranged it. The answer might be Karen Brooks Hopkins. Let me check again. The article says "she was the person ONX turned to when it was seeking a large, public venue..." So she facilitated it, but the funding is from Onassis. The question says "personally funded" so maybe N/A because she didn't personally fund it; the foundation did. But the question might be tricky. Alternatively, maybe the question is mixing roles. Since the question says "personally funded," but the article doesn't mention her personal funding. So N/A? Wait, the question says "personally funded the collaboration between ONX Studio and the Fisher building's black box theater?" The article says "primarily funded by Onassis ONX," so the answer is Karen Brooks Hopkins isn't the funder. So the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe the question is wrong in the premise. The correct answer would be Karen Brooks Hopkins as the person who arranged it but not funded. Since the question asks who funded, answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is mixing up the roles. I'll need to check again. The article says "primarily funded by Onassis ONX," so the answer is not Karen. So the answer is N/A for funding, but the person involved is Karen. Since the question specifically asks who personally funded, answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The article mentions the scenes were rendered in a "nostalgic style suggestive of travel posters from a century ago." A century ago from when? The installation is in 2023-2024, so a century ago would be early 1920s. But the question asks for a specific style from the 1920s. The article doesn't name a specific style or era, just "travel posters from a century ago." Since it's not named (like Art Deco or something), the answer is N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The installation with the scenario where a galactic figure meets delivery drivers is "The Golden Key," as described in Marc Da Costa's example. The answer is "The Golden Key."

5. **Question 5:** The screening at BAM Rose Cinemas is on Jan. 7 at 7:30 p.m., as per the schedule listed at the end.

6. **Question 6:** "The Vivid Unknown" reinterprets "Koyaanisqatsi" (1982 film) using AI-generated imagery and score, without any actual photography or Philip Glass's music. So the answer is "The Vivid Unknown."

7. **Question 7:** "The Golden Key" is based on a Brothers Grimm story and uses computer kiosks for audience input. So the answer is "The Golden Key."

8. **Question 8:** Karen Brooks Hopkins, who was BAM's former president and is now on the Onassis board, facilitated the collaboration. The answer is Karen Brooks Hopkins.

9. **Question 9:** "Secret Garden" is by Stephanie Dinkins, a Brooklyn artist, compiling stories of Black women's achievements. The answer is "Secret Garden."

10. **Question 10:** The Athens-based video artist is Margarita Athanasiou with "Voices," focusing on the spirit world. The answer is "Voices."

11. **Question 11:** John Fitzgerald projected "Koyaanisqatsi" on his ceiling at Brown and co-developed "The Vivid Unknown," which revisits themes from the original film about disengagement from nature. So the answer is John Fitzgerald.

12. **Question 12:** "The Golden Key" uses AI to simulate folklore and addresses misinformation from automated storytelling under economic/political control. The answer is "The Golden Key."

13. **Question 13:** The article states "with the exception of 'Voices,' each is interactive." So the non-interactive one is "Voices."
