Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to go through each question carefully and find the exact information in the article. Let me start by skimming through the article again to make sure I don't miss anything.

1. The first question asks for the percentage profit margin of members of the Automotive Parts Manufacturer's Association according to Flavio Volpe. Looking through the article, there's a part where Flavio Volpe is mentioned: "Flavio Volpe, the president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturer's Association, a Canadian trade group, estimated that most of his members had single-digit profit margins and that the tariffs Mr. Trump was threatening would be ruinous." So "single-digit" would mean under 10%, but the exact percentage isn't given. Wait, but the question says "what percentage" so maybe they want the exact number? But the text only says "single-digit". Hmm, maybe "single-digit" is the answer here? Wait, the question is asking for the percentage. Since "single-digit" means between 1-9%, but the exact number isn't specified. But the question says "according to Flavio Volpe" and the text says "single-digit profit margins". Since it's not a specific number, maybe the answer is "single-digit"? But the instructions say to answer with the exact figure if possible. Wait, but the question is phrased as "what percentage profit margin do most members...", so maybe the answer is "single-digit" but since it's a percentage, perhaps they want the exact number. Wait, but the article doesn't give an exact number, just says single-digit. So maybe the answer is "single-digit"? But the instructions say if the answer isn't provided, put N/A. Wait, but "single-digit" is provided. So the answer is "single-digit".

2. The second question is about which U.S. state is explicitly mentioned as a target for Canadian retaliatory tariffs due to its economic reliance. The article mentions: "retaliatory tariffs would also drive up prices in Canada." But it also says Canada's small economy makes it hard to inflict harm, though levies against specific products could hurt individual states. But the text doesn't name any specific state. The only state mentioned in the context of a plant is Alabama (Honda's Alabama plant) and Michigan (processing in Michigan). But the question is about which state is explicitly mentioned as a target. Since the article doesn't specify a state, the answer would be N/A. Wait, the question says "explicitly mentioned" so unless the article mentions a state name in that context, it's N/A. Since the article doesn't name a state here, answer is N/A.

3. The third question asks for the cross-border infrastructure worth $5.7 billion and scheduled to open this year, mentioned alongside the Ambassador Bridge. The article says: "the $5.7 billion Gordie Howe International Bridge, scheduled to open this year, and the 96-year-old Ambassador Bridge..." So the answer is Gordie Howe International Bridge.

4. The fourth question is about the Windsor manufacturer with hulking presses over 600 tons and a concrete boardroom. The article mentions Lanex Manufacturing: "The president of Lanex, said in its boardroom, whose walls were made of painted concrete blocks." Also, "At Lanex, small metal parts... forged into shape by upward of 600 tons of pressure by the firm's presses." So the answer is Lanex Manufacturing.

5. The fifth question is about the plastics company leader who said U.S. buyers would adjust payments via contract terms. The article says George Papp, CEO of Papp Plastics: "His U.S. customers... would simply invoke the terms of contracts... deduct the cost of tariffs..." So the answer is George Papp.

6. The sixth question is the head of the automotive parts association who warned about the tariffs. That's Flavio Volpe, as mentioned earlier. So Flavio Volpe.

7. The seventh question is the automaker that invested 1.89 billion CAD to retool for EVs. The article says Stellantis spent 1.89 billion Canadian dollars to retool its assembly plant. They produce Chrysler Pacifica minivans and Dodge Charger. So the answer is Stellantis.

8. The eighth question is the union leader warning about job losses. The article mentions James Stewart, president of the local union representing Stellantis workers in Windsor. So James Stewart.

9. The ninth question is who cautioned that tariffs would hurt both Canada and the U.S. That's Justin Trudeau, when he visited a steel plant. The article says: "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at a steel plant during a recent visit to the city. Mr. Trump, he added, 'is proposing tariffs that would damage not just people here in Windsor but people right across the country and indeed in the United States.'" So the answer is Justin Trudeau.

10. The tenth question is the year of the Canada-US accord eliminating the auto border. The article says "1965 when Canada and the United States reached an agreement that effectively eliminated the border for the industry." So 1965.

11. The eleventh question is the Japanese manufacturer whose Alabama plant uses parts from Windsor. The article mentions Honda: "Seat-locking hooks that Lanex makes for Honda minivans are sent to a plant elsewhere in Ontario, where they are fitted with other parts and then shipped to an assembly line in Alabama that belongs to Honda." So Honda.

12. The twelfth question is the product category exceeding automotive exports in revenue. The article states: "Of Canada's $440 billion in annual exports to the United States, only oil and gas generate a larger amount than cars, trucks and auto parts." So oil and gas are the category that's larger. The question asks which category surpasses automotive, so oil and gas.
