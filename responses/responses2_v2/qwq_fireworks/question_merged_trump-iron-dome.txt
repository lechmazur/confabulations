Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article and don't infer anything beyond what's written. Let me start with the first question.

1. **How many Brilliant Pebbles were successfully deployed into orbit as part of the antimissile defense system before the program was discontinued?**  
The article mentions the "Brilliant Pebbles" as a failed plan, but it doesn't say how many were deployed. It only describes the concept. So answer N/A.

2. **What was the total cost of implementing the Israeli Iron Dome technology for continental US defense according to the OMB spreadsheet?**  
The article says the OMB spreadsheet suspended funding for programs, but there's no specific cost mentioned for Iron Dome implementation. Answer N/A.

3. **Which former MIT professor first proposed using space-based interceptors to counter hypersonic weapons during the Biden administration's missile tests?**  
Looking at the text, Thomas Karako from CSIS talks about space-based sensors and interceptors in the context of the Biden admin's tests. The former MIT professor mentioned is Ernest Moniz. Wait, no. Wait, the article says: "Thomas Karako, the director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said on Tuesday that the order would accelerate work on space-based sensors to detect hypersonic missiles like the ones that were launched last year by the Biden administration." But the question is who first proposed it. The article doesn't mention a specific professor proposing it first. The other MIT professor mentioned is Theodore A. Postol and Ernest Moniz. Wait, the quote from Karako mentions "space-based interceptors" as coming, but no specific professor is named as first proposing it. So N/A.

Wait, the article says: "Stephen I. Schwartz... estimates that over the decades the United States has spent more than $400 billion on the kind of antimissile goals that Mr. Trump now says will provide..." But that's not about the proposer. Maybe the question is wrong. So answer N/A.

4. **What percentage reduction in nuclear terrorism risk did the White House project would result from the temporary funding freeze of counternuclear programs?**  
The article doesn't mention any projected percentage. The freeze is presented as a pause, but no numbers. Answer N/A.

5. **How many successful intercepts were achieved in the Pentagon's dual-interceptor test against simulated North Korean warheads?**  
The article states: "The exercise appeared to simulate how the United States might defend against an adversary like North Korea. The test's novel feature was that it fired two interceptor rockets at an incoming mock warhead, rather than one." It says "successfully tested a new method", so maybe one intercept? The answer is "one" or maybe the question is about how many interceptors were fired (two), but the question is about successful intercepts. The article says "successfully tested" but doesn't specify the number of intercepts. Since it's a test against one mock warhead, likely one successful intercept. So answer 1? Wait, the test fired two interceptors at one warhead. The article says "successfully tested a new method for intercepting missiles", so maybe it was successful in intercepting, but the count is 1? The question is about how many successful intercepts. The article doesn't explicitly state the number of successful hits, just that the test was successful. So maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "successfully tested a new method", so the test was successful, but how many intercepts? Since it's a test against one mock warhead, maybe one. But the question is about the number achieved. Since it's not stated, N/A?

Hmm, tricky. Let me check again: "The Pentagon said it successfully tested a new method for intercepting missiles aimed at American cities. The exercise appeared to simulate how the United States might defend against an adversary like North Korea. The test's novel feature was that it fired two interceptor rockets at an incoming mock warhead, rather than one." The test was successful, but the number of intercepts isn't specified. So answer N/A.

6. **What was the projected completion date for the comprehensive missile defense shield announced in Trump's executive order?**  
The article doesn't mention a specific completion date. The executive order is described as vague, so N/A.

7. **How many Russian undersea autonomous nuclear torpedoes were detected approaching the West Coast during Trump's first term?**  
The article mentions that Russia "boast of an undersea autonomous nuclear torpedo that can cross oceans to hit the West Coast." But there's no mention of any being detected. So N/A.

8. **What budget allocation did the OMB spreadsheet specify for developing countermeasures against China's projected nuclear arsenal expansion?**  
The article says the OMB suspended funding for programs including those to curb nuclear arms spread, but doesn't specify a budget for China's expansion. N/A.

9. **Which specific biological weapons defense programs were transferred to Space Force oversight under the new executive order?**  
The article doesn't mention any biological programs being transferred to Space Force. The executive order's specifics aren't detailed beyond accelerating current programs. N/A.

10. **What was the measured speed differential between Israeli Iron Dome intercepts and the proposed US system's required intercept velocity?**  
The article states that Iron Dome targets slower missiles (compared to intercontinental warheads), but doesn't provide a numerical speed difference. The question asks for a measured differential, which isn't in the text. N/A.

11. **Based on the article’s discussion of advancing missile defense, which military leader is portrayed as having laid the groundwork for the space‐based sensor initiatives mentioned in Trump’s directive?**  
The article mentions Ronald Reagan's day as the start of such efforts. So Reagan is the leader. But the question is about a military leader? Reagan was a president. Maybe not. Wait, the article says "since Ronald Reagan's day, with only mixed results." So the groundwork was laid by Reagan's administration. The question might expect Reagan, even if he wasn't a military leader. Alternatively, maybe someone else? The article doesn't name another leader. So answer Ronald Reagan. The question says "military leader," but maybe it's acceptable. Alternatively, N/A if the leader isn't specified. The article doesn't name a military leader, so maybe N/A. Hmm. The question says "military leader," so maybe N/A. Alternatively, if Reagan counts as a leader (though civilian), but the question says military. So N/A?

Wait, the article says "the effort has been underway since Ronald Reagan's day". So the groundwork was laid by Reagan's administration. But the question asks for a military leader. Since Reagan was president, not a military leader, answer N/A.

12. **Referring to the 56‐page spreadsheet from the Office of Management and Budget described in the text, which program aimed at preventing terrorist nuclear fuel seizures is listed among those suspended?**  
The article says "most of the major U.S. efforts to reduce the amount of nuclear fuel that terrorists might seize" were suspended. So the program is "efforts to reduce the amount of nuclear fuel that terrorists might seize". The answer is that program's name? The article doesn't name it, just describes it. The question asks for the program's name, but the article doesn't specify. So answer N/A. Wait, the question says "which program aimed at...", but the article just mentions the category. Since no specific program name is given, answer N/A.

13. **Considering the timeline of events discussed, what year does the article give for the Pentagon’s reported successful test of a dual-interceptor method simulating a defense against missile attacks?**  
The article says "During his first term, Mr. Trump in 2019 vowed... The Pentagon's explanation for the 2019 initiative looked... Weeks after Mr. Trump unveiled his plans, the Pentagon said it successfully tested..." So the test was in 2019, since it was weeks after 2019. Answer 2019.

14. **In linking the technological approach to detecting hypersonic threats with established defense tactics, which element from the Israeli defense system is cited as a model for Trump’s initiative?**  
The article mentions the Iron Dome as the model, but notes it's misleading because the Israeli system targets slower missiles. The element cited as a model is the Iron Dome's success, even though it's not directly applicable. The question asks which element is cited. The article says "The Iron Dome reference conjures up the success...", so the Iron Dome system itself is the model. So answer "Iron Dome missile defense".

15. **Based on the article, what approximate total figure is stated for U.S. spending on antimissile goals, despite the initiative’s historical beginnings under a previous administration?**  
The article states "Stephen I. Schwartz, an independent consultant... estimates that over the decades the United States has spent more than $400 billion on the kind of antimissile goals that Mr. Trump now says..." So the figure is $400 billion.

16. **Within the context of countering fast-moving missile threats mentioned in the article, which proposed countermeasure is identified as being developed specifically to detect and intercept these weapons?**  
The article mentions "space-based sensors to detect hypersonic missiles" and "space-based interceptors" as part of the plan. So the countermeasure is space-based interceptors or sensors. The question asks for the specific one developed. The answer is "space-based interceptors" as per Karako's comment.

17. **By simultaneously accelerating antimissile developments and suspending counternuclear programs, what single vulnerability does the article suggest the United States might be risking?**  
The article says the combination is a "terrible trade-off" because it neglects nuclear terrorism and other threats. The vulnerability is "nuclear terrorism" or "attacks via other means". The answer is "nuclear terrorism" or the broader "attacks via other forms (e.g., nuclear terrorism, bioterrorism, cyberattacks)". The question asks for the single vulnerability mentioned. The article states: "the threat of nuclear terrorism and blackmail with an atomic bomb... seen as far bigger than an enemy firing a single missile...". So the vulnerability is "nuclear terrorism".

18. **If the administration’s plan had moved forward without judicial intervention, which unique Russian weapon—described for its capability to cross oceans—might the new defense system have targeted?**  
The article mentions "an undersea autonomous nuclear torpedo that can cross oceans to hit the West Coast". So the answer is "undersea autonomous nuclear torpedo".

19. **When comparing different interception challenges, what term does the article use to describe the slow speed of the missiles that the Israeli defense system successfully intercepts relative to intercontinental warheads?**  
The article says "small missiles that move at a snail's pace compared with the blinding speeds of intercontinental warheads". The term is "snail's pace".

20. **Which defense system name, also used for a successful Israeli missile shield, is repurposed in Trump’s executive order despite the article noting significant operational differences between the two systems?**  
The article states Trump's order mentions "Iron Dome", which is the Israeli system's name. So the answer is "Iron Dome".
