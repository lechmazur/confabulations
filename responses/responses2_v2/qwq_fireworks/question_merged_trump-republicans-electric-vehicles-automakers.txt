Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly. Let's go step by step.

1. **Question 1:** Which Chinese automaker's success in producing 4.3 million vehicles prompted Honda to accelerate its Ohio factory timeline?

Looking through the article, there's a mention of BYD producing 4.3 million vehicles. The part about Honda accelerating Ohio's timeline isn't directly linked to BYD's success. The article says Honda will begin producing electric cars in Ohio later this year but doesn't connect it to BYD. So maybe this is a trick question. The answer is N/A because the article doesn't state that BYD's success caused Honda's acceleration.

2. **Question 2:** How many electric vehicle charging stations did Hyundai install at its new Savannah facility to support the Ioniq 5 production?

The article mentions Hyundai's new factory in Savannah but doesn't specify the number of charging stations installed there. The 12,000 chargers added in 2024 are nationwide, not specific to the factory. So answer N/A.

3. **Question 3:** What percentage decrease in electric vehicle sales did Cox Automotive project would occur if both federal and state incentives were eliminated simultaneously?

The article says that when Germany slashed incentives, sales plunged 27%. However, the question is about projections from Cox Automotive. The text mentions a study by professors projecting a drop of over 300,000 vehicles, but Cox's own projection isn't stated. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** According to SAP's automotive business unit, what software features in Chinese electric vehicles contributed to their 50% market share achievement?

The article states that Chinese cars have software features hard to install in gasoline cars. SAP's Hagen Heubach mentions this as a reason buyers focused on advantages after price parity. So the answer is software features.

5. **Question 5:** How much did Tesla's partnership with Elon Musk influence the Republican stance on maintaining battery manufacturing subsidies?

The article notes Trump's inner circle includes Musk, but it's unclear how much influence he had. The text says Republicans plan to eliminate subsidies, but Musk's stance is mentioned as supporting repeal. The article doesn't quantify his influence, so N/A.

6. **Question 6:** What role did Albert Gore III's Zero Emission Transportation Association play in establishing the current lithium supply chain agreements with China?

Gore mentions that mining companies rely on demand commitments from automakers. The article doesn't state his organization's direct role in agreements with China. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** How many jobs were lost in Tennessee, Kentucky, and South Carolina's automotive sector when the first round of EV tax credits expired?

The article says Republicans might not repeal all policies because they support factories in those states, but there's no mention of job losses when credits expired. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** What percentage of Deloitte survey respondents who expressed range anxiety owned vehicles that regularly traveled more than 200 miles per day?

The Deloitte survey says nearly half worried about range, but it's noted that most people rarely travel over 60 miles. The question asks for the percentage of those with range anxiety who drive over 200 daily. The text doesn't provide this exact data. Answer N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Which automotive manufacturing jobs program did Mike Johnson propose to replace the eliminated EV mandates?

The article states Johnson wants to end EV mandates but doesn't mention a specific jobs program replacement. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** What metrics did General Motors use to determine that their electric vehicles would become cheaper than internal combustion engines?

The article quotes GM's Kurt Kelty aiming for lower costs but doesn't specify the metrics used. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Which two automakers lost eligibility for federal tax credits on January 1st due to sourcing requirements for semiconductor components rather than battery materials, according to the Inflation Reduction Act's updated provisions?

The article mentions Volkswagen ID.4 and Ford Mustang Mach-E losing eligibility due to component sourcing, but it specifies battery materials, not semiconductors. The exact cause here isn't stated as semiconductors, so N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Which U.S. military installation housing migrants with suspected gang affiliations was retrofitted with EV charging infrastructure using Inflation Reduction Act funds?

The article mentions Guantanamo Bay holding migrants but doesn't link it to EV charging funded by the Act. So N/A.
