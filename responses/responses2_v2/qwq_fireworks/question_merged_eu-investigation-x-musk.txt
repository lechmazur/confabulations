Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information from the text and not rely on any external knowledge. Let's start with the first question.

1. The first question asks what percentage of global revenue Mark Zuckerberg suggested as the maximum fine for non-compliance with the Digital Services Act. The article mentions that the DSA allows fines up to 6% of global revenue, and Zuckerberg criticized the EU when he announced changes to Meta's fact-checking. But the text doesn't say he proposed a specific percentage as a counter. So the answer is N/A.

2. The second question is about Elon Musk proposing an alternative regulatory body mirroring the First Amendment. The article states Musk and Vance criticized EU laws as censorship but doesn't mention a specific proposed body. So N/A again.

3. The third question asks what type of content beyond hate speech and misinformation Henna Virkkunen cited to protect religious groups. The article says EU officials see some speech restrictions as necessary to protect religious and ethnic minorities, but the exact content isn't specified. So N/A.

4. The fourth question asks the month X's legal team projected the investigation would conclude before the document preservation order. The text mentions the order to preserve until the end of the year but doesn't state the original projected month. N/A.

5. The fifth question is about another legislation related to Bill Gates and the free speech divide. The article mentions D.E.I. retreats and Trump's policies but doesn't link another law to Gates. N/A.

6. The sixth question is about what aspect beyond the algorithm regulators demanded access to. The article says they asked for content moderation policies and data on why content goes viral. So the answer is content moderation policies.

7. The seventh question asks for the medical procedure similar to the blood filter mentioned in relation to X's policies. The article references the blood filter in Antigua but doesn't link it to X's policies. N/A.

8. The eighth question is another country mentioned regarding circumventing regulations. The article only mentions Antigua in that context. N/A.

9. The ninth question about the governmental role held by a critic influencing the EU's decision. The article mentions VP-elect JD Vance criticizing EU laws, so his role is Vice President-elect.

10. The tenth question is the hedge fund behind DeepSeek. The article says DeepSeek was the brainchild of a hedge fund, so the answer is the hedge fund's name isn't given, so N/A.

11. The eleventh question asks which platform owned by a billionaire with Trump ties is under scrutiny. The answer is X, owned by Musk, who's close to Trump.

12. The twelfth question is the legislative measure allowing fines. The Digital Services Act is mentioned, so that's the answer.

13. The thirteenth question about documents mandated for preservation. The article says regulators ordered X to preserve internal documents related to the probe, so the answer is internal documents.

14. The fourteenth question's personal connection is Musk's ties to Trump's administration.

15. The fifteenth question's network highlighting the trans-Atlantic conflict is X's investigation.

16. The executive from the European Commission is Henna Virkkunen.

17. The other tech company under investigation besides X is Meta (Facebook/Instagram).

18. The central issue the probe highlights is free speech regulation differences between US and EU.

19. The deadline for preserving data is the end of the year.

20. The policy change triggering the probe was Musk scaling back content moderation, leading to the EU investigation.
