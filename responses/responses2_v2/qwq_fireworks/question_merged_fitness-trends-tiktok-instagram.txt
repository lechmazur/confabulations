Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and answer each exactly as per the instructions. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and cross-referencing with the article.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about the aspect of physical fitness improved by the "75 Hard" challenge according to Rae Reichlin. Wait, the article mentions Rae Reichlin discussing spot reduction, not the "75 Hard" challenge. The "75 Hard" was discussed by Victoria Sekely. So maybe this is a mix-up. The question is incorrect because Rae Reichlin isn't linked to the "75 Hard" challenge. So the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Victoria Sekely's recommendation for full-body strength training. The article says Robyn LaLonde suggests twice a week. But the question attributes this to Victoria Sekely. Since Sekely talks about the "75 Hard" being unsustainable but doesn't mention strength training frequency, the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Meghann Featherstun on water consumption for zone two training. The "75 Hard" required a gallon of water, but Meghann's comments were about diet posts leading to disordered eating. The question links her to water for zone two, which isn't in the text. N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Dr. Comander on cold plunges' primary benefit. The article says cold plunges are claimed to help with recovery, immune system, etc., but she says more research is needed. The primary benefit she mentions isn't stated; she says do it if it feels good. N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Train Smart Run Strong's founder (Victoria Sekely) on reading for mental toughness in "75 Hard". The challenge requires reading nonfiction. Since Sekely criticizes the challenge but the question is about what reading material is beneficial per her, maybe the answer is nonfiction. Wait, the "75 Hard" requires 10 pages of nonfiction. Sekely says it's unsustainable, but the question is asking what the founder recommends. Since Sekely is the founder, but she's against the challenge, maybe she doesn't endorse it. So the answer would be N/A because she criticizes the challenge, not promoting the reading part.

6. **Question 6**: Dr. Sekely's cautioned metric influenced by dietary recommendations. The article says Sekely warns against data dictating your day, but the question ties it to dietary advice from Ladies Who Lift (Reichlin). Not directly linked. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Dr. Comander's recommended workout frequency for targeted weight loss. The article says spot reduction isn't possible; instead, full-body strength. She advises against quick fixes. The "recommended frequency" isn't specified except for strength training twice a week by LaLonde. Since the question asks for Comander's advice, maybe N/A, unless the general advice is "regular habit". But the exact frequency isn't given by her. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Equipment for cold-water benefits. The article mentions cold plunges, but Wirecutter's recommendations are about home gym items like pull-up bars. The question asks for equipment to replicate cold-water benefits, but the article doesn't mention any specific equipment for that. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The "75 Hard" challenge was criticized by Sekely for two workouts a day. The article states this, so answer is "75 Hard".

10. **Question 10**: LaLonde's alternative for no equipment. She says you can do strength training at home with little/no equipment, so the answer is "home workouts with little/no equipment".

11. **Question 11**: Dr. Comander's reason for cold plunge. She did it as a social activity, so the answer is "social activity".

12. **Question 12**: Heart rate zones mentioned by McKirdy. The text says "five heart rate zones", so answer is 5.

13. **Question 13**: Exercise linked to aerobic capacity with caution on devices. Zone two training (endurance, aerobic capacity) but cautioned by McKirdy and Larson about relying on devices. So "zone two training".

14. **Question 14**: Arizona-affiliated expert advising conversational pace. James McKirdy is in Flagstaff, AZ. He says aim for a pace where you can talk. So answer is "James McKirdy".

15. **Question 15**: Max weekly strength sessions without equipment. LaLonde says twice a week. The question asks for "maximum number" but the article says "twice a week", so answer is 2.

16. **Question 16**: Recovery method with unproven benefits. Cold plunges' claims about inflammation and depression are unsupported. So "cold plunges".

17. **Question 17**: Dietary guidance from Ohio dietitian. Meghann Featherstun advises against comparing to influencers and suggests consulting a nutritionist. So answer: "consult a nutritionist/sports dietitian".

Now, checking each answer against the text to ensure accuracy. Some required careful reading to avoid mixing up experts and their statements. Let's list them properly.
