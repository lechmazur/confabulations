Okay, let me start going through each question one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information given in the article and answer strictly based on that. 

Question 1: "How many millions in capital gains did Ramaswamy report on his tax returns in 2021 after selling his stake in Merit Airlines?" 

First, I need to check if the article mentions Merit Airlines and capital gains for 2021. The article says that in 2020, Ramaswamy sold some Roivant stock and reported nearly $175 million in capital gains that year. Merit Airlines was one of the ideas they considered but didn't pursue. The article doesn't mention anything about Merit Airlines being sold or capital gains in 2021. So the answer should be N/A.

Question 2: "Which governor did Ramaswamy convince to move their state's pension fund entirely from BlackRock to Strive's DRLL fund?" 

The article mentions that only the Texas pension fund invested briefly in Strive's ETF but then withdrew. It doesn't say any governor was convinced to move entirely. So the answer is N/A.

Question 3: "What was the name of the Alzheimer's drug that generated $1.3 billion in value for Axovant before its clinical trial results?" 

The article states that Axovant's stock lost over $1.3B after a trial failure. The drug isn't named, so N/A.

Question 4: "During which month in 2022 did Ramaswamy meet with Larry Fink to discuss BlackRock's ESG policies at the Polo Lounge?" 

The article mentions a meeting with D.A. Wallach at the Polo Lounge in 2020, not Larry Fink. The meeting with Fink isn't mentioned here. So N/A.

Question 5: "How much did Strive's assets under management increase after Ramaswamy's karaoke performance at the Iowa State Fair?" 

The article says he performed at the Iowa State Fair, but there's no mention of asset changes post that event. So N/A.

Question 6: "What percentage of Chevron's total emissions did the company agree to cap after receiving Ramaswamy's critical letter?" 

The article says Chevron set goals but didn't cap emissions overall. So no percentage given. N/A.

Question 7: "Which Trump administration official first suggested the name 'Department of Government Efficiency' for the DOGE initiative?" 

The article refers to DOGE as the Department of Government Efficiency but doesn't mention who suggested the name. N/A.

Question 8: "What was the value of the Bitcoin holdings that Strive acquired from the Dallas firm they purchased?" 

The article mentions Strive acquired a Dallas firm's leadership team, moving into crypto, but doesn't state Bitcoin's value. N/A.

Question 9: "How many employees did Strive lay off after building their new office space for 100 people?" 

The office was built for 100 but they had 35 employees. The article doesn't mention layoffs. N/A.

Question 10: "What return on investment did the Texas pension fund achieve during their brief investment in Strive's ETFs?" 

The article mentions Texas had a brief investment but no ROI figures. N/A.

Question 11: "Which two specific energy companies did Strive successfully pressure to appoint board members aligned with its anti-E.S.G. agenda through direct meetings with executives?" 

The article says Exxon appointed two Strive-backed board members after a meeting. Chevron isn't mentioned as appointing. So only Exxon is named. Since the question asks for two, but only one is mentioned, N/A.

Question 12: "What specific regulatory loophole did Ramaswamy exploit to shield himself from financial losses during Axovant's stock collapse, as mentioned in the article's description of Roivant's corporate structure?" 

The article says Roivant's structure allowed them to weather the storm, but doesn't specify a loophole. It mentions a "savvy way he structured companies". Since no specific loophole name is given, N/A.
