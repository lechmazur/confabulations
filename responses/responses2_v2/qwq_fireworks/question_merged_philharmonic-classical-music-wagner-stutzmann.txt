Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. 

1. **Question 1**: Which specific piece from Wagner's Ring cycle did Talise Trevigne perform as her solo at David Geffen Hall?  
   The article mentions Talise Trevigne sang a cantata titled "Jauchzet Gott in allen Landen." But wait, the performance at David Geffen Hall was about "The 'Ring' Without Words," while Talise's part was at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine. The question asks for David Geffen Hall, but she performed at the Cathedral. So the answer here is N/A because the solo at David Geffen Hall isn't specified for her.

2. **Question 2**: How many minutes longer was Maazel's original 1987 recording compared to the performance conducted by Stutzmann?  
   The article states Maazel's arrangement is 70 minutes. There's no mention of Stutzmann's performance duration differing, so unless there's a comparison, it's N/A.

3. **Question 3**: What was the attendance figure at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine performance that made it more intimate than the Geffen Hall concert?  
   The article doesn't provide specific attendance numbers for either venue. It just says the church is better suited for chamber music, but no figures. N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Which movement from Bach's Musical Offering did Leon Kosavic perform before the quartet's rendition?  
   The quartet played the "Sonata sopra il Soggetto Reale" from the Musical Offering. The article mentions Kosavic sang in "Ich will den Kreuzstab gerne tragen," which is a cantata, not part of the Musical Offering. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: What was the controversial comment about musician work ethic that Stutzmann made in her New York Times interview two years ago?  
   The text says she made a "jokey comment" that the musicians twisted into a criticism of their work ethic, but the exact comment isn't quoted. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: How many CD recordings did Telarc release of Maazel's Ring arrangement between 1987 and the early 2000s?  
   The article mentions Telarc commissioned it in the late '80s, but doesn't specify the number of releases. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: What tempo marking did Stutzmann use for the opening of Das Rheingold that made it notably different from Maazel's original interpretation?  
   The article says Stutzmann's performance was "squareness rather than timelessness" in the Rheingold beginning. No specific tempo marking like "adagio" is mentioned. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Which member of the quartet received a standing ovation for their harpsichord cadenza during the Bach performance?  
   The quartet members are listed, but there's no mention of a standing ovation for any individual. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: What was the duration of the reverb decay in St. John the Divine that affected Kosavic's softer passages?  
   The article mentions the acoustics are "reverberant," but no specific decay time is given. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: How many musicians from the original 1987 premiere of The Ring Without Words were present in the orchestra for this performance?  
    No info on the original premiere's musicians or their presence now. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: What specific comment did Nathalie Stutzmann make during her Metropolitan Opera debut that directly led to the orchestra musicians publicly criticizing her on social media before the Philharmonic performance?  
    The article states she made a "jokey comment" in a NYT preview that was misinterpreted, but the exact words aren't provided. N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Which instrumental section's unsteady entrances during the "Ride of the Valkyries" were attributed to the reverberant acoustics of David Geffen Hall in the final performance of "The 'Ring' Without Words"?  
    The text says "some unsteady entrances and transitions" but doesn't link them to acoustics. It mentions brass intonation issues, but not specifically for "Ride of the Valkyries." N/A.

13. **Question 13**: What role did the Telarc label's involvement play in the New York Philharmonic's decision to commission Lorin Maazel's "The 'Ring' Without Words" for their 2024 season under Stutzmann?  
    The commission was done in 1987 at Telarc's behest, but the Philharmonic's 2024 decision isn't mentioned. N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Which soloist's performance in "Ich will den Kreuzstab gerne tragen" was noted for its contrast with the "brightly florid" style of the "Ride of the Valkyries" due to the Cathedral Church's acoustics?  
    Leon Kosavic sang that cantata, and the article contrasts his softer singing with Trevigne's "brightly florid." The answer is Leon Kosavic.

15. **Question 15**: What specific transition between "Die Walküre" and "Götterdämmerung" in "The 'Ring' Without Words" did the Philharmonic's strings fail to execute seamlessly during Siegfried's funeral march?  
    The article mentions the transition from Walkure's storm to the sword forging, but the strings' issue was in Siegfried's funeral march. No specific transition between those operas is noted here. N/A.

16. **Question 16**: Which historical period of Baroque interpretation does the article suggest Stutzmann revived during the "Ride of the Valkyries" to counteract the Philharmonic's "squareness" in Wagner?  
    The article says her Bach performance was "old-fashioned... before spikier, faster Baroque interpretation became the norm." So the period is the pre-Baroque revival era, but the exact period isn't named. N/A.
