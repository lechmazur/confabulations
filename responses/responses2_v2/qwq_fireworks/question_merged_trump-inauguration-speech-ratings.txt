Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the provided article and follow the strict instructions. Let me start with the first question.

1. **Question 1**: The percentage increase in Fox News viewership between 2017 and 2024. The article says Fox's viewership in 2024 was "roughly in line with its 2017 viewership." Since it's "in line," there's no increase. So the answer is N/A because no percentage is given, and the text says it's about the same.

2. **Question 2**: The time difference between Biden's 2021 speech and Trump's 2024 address based on Nielsen's windows. The article mentions the time slots for Trump's 2024 coverage as 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. Eastern. For Biden's 2021, it doesn't specify the exact time window. Since the duration isn't provided for Biden's, can't calculate the difference. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Which social media platforms caused the decline. The article states that the drop in TV viewership is due to people turning to "websites, social media, and other digital platforms." It doesn't name specific platforms, so N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Total digital viewership during Trump's 2024 inauguration. The article doesn't provide numbers for digital platforms, only mentions the shift to them. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Number of news organizations receiving payments per Trump's claims. The article says Trump claimed the government paid Politico and "other news media outlets." It mentions "agencies paid for subscriptions," but the exact number isn't stated. Since it's plural but not specified how many, N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Percentage of NYT subscribers who watched via digital. The article says NYT has 11.4 million digital subscribers, but there's no info on how many watched the inauguration. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: When Lara Trump discussed "patriotic economy." The article mentions Trump Media's investment products in the "patriotic economy" but doesn't specify the show's segment. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Content of Harris's statements in the interview. The FCC released the transcript, but the article doesn't detail what she said. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Viewers switching from CNN to Fox. The article gives CNN's drop from 10M to 1.7M, but doesn't track individual viewers switching. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Nielsen's role in social media engagement for viewership figures. The article says Nielsen's data is about TV networks, not social media. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Percentage of Fox's Golden Globes viewership that MSNBC got. Fox had 10.3M, MSNBC had 848K. The question asks for percentage of Fox's 9.3M (from Golden Globes) that MSNBC got (848K). Wait, the Fox viewership during the inauguration was 10.3M, but the Golden Globes had 9.3M. So (848,000 / 9,300,000)*100 ≈ 9.12%. Rounded to nearest whole number, 9%. Wait, but the question is asking for MSNBC's viewers during the same time slot (11:30-1pm) as the inauguration. The article says MSNBC had 848K, while Fox's Golden Globes had 9.3M. So the percentage is (848,000 / 9,300,000)*100 ≈ 9%. So answer is 9%.

Wait, but the question says "percentage of Fox News's Golden Globes viewership did MSNBC attract during the same time slot". So yes, that's correct. So answer is 9%.

12. **Question 12**: Hypothetical viewers for Lara's show. Assume similar drop as CNN's from 2021 to 2024. CNN had 10M in 2021 to 1.7M in 2024, so a drop of 8.3M. If Lara's show aired during the same slot, but using the same time, perhaps assuming Fox's viewership is the base? Wait, the question says if Lara's show had aired during the 11:30-1pm slot, and assuming a similar viewership drop as CNN. Wait, CNN's drop was from 10M to 1.7M. So the drop is (10M -1.7M)=8.3M. But the question says "assuming a similar viewership drop as CNN experienced". So if Lara's show hypothetically had the same viewers as CNN in 2021 (10M), then subtract the same percentage drop? Wait, maybe better to calculate the percentage drop CNN had and apply it to Fox's 2024 viewers. Wait the question is a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe it's assuming Lara's show would have started with Fox's 2024 viewers (10.3M) and then experienced the same drop percentage as CNN. Let me recheck the question: "how many viewers would her show have attracted?" Assuming Lara's show is on Fox, but the question might be comparing to MSNBC? Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous, but maybe the user wants to take the 2021 CNN viewers (10M) and apply the same drop rate. Alternatively, perhaps the question is saying if Lara's show had the same initial viewers as CNN's 2021 (10M) and then the same drop (like CNN's 2024 viewers, 1.7M). But the question says "assuming a similar viewership drop as CNN experienced between Biden's and Trump's inaugurations". So the drop for CNN was from 10M to 1.7M. The drop is 83% decrease (since 1.7 is 17% of 10). So if Lara's show had started at Fox's 2024 viewers (10.3M) but that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the question is saying if Lara's show were on the same time slot (11:30-1pm), which was when Fox had 10.3M. But the hypothetical is if it had the same viewership as CNN's previous, but I'm confused. Alternatively, maybe the question wants to take the 2021 MSNBC viewers (6.5M) and apply the same drop as CNN (from 10M to 1.7M). Wait, the question says "assuming a similar viewership drop as CNN experienced between Biden's and Trump's inaugurations". So CNN's viewers dropped from 10M to 1.7M, so a decrease of 8.3M. If Lara's show (assuming it's on Fox, but maybe it's on another network?), but the question is unclear. The problem is that without clear parameters, this might be N/A, but maybe the answer expects calculation. Wait, the question says "assuming a similar viewership drop as CNN experienced between Biden's and Trump's inaugurations". So the drop percentage for CNN is (10M -1.7M)/10M = 83% decrease. If Lara's show were to start with the same viewership as CNN had in 2021 (10M), then after the same drop, it would be 1.7M. But the article doesn't say Lara's show's viewership, so maybe the question is asking if Lara's show had been on during the same time as the inauguration (so the same time slot as the inauguration's coverage), which Fox had 10.3M. But the hypothetical is "assuming a similar viewership drop as CNN experienced". Since CNN's drop was from 10M to 1.7M, so 1.7M. So answer is 1.7 million? But the question says "how many viewers would her show have attracted?" So the answer would be 1,700,000? But the article doesn't mention Lara's show's viewership. Hmm, perhaps this is a trick question and since the info isn't there, but the question might require the calculation. Wait the question is: "If Lara Trump's new show had aired during the 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. Eastern time slot on the day of the inauguration, and assuming a similar viewership drop as CNN experienced between Biden's and Trump's inaugurations, how many viewers would her show have hypothetically attracted?" So if the show aired during that slot, and assuming Lara's show would have started with the same viewers as CNN had in 2021 (10M) and then the same drop (to 1.7M), then 1.7 million. But maybe the question is considering that the time slot's viewership for that show would be similar to CNN's drop. Alternatively, maybe the question is comparing to MSNBC's drop? The question is unclear, but since the only numbers given are for CNN and MSNBC, perhaps the answer is 1.7 million. But since the question says "similar viewership drop as CNN", then yes. So answer is 1,700,000. But the article doesn't explicitly state that Lara's show would have those viewers, but based on the hypothetical, maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is N/A because the premise is hypothetical and not in the article. Wait the instructions say to answer based on the article, so if the article doesn't have the data to calculate, it's N/A. Since the hypothetical requires assuming the starting point, but the article only gives the result of CNN's drop, not the starting point for Lara's show. So maybe N/A. Hmm. I'll go with N/A because it's a hypothetical not supported by article data.

13. **Question 13**: The primary subject of the lawsuit between CBS and the president. The article says the FCC released the transcript of Harris's interview that's at the center of a lawsuit between CBS and Trump. The lawsuit is between CBS and Trump, so the subject is the "60 Minutes" interview transcript. So the answer is the content of the interview, but the question asks for the primary subject. The article states it's about the interview, so answer is the "60 Minutes" interview transcript.

14. **Question 14**: What financial service did Politico report was offered by the government? The article says Politico reported that Trump Media is positioning itself as a financial services firm offering investment products in the "patriotic economy". The question asks what specific financial service was falsely attributed to government payments. The government payments were for subscriptions, not the investment products. The question is phrased as "what type of investment product... was falsely attributed to government payments for positive coverage?" The false claim by Trump is that the government paid for positive coverage, which involved subscriptions. The investment products are from Trump Media, not related to the payments. So the answer is N/A because the investment products aren't the subject of the false claim. The false claim is about payments for coverage, not the investment products. So the financial service mentioned in relation to Trump Media is the investment products, but the question asks what was falsely attributed to government payments. The government payments were for subscriptions, so the answer is subscriptions. Wait the question says "what specific financial service, mentioned in relation to Trump Media, did Politico report was offered by the government to news outlets?" Wait, the article says "Trump's social media company is moving to position itself as a financial services firm that will allow his supporters to put money into investment products geared to what the company has called the 'patriotic economy.'" So the financial service from Trump Media is the investment products. But the question is asking what the government offered, according to Politico's report? The article says "Trump Media: Trump's social media company is moving..." so the financial service is the investment products. But the question says "what specific financial service... did Politico report was offered by the government to news outlets?" The government's part is paying for subscriptions, not investment products. So the question is mixing up. Since the question says "mentioned in relation to Trump Media", the answer is the investment products. But the question's phrasing is confusing. Alternatively, the answer is N/A because the government didn't offer the investment products; the false claim was about payments for coverage, not financial services. So the answer is N/A.

15. **Question 15**: NYT subscribers at the previous inauguration (2021). The article says NYT had 11.4M after adding 350K in the last quarter. Assuming constant rate, need to know the time between the last quarter and the previous inauguration. But the article doesn't specify when the quarter ended or when the previous inauguration was (2021). Without dates, can't calculate. So N/A.

16. **Question 16**: Additional subscribers if peak viewers matched Biden's. The article says if peak viewers were 40M (Biden's) instead of 34.4M, and assuming a direct correlation with the 350K added. The difference in viewers is 5.6M (40-34.4). But the question says "direct correlation", so maybe the 350K is proportional. But since the question is hypothetical and the article doesn't state a correlation, it's N/A.

17. **Question 17**: Investment product falsely attributed to government payments. The false claim was about payments for positive coverage, not the investment products. The investment products are from Trump Media, unrelated. So N/A.

18. **Question 18**: Unfounded claim about payments to outlets for coverage of the "60 Minutes" interview. The article says Trump claimed the government paid Politico and others for positive coverage of Democrats. The "60 Minutes" interview is a separate matter, but the lawsuit is about that interview's transcript. The claim related to payments is about coverage of Democrats, not the interview. So the unfounded claim regarding the interview's coverage isn't mentioned. The question is about payments related to the "60 Minutes" interview. The article doesn't link Trump's claims about payments to the interview specifically. So N/A.

19. **Question 19**: Name of the show hosted by a close relative contributing to TV decline. The article mentions Lara Trump's new weekend show on Fox News. So the name is her show, but the article doesn't name it. It just says "a new weekend show". So N/A.

20. **Question 20**: Percentage decrease for CNN between two inaugurations. 2021: 10M viewers, 2024: 1.7M. The decrease is 8.3M from 10M. (8.3/10)*100 = 83% decrease. Rounded to nearest whole number is 83%. So answer is 83.
