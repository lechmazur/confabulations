Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to be careful to answer based solely on the text and follow the instructions strictly. Let me go through each question step by step.

1. The first question asks which retired editor from Global Times argued that U.S. semiconductor restrictions forced Chinese companies to achieve breakthroughs in A.I. model training efficiency using only 500 Nvidia chips? Looking at the article, the retired editor mentioned is Hu Xijin from Global Times. The article says he wrote that U.S. sanctions might backfire and spur progress. The part about 500 chips might be a typo since the article mentions DeepSeek used 2,000 Nvidia chips. But the question specifically asks about the editor, so the answer is Hu Xijin.

2. The second question is about a company whose stock surge caused Nvidia to halt exports. The article mentions that DeepSeek's announcement "tanked the stock market on Monday." It also mentions OpenAI possibly talking to SoftBank for $25B, but there's no mention of a company's stock surge causing Nvidia to stop exports. So this might be N/A. Wait, the article says "the claim about DeepSeek's success was viewed in China as a shot in the arm... sent Silicon Valley into a panic." But the question is about a company's stock surge leading to Nvidia halting exports. The article doesn't mention this, so N/A.

3. Third question: Which Chinese leader did Liang meet during Lunar New Year in Guangdong? The article mentions a hashtag about Liang visiting his hometown in Guangdong for Lunar New Year with over 50 million views. The article doesn't name the leader he met. The only Chinese leader mentioned is Li Qiang, the premier, whom Liang met in a meeting. But that's separate from the Lunar New Year visit. The question is about the Lunar New Year, so maybe it's the premier? Wait, the meeting with Li Qiang was separate from the hometown visit. The article says the hometown visit was part of the Lunar New Year, but the leader he met there isn't named. So the answer is N/A because the article doesn't specify the leader's name during the hometown visit. Wait, the article says "a hashtag about the DeepSeek chief executive, Liang Wenfeng, visiting his hometown in southern Guangdong Province for the Lunar New Year, which falls on Wednesday, was a hot topic on Weibo. It had more than 50 million views." There's no mention of meeting a leader there. So N/A.

4. Fourth question: When did DeepSeek's chatbot start censoring Hong Kong protests? The article mentions users posting screenshots showing censorship of topics like Xi Jinping, Ukraine war, Cultural Revolution, Tiananmen. But there's no specific date given. So N/A.

5. Fifth question: The $200 billion initiative called "Interstellar Graveyard"? The article says Fancaiju called DeepSeek's breakthrough turning Trump's $100B Stargate into "Interstellar Graveyard." The question says $200B, but the article states $100B. Since the number is different, maybe it's a trick. The answer would be Stargate, but the amount is wrong. Since the question specifies $200B, which isn't in the text, answer N/A.

6. Sixth question: Which university did Kaifu Lee attend? The article says Kaifu Lee studied at Carnegie Mellon in the 1980s. So answer Carnegie Mellon University.

7. Seventh question: Which historical event besides Tibet independence and Xi's wealth was censored? The article lists the Cultural Revolution and Tiananmen Square massacre. So the answer is Cultural Revolution or Tiananmen Square massacre. But the question says "sensitive historical event" alongside those two. The answer is either of those. The question lists three topics, so the third is one of them. The user needs to pick one. Wait, the question says "sensitive historical event did DeepSeek's chatbot refuse to discuss... alongside Tibet independence and Xi Jinping's family wealth?" The article mentions the topics censored include Xi, Ukraine war, Cultural Revolution, Tiananmen. The three listed in the question are Tibet independence (not mentioned?), but the article's examples are the ones listed. Wait, the user's question mentions "Tibet independence and Xi Jinping's family wealth"—so the other one is either Cultural Revolution or Tiananmen. The question asks for the third one. The answer should be Cultural Revolution or Tiananmen Square massacre. The article lists both, so maybe either is acceptable. Let me check the exact wording: "censor topics including Xi Jinping, the war in Ukraine, the Cultural Revolution and the Tiananmen Square massacre." So the three in the question's context would include Cultural Revolution and Tiananmen. The question's example includes Tibet independence, which isn't in the article's list. Wait, the question says "alongside Tibet independence and Xi's family wealth"—but the article doesn't mention Tibet independence. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake. The article mentions the four topics: Xi, Ukraine, Cultural Revolution, Tiananmen. The question's example lists Tibet and Xi's wealth. Since the article doesn't mention Tibet, perhaps the correct answer from the article is Cultural Revolution or Tiananmen. But the question lists "Tibet independence and Xi's family wealth" as the other two, so the third is either of the other two. The answer should be Cultural Revolution or Tiananmen Square massacre. The question asks for one, so pick one. The article lists them together, so maybe the answer is "the Cultural Revolution" or "Tiananmen Square massacre". Since the question allows either, but the user might expect one of them. Let's go with Tiananmen Square massacre as it's a sensitive event.

8. Eighth question: Which HR expert from Google claimed Tsinghua graduates dominate OpenAI's teams? The article mentions Tom Zhang, a HR expert from Silicon Valley companies, saying Tsinghua and Peking graduates outshine Stanford/MIT. But it doesn't mention Google specifically. The question says "previously employed at Google", but the article just says "worked at several big tech companies in Silicon Valley". Since Google isn't specified, answer N/A.

9. Ninth question: What percentage of DeepSeek's funding came from SoftBank's $25B? The article mentions OpenAI talking to SoftBank for $25B, but nothing about DeepSeek's funding. So N/A.

10. Tenth question: Which employee has a PhD in quantum computing and wrote on censorship-resistant AI? The article mentions employees' names and backgrounds but doesn't specify someone with a quantum computing PhD. The only specific mention is Liang's team having young graduates from Chinese universities. So N/A.

11. Eleventh question: Which startup used 2,000 Nvidia chips vs. 16,000? The article says DeepSeek used 2,000, and the U.S. counterparts used up to 16,000. So answer is DeepSeek.

12. Twelfth question: Which geeky billionaire with a master's in AI and quantitative background started the project? The article describes Liang Wenfeng as a geeky billionaire with a master's in AI who founded a quantitative firm and started DeepSeek as a side project. So Liang Wenfeng.

13. Thirteenth question: Which company's CEO's hometown visit had 50M views? The article mentions Liang Wenfeng's visit, so DeepSeek.

14. Fourteenth question: Which hardware component's usage shows cost efficiency (2k vs 16k)? The article mentions Nvidia chips: "DeepSeek trained its A.I. chatbot with 2,000 specialized Nvidia chips, compared with as many as the 16,000 chips used by leading American counterparts." So answer is Nvidia chips.

15. Fifteenth question: Which government regulation requires A.I. to filter content? The article says "A.I. models that serve consumers are subject to censorship rules." The answer is censorship rules.

16. Sixteenth question: Which entrepreneur argues economic slowdown encourages innovation? The article quotes Liang Wenfeng saying China's slowdown could force founders to focus on innovation instead of quick money. So Liang Wenfeng.

17. Seventeenth question: Which homegrown graduates outperform Stanford/MIT? The article mentions Tsinghua and Peking graduates outshining Stanford/MIT. So Tsinghua and Peking University graduates.

18. Eighteenth question: Which country's export restrictions forced efficiency? The article says U.S. restrictions on Nvidia chips forced Chinese companies to be efficient. So United States.

19. Nineteenth question: Which initiative by a former president became "Interstellar Graveyard"? The article mentions Trump's Stargate initiative. So Stargate.

20. Twentieth question: Which WeChat blog compared to Soros's 1992 move? Fancaiju's post compared to Soros's bet on British pound. So Fancaiju.
