Okay, let me start by going through each question one by one and see what the article says.

1. The first question asks about an initiative proposed by the person who appealed to Trump on TikTok, similar to Project Achilles but focused on international aid. The article mentions Project Achilles as a TikTok initiative, and the person who appealed to Trump was Shou Chew. But the question is about an initiative related to USAID. Wait, the article's DEI section mentions Trump's call for USAID closure. However, the article doesn't say TikTok proposed anything related to USAID. The user might be conflating Trump's action with TikTok's actions. Since the article doesn't mention such an initiative by TikTok, the answer should be N/A.

2. The second question: How many days after the Supreme Court decision did the former president (Trump) suggest he'd grant an extension? The article says after the Supreme Court decision, TikTok appealed to Trump, and on Saturday, Trump indicated he'd give a 90-day extension. The Supreme Court decision was on Friday, so the next day (Saturday) would be 1 day after. So answer is 1 day?

Wait, the article says "on Saturday, the White House press secretary called TikTok's statement a stunt. And Mr. Trump indicated... that he would 'most likely' give a 90-day extension once he takes office on Monday." The Supreme Court decision was Friday. The next day is Saturday. The extension was mentioned the day after the decision, so 1 day later. So answer is 1?

3. The third question: Legal precedent from Montana's lawsuit invoked by the head of policy (Michael Beckerman) during Peru gathering. The article says Montana's law was overturned in federal court in November 2023. The precedent would be that the Montana law was ruled overreaching and violating the First Amendment. The article says TikTok's legal case against Montana prevailed. So the precedent is the Montana court ruling against the ban. But the question is what legal precedent was invoked by Beckerman. The article doesn't mention him citing any precedent, just that the Montana case was overturned. Maybe the answer is the Montana ruling? But the question is phrased as a legal precedent established during that lawsuit. The article says the court ruled in TikTok's favor, so the precedent might be that state laws banning TikTok are unconstitutional. But the exact name? The question is tricky. Since the article doesn't mention Beckerman invoking a specific precedent, perhaps N/A.

Wait the question says "the head of policy for the Americas invoke during the team gathering in Peru to justify the trip's timing?" The Peru trip was in October 2023, and the Montana ruling was in November. So timing-wise, maybe not. The article says the Peru trip was held in October, and the Montana ruling was in November. So perhaps the timing isn't related. The article doesn't mention any legal precedent being cited here, so maybe N/A.

4. Fourth question: The establishment analogized by Bethenny Frankel was a club. She said users are "club kids" and the club wouldn't be shut down, implying the club as the establishment. So the answer is "club".

5. Fifth question: The literary work popularized by BookTok mentioned by the bookstore owner (Emma Straub) was "The Song of Achilles" by Madeline Miller. The article says Emma Straub mentioned "The Song of Achilles" being popularized by BookTok. Project Achilles was the name of TikTok's internal project. So the answer is "The Song of Achilles".

6. Sixth question: The government agency facing closure due to Trump's call was USAID. The company that sponsored the Capitals is TikTok. The irony is that USAID was targeted by Trump, similar to TikTok's situation. So the answer is USAID.

7. Seventh question: The original destination for the Peru trip was Miami, but changed due to a hurricane. The article states that the Peru trip was originally to Miami but switched because of a hurricane. So the original destination was Miami.

8. Eighth question: The education app that Musical.ly's founders were working on before pivoting was mentioned. The founders ran out of funding for an education app and pivoted to Musical.ly. The article says "the founders had nearly run out of venture funding for an education app when they decided to pivot to D.I.Y. music videos." The name of the education app isn't given, so answer N/A.

9. Ninth question: The U.S.-based company supposed to assuage Trump's fears was TikTok Global. The article mentions "TikTok Global" as the new U.S. company in the deal with Trump. So answer is TikTok Global.

10. Tenth question: The event sponsored by TikTok where Chew was at two weeks after Biden signed the law was the Met Gala in 2024. The article says "two weeks after Mr. Biden signed the TikTok law, Mr. Chew and his wife joined dozens of celebrity guests at the 2024 Met Gala in Manhattan, which TikTok sponsored." So the event is the 2024 Met Gala.

11. Eleventh question: The event sponsored by TikTok in April 2024 with Marc D'Amelio. The article mentions that in 2021, Marc D'Amelio's family had a reality show, but the April 2024 event isn't mentioned. The article does mention sponsoring the Washington Capitals in September, and a headline sponsor event on Sunday (the ban date) for conservative influencers. The Met Gala was in 2024, but that was after the law was signed. The question is about April 2024. The article says in April 2024, the law was signed? Wait, the TikTok law was signed in April (April 2024?), but the Met Gala was in 2024. Wait the article says "two weeks after Mr. Biden signed the TikTok law, Mr. Chew... Met Gala in Manhattan, which TikTok sponsored." So the Met Gala was in April? Not sure. The article doesn't mention another event in April 2024 with Marc D'Amelio. Maybe N/A? Or perhaps the event in question is the one where they sponsored the Washington Capitals in September, but that's not April. The article doesn't mention an April 2024 event with Marc, so N/A.

Wait, the question says "in April 2024" but the article mentions the Met Gala was two weeks after the law was signed. The law was signed in April (the article says "April, less than eight weeks after its introduction â€” leading some aides to nickname it 'Thunder Run.'"). So if the law was signed in April, then the Met Gala would be in April or May? The Met Gala is usually in May, but perhaps in 2024 it was in April? The article doesn't specify, but the question is about an event in April 2024. The article says the Met Gala was sponsored by TikTok. The question asks for an event that was criticized as tone-deaf. The Met Gala might be seen as tone-deaf given the legal issues. So the answer is the Met Gala. But the question says "sponsored in April 2024", and the Met Gala was two weeks after the law was signed (April). So maybe the answer is the 2024 Met Gala. But the question mentions Marc D'Amelio being a guest. The article says Marc D'Amelio's family had a reality show on Hulu by 2021, but there's no mention of him at the Met Gala. The question might be a trick because the article doesn't mention Marc at that event. So answer N/A.

12. Twelfth question: The original app acquired by ByteDance before rebranding was Musical.ly. The article says ByteDance bought Musical.ly in 2017 and folded it into TikTok. The country that banned it prior to acquisition was India. The article mentions India's ban after Trump's first attempt. So the original name is Musical.ly, and the country was India. So the answer combines both: "Musical.ly" and "India".

13. Thirteenth question: Which state's ban was overturned in November 2023? The article says "a federal court ruled that TikTok wouldn't have to go dark in that state after all" referring to Montana's law. So Montana.

14. Fourteenth question: The initiative proposed in late 2023 but abandoned was Project Achilles. The article says Project Achilles was proposed but leaders lost interest by end of the year (2023), so yes, that's the answer.

15. Fifteenth question: How many days after the Supreme Court decision did TikTok announce the shutdown? The article says after the Supreme Court upheld the law on Friday, TikTok said on late Friday that unless the administration clarified, they'd go dark on Jan 19. The Supreme Court decision was Friday, and the announcement was the same day (late Friday). So 0 days later, but the question might count the next day as 1? The article says "late Friday, the company said... unless the Biden administration made it clear... by Jan 19. But on Saturday, the White House called it a stunt." So the announcement was made the same day as the decision (Friday), so 0 days. But the question might consider the next day as 1. The exact phrasing: "Late Friday, the company said..." So the answer is 0 days? Or the article says "starting Sunday, when the law goes into effect." The Supreme Court decision was Friday, and the law goes into effect Sunday. The announcement was on Friday, so 0 days after. So answer is 2 days until Sunday, but the question is how many days after the decision did TikTok announce? The answer is 0.

16. Sixteenth question: Which executive's Peru trip raised concerns? The article mentions Michael Beckerman held a gathering in Peru. So Beckerman.

17. Seventeenth question: The White House called TikTok's claim a "stunt".

18. Eighteenth question: The viral trend during pandemic causing feta and cucumber sales was recipes. The article says "cucumbers flying off the shelves as home cooks clamored to recreate viral recipes." The trend was viral recipes, but the specific trend might have a name. The article doesn't name it, so answer N/A. Alternatively, if the question refers to the general trend, maybe "viral recipes" but the question asks for the name of the trend. Since it's not given, N/A.

Wait, the article says "viral recipes" but doesn't name a specific trend like "cucumber toast" or something. So the answer is N/A.

19. Nineteenth question: The nickname for the rapid legislative process was "Thunder Run", as the article says "nicknamed it 'Thunder Run'".

Now, compiling all answers:

1. N/A (no initiative related to USAID mentioned by TikTok)
2. 1 (day after Supreme Court decision on Friday, Trump said on Saturday)
3. N/A (no legal precedent mentioned in Peru context)
4. club
5. The Song of Achilles
6. USAID
7. Miami
8. N/A (name not given)
9. TikTok Global
10. 2024 Met Gala

12. Musical.ly and India
13. Montana
14. Project Achilles
15. 0 (announced same day as decision)
16. Michael Beckerman
17. stunt
18. N/A
19. Thunder Run
