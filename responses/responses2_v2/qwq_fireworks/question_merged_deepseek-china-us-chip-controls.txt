Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the given article and answer strictly based on that. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The $103 million transaction involved a vendor in Shenzhen, but the article doesn't mention Liang Wenfeng's role in the App Store availability. Liang was interviewed about DeepSeek's chip stockpile, but not about the transaction or App Store. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The 36Kr interview with Liang mentioned DeepSeek had acquired A100s by 2021. The question asks about an alternative tech mentioned by the founder. The article says DeepSeek uses Nvidia chips but hasn't switched to Huawei's yet. So maybe the pivot isn't mentioned. The article says they might use Huawei chips but it's suggested, not stated as a pivot. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Jimmy Goodrich said the US still has an advantage in hardware. The Trump order was to review export controls to eliminate loopholes. The question is what aspect of Huawei's chip production would be impacted. Since Huawei makes chips, maybe the machinery needed to make them. The article mentions complex machinery needed for advanced chips. So the answer might be "the complex machinery needed to make advanced A.I. chips."

4. **Question 4:** Alexandr Wang said DeepSeek had about 50,000 H100s. The article doesn't mention total H100 production, so percentage can't be calculated. Answer N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Biden's recent action was caps on Nvidia sales. The question is about energy consumption concerns. Chorzempa mentioned energy intensity. The caps might relate to limiting sales but not directly energy. So N/A unless the caps are the answer. The article says Biden's action this month was caps. So answer "setting caps on the number of chips Nvidia can sell globally."

6. **Question 6:** OpenAI's Deep Research can synthesize info into reports. The article says DeepSeek's chatbot includes Chinese propaganda. So the answer is "Chinese propaganda."

7. **Question 7:** The Japanese conglomerate mentioned is SoftBank, talking to OpenAI. The question is about investing in DeepSeek. The article says SoftBank is in talks with OpenAI, not DeepSeek. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** US anticipated restricting military applications. The article mentions "militarily" as a concern. But specific application? The article doesn't name one. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The Shenzhen vendor offered servers with chips. The article mentions servers with chips but not complex machinery. The text says "complex machinery needed to make those chips," but that's a separate point. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Chorzempa mentions "Midwestern small businesses" and "North Korean hackers" but not job titles. The question asks which job in U.S. hyperscalers would be replaced. The article doesn't specify a title, so N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The contradiction is that the U.S. restricted chips but DeepSeek used legally acquired ones. The article says "You can't control what's already there," so the contradiction is that the export controls couldn't stop pre-ban purchases.

12. **Question 12:** The article says the US still has hardware advantage. So the outcome is "the U.S. still has an advantage in hardware."

13. **Question 13:** DeepSeek's efficiency and Nvidia's drop imply lower costs. The article says "cheaper and less energy intensive." So answer "lower costs."

14. **Question 14:** The key factor is stockpiling chips before restrictions. The article mentions they built up chips before controls.

15. **Question 15:** Chinese can't make rival chips. The article says they can't rival Nvidia's chips or the complex machinery.

16. **Question 16:** Smuggling and regulations impacted Nvidia's shares. The article mentions shares plunged due to fears of lower Nvidia sales.

17. **Question 17:** The contradiction is between Biden's measures and Trump's review. The article says Trump's order was to review controls, but Biden's actions may not have closed loopholes as per Trump's order, leading to smuggling.

18. **Question 18:** The strategy is using fewer chips. The article says "doing more with less" and "lower training costs and less compute."

19. **Question 19:** Timing factor is pre-restriction purchases. The article says they stockpiled before bans.

20. **Question 20:** The theme is competition via chip access and innovation despite restrictions. The article's overall point is U.S. efforts vs. China's gains.
