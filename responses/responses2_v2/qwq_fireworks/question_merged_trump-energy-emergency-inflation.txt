Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked and not infer beyond the text. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks for the percentage increase in domestic oil production suggested by the Treasury secretary nominee. The article mentions Scott Bessent wants to increase production by an additional three million barrels per day from the current 13.2 million. To find the percentage, I can calculate (3/13.2)*100, but the question is about what the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecast says. Wait, the article says the IEA forecasts global production will outpace demand by over one million barrels a day. The question specifically asks for the percentage increase the nominee suggested, but the IEA's forecast is separate. Wait, the article states that Bessent wants to increase production by 3 million barrels. The percentage would be (3/13.2)*100 ≈ 22.7%, but the question says "according to the International Energy Agency's forecast". Hmm, maybe the IEA's forecast is about the overproduction. The question is confusing. Wait, the user's question says "What percentage increase... did the Treasury secretary nominee suggest would be beneficial, according to the International Energy Agency's forecast?" The IEA's forecast is that increasing production by 3 million (to 16.2 million) would lead to a surplus. The answer might be N/A because the percentage increase is 3 million over current 13.2, but the question ties it to the IEA's forecast. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking what Bessent suggested and the IEA's forecast says that would be too much. The answer might be 22.7%, but since the question says "according to the IEA's forecast", perhaps it's the 3 million figure, but the question asks for a percentage. Wait the article says "Scott Bessent... increase domestic oil production... by an additional three million barrels per day." So the percentage is (3/13.2)*100 ≈ 22.7%, but the question says "according to the International Energy Agency's forecast". Since the IEA is mentioned in the context that adding 3 million would be more than the world can absorb, maybe the answer is N/A because the IEA's forecast is about overproduction, not the percentage. Hmm, tricky. Let me check again. The question is phrased as "What percentage increase... did the Treasury secretary nominee suggest would be beneficial, according to the International Energy Agency's forecast?" The IEA's forecast is that production would outpace demand. So the nominee's suggestion (3 million increase) would lead to overproduction. But the question is asking for the percentage the nominee suggested. The percentage is (3/13.2)*100 ≈ 22.7%, but the question wants the percentage that the nominee suggested would be beneficial according to the IEA's forecast. Since the IEA says it would be too much, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is just asking for the percentage increase the nominee suggested, which is 3 million, so the percentage is 22.7%. But the question includes "according to the International Energy Agency's forecast", which might be a red herring. Since the article states the nominee's suggestion, I'll go with 22.7%, but maybe it's better to check the exact wording. The question says "according to the International Energy Agency's forecast", so the answer might be N/A because the IEA's forecast is about the overproduction, not the percentage. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed and see other questions.

2. The question asks how many barrels above 13.2 million Scott Bessent believes would be more than the world can absorb. The article says the IEA forecasts global production will outpace demand by over one million barrels a day this year. If the U.S. adds 3 million, then total global overproduction would be 1 million plus the U.S. increase? Wait, the article says "the International Energy Agency... is forecasting that global production will outpace demand by more than one million barrels a day this year." So adding 3 million from the U.S. would make the surplus even larger. The question is about Scott Bessent's belief based on the Dallas Fed's threshold. Wait, the question says "based on the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas's profitability threshold". The Dallas Fed says companies need over $60/barrel to drill. The question is asking how many barrels above 13.2 million would be more than the world can absorb. The article states that Bessent's plan would add 3 million, which would be more than the world can absorb. The answer is 3 million? But the question says "based on the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas's profitability threshold". Wait, maybe the question is phrased to ask how much over the world can absorb considering the Dallas Fed's threshold. The Dallas Fed's threshold is $60, but the current price is around $70. If production increases, price might drop below $60, making drilling unprofitable. But the question is about the surplus. The article says the IEA forecast is that production will outpace by 1 million, so adding 3 million more would be 4 million over? Wait, maybe the answer is 3 million, as that's the amount Bessent suggests, which the IEA says would exceed demand. The question says "based on the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas's profitability threshold" but maybe that's a distractor. The answer is 3 million. So the answer is 3,000,000 barrels per day? The question says "how many barrels per day above the 13.2 million currently produced". So 3 million. So answer is 3,000,000 or 3 million.

3. The question asks what tariff-induced price per barrel would force companies to stop drilling, based on shareholder preferences. The article says companies need prices above $60 to profitably drill. So if tariffs cause the price to drop below $60, they would stop. So the answer is $60. But the question is phrased as "tariff-induced price per barrel would likely force...". So the threshold is $60. Answer is $60.

4. The question asks what specific action the Fed would take after oil prices drop, as Trump said. He demanded interest rates drop immediately. The answer is "interest rate cuts".

5. The question is about the timeframe for Fed to hit inflation target with Trump's policies. The article says Wells Fargo doesn't expect the Fed to reach 2% until the latter half of 2026. So the answer is "latter half of 2026".

6. The average oil price over last two decades before recent decline. The article says current oil price is about $76, which is in line with the average. So the average is $76. The question says "before the recent 3% decline in gas prices". The recent decline is in gas prices, but oil price is around $76, which is the average. So answer is $76.

7. The question asks what inflation level prompted the Fed to pause rate cuts. The article says Wells Fargo raised inflation forecasts and the Fed is expected to pause rate cuts next week (the article's context) as they assess policy changes. The question is about the inflation level, but the article doesn't specify a number. The answer is N/A because it's not stated. The Fed is pausing because of uncertainty, not a specific inflation number. So answer N/A.

8. The question is about a loan type made more expensive due to inflation. The article mentions "high interest rates on mortgages and other loans". So the loan is mortgages.

9. The other action besides the mentioned ones. The article lists "cutting taxes, increasing tariffs, rolling back regulations and reducing wasteful government spending". The question asks besides those three, so the fourth is reducing wasteful government spending.

10. The former deputy director (Ramamurti) said that increasing energy production is not a "silver bullet". So the answer is "silver bullet".

11. The new target is 13.2 + 3 = 16.2 million barrels per day.

12. The economist at CSIS (Center for Strategic and International Studies) is Howard Gruenspecht.

13. The financial institution raising inflation projections is Wells Fargo.

14. The forum where Trump made the claim was the World Economic Forum in Davos.

15. The minimum price per barrel is $60.

16. The economist who said tariffs initially boost inflation is Sarah House from Wells Fargo.

17. The multilateral organization in Paris is the International Energy Agency (IEA).

18. The speaker at Davos was Trump, as per the article.

19. The executive action signed to lower housing and healthcare costs is mentioned as a separate executive order, so the answer is "executive order on reducing housing and health care costs".

20. The commodities analyst is Helima Croft from RBC Capital Markets.

Now, let me verify each against the article:

1. The Treasury nominee (Bessent) wants an additional 3 million barrels. The percentage increase is (3/13.2)*100 ≈ 22.7%. The question says "according to the International Energy Agency's forecast". The IEA's forecast is that global production will outpace demand, but the percentage increase is from the nominee's suggestion. Since the question asks for the percentage the nominee suggested, which is 3 million, the percentage is 22.7%, but the question might want the exact figure from the text. The article doesn't state a percentage, just the 3 million increase. Since the question asks for percentage, but the text only mentions the 3 million, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "percentage increase... did the Treasury secretary nominee suggest would be beneficial, according to the International Energy Agency's forecast?" The IEA's forecast is that adding 3 million would lead to overproduction. But the question is about the percentage the nominee suggested, which is 3 million over 13.2. Since the article states the 3 million, the percentage can be calculated, but the question may expect the percentage as stated in the article. Since it's not explicitly given, maybe N/A. Hmm, this is tricky. The user's instructions say to answer based on the article's facts. The article says "increase domestic oil production... by an additional three million barrels per day". The percentage isn't stated, so the answer would require calculation, which isn't in the text. So maybe N/A. But maybe the question is asking for the 3 million figure, but the question asks for percentage. Since the article doesn't give a percentage, answer N/A.

2. The question is how many above 13.2 million. The answer is 3 million.

3. $60 is correct.

4. "interest rate cuts" as Trump demanded.

5. "latter half of 2026".

6. $76.

7. N/A because the article doesn't state the inflation level prompting the pause, just that the Fed is pausing to assess.

8. "mortgages".

9. "reducing wasteful government spending".

10. "silver bullet".

11. 16.2 million.

12. Howard Gruenspecht.

13. Wells Fargo.

14. World Economic Forum in Davos.

15. $60.

16. Sarah House.

17. International Energy Agency.

18. President Trump.

19. The executive order on reducing housing and health care costs.

20. Helima Croft.

Proceeding with these answers, correcting question 1 to N/A since the percentage isn't given directly.
