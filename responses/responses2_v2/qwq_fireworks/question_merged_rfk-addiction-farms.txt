Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. Let me start with the first question.

1. How many graduates of The Other Side Academy in Salt Lake City have remained completely sober for at least five years after completing the program, according to the data cited in the documentary?

Looking through the article, the section on The Other Side Academy mentions that about 200 had graduated since 2015. The article also states that about 50% last the full 30 months. However, there's no specific data on how many remained sober for five years. The question asks for the number cited in the documentary, but the article doesn't provide that exact figure. So the answer should be N/A.

2. Which specific neurotransmitter imbalance does Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attribute to the failure of anti-depressants and Adderall?

The article says Kennedy's proposal allows people to stop taking anti-depressants and Adderall, but doesn't mention any neurotransmitter. The reasoning behind his stance isn't detailed here, so N/A.

3. Which historical figure from the United States Narcotic Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, is directly quoted in the documentary as criticizing the use of methadone?

The article mentions Chet Baker and William S. Burroughs were residents, but there's no quote from them regarding methadone. The criticism of methadone comes from others, but the question asks for a historical figure from that farm quoted in the doc. Since the text doesn't mention any such quote, N/A.

4. What is the monthly cost for residents at Simple Promise Farms after factoring in mandatory off-site therapy?

The article states the monthly fee is $11,000 for room and board, and they pay off-site therapists directly. It doesn't specify the cost of therapy, so total isn't given. The question requires the total, but since the article only mentions the base fee and the existence of therapy costs without numbers, answer is N/A.

5. Which 2023 peer-reviewed study by Kevin Sabet supports higher relapse rates?

The article mentions Kevin Sabet's opinion but doesn't cite any 2023 study. The National Academies' 2019 analysis is mentioned, but not a 2023 study by Sabet. So N/A.

6. How many residents at Delancey Street Foundation were in drug experiments?

The article references Delancey Street Foundation in the context of Dave Durocher's background. It says the US Narcotic Farm had drug experiments, but Delancey isn't linked to that. The question is about Delancey's residents, which the article doesn't mention. N/A.

7. Which amendment to the Controlled Substances Act must be repealed for cannabis legalization?

The article states Kennedy would push to sell cannabis in dispensaries, but doesn't mention specific amendments. So N/A.

8. Total healing farms operational in two years based on marijuana tax revenue?

The article says he proposes a tax on marijuana to fund the farms, but doesn't give a number. The question asks for the claimed number, which isn't present. N/A.

9. Which element of healing farms excludes opioid-blunting approaches?

The article says the farms prohibit medications like methadone and buprenorphine. The exclusion is medication-assisted treatment. The first gold standard medication mentioned is methadone. So the answer is exclusion of medication-assisted treatments.

10. The longstanding model invoked is the US Narcotic Farm mentioned in the historical context. The article says Kennedy's proposal is similar to therapeutic communities like the Narcotic Farm. So the model is "therapeutic community" or "United States Narcotic Farm". The question asks for the model name, which is "therapeutic community".

11. The ironic consequence is paying for treatment with marijuana tax, which Sabet compares to paying hospital costs by encouraging speeding. So the answer is that it funds treatment through a substance's sales, implying contradiction.

12. The spiritual conviction Kennedy cites is belief in God, as mentioned in his quote about Jung and recovery through faith.

13. The rule conflicting with opioid treatments is prohibition of medications like methadone and buprenorphine.

14. The first gold standard medication mentioned is methadone.

15. Funding mechanism: Kennedy uses marijuana tax, while Other Side Academy is self-supported (they don't take government funds). So the distinction is federal tax vs self-funding.

16. Missing feature in therapeutic communities: licensed therapists or medical providers on site. The article says they use peer meetings instead of medical staff.

17. Legal barrier: the article mentions political and legal roadblocks for building on public land, similar to the closed Narcotic Farm. The barrier is likely land use laws or opposition, but the article says "political and legal roadblocks" without specifics. The historical parallel is the Narcotic Farm's closure, so the barrier is similar to that program's issues.

18. Overarching lifestyle philosophy: "clean living" is mentioned as Kennedy's approach to health issues, including vaccines and addiction. The conclusion mentions spirituality and living as if watched by God, but the overarching philosophy is clean living.
