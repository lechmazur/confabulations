Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the given article and answer strictly based on that. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks what percentage of the MacArthur Fellowship grant FastHorse dedicated to Indigenous Direction. The article mentions she co-founded Indigenous Direction with Ty Defoe and that she won the MacArthur Fellowship (genius grant) in 2020. However, there's no mention of how much of the grant went to the firm. So, N/A here.

2. The second question is about the year she sold her pilot to Fox, leading her to playwriting. The article says her first two pilots were sold to TeenNick and Fox but weren't made. She started playwriting in 2007. The pilots were sold before that, but the exact year isn't given. The article doesn't specify the year, so N/A.

3. The third question asks how many years after "The Thanksgiving Play" (which premiered Off-Broadway in 2018) her play with Julie Bowen and Tonantzin Carmelo opened at the Mark Taper Forum. The article says "Fake It Until You Make It" was supposed to open in 2023 but was delayed. It finally opened last week (as of the article's writing) and runs through March 9. Assuming the article is from 2024, that's 6 years. But the article doesn't give the exact year of the Taper opening, just that it was delayed from 2023. Since the article mentions it's finally onstage in LA, maybe 2024. But without exact years, perhaps the answer is 5 (from 2018 to 2023), but the play was delayed, so maybe 6. Wait, the article says "finally onstage in Los Angeles" in the present, and the original Off-Broadway was 2018. The Taper was supposed to open in 2023 but was suspended. The current run is through March 9 (assuming 2024). So from 2018 to 2024 is 6 years. But the question says "how many years after Off-Broadway did it open at the Taper?" The Taper's first opening was delayed to 2024? The article states it was scheduled for 2023 but postponed. The current run is mentioned as "last week," so maybe 2024. The answer would be 6, but the article doesn't explicitly state the exact year of the Taper opening. Hmm, maybe it's better to say N/A because the exact years aren't given. Wait, the article says "it finally opened last week (it runs through March 9)" but the year isn't specified. Since the article mentions the 2023 suspension, maybe it's 2024, making it 6 years. But since the article doesn't specify the exact year, perhaps N/A. Wait, the question says "how many years after 'The Thanksgiving Play' premiered Off-Broadway (2018) did her play (Fake It...) open at the Taper?" The Taper was supposed to open in 2023 but was delayed. The article says "it finally did last week (it runs through March 9)". If the article was written in 2024, that's 6 years. But without the exact year, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "In June of that year, however, just two weeks before rehearsals were to begin, the Taper suspended the remainder of its season, citing a financial crisis exacerbated by the pandemic. The play's future was in limbo. FastHorse received offers from other theaters outside of Los Angeles, but she fought to have it debut in the city, which it finally did last week..." "that year" refers to 2023. So the play was supposed to open in 2023 but was delayed and finally opened in 2023? Or 2024? The article's publication date isn't clear. Since the pandemic suspension was in 2023, maybe it opened in 2023. So from 2018 to 2023 is 5 years. The answer would be 5. Let me check again: "The play was scheduled to open in 2023. In June of that year (2023), the Taper suspended... The play's future was in limbo... she fought to have it debut in the city, which it finally did last week." So "last week" would be in 2023, so 5 years after 2018. So answer is 5.

4. The fourth question asks what role Amy Brenneman took in the Washington production. The article says "Amy Brenneman will portray River when the play is presented in April at Arena Stage Theater in Washington." So the answer is River.

5. The fifth question asks the name of the "chick-empowerment book" with Maria Tallchief. The article says "an illustration of Maria Tallchief... in one of those chick-empowerment books that an aunt had given her." The book's name isn't provided. So N/A.

6. The sixth question is about Tom Turkey's attire changes besides the pilgrim hat. The article mentions they added a land acknowledgment and ditched the pilgrims, but the attire change was replacing the pilgrim hat with a top hat. Wait, the question says besides the pilgrim hat, what else? The article says "replaced the bird's buckled pilgrim hat with a top hat." So the pilgrim hat was replaced with a top hat. So the specific element altered was the top hat replacing the pilgrim hat. Wait, the question asks what specific element besides the pilgrim hat was altered? The article doesn't mention another element of the attire. Maybe the "Ugg-a-Wugg" song removal is part of Peter Pan, not Tom Turkey. So perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "they added a land acknowledgment and ditched the pilgrims." The pilgrims were part of the parade, not the turkey's attire. The attire change was the hat. So the only change to Tom Turkey's attire was the hat. The question asks besides the pilgrim hat, so maybe there's nothing else. So N/A.

Wait, the article states: "they added a land acknowledgment and ditched the pilgrims." The pilgrims were the group, not part of the turkey's costume. The turkey's hat was changed. The question is about Tom Turkey's attire changes besides the pilgrim hat. The pilgrim hat was on the turkey. The answer is the top hat, replacing the pilgrim hat. So the question is phrased as "specific element of Tom Turkey's attire, besides the pilgrim hat, did FastHorse and Ty Defoe alter?" The pilgrim hat was replaced with a top hat. So the only alteration was replacing the pilgrim hat with a top hat. So the answer would be the top hat, but the question is asking what else besides the pilgrim hat. Since the pilgrim hat was replaced, the other element isn't there. So maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, perhaps the question is a trick. The pilgrim hat was the only element changed on the turkey. The other changes (land acknowledgment, ditching pilgrims) are about the parade elements, not the turkey's costume. So the answer is N/A.

7. The seventh question: the fictional tribe in her 2017 play that encountered kinder Klansmen. The play is "What Would Crazy Horse Do?" (2017), and the Klansmen are KKK. The question asks the name of the fictional tribe. The article says "the last members of a fictional tribe encounter a pair of kinder, gentler Ku Klux Klan members." The tribe's name isn't given, so N/A.

8. The eighth question asks the name of the artistic director who suggested the title. The article says Luis Alfaro, an associate artistic director at Center Theater Group, suggested "Fake It Until You Make It." The answer is Luis Alfaro.

9. The ninth question: the all-Native cast play created with Indigenous people of LA Basin before Thanksgiving Play, specifically for four white actors. The article mentions "Urban Rez" as the play created with Indigenous people of LA Basin. However, "The Thanksgiving Play" was written for four white actors. The question asks the name of the all-Native cast play before Thanksgiving Play. So Urban Rez is the answer.

10. The tenth question: university after Atlanta Ballet leading to internship. The article says after dancing, she quit in 2001 and found a paid internship in a writing program at Universal Pictures. It doesn't mention a university, so N/A.

11. The eleventh question: her retort when locals dismissed her identity. The article says when friends talked about "drunk lazy Indians," she'd say "um, excuse me, I'm right here," and they'd say "Oh, well, not you!" The retort encapsulating being overlooked is "Not you!" So the answer is "Oh, well, not you!" or the phrase used by others, but the question asks her retort. Her retort was "um, excuse me, I'm right here," but the question says the brief retort that encapsulated her experience was the "not you" dismissals. The answer is "Not you!" as per the article's wording: "the 'not you' slights continued."

12. The twelfth question: the recurring phrase locals used to exclude her. The article says "Oh, well, not you!" So that's the phrase.

13. The thirteenth question: central question about nonprofits' administration in her play. The article states the play raises questions like "Why are so many of the best Native organizations run by white people?" So that's the central question.

14. The fourteenth question: which Broadway musical did she overhaul. The article mentions her adaptation of "Peter Pan."

15. The fifteenth question: physical form she abandoned in 2001 due to age and injuries. She quit ballet in 2001.

16. The sixteenth question: how the title was set despite no concept. The article says she told Luis Alfaro ideas, he suggested the title, and then couldn't change it when banners were up.

17. The seventeenth question: industry where her early pilots were sold. The pilots were sold to TeenNick and Fox, so TV industry.

18. The eighteenth question: language strangers used, highlighting her struggle. The article says "Everyone speaks Spanish to me in L.A."

19. The nineteenth question: pioneering milestone. First Native American playwright on Broadway, or first with most-produced play. The article says "first known Native American playwright to have a Broadway show."

20. The twentieth question: name of the firm for Macy's rebrand. Indigenous Direction.
