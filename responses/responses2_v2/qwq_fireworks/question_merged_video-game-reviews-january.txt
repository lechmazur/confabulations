Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question is asking which Roottree family member's disappearance in 1998 sparked the investigation. The article mentions "The Roottrees Are Dead makes sleuths of us all" and talks about the family tree and secrets, but I don't see any specific name mentioned for a disappeared member. The article says "identifying wayward aunts and uncles" but no specific individual. So the answer here is N/A.

2. Question 2 asks how many hours of gameplay footage Snowman studio recorded while researching NYC locations. The article states that Snowman did "copious on-the-ground research" but doesn't mention hours of footage recorded. So N/A.

3. Completing the Central Park security guard chase sequence's unlock. The article mentions the chase but doesn't specify what it unlocks. So N/A.

4. The character class in Heroes of Hammerwatch II that gives health regeneration. The review says "the paladin increases armor levels" but not health. The question is about health regeneration, which isn't mentioned. So N/A.

5. Original release date of The Roottrees Are Dead before remaster. The article says it's a remaster of a 2023 browser game, so the original was 2023. Wait, the remaster is of a 2023 game? Wait, the article says "remaster of a 2023 browser game". So the original release was 2023.

6. Number of skateboard deck designs with NYC landmarks. The article mentions "Classic 'I NY' and graffiti-style Brooklyn decks" but doesn't specify how many. So N/A.

7. Which gaming magazine's cover story is in the evidence. The article lists "internet articles and newspaper clippings, the more I flip through water-damaged photographs and magazine cover stories", but doesn't name a specific magazine. So N/A.

8. Percentage boost from paladin's armor. The article says "the paladin increases armor levels" but doesn't state a percentage. So N/A.

9. Secret area after shooing pigeons in Brooklyn. The article mentions shooing white pigeons but doesn't say what unlocks. N/A.

10. Developer who interviewed Roottree family members. The article doesn't mention any interviews with real family members; the game's materials are fictional. So N/A.

11. The game set in the late 90s about family truths. The article says The Roottrees Are Dead is set in 1998 and deals with family secrets. So that's the answer.

12. The cyberpunk game with dice mechanics. The article mentions Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector as a cyberpunk future with dice rolls. So that's the title.

13. The mobile game with NYC landmarks and cinematic Statue of Liberty. Skate City: New York is described with the Statue of Liberty video and NYC locations. So yes.

14. The game with retro dungeon and 90s aesthetics. Heroes of Hammerwatch II is mentioned with "retro art and soundtrack" and "late-'90s panache". So that's it.

15. The remaster set during the dawn of the web. The Roottrees Are Dead is noted for being set in 1998, the early web days. So that's the answer.

16. The game capturing NYC vibe with challenges. Skate City: New York is described with NYC landmarks and challenges like the security guard. So yes.

17. The documentary counterpoint to GTA VI. The article mentions "Grand Theft Hamlet" as a documentary about Shakespeare during lockdown, contrasting GTA VI. So that's it.

18. The game with family secrets via clippings and photos. Again, The Roottrees Are Dead is the one with those elements. So same as 11 and 15.

19. The rogue-lite with warrior class and retro soundtrack. Heroes of Hammerwatch II is the rogue-lite with warrior class and retro soundtrack. So yes.

20. Voice actor channeling Harrison Ford. The article says Troy Baker as the archaeologist in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. So that's the answer.
