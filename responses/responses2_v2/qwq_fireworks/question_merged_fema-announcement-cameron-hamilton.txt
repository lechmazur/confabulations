Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the given article and answer strictly based on that. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks about Mr. Hamilton's specific legislative action proposed during his congressional campaign regarding FEMA's support for undocumented migrants. The article mentions he reposted a message from Anna Paulina Luna criticizing FEMA for supporting undocumented migrants and wrote "Exactly. Why aren't more members of Congress saying this?" But it doesn't mention any specific legislative action he proposed. So the answer should be N/A.

2. The second question is about a policy change he advocated for during his time at DHS related to FEMA's budget. The text says he managed EMTs along the border but doesn't specify any policy change he advocated for regarding budget allocation. So N/A again.

3. The third question asks what type of assistance other than housing he suggested FEMA should stop providing to hurricane survivors. The article states he criticized FEMA's decision to move hurricane survivors out of temporary housing but doesn't mention other types of assistance. So N/A.

4. The fourth question asks if he proposed another agency to take the lead instead of FEMA. The article doesn't mention any alternative agency he suggested. N/A.

5. Fifth question is about the percentage of votes he got in his primary. The article says he had an unsuccessful run but doesn't give the vote percentage. N/A.

6. Sixth question about an international agreement undermined by FEMA's actions. The text doesn't mention any specific international agreements related to his criticisms. N/A.

7. Seventh question on technology from his defense contractor job to track migrants. The article only states he worked there but doesn't mention specific tech. N/A.

8. Eighth question about reforms Kevin Guthrie implemented that Hamilton proposed. The article mentions Guthrie as a leading candidate but doesn't say Hamilton proposed any specific reforms from Guthrie. N/A.

9. Ninth question on the specific amount he proposed to reallocate to ICE. The article says Trump transferred money before but doesn't mention Hamilton's proposal or the amount. N/A.

10. Tenth question about Senate confirmation date. The article doesn't mention a specific date. N/A.

11. Eleventh question asks which state's director is a leading candidate. The article says Kevin Guthrie is director of Florida's Division, so Florida.

12. Twelfth question on which border issue he criticized Biden. The article quotes him talking about the southern border transition in 2021 but doesn't specify the exact issue. Wait, he said during his campaign that immigration and the border were top priorities, and he criticized FEMA's support for undocumented migrants. The Daily Progress interview mentioned his comments on FEMA's support for migrants. The question asks which specific border issue he criticized the Biden admin for. The article states he criticized FEMA's support for undocumented migrants, which relates to border issues. So maybe the answer is support for undocumented migrants, but the question asks for the specific issue he criticized the Biden admin for. The article says he referenced the transition in 2021 (Biden's inauguration) leading to problems. The exact issue isn't specified beyond immigration and border security. Hmm, but the question might be looking for the specific criticism from his remarks to The Daily Progress. The article says he criticized FEMA's support for undocumented migrants, so that's the specific issue related to border. So answer would be support for undocumented migrants.

Wait, but the question says "based on his remarks to The Daily Progress". The article says he told the Daily Progress during his campaign that immigration and border were top priorities, and he reposted Luna's criticism of FEMA helping undocumented migrants. So the specific issue he criticized the Biden admin for would be their support for undocumented migrants via FEMA. So the answer is providing support for undocumented migrants.

13. Thirteenth question: which agency's funds were redirected to migrant detention. The article mentions Trump transferred FEMA funds to pay for detaining migrants in his first term. So the answer is FEMA.

14. Fourteenth question: criticism regarding his qualifications. The article says he lacks experience coordinating large disasters like wildfires, hurricanes, etc., unlike past FEMA leaders post-Katrina who had disaster management backgrounds. So the answer is lack of experience in coordinating large-scale disasters.
