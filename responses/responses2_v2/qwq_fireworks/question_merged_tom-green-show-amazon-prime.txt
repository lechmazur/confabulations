Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and don't make any assumptions beyond that. Let's start with the first question.

1. The first question asks for the title of the Canadian cable access show where Tom Green first aired the segment of him humping a dead moose. The article mentions that the segment was initially on Canadian cable access before MTV. The show is referred to as "The Tom Green Show" starting in 1994. So the answer should be "The Tom Green Show".

2. The second question is about the streaming platform Tom partnered with in 2005 for "Webovision". The text says he uploaded shows from his home studio, including "Webovision", around 2005. It also mentions Justin.tv but doesn't name another platform. Wait, the article says he was doing this alongside Justin.tv, but the question is which platform he partnered with. Wait, actually, the article says "He interviewed celebrities... One guest, Joe Rogan, credited Tom Green's web show with inspiring his podcasting..." but the specific platform for "Webovision" might be part of his own setup. The article mentions he built a TV studio in his living room and uploaded to the web. The question is which streaming platform he partnered with. The text says "uploading and streaming video" but doesn't name a specific platform besides Justin.tv. Wait, the exact line: "he was doing a talk show in his living room. And then there's these kids up in San Francisco, and they were putting video online. We all knew of each other. One became Twitch. Then one became YouTube. And then I'm here on the farm..." So he didn't partner with a specific platform named here, except maybe his own website? The question says "partnered with", but the article doesn't mention a specific platform except Justin.tv, but that's the other guy. The answer might be N/A because the text doesn't name a platform for Webovision specifically. Wait, the question says "partnered with in 2005 to launch Webovision". The article says he started uploading from his setup, but the only mentioned platforms are Justin.tv and YouTube, but those were others. Since the question is about which platform he partnered with, and the article doesn't specify, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but the article says "uploading and streaming video" from his setup, but didn't partner with another platform. So the answer is N/A.

3. The third question asks how many eggs per day the farm produces. The article says "the chickens, for instance, had been laying more eggs than he could keep up with so he'd been lining some up on a nearby fence for the crows to enjoy." But there's no specific number given. So the answer is N/A.

4. The fourth question is which celebrity credited Tom Green's show for inspiring their podcasting. The article mentions Joe Rogan credited Green's 2007 appearance on "Tom Green Live!" as transformative. So the answer is Joe Rogan.

5. The fifth question is the punk band Tom Green formed in Ottawa that won a Canadian Music Video Award in 1992. The article says Organized Rhyme, so that's the answer.

6. The sixth question is the film directed by Green added to Criterion in 2023. The article mentions "Freddy Got Fingered" was on Criterion last year (assuming the article is recent, maybe 2023). So the answer is Freddy Got Fingered.

7. The seventh question is the type of tree Tom mentions planting for wildlife. The article doesn't mention any specific trees being planted, only that he has a farm with animals. So N/A.

8. The eighth question asks which Jackass member inspired his scuba fountain prank. The article says "Jackass" segments were inspired by his work, but he mentions Johnny Knoxville as part of the Jackass cast. The question is reversed: who inspired him? The text doesn't say that, so N/A.

9. The ninth question is the app he proposes for ghost towns. The article says he suggests an app to coordinate group purchases to buy and revitalize towns. The exact wording is "Why isn't there an app that gets a whole bunch of people together? And they go buy a town..." So the name of the app isn't given, so N/A.

10. The tenth question is the animal he taught to pull a plow. The article mentions a mule named Fanny, but the plowing isn't mentioned. The article says he rode a mule and tended animals, but no specific plowing segment is described. So N/A.

11. The eleventh question is which family members he shared the spotlight with on a talk show. The article mentions Oprah Winfrey had him and his parents on her show. So Mary Jane and Richard Green (his parents).

12. The twelfth question asks which animal embodies the warmth of his new life. The article mentions Fanny the mule and says "I love Fanny" and that nuzzling is in now. So the answer is mule.

13. The thirteenth question is the online medium he used before YouTube. The article says he started uploading audio clips in 1999, then video in 2003, using his own setup. The medium would be web-based, maybe just "online" or "website", but the text says "uploading audio clips to the web" and later "streaming video". The specific medium is "audio clips" and "video streams", so maybe "audio clips" but the question is about the medium. Alternatively, the answer is "audio clips" but the question might be looking for "podcasting" but he started stand-up. Wait, the article says he was doing stand-up and then started uploading audio. The medium is "online streaming" or "webcasts". Since the question is about the medium before YouTube, the answer is "audio clips" but the exact term might be "podcasting"? The article says he was doing "audio clips" and later "video". The answer might be "audio clips and video streams", but the question is "online medium", so maybe "webcasting" or just "online platforms". The article doesn't name a specific medium, so perhaps N/A? Wait, the text says "uploading audio clips to the web... and later video". So the medium is "web-based streaming" or "online streaming", but the exact term isn't given. The question might expect "podcasting" but the article says he started that, and Joe Rogan was inspired by his podcast. Wait, in the article: "Tom Green Live!" was a web show, and Joe Rogan was a guest on the web version in 2007. The medium is "web shows" or "online video platforms". Since the question is before YouTube became dominant, the answer might be "webcasting" but the article doesn't specify a name. Alternatively, the answer is "podcasting", but the article says he started with audio clips. So the medium is "podcasting and video webcasting". Since the question is about the medium, the answer is "podcasting" or "audio clips", but the exact term from the text is "audio clips" and "video". The question asks "which online medium", so maybe "audio clips" but the answer is "podcasting" since that's what Joe Rogan did. Alternatively, the article says "uploading audio clips to the web around 1999, and by 2003 he was uploading and streaming video". So the medium is "online streaming" or "webcasting". Since the question is looking for the name, maybe "Webovision" but that's the show name. Hmm, tricky. The answer might be "podcasting" as per Joe's credit, but the article says Tom started with audio clips first. So perhaps the answer is "podcasting" but the article says he started with audio clips, so the medium is "podcasting". The answer is "podcasting".

Wait, but the question is asking what medium he experimented with before YouTube. The text says he started with audio clips (podcasting) then moved to video. So the answer is "podcasting".

14. The fourteenth question is which trailblazing streaming platform he mentions alongside his own. The article says "Justin.tv. He was doing it at the same time as me. He wore a camera on his head... One became Twitch. Then one became YouTube." So the platforms are Justin.tv (which became Twitch) and YouTube. The question asks which one he mentions alongside his own. The answer is "Justin.tv" or "Twitch". Since the question is about the platform he mentions, the answer is Justin.tv.

15. The fifteenth question is which musician referenced his animal stunt in lyrics. The article says Eminem referenced the dead moose in "The Real Slim Shady". So the answer is Eminem.

16. The sixteenth question is the technology that drove his early explorations. The article states "Technology was also an obsession of Green's since childhood... inspired by these scenes, he started hitting the streets with a camera in tow". The specific tech is "camera technology" or "cameras". The answer is "cameras".

17. The seventeenth question is the iconic host he appeared with as a guest. The article mentions David Letterman, where he guest hosted and considered it a career highlight. So the answer is David Letterman.

18. The eighteenth question is the brand of winter outerwear. The article says "bundled in a polar-rated Baffin snowsuit he'd wisely insisted I wear". So the brand is Baffin.

19. The nineteenth question is the concept involving a mobile platform for towns. The article talks about an app to buy towns, but the question mentions "mobile platform" which might be the app. The answer is the app he proposed, but the name isn't given. The question says "concept involving a mobile platform", so the answer is "group purchase app" but the exact term is "app that gets a whole bunch of people together". Since the name isn't given, it's N/A.

20. The twentieth question is the controversial film that became a cult classic. The article mentions "Freddy Got Fingered" being a cult classic on Criterion. So the answer is Freddy Got Fingered.
