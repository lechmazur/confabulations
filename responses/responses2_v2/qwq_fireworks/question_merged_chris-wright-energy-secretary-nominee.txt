Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information in the text and not rely on any outside knowledge. Let me start with the first question.

1. **Question 1:** What percentage of the Energy Department's annual budget... for new geothermal energy projects in Nevada? The article mentions that 80% of the $52 billion budget goes to nuclear arsenal, cleanup, etc., but there's no mention of a specific percentage proposed by Senator Mike Lee for geothermal. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Specific clean-energy project Mr. Wright pledged to discontinue? The article says he didn't elaborate on rescinding spending for Biden's programs, just said he'd follow the law. He didn't pledge to discontinue any specific project. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Software by Pinnacle Tech to justify halting power lines? The software (called "super nerdy") helped shale-gas, but the article doesn't link it to halting lines. The question is about stopping expansion, but the article says Wright said transmission lines are important. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** National lab he promised to oversee? The article lists 17 labs but doesn't mention any specific one he would oversee. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Dollar amount reallocated to nuclear reactors? The article says Liberty worked on modular reactors but no specific loan amount mentioned. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Policy at USAID to address global warming? The article mentions Trump called for USAID closure but no specific policy by Wright. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Conservative group influencing LNG terminal slowdown? The article says industry groups were angry at Biden's slowdown, but no group named that influenced Wright. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Tent city to house researchers? The tent city in Guantanamo is for migrants, not researchers. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Podcast discussing funds for Puerto Rico solar? The article mentions the Puerto Rico project but not a podcast where he discussed reallocating funds. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Student club at West Point to promote diversity? The DEI section mentions West Point ended clubs, but no specific club proposed by Wright. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Percentage of budget for legacy programs? The article says 80% goes to those programs. Answer is 80%.

12. **Question 12:** Value of shares? The article states $55 million. So $55 million.

13. **Question 13:** Senator from Utah asking to freeze loans? Mike Lee from Utah asked to freeze on Day 1. So Mike Lee.

14. **Question 14:** Undergraduate institution? He graduated from MIT, then did grad work at Berkeley. So MIT.

15. **Question 15:** Non-fossil fuel with LNG? His mention included nuclear, geothermal, hydro, wind, solar. The question asks for one, so nuclear is mentioned first. The answer is nuclear power.

16. **Question 16:** Catastrophic event cited? Senator Padilla mentioned Los Angeles wildfires. So Los Angeles wildfires.

17. **Question 17:** President's clean energy projects contrasted? Biden's projects like Ohio batteries and Puerto Rico solar are contrasted with Trump's plans. Answer: Biden.

18. **Question 18:** Dismissive term for wildfire coverage? The quote says "hype over wildfires is just hype to justify..." So "hype".

19. **Question 19:** Puerto Rico project? The article mentions a novel rooftop solar expansion in Puerto Rico. So rooftop solar expansion.

20. **Question 20:** Year he said no climate crisis? The article states 2023. So 2023.
