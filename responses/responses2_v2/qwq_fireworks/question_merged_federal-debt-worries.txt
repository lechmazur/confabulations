Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked and not infer beyond the text.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions Jared Bernstein from the Biden administration talking about interest rates but doesn't mention any former Treasury Secretary warning about low rates during the pandemic. So N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The article talks about the term premium rising but doesn't give specific percentage points between 2020-2023. No exact numbers here, so N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Elizabeth Warren's proposals are mentioned, but the exact amount saved isn't stated. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The 1998 paper is cited by Dr. Yagan, not a 2022 one. The article doesn't mention a 2022 paper, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Mandatory spending's GDP percentage during the pandemic peak isn't given. The article mentions mandatory spending growing but no specific percentage. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The CBO says extending tax cuts would add $3.7 trillion to deficits, implying expiration could save that, but the Roosevelt Institute's analysis isn't specified. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The article doesn't mention a specific formula developed by Yagan. He refers to r vs. g but no formula name. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** No European country's debt crisis is cited as an example. The article refers to WWII but not a specific country post-WWII. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The interest rate during Medicare Part D isn't mentioned. The article notes Medicare Part D added to spending but not rates. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Bernstein references a general concern but no open letter with a specific number of economists. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The Bush tax cuts decreased revenues and were only partly repealed under Obama. The question asks for an action similar to Medicare Part D that reversed the trend. The repeal under Obama is the answer.

12. **Question 12:** The article states the 10-year yield is at 4.5%, but no percentage increase linked to mandatory vs. discretionary spending. N/A.

13. **Question 13:** The political scientists' paper focused on Republicans giving up deficit reduction. If it were about Democrats, maybe the Obama stimulus or part of the tax cuts repealed? The article says Obama only partly repealed Bush's tax cuts. So the action would be the partial repeal of Bush's tax cuts.

14. **Question 14:** Madowitz mentions $4.6 trillion for the pandemic. If term premium doubles, would need similar funding? The question asks for the specific level, so $4.6 trillion again? But the answer should be the same figure, so 4.6 trillion.

15. **Question 15:** Yagan's analogy mentions forcing banks to hold Treasuries. During WWII, the US used war bonds, which are similar. So the policy would be war bonds.

16. **Question 16:** Discretionary spending includes defense. Warren focuses on defense contracting, so she'd target defense cuts.

17. **Question 17:** Kogan says if tax cuts weren't made, the system would keep up. The $3.7 trillion is from extending the cuts. If taxes kept pace, that deficit would be offset. So 100% of the $3.7T?

18. **Question 18:** The 1998 paper's concern is investor confidence leading to a crisis. The consequence would be loss of confidence causing a tipping point, so "loss of investor confidence" or similar. The article says the primary focus would be the tipping point leading to bad outcomes like default, so the answer is the "tipping point" but the question asks for the consequence linked to investor confidence. The text mentions "investors lose confidence" leading to bad options. So the consequence is "loss of investor confidence" but the question asks for the economic consequence policymakers focus on. The article says the main concern is the tipping point causing a crisis, so the answer is "tipping point leading to sudden adjustment" but the question specifies the consequence directly linked, so maybe "sudden and catastrophic adjustment".

19. **Question 19:** Left-leaning might want to increase non-mandatory spending, like stimulus or public investment. The article mentions stimulus spending under Obama as part of the financial crisis response. So "stimulus spending" or "public investment".

20. **Question 20:** Bush's tax cuts decreased revenue, similar to Trump extending 2017 cuts. The specific action is the "deficit-financed tax cuts under President George W. Bush".
