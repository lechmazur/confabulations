Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided.

1. **Question 1**: Which Republican lobbying firm did Yale University hire? The article mentions Yale is opening a Washington office but doesn't specify a firm. They mentioned Harvard, Columbia, Duke, etc., but Yale's answer is "N/A" because the text says they started their own operations, not hiring a specific firm named.

2. **Question 2**: Columbia's payment to BGR in Q4 2023? The article states Columbia signed with BGR but doesn't mention specific amounts for any quarters. So "N/A".

3. **Question 3**: Total endowment tax before Trump's first EO? The text says in 2023, 56 schools paid over $380M. But that's after the 2017 tax. The question is before Trump's first EO (2017), but pre-2017, endowments were mostly tax-exempt. So no data given, so "N/A".

4. **Question 4**: President who criticized Trump's "Marxists" comment? The article quotes Barbara Snyder from AAU talking about challenges but not directly addressing Trump's remark. The professor Kenneth Wong mentions concern, but no specific president's name. So "N/A".

5. **Question 5**: Number of firms Wesleyan interviewed? The article says Wesleyan decided not to hire lobbyists and used the money for students. But it doesn't state how many firms they interviewed. So "N/A".

6. **Question 6**: Percentage of 400k students affected? The article mentions the administration's threat to deport "roughly 400,000 undocumented students". The question asks for the percentage affected by the policy. Since the directive targets all, but the text doesn't specify a percentage, so "N/A".

7. **Question 7**: Architect of 35% endowment tax? Vance proposed increasing it to 35% when he was a senator. So the answer is JD Vance.

8. **Question 8**: Which agency's memo outlined the investigations? The article says Trump ordered federal agencies to compile lists, but no specific agency's memo is mentioned. So "N/A".

9. **Question 9**: Average cost per student lost? Wesleyan's example: $85M for 1,500 students = ~$56,666. But the question asks for the average cited by universities. The text only gives Wesleyan's figure, but others might differ. Since it's not an average across all, answer "N/A".

10. **Question 10**: Number of speakers who withdrew from Rutgers' conference? The article says "many speakers withdrew", but exact number isn't given. So "N/A".
