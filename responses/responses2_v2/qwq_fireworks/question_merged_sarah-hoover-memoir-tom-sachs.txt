Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict instructions. Let me start by going through each question and checking the article for the answers.

1. The first question asks which gallery Sarah worked at before transitioning to writing her memoir. The article mentions she worked at Gagosian Gallery for 14 years. Paula Cooper Gallery is mentioned as where she saw the exhibition, so the answer is Gagosian.

2. The second question is about how many hours she spent reading female authors while writing in Tom's studio. The article says she reads widely but doesn't specify hours per day. So N/A.

3. The third question asks for the psychotherapist who helped her with postpartum depression. The article doesn't mention a specific therapist, so N/A.

4. The lilac cashmere cardigan's designer: The article says the daughter wore it, but doesn't name the brand. So N/A.

5. The price of Walton Ford's painting isn't mentioned. N/A.

6. Number of nap dresses from Hill House Home: The article mentions she shares interests with Nell Diamond but doesn't state how many dresses. N/A.

7. The zine's title is "My Beautiful, Poorly Behaved Wife" as per the text.

8. The Indianapolis tailor: The article mentions her mother took her to a tailor but doesn't name the person. So N/A.

9. The baby nurse's salary isn't provided. N/A.

10. Paintings by their son displayed at the gallery: The article says there were paintings from camp on a side table, but not at the exhibition. So N/A.

11. The hem length of her Chanel dresses was 32 inches below collarbone. That's direct.

12. The artistic medium blending pretty and explicit is painting, as Cecily Brown's works are mentioned as such.

13. The dog Jenna Lyons brought wasn't mentioned. The article says Sarah brought her dog, so N/A.

14. The zine with the dog feces photo is "My Beautiful, Poorly Behaved Wife".

15. The shade of moss-green curtains isn't specified. N/A.

16. The classified ad mentions managing dogs, but besides Donut, there's no other pet named. So N/A.

17. The complaint about burning tongue was after the first child's birth, about French fries. The daughter's birth isn't linked to a specific food. So N/A.

18. Martha Hoover's role at Gagosian isn't mentioned. She was a restaurateur. N/A.

19. The vehicle for walks: The article says she takes walks with a stroller three times a day. No vehicle mentioned. N/A.

20. The Sweetbitter author is Stephanie Danler. But the question mentions love for pencils, which Sarah hates. So the shared interest is murderous women, but pencils part is incorrect. Since the question has an incorrect premise, N/A.
