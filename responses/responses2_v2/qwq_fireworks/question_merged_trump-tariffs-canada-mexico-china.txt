Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and avoid any external knowledge. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. The first question asks which Republican senator wrote the op-ed titled "The Dumbest Trade War in History" in the WSJ. The article mentions that the WSJ editorial board usually backed Trump and used that headline. It also says Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky argued against the tariffs. Since the op-ed was by the editorial board, but the question specifies a senator, Rand Paul is the answer here.

2. The second question is about the number of hours Treasury officials worked with Musk's team before granting access. The article states Musk's team worked "120 hours a week," but that's their work hours, not the officials'. There's no mention of the officials' hours, so N/A.

3. The third question asks for the total value of Canada's retaliatory tariffs targeting specific U.S. states. The article says Canada would target products like Kentucky bourbon, Florida oranges, etc., but doesn't give a specific value. So N/A.

4. Who replaced Rohit Chopra? The article says Chopra was dismissed and the administration would roll back oversight, but doesn't name his replacement. So N/A.

5. Tesla's stock price drop after reincorporation to Texas. The article mentions Musk moved Tesla to Texas but doesn't state the percentage decrease. N/A.

6. The former Delaware judge supporting McCormick's ruling. The article mentions William Chandler attacked McCormick, implying opposition. So the answer is N/A because no one is mentioned as supporting her.

7. Primary difference between DeepSeek and ChatGPT's solutions. Both proposed similar steps, so the difference might be in approach. The article says ChatGPT emphasized a thesis about shifting from ownership to partnership, while DeepSeek focused on de-escalation and investment. The exact difference isn't spelled out, so maybe N/A? Wait, the article says both had similar approaches but ChatGPT's key was shifting from ownership concept. The primary difference would be that ChatGPT stressed partnership over ownership more explicitly. But the question asks for the primary difference in their resource-sharing proposals. The article states both included resource-sharing treaties. Hmm. The answer might be N/A since the main difference isn't specified beyond that ChatGPT's key was the shift. Maybe the difference is in the emphasis, but the question is about the primary difference in their proposed solutions. Since both included resource-sharing, perhaps N/A. Wait, the article says "both chatbots offered multistep diplomatic strategies... DeepSeek... resource-sharing treaty. ChatGPT... economic ventures for rare earth minerals and other resources; coordinating with NATO and EU; ruling out force." The primary difference might be that ChatGPT included ruling out force as part of resource-sharing? Not sure. The answer might be N/A.

8. Annual savings from Musk's initiatives. The article doesn't mention any specific savings figure. N/A.

9. Chopra's recommended credit card rate cap. The article says he urged capping rates but doesn't state the percentage. N/A.

10. OPEC Plus members opposing increased production. The article says OPEC Plus reportedly planned to reject pressure, but no specific nations named. N/A.

11. U.S. state's agricultural product targeted by China. The article mentions Canada targeting bourbon, oranges, motorcycles. China's retaliation isn't detailed beyond Canada, Mexico, and the general $1T. So N/A unless the question is a trick. Wait, the question says China, but in the article, Canada's retaliation is detailed. The article says "three countries pledged retaliation" including China. But the specific products mentioned are from Canada (Kentucky bourbon, etc.), so China's targets aren't listed. So N/A.

12. The payment system Musk's team accessed. The article says "Treasury Department's payments system" which sends money to recipients like Social Security. The exact name isn't given, so maybe N/A? Wait, the exact system isn't named, so answer is N/A. Or perhaps the system is called the Treasury's payment system, but the question asks for the name. Since it's not specified, N/A.

13. Fed's response to tariffs. The article says the Fed paused interest rate reductions and isn't expected to resume for months. So the action was pausing rate cuts. The answer is "paused reductions in interest rates."

14. The aid organization Musk claimed to dismantle. The article says U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). So answer is USAID.

15. OPEC Plus's justification for maintaining production. The article says they likely stuck to gradual increases to avoid retaliation. The primary justification is avoiding retaliation. So "to avoid retaliation from Washington."

16. South Korean leader with dismissed charges. Lee Jae-yong, Samsung's chairman. The article mentions his charges were cleared.

17. Policy tool Summers criticized. The question says Larry Summers criticized the Canada and Mexico tariffs as "inexplicable and dangerous." The article says he wrote about the tariffs being misapplied to allies. The policy tool is tariffs on allies. So the answer is "tariffs on U.S. allies."

18. Delaware judge ruling against Musk's pay. The article mentions Kathaleen McCormick twice overturned his pay packages. So her name is McCormick.

19. Treaty proposed by both AI. Both mentioned a resource-sharing treaty. The answer is "resource-sharing treaty."
