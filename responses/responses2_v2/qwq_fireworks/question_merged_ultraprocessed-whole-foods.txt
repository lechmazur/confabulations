Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the provided article. I need to be careful not to assume anything beyond what's written here.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions Dr. Van Horn's behavioral changes leading people to feel better, but there's no specific percentage stated. So, N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Dr. Hall talks about nutrients in meals, but the article doesn't list specific deficiencies caused by UPFs. N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The TrueFood database helps choose less-processed items but doesn't mention cost differences. N/A.

4. **Question 4**: No specific number of vegetable servings from Dr. Mattei's research is given. N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The article doesn't discuss metabolic changes from replacing breakfast with fruit. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Experts mention frozen foods are as good as fresh, but no specific veggies listed. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The article says affordability is a factor and mentions a budget guide, but no direct correlation stated. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: No data on preparation time is provided. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The article doesn't mention a percentage improvement after six months. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: No chemicals in chicken tenders being neutralized by greens are named. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The Dietary Guidelines say 85% should be nutrient-dense, implying UPFs can be up to 15%. So 15%?

12. **Question 12**: The TrueFood database is mentioned for comparing processed items, but not specifically fresh vs. canned. N/A.

13. **Question 13**: Mattei's research links some UPFs (like soda and processed meats) to heart issues, but not all UPFs. N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Dr. Van Horn suggests adding to two meals a week after one, but not three meals over weeks. N/A.

15. **Question 15**: Dr. Hall says pairing chicken tenders with greens, not warning against any unprocessed item. N/A.

16. **Question 16**: Harvard's guide is mentioned for budget eating, so Harvard T.H. Chan School.

17. **Question 17**: The author limits sodas and processed meats, not replacing with something else. N/A.

18. **Question 18**: The challenge uses TrueFood but doesn't specify phases. N/A.

19. **Question 19**: Sensory evaluation is mentioned, but no specific method for additives. N/A.

20. **Question 20**: The article doesn't state the sodium threshold in grams. N/A.

Wait, let me double-check some answers. For question 11, the article says 85% should be nutrient-dense, so the remaining 15% could be UPFs. That's a logical inference. For question 16, the Harvard guide is referenced, so that's correct. Others are all N/A unless I missed something. Let me scan again.

The article says "85 percent of our diets should be nutrient-dense" from Dietary Guidelines. So the percentage for UPFs would be 15%? But the question is about how much should come from UPFs. Since the 85 is nutrient-dense, which can include some UPFs, the exact allowed percentage for UPFs isn't specified. The article says "can include UPFs" but doesn't give a specific target. Hmm, maybe I should mark that as N/A. Wait, the question is "what percentage of daily caloric intake should come from ultraprocessed foods to maintain optimal health?" Since the guidelines say 85% should be nutrient-dense (which can include some UPFs), but the exact UPF percentage isn't given. So maybe N/A. I might have made a mistake here. Let me think again. The article states "the Dietary Guidelines for Americans states that 85 percent of our diets should be what's called 'nutrient-dense.'" So the remaining 15% could be non-nutrient dense, which might include UPFs. But the question is asking for the percentage that should come from UPFs. Since the guidelines don't specify an exact percentage for UPFs but rather the nutrient-dense portion, the answer might still be N/A. So I'll go with N/A for question 11.

For question 16, the Harvard T.H. Chan School's budget guide is mentioned, so that's the institution. The answer is Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The question asks which institution developed the tool, so that's correct.

Alright, proceeding with these answers.
