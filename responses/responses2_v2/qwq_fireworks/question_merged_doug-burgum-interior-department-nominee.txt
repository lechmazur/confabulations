Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly based on the text and not use any outside knowledge. Let's start with the first question.

1. The first question asks for the percentage of U.S. greenhouse gases attributed by Burgum to activities overseen by the Interior Department. The article states that emissions from federal lands and waters account for nearly 22%. Since Burgum is nominated to lead Interior, which oversees those lands, the answer is 22%.

2. The second question is about how many acres Biden restricted. The text says Biden barred drilling in over 265 million acres. Wait, but the question specifies "land"—the article mentions 265 million acres of Oceans and Gulf areas, which are waters, not land. Wait, the exact wording is "265 million acres of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the Northern Bering Sea." So those are waters, not land. The question asks for acres of land, so maybe this is a trick. The article doesn't mention land acres restricted by Biden. Hmm, so the answer might be N/A? Wait, the question says "according to the testimony of the former governor who created an office..." The former governor is Burgum, and the article says the Biden admin barred drilling in those ocean areas. But the question specifies land. The article mentions "500 million acres of American lands" but that's under Burgum's proposal. The Biden part is about ocean areas. So the answer would be N/A? Wait, but the question says "restricted from drilling"—maybe the 265 million is the total including both land and water? The question might be a trick. Since the article says "265 million acres of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans... and Northern Bering Sea"—all waters. The land part isn't specified here. So the answer is N/A?

Wait, let me check again. The article says: "Biden administration has barred drilling in more than 265 million acres of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the Northern Bering Sea." So those are all water areas. The question asks for "acres of land"—so the answer would be N/A because the 265 million is for waters. Therefore, answer is N/A. But maybe I missed something? The question might be a trick. Let me note that.

3. The third question asks for an organization similar to USAID that Burgum voted on matters benefiting Continental and Hess. The article mentions that Burgum was on the state Industrial Commission which oversaw energy regulation, and he voted on matters benefiting those companies. The question asks for an organization similar to USAID. USAID is for international aid. The Industrial Commission is a state body, so maybe the answer is the state Industrial Commission? But the question says "similar in function to USAID"—no, that's not similar. Wait, the question is phrased as "similar in function to the U.S. Agency for International Development which Trump wants closed, did Mr. Burgum vote on matters benefiting... while serving on North Dakota's Industrial Commission?" Wait, the structure is confusing. The question is asking for an organization that's similar to USAID, but the article says he was on the Industrial Commission. Maybe the answer is N/A because the Industrial Commission isn't similar to USAID. Wait, the question might be a trick. Since the user is asking for an org similar to USAID but the article says he was on the Industrial Commission. So perhaps the answer is N/A. But the wording is tricky. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the Industrial Commission itself, but since it's not similar to USAID, maybe N/A. Hmm.

4. The fourth question: the research group that provided docs to NYT about Burgum's ties. The article says "public meetings and other documents, some of which were obtained by Fieldnotes, an oil and gas research group, and provided to The New York Times." So the answer is Fieldnotes.

5. Fifth question: what legal challenge similar to CBS and Register did Senator King use? The article mentions that Trump's lawsuits against those lack merit but are effective. The question is about what Senator King used to get Burgum to commit to renewables. The article says "Democrats tried and failed to get Mr. Burgum to commit... none pressed him on climate change." The question asks for a legal challenge similar to the ones faced by CBS etc. But King's approach isn't a legal challenge. The answer might be N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the type of legal challenge Burgum is facing, but the question is about what King used. Since the article doesn't mention King using a legal challenge, answer is N/A.

6. Sixth question: Interior's budget when he stepped down as governor. Burgum stepped down in December. The article says the Interior has a $18 billion budget. The question is about the fiscal year when he left. Since he left in December, which is the end of the fiscal year (assuming the US fiscal year ends in September), maybe the budget is $18 billion as stated. The article says "has a budget of about $18 billion" but doesn't specify the year. Since the article is current, maybe the answer is $18 billion.

7. Seventh question: term for public lands as financial assets. The article says he called them part of the country's financial "balance sheet." So the answer is balance sheet.

8. Eighth: slogan for energy production. The article mentions "energy dominance" as the phrase for more fossil fuels. So the one-word slogan might be "dominance" but the exact phrase is "energy dominance." Wait the question says "one-word slogan." Maybe the answer is "dominance" but the article says "energy dominance" is the phrase. The question says "one-word slogan," so perhaps "dominance" but maybe the answer is "energy dominance" but that's two words. Wait the question says "one-word slogan"—maybe the answer is "drill, baby, drill" which is mentioned as Trump's agenda. The article says "drill, baby, drill" agenda. So the one-word slogan might be "drill," but the exact phrase is "drill, baby, drill." The question says "one-word," so perhaps "drill" but the article uses "energy dominance" as the phrase for "more fossil fuel production." Wait the question says "leveraged to embody his administration’s objective for energy production." The article says "energy dominance" is the phrase that's shorthand for more fossil fuels. So the one-word might be dominance, but the slogan is "energy dominance." Alternatively, the answer is "energy dominance" even though it's two words? The question says "one-word," so maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "one-word slogan"—maybe the answer is "drill" from "drill, baby, drill." The article says "implementing Mr. Trump's 'drill, baby, drill' agenda." So the slogan is "drill, baby, drill," but the one-word would be "drill." But the question says "one-word," so maybe that's the answer.

9. Ninth question: monetary magnitude of deposits. The article says "trillions of dollars worth of oil, gas and minerals waiting to be extracted." So the answer is trillions of dollars.

10. Tenth question: opposing admin for "unpredictable" lease sales. The article says Burgum accused the Biden administration of holding unpredictable sales. So answer is Biden.

11. Eleventh: industry leader compared to a past president. The article says Burgum likened Harold Hamm to Theodore Roosevelt. So the answer is Harold Hamm.

12. Twelfth: office established for hunting/fishing access. The article says he created an office of outdoor recreation to preserve access to hunting and fishing. So the answer is office of outdoor recreation.

13. Thirteenth: government evaluation to value natural assets. The article says he called for a federal assessment to value the resources. So the answer is federal assessment.

14. Fourteenth: department whose budget he referenced. The article says the Interior Department has a $18 billion budget. The question is about which department's budget he referenced when discussing balancing resources. Since he's talking about Interior's role, the answer is Interior.

15. Fifteenth: response about drilling in Bears Ears. The article says he dismissed a question, saying he hadn't heard anything about drilling there. So answer is "has not heard anything about."

16. Sixteenth: tech company from which he derived reputation. The article mentions he's a former Microsoft executive. So answer is Microsoft.
