Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly what's asked without any extra fluff. Let's start with the first question.

1. Which Lithuanian film features a protagonist who communicates primarily through sign language while teaching at a dance workshop? 

Looking at the article, "Slow" is the Lithuanian film mentioned where Dovydas is a sign language interpreter, and he meets Elena, a choreographer conducting a workshop for deaf dancers. So the answer should be "Slow".

2. How does the medical glove factory's management respond when Reshmi first reports the discovery of her edited video to human resources?

The article says Reshmi's attempts to find the culprit unearth deeper rot in the factory and management. But it doesn't explicitly mention the management's response when she first reported it. So maybe N/A? Wait, the article states "the travel agent has no updates... refuses to return money or passports" but that's about the travel agent, not the factory's HR. Since there's no direct info on HR's response, it's N/A.

3. What ritual do the townspeople in "Nightsiren" perform when Sarlota first arrives at her mother's cabin?

The article mentions the townspeople first elicit disbelief and then morbid curiosity. It doesn't describe a specific ritual. So N/A.

4. When does Dovydas reveal to Elena that his previous relationship ended due to his asexuality?

The article says Dovydas is asexual and his forwardness comes from being attuned to his desires. The twist is that he's asexual, but when exactly he reveals the previous relationship's end cause isn't stated. The text says "the twist soon arrives in 'Slow' -- but it is surprisingly wholesome. Dovydas is asexual..." So maybe the reveal is when they hit it off, but the question is when he tells Elena about the previous relationship ending because of his asexuality. The article doesn't specify timing, so N/A.

5. What punishment does Amina face at school after her social media campaign against Zineb's harasser goes viral?

The article mentions Amina uses social media recklessly, leading to consequences where differences of class and race become real. But it doesn't state a specific punishment like suspension or detention. So N/A.

6. How many deaf dancers participate in Elena's workshop where she meets Dovydas?

The article says "a workshop for deaf dancers," but the exact number isn't mentioned. So N/A.

7. What medical condition causes Vytas to disappear from his apartment in the Lithuanian sprint film?

The sprint film is "Sprint" (probably the one where Marija's boyfriend Vytas is missing). The article states Vytas is dealing with a psychotic episode. So the condition is "psychotic episode".

8. Which traditional pagan symbol appears repeatedly throughout "Nightsiren" as Mira reveals the town's dark history to Sarlota?

The article mentions "pagan congregations" but doesn't specify a symbol. So N/A.

9. What is the name of the travel agent who refuses to return Reshmi's passport in "Ariyippu"?

The article mentions "their travel agent has no updates on their visa application and refuses to return their money or passports." No name is given, so N/A.

10. How many days pass between Marija discovering her boyfriend's disappearance and the onset of her arm numbness?

The article says "she has a fresh wound on her lip, and her arm has started to go numb -- but nothing will pause..." The timing between discovery and numbness isn't specified. So N/A.

11. In the narrative that opens with a Lithuanian love story where a sign language interpreter and a choreographer share an instant connection, what personal orientation of the interpreter ultimately redefines his approach to intimacy?

This is the same as question 1. The orientation is asexuality. The answer is "asexual".

12. Amid the bleak setting of a factory making medical gloves, which global disruption intensifies the protagonists’ struggle as they cope with worsening conditions and corruption?

The article mentions the pandemic lockdown is in effect, which increases their workload. So "pandemic lockdown".

13. Within the story featuring rows of plastic hands moving past workers and harsh urban smog, which film uses these images to evoke a quiet poetic depiction of a woman’s fight for dignity?

The description matches "Ariyippu" since it's about Reshmi in the medical glove factory with the smog visuals. The answer is "Ariyippu".

14. In the horror tale replete with gothic imagery and eerie folk elements, which character returns to her provincial hometown and triggers a series of superstitious stirrings among the locals?

That's Sarlota in "Nightsiren". So "Sarlota".

15. In the film that follows a frantic chase through Vilnius where eerie details like soldiers gathering and reports of war are interwoven, which female protagonist embarks on this relentless pursuit after her boyfriend disappears?

The film is "Sprint" and the protagonist is Marija. So "Marija".

16. Set in Paris and marked by a provocative title that conflates low-income housing with an insulting body part reference, which central character is the target of a demeaning nickname from her classmates?

The film is "Sisterhood" and the main character is Djeneba. The nickname is the HLM reference. So "Djeneba".

17. In the love story that subverts expectations by showcasing a partner with an uncharacteristically reserved sensuality, which character, known for her past promiscuity, finds herself both intrigued and alienated by her partner’s emotional restraint?

Elena is the one with a promiscuous past, so "Elena".

18. Which film, interlacing a narrative of harassment with the empowering use of social media to combat abuse, highlights a turning point where a character’s digital intervention brings class and racial dynamics into sharper focus?

That's "Sisterhood" where Amina uses social media, leading to consequences involving class and race. So "Sisterhood".

19. In the film where a provincial town’s superstitions are exposed through eerie visuals of bloody apparitions and mysterious women in the woods, which narrative element subtly critiques misogyny hidden beneath folkloric legends?

The critique is mentioned as "exposing myth as a desperate cover for misogyny, bigotry..." So the answer is the critique of misogyny under folkloric legends. But the question asks for a narrative element. The element is the exposure of the town's dark history through Mira's revelations. But the question wants the element that critiques misogyny. The article says "exposing myth as a desperate cover for misogyny..." So the answer is "exposing myth as a cover for misogyny" but the question asks for the narrative element. Maybe the answer is "folkloric legends critiquing misogyny" but the exact phrasing in the question is tricky. Wait the question says "which narrative element subtly critiques misogyny..." The article states that "Nightsiren...exposing myth as a desperate cover for misogyny..." So the answer is "exposing myth as a cover for misogyny" but the question wants the element. Since the options are the films, perhaps the answer is "Nightsiren" but the question is about the narrative element. Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check. The question is asking which narrative element (like a specific plot point) in the film critiques misogyny. The article says the film "exposing myth as a desperate cover for misogyny..." So the narrative element is the exposure of the myths. But the question asks for the element that does the critique. The answer should be the exposure of the myths as covering misogyny. But the question wants the element, so maybe "the exposure of myths as covering misogyny". However, since the options might require the film title, but the question is about the element. Wait, the question is phrased as "which narrative element...", so the answer is the exposure of the myths as a cover for misogyny. But the options are to pick from the article's info. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "misogyny" but that's too vague. Wait the article says "exposing myth as a desperate cover for misogyny, bigotry and the biggest boogeyman of them all: fear of the other." So the narrative element is the exposure of the myths as covering misogyny. Since the answer needs to be a noun phrase, perhaps "the exposure of folkloric myths as covering misogyny". But the question wants the answer from the text. The article states that the film's twist is exposing myth as a cover for misogyny, etc. The question asks which narrative element does this. The answer is "exposing myth as a cover for misogyny" but as a phrase. Since the user wants the answer in the article's exact terms, perhaps that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe the question expects "folkloric legends" as the symbol, but the question is about the narrative element that critiques. Hmm, maybe the answer is "the critique of misogyny hidden beneath folkloric legends" but the exact wording is needed. The article says "exposing myth as a desperate cover for misogyny..." so the answer is "exposing myth as a cover for misogyny". But the user wants the answer in the format, so I'll go with that. Wait, but the question says "which narrative element...", so the answer is the element which is the exposure of the myths. Since the user requires exact info from the article, I think the answer is "misogyny" but not sure. Alternatively, the answer is "N/A" if the question is looking for a specific ritual or symbol. Wait the question is about a narrative element, so the answer is the exposure of the myths as a cover. Since the article states that, the answer is "exposing myth as a cover for misogyny" but I need to check if it's in the text. The exact phrase is "exposing myth as a desperate cover for misogyny, bigotry..." So the answer is "exposing myth as a cover for misogyny".

20. Drawing together themes of urban decay, corrupted management, and personal dignity, which cinematic work presents its story through muted visuals and a somber tone that frames a woman’s struggle within a stifling industrial environment?

That's "Ariyippu", which uses muted visuals and a somber tone, focusing on Reshmi's struggle. The answer is "Ariyippu".
