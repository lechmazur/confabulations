merged_angel-blue-aida-met-opera.txt
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. 

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions Angel Blue attended the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts. It says she first heard opera at 4 years old in "Turandot," but the question is about a performance there. Wait, the article says she went to that school but doesn't mention her performing an opera there. The question asks which opera she performed there that convinced her to pursue singing. Since there's no info on her performing an opera at the school, the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The article states she studied with Zubin Mehta in college. But the question is about practicing the role of Aida with him before her Met debut. Since Aida was later in her career, and the article doesn't mention Mehta's involvement with Aida specifically, this is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The article says her father led church choirs but doesn't name the church or any specific choir. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The power pose is mentioned before performances, but the article doesn't link it to "Porgy and Bess." The Grammy win was for that opera, but the pose's use isn't specified there. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** There's no mention of Leontyne Price giving her advice personally. The article says her father predicted she'd follow Price's footsteps. No advice from Price herself, so N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The article mentions she performed "Sempre libera" in the Miss California pageant but doesn't say any judge recommended the Met. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The attendance figure for her English National Opera debut isn't provided. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The article says she received "many rejection letters" but doesn't specify a number. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The director Michael Mayer's modifications for "O patria mia" aren't detailed. The article says Blue thinks of her father during that aria, but no staging changes mentioned. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The Bible verse she uses now is Philippians 4:13, but the question is about what her father recommended at age 6. The article doesn't mention that. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Her father died from complications of diabetes. The article says she connects her personal experiences (like her father's death) to Aida's lamentations. The ailment would be diabetes. But the question asks for the ailment she mentions as a recurring theme. The article states she thinks about her father's death, not her own ailment. So N/A.

12. **Question 12:** She dedicated "Sempre libera" to her father. The Grammy-winning recording was "Porgy and Bess." So likely that's the answer.

13. **Question 13:** Her father was a pastor who sang gospel. The Blue Man Group's Fred Armisen learned drumming. The question asks what instrument Sylvester taught her. Since her father gave her voice lessons, maybe vocal training, but the question wants an instrument. The article says her mother played piano. Maybe piano? But the question links to Blue Man Group's instrument, which is drums. Not sure. The answer might be N/A.

14. **Question 14:** The tree in "Redwood" is literal. The question asks what tree she might climb symbolically. The article doesn't mention trees, but "Redwood" has her climbing conifers. So maybe "conifers" or "redwood." The answer would be "redwood," but need to check. The article says Idina Menzel is in "Redwood" climbing conifers. The question says "symbolically climb to represent overcoming rejection," so "redwood" is likely.

15. **Question 15:** Her role at the English National Opera was Musetta. The question asks another role that mirrored Jimmy Fallon's stage fright. Fallon was nervous in Broadway. The article says after Musetta, she got auditions. The role that led to auditions was Musetta, so the answer is Musetta, but the question says "mirrored Jimmy's experience." Since Fallon's jitters were in a new play, maybe not directly. The question might be a trick. The answer is N/A because the article doesn't mention a role mirroring Fallon's experience.

16. **Question 16:** Blue uses Philippians 4:13. The question asks what Janowski, like her, might recite. Since the article mentions his belated debut, maybe the same verse. So Philippians 4:13.

17. **Question 17:** The article says Blue sees Aida as a woman with dignity, charisma, humility. The Broadway trend is multidimensional mothers. The aspect beyond princess/warrior is dignity and humility. So answer is "dignity and charisma and humility."

18. **Question 18:** She slammed piano lid and threw music during Aida prep. The object would be "piano music" or "music sheets." The question asks for an object similar to a Broadway prop. The article mentions throwing music, so "music sheets" or "music."

19. **Question 19:** The pioneering soprano her father mentioned was Leontyne Price. The question asks who also had a defining role in "Aida." The article says Price is mentioned, and later Peter Gelb says Blue is one of the great Aidas, implying Price did too. So answer is Leontyne Price.

20. **Question 20:** The article says she performed in "Turandot," "Fire Shut Up In My Bones," and "Porgy and Bess." The question asks another role besides Musetta (which was at English National, not Met). At Met, besides Musetta (since question says "at the Met"), the other roles listed are Turandot, Fire..., and Porgy. "Turandot" was mentioned as one she sang at the Met. Leontyne Price also did Turandot. So answer is Turandot.
