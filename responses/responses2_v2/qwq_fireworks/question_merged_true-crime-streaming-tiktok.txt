Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one based only on the provided article. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then cross-referencing the article to find the answers. 

1. The first question asks about the genre of video popularized by Ali Abulaban that 7M Films focused on. From the article, Ali Abulaban was known for Skyrim and "Scarface" impressions. The article mentions that 7M Films was created to help TikTok dancers and influencers. Wait, but the question is about the genre that 7M focused on. The article says "7M Films and were members of Shekinah Church" and that Shinn created 7M to help TikTok dancers. So the genre here would be dance videos, since 7M was for dancers. The answer is dance videos.

2. The second question is about legal actions similar to those faced by Robert Shinn (fraud, labor violations, etc.) that Reesa Teesa's ex-husband allegedly committed. The article says Reesa's ex is accused of fraud, forgery, and manipulation. So the legal actions would be fraud and forgery.

3. The third question asks what type of content 7M used to groom and control talent, similar to Ali's videos. The article mentions that Ali recorded his life, including fights. For 7M, it says they were managing dancers, so maybe the content they used is the TikTok dance videos. The answer is dance videos again?

Wait, the question specifies content used by 7M to groom and control. The article says "the dancers claim that 7M is a cult and that Shinn is an abusive leader. Accusations include... grooming." So maybe the content was their dance videos, which were part of their management. The article says "glossy dance videos" are part of TikTok's content. So answer is dance videos.

4. The fourth question is about the role Reesa's ex assumed similar to Shinn. Shinn was a pastor and leader of a church. Reesa's ex's role? The article says her ex is accused of manipulation and control, similar to a cult leader. So maybe he acted as a controlling figure, like a manipulative partner. The question asks for a role similar to Shinn's. Since Shinn was a pastor and leader, perhaps the answer is "ex-husband" but that's his relation. Alternatively, the role is "abusive partner" but the question wants a specific role like "cult leader". The article states Reesa's ex is her husband who allegedly committed fraud and manipulation, so the role here is similar to Shinn's as a manipulative leader. The answer might be "manipulative partner" but the question says "specific role similar to Pastor Robert Shinn". Since Shinn was a religious leader, maybe the answer is "religious leader" but Reesa's ex isn't that. Hmm, maybe the question is looking for "abusive cult leader", but the exact wording in the article for Reesa's ex is "ex-husband" but the role he took is "manipulative and controlling", so perhaps "abusive partner" or "controlling spouse". Wait, the question says "similar to that played by Pastor Robert Shinn". Shinn's role was as a leader of a church and talent company. The ex-husband's role is as a manipulative spouse. Since the question asks for a role similar to Shinn's, maybe the answer is "leader of a controlling organization", but the article doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe "husband" but that's his relation. I'm confused here. Wait, the question says "specific role... similar to Pastor Robert Shinn". Shinn was a pastor and leader. The ex-husband's role isn't a religious leader, so maybe the answer is "manipulative cult leader" but the article doesn't state that. Alternatively, since the ex is accused of manipulation and control, the role is "abusive partner". But the question wants a role similar to Shinn's, so maybe "cult leader" but the ex isn't that. Hmm, maybe N/A? Wait the article says Reesa's ex's actions include fraud, forgery, manipulation. So the legal actions are fraud etc., but the role Shinn had was as a pastor and cult leader. The question is about the role the ex assumed, which is similar. Since the ex isn't a religious leader, perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait the question might be looking for "manipulative spouse" but that's not exactly a role. Alternatively, maybe "abuser" but not sure. Wait, the article says "Reesa Teesa's ex-husband -- a drama that includes claims of fraud, forgery and manipulation". The role similar to Shinn (who was a leader) would be "abusive partner", but the question wants a role like Shinn's, so maybe "cult leader" but that's not applicable. Hmm, maybe the answer is "manipulative partner" but I'm not sure. Wait, the article says Shinn is an abusive cult leader. The ex is accused of manipulation, so maybe the role is "abusive partner" but not exactly a leader. The question might expect "manipulative spouse" but I need to check again. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "husband" but that's not a role. Hmm, perhaps N/A? Wait the question says "similar to that played by Pastor Robert Shinn". Shinn's role was as a leader (pastor and head of 7M). The ex's role isn't that, so maybe N/A. Wait the article says Reesa's ex is her husband who was part of the fraud. Maybe the role is "manipulative husband", but I think the answer might be "abusive partner" but not exactly a role. Alternatively, maybe "manipulator" but not a role. Hmm, this is tricky. Let me come back to this one.

5. The fifth question asks for a specific location central to both Ana's murder and "Dancing for the Devil". The article mentions Ana's murder in a luxury San Diego high-rise. For "Dancing for the Devil", the church involved is Shekinah Church. The location for the documentary is the church's area? The question asks for a location mentioned in both. Wait, the documentary's focus is on Shekinah Church and 7M Films. Ana's murder was in San Diego. The article doesn't mention Shekinah Church being in San Diego. The only common location might be N/A, but the question says "similar to that produced by Ali Abulaban". Wait, the question is about the location central to both. The Ana case's location is San Diego, and the "Dancing..." series is about Shekinah Church, but where is that? The article doesn't specify. So maybe N/A? Or perhaps the church's location isn't mentioned. Hmm.

6. The sixth question is about a violation committed by Raheel Ahmad (Sania Khan's husband) similar to "Dancing for the Devil". The article says Sania's husband was abusive. The violations in "Dancing..." include fraud, labor violations, etc. The question asks for a specific type of violation. The article says Sania's husband was abusive, so maybe domestic violence? The "Dancing..." series has assault as an accusation. So the answer would be assault or domestic violence. The article mentions "abusive marriage" so domestic abuse. The exact term in the article for Shinn's accusations include "assault". So the answer is assault.

7. The seventh question asks what media form Ali used to document his life that Reesa also used. Ali used his phone to record his life, including live broadcasts. Reesa used TikTok videos. The article says Reesa posted a 50-part series on TikTok. So both used TikTok videos. The answer is TikTok videos.

8. The eighth question is the name of the church mentioned in both the 7M doc and the Investigation Discovery series. The 7M doc mentions Shekinah Church. The Investigation Discovery series episode about Sania Khan also mentions the church? Wait, the article says the ID series episode about Sania Khan's story is part of the series that examines crimes connected to social media's underbelly. The question says the church was also the subject of an episode in the ID series. Wait, the article says the ID series has an episode on Sania Khan, whose story is told through her friends, and she was part of conservative South Asian communities. The church mentioned in the 7M context is Shekinah Church. The question says the church was also part of an ID episode, but the ID series episode about Sania Khan doesn't mention Shekinah Church. So maybe N/A. Wait the question says "mirroring the focus on social media's underbelly", but the church is only in the 7M doc. So perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait the article says the ID series "examines a different crime connected to the underbelly of social media". The episode about Sania Khan is part of that series. The church in question is Shekinah, but that's from the 7M doc, not the ID series. So the answer would be N/A.

9. The ninth question asks for the church leader accused in the cult allegations. The article mentions Pastor Robert Shinn, who founded Shekinah Church and 7M Films. So the answer is Pastor Robert Shinn.

10. The tenth question is which streaming service has the doc about Ana's murder. The Ana case is covered in a Peacock documentary (the second section says "this 2024 Peacock documentary"). So the answer is Peacock.

11. The eleventh question is how many parts Reesa's series had. The article says "50-part series". So 50.

12. The twelfth question is the U.S. figure who delayed the TikTok ban. The article says President Trump signed an executive order stalling the ban for 75 days. So the answer is President Trump.

13. The thirteenth question is the Pakistani American influencer facing harassment. The article mentions Sania Khan as a Pakistani American influencer who discussed her abusive marriage and faced backlash. So the answer is Sania Khan.

14. The fourteenth question is the talent company linked to Shinn's church. The article says 7M Films was founded by Shinn along with Shekinah Church. So the answer is 7M Films.

15. The fifteenth question is Ali's TikTok username. The article says Ali Abulaban used the username JinnKid. So the answer is JinnKid.

16. The sixteenth question is the app common to all stories. The article mentions TikTok as the app in all the cases. The answer is TikTok.

17. The seventeenth question is the Y2K personality on Amazon. The article mentions Tom Green's return on Amazon Prime. So the answer is Tom Green.

18. The eighteenth question is the title of the Netflix series about the cult. The first documentary is "Dancing for the Devil" on Netflix. So the answer is Dancing for the Devil.

Now, going back to question 4. The question is asking for the role Reesa's ex assumed similar to Shinn's role. Shinn was a pastor and leader of a church and talent company. Reesa's ex's role is her husband accused of fraud, forgery, manipulation. The role similar to Shinn's would be "manipulative partner" but the article doesn't explicitly state a role, just the accusations. Alternatively, since Shinn was a leader of a controlling organization, the ex's role is "controlling spouse". The question might expect "manipulative spouse" but the exact term in the article for Shinn's role is "cult leader". Since Reesa's ex isn't a leader of an organization, maybe the answer is "abusive partner" but the question wants a role like "cult leader". Since there's no exact match, perhaps N/A? Wait the article says Reesa's ex is accused of manipulation and control, so the role could be "manipulative partner". But the question wants a role similar to Shinn's, which was a leader. Since the ex isn't a leader, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe "husband" is the role, but that's just his relation. Hmm. The question might be expecting "manipulative spouse" but since the article says "manipulation", maybe "manipulator". Alternatively, the answer is "abusive husband". Wait the question says "similar to that played by Pastor Robert Shinn", who was a leader. Since the ex isn't a leader, maybe the answer is N/A. I'll go with N/A here because there's no exact role mentioned similar to Shinn's.

Question 5: The location central to both Ana's murder and "Dancing..."? The Ana case was in San Diego, and the documentary's church isn't linked to a location mentioned here. The article doesn't say Shekinah Church is in San Diego. So answer is N/A.

Question 8: The church mentioned in both the 7M doc and an ID series episode. Since the ID series episode about Sania Khan doesn't mention Shekinah Church, the answer is N/A.

So now I can proceed to fill in the answers accordingly.
