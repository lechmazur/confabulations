Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. The user provided a detailed article and wants answers strictly based on that. I need to make sure I don't use any outside knowledge. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. The first question is about an initiative similar to West Point's actions regarding USAID. The article mentions West Point ending clubs due to Trump's D.E.I. ban. Then, in the USAID section, it says Trump called for closing USAID. The question asks what initiative USAID's head proposed before staff furloughs. Wait, the article says Trump directly called for closure, not the head of USAID. The question might be tricky here. Since the initiative is similar to West Point's (which was ending clubs due to D.E.I. ban), but USAID's action is closure. The question asks what the USAID head proposed, but the text says Trump called for closure. So maybe the answer is the closure of USAID? But the question says "initiative... similar in scope". Since West Point's action was about D.E.I., and USAID's was closing the agency, maybe the answer is "closure of the U.S. Agency for International Development". But the question says "proposed before the anticipated staff furloughs". The article says Trump called for closure "just hours before most of its staff were expected to be suspended..." So the answer should be "closure of the U.S. Agency for International Development".

2. The second question asks besides gang affiliations, what other accusation was against the migrants in Guantanamo? The article mentions they are held there because they have "suspected gang affiliations" and the same prison that housed Al Qaeda members. The question asks another specific accusation. The text says "migrants with suspected gang affiliations" but doesn't mention another accusation. The Al Qaeda part is about the prison's previous use, not the migrants' charges. So maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "related to Guantanamo Bay detainees", so maybe "accused of being members of Al Qaeda"? But the article says the migrants are in the same prison that housed Al Qaeda members. The migrants are not accused of being Al Qaeda, but they are held there. The accusation is gang affiliations. So the answer might be N/A.

3. The legal strategy in cases against CBS and Register that was effective but lacked merit. The article says "lawsuits lack legal merit. But they now also realize that the lawsuits are proving effective at harassing the press". The strategy isn't named, but the question is about the legal strategy. Since it's about suing to harass, maybe the answer is "suing" or "filing lawsuits". But the question is about the strategy. The article doesn't name it, so maybe N/A? Wait, the strategy could be "filing meritless lawsuits to harass", but the text doesn't specify a term. Since the question asks for the legal strategy, perhaps the answer is N/A. Hmm.

4. The month when researchers proposed typhoid fever caused Harrison's death. The article says in 2014, they suggested typhoid from unclean water. The question asks in what month. The article only says "in 2014", so month isn't given. Answer N/A.

5. The resource in Trudeau's country that prompted Trump's comments about territorial acquisition. The article says Canada's critical minerals are behind Trump's comments. So the answer is "critical minerals".

6. The temperature decrease between Trump's first inauguration (48) and the moved one (23). The first was 48, the second's forecast high is 23. The difference is 25 degrees. The question asks percentage decrease. 25/48 is roughly 52%. But the article doesn't mention percentage, so maybe N/A? The question says "percentage decrease", but the text doesn't calculate it. So answer N/A.

7. The facility prepared for migrants that mirrors confinement for Al Qaeda. The article mentions a tent city for migrants and Guantanamo for Al Qaeda. The tent city is the facility. The question asks what type mirrors the historical confinement (Guantanamo for Al Qaeda). So the answer is "tent city".

8. The action by West Point leaders that contradicted diversity efforts. The article says they ended clubs due to D.E.I. ban, which critics say contradicts diversification. The group responsible for the tent city plan isn't mentioned here. Wait, the question says "the group responsible for implementing the tent city plan"—the tent city is about migrants, but West Point's action is separate. Maybe the question links the two? The action was ending clubs (D.E.I. compliance), contradicting diversity efforts. The group would be "the nation's fighting force" as per the first DEI section. So the answer is "ending a dozen student clubs".

9. The weather phenomenon causing the move indoors, similar to a past parade cancellation. The current issue is arctic chill, wind, and snow. The past was Reagan's 1985 with below-zero wind chill and parade canceled. The phenomenon is "wind chill" or "arctic air". The question says "echoing the cancellation... due to below-zero wind chill". The article mentions "wind chill temperatures that afternoon were 10 to 20 below zero" for Reagan. The current problem's phenomenon is "wind chill" and snow. The answer is "wind chill".

10. The president's second inauguration indoors with parade canceled and wind chill 10-20 below. The article mentions Reagan's 1985 second inauguration was indoors with parade canceled, and wind chills 10-20 below. So the answer is "Ronald Reagan".

11. Which president's inauguration had a noon temp contrasting Trump's 48? The article mentions Obama's 2009 inauguration was 28 degrees at noon, which is colder than Trump's 48. The question says "contrasts with Trump’s earlier 48-degree reading". So Obama's 2009.

12. President's long speech without clothing linked to fatal illness. That's William Henry Harrison's 1841 inauguration. He gave a long speech in bad weather and died of illness. The answer is "William Henry Harrison".

13. Leader's decision on USAID closure alongside arctic air and staff disruptions. The article mentions Trump called for USAID closure before staff furloughs, and the arctic air is current. The question links weather and policy. The leader is Trump.

14. Meteorologist credited for the forecast, possibly confused with political decisions. The article mentions Judson Jones as the meteorologist who forecasts the weather. The answer is "Judson Jones".

15. Whose inauguration had 48 degrees at noon? The first Trump inauguration was 48. The article starts with that. The answer is "Donald J. Trump".

16. Agency targeted for closure by Trump before staff disruptions. The USAID closure is mentioned, so answer "U.S. Agency for International Development".

17. Foreign leader with critical minerals and northern neighbor comment. That's Justin Trudeau, Canada's PM. The answer is "Justin Trudeau".

18. Political figure suing news outlets linked to inauguration issues. The lawsuits are from Trump's administration. The answer is "Donald Trump".

Now, check each answer against the article again for accuracy.

1. USAID closure is correct. The question says "initiative... similar to West Point's actions". West Point ended clubs (D.E.I. compliance), USAID was to be closed. Both actions per Trump's orders. So the answer is correct.

2. The migrants are accused only of gang affiliations. The other accusation isn't mentioned. So N/A.

3. The legal strategy isn't named. The article says lawsuits lack merit but are effective at harassing. The strategy isn't named, so N/A.

4. Month is 2014, not specified, so N/A.

5. Critical minerals.

6. Percentage not given, N/A.

7. Tent city mirrors the confinement (Guantanamo for Al Qaeda; tent for migrants). Answer is tent city.

8. The action was ending clubs, which contradicts diversity efforts. The group responsible for the tent city isn't linked here, but the question's first part is about West Point's action. So answer is "ending a dozen student clubs".

9. Wind chill caused the move, like Reagan's case. So wind chill.

10. Reagan.

11. Obama's 2009 (28 vs Trump's 48 first inauguration).

12. Harrison.

13. Trump's decision on USAID with arctic air and staff furloughs. Yes.

14. Judson Jones.

15. Trump's first inauguration.

16. USAID.

17. Trudeau.

18. Trump.

All answers should now be correct based on the article.
