Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question is about the legal precedent allowing Mick Mulvaney's installation as acting director during Trump's first term. The article mentions that Trump used the Vacancies Act to install Mulvaney, who was then the OMB director. So the answer is the Vacancies Act.

2. The second question asks for the dollar amount Chopra secured from financial companies. The article states he ordered repayments of over $6 billion. So that's the answer.

3. The third question is about the enforcement action after Trump's inauguration. The article says the first action was a $2 million fine against Wise. So Wise's $2M fine is the answer.

4. The former Republican rep who found it surprising was Patrick McHenry, as mentioned near the end. He's the answer here.

5. Trump proposed a 10% cap on credit card interest rates during his campaign. The article explicitly states this.

6. The action by West Point was ending 12 student clubs due to Trump's DEI ban, conflicting with diversity efforts. So that's the answer.

7. The concern Trump raised at WEF was banks cutting off conservatives, as mentioned when he spoke to Bank of America and JPMorgan CEOs.

8. The agency Trump wanted closed was USAID, as stated in the article's "U.S.A.I.D" section.

9. The location for migrants is Guantanamo Bay prison, used previously for Al Qaeda suspects.

10. The publications sued by Trump include The Des Moines Register alongside CBS News.

11. The law used for Mulvaney was the Vacancies Act again.

12. Wise paid $2M to the CFPB and $450K to customers, totaling $2,450,000. The question asks for total penalties, so adding them makes sense.

13. The Supreme Court case from 2020 that allowed presidential removal is mentioned but not named. The article just says "a 2020 ruling," so N/A here.

14. The article doesn't mention specific CEOs Chopra criticized by name during the panel. It refers to Bank of America and JPMorgan CEOs but doesn't say Chopra criticized them personally. So N/A.

15. Chopra's proposed cap was $8 per month on late fees, not an interest rate. The 10% was Trump's proposal. So N/A for Chopra's interest rate cap.

16. Michael Hsu's prior position isn't stated. The article says he was acting comptroller since 2021 but doesn't mention a previous Senate-confirmed role. So N/A.

17. The number of nonbank financiers in the registry isn't provided. The article mentions the registry was created but no figure, so N/A.

18. The senator who accused Chopra was Tim Scott, who called him "no ally of consumers." So Tim Scott is the answer.

19. The overdraft fees repayment total is part of the $6 billion Chopra secured, but the exact amount for overdrafts isn't specified. The article says "led a crackdown that prompted... overdraft fees," but the total is not broken down. So N/A.

20. Biden fired Kathleen Kraninger, Trump's appointee, on his first day. So her name is the answer.
