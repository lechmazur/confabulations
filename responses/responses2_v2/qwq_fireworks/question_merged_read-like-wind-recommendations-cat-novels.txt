Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. 

1. **Question 1**: The author of "We Do Not Part" is Han Kang, mentioned as a Nobel laureate. The question asks about a prize for a novel where the protagonist communicates with cats. The article mentions Murakami's "Kafka on the Shore" has Nakata talking to cats. But the prize is the Nobel, so the answer is Nobel Prize.

2. **Question 2**: Nakata finds a breed challenging. The article says the Siamese is "savvy," but no other breed is mentioned as challenging. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The zoo is said to "stock" the book, but no reward is mentioned. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Kafka reads "The Arabian Nights" in the library. That's the answer.

5. **Question 5**: Besides Siamese, the article doesn't mention another type. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Millie meets a lion god (Henry). The question asks for a mythical creature guarding treasure. Lion god fits, but the article doesn't specify another. Maybe N/A?

Wait, the question says "before meeting Henry." The article says Henry is the lion god. So maybe N/A since no other creature is mentioned.

7. **Question 7**: Colonel Sanders is in Murakami's novel. The fast-food item linked to Kentucky (KFC). So Kentucky Fried Chicken.

8. **Question 8**: Precipitation mentioned is fish falling from the sky. So fish rain during "Memory"? The question links to "Memory" from Andrew Lloyd Webber. But the article says fish fall, so "fish rain."

9. **Question 9**: Stan thought Henry was a mythical creature. The article says Henry is a rumored lion god. But the question asks for a Latin American creature. Zozobra is mentioned as a chupacabra example. So chupacabra?

10. **Question 10**: Nakata likes onigiri. Kafka's diet: the article says Kafka eats "The Arabian Nights" and exercises. Wait, the "Read if you like" section mentions onigiri for Murakami's book. So Kafka might eat onigiri? The question says Kafka consumed during his diet. The article says "onigiri" is a "Read if you like" for Kafka's book, so maybe he ate it. Answer: onigiri.

11. **Question 11**: Stan fails to document a ritual. The article says Stan studies the cult but Millie's transformation distracts him. No specific ritual named, so N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Colette's phrase is about a cat losing virginity, which thematically relates to Millie's transformation and relationship with the lion. The phrase's sexual connotation mirrors Millie's "knowing life" through her affair. So the answer connects the phrase to her relationship's theme.

13. **Question 13**: Both involve myths tied to regions. Ingalls' Zozobra (chupacabra) and Murakami's Colonel Sanders leading to an alternate reality. Both use local myths to build the story's fantasy elements. So the parallel is using geographically specific myths to access alternate realities.

14. **Question 14**: Zoo stocking the book critiques Stan's failure because the zoo's action highlights his inability to grasp Millie's transformation linked to the lion god, showing his academic inadequacy. So metaphorical critique via the zoo's action.

15. **Question 15**: The Oedipal prophecy in Kafka's story. The Siamese warns about tuna, but the prophecy is Kafka running from an Oedipal issue (mother abandonment). The warning symbolically foreshadows avoiding dangers tied to his quest. So the prophecy is about avoiding his mother, but the question links to tuna warning. Maybe N/A, but the answer could be the Oedipal prophecy itself, but the question asks how the cat's warning foreshadows it. Since the article doesn't connect tuna to the prophecy, N/A.
