Okay, I need to answer these 19 questions based solely on the provided article. Let me go through each question one by one and check the text for the answers. 

Starting with question 1: The article mentions that Starbucks called the union's wage proposals "not sustainable" during the December session. But the exact percentage Workers United demanded isn't stated. The company offered 1.5%, but the union's demand isn't specified. So maybe N/A?

Question 2 asks how many stores participated in the strike by its final day. The article says it started in 10-15 stores and spread to "dozens more". "Dozens" is vague, so exact number isn't given. N/A.

Question 3: The total number of labor law violations. The text says federal regulators accused Starbucks of violating labor law "hundreds of times". So the answer is hundreds.

Question 4: The former CEO who initiated framework discussions in February before leaving in August. The article mentions Laxman Narasimhan did that. He left in August, so that's him.

Question 5: The counter-proposed percentage by Workers United. The article only says Starbucks offered 1.5% and the union wanted more but doesn't state the exact counter. So N/A.

Question 6: Number of work condition issues resolved. The union said they agreed on "dozens of issues". Dozens is a vague term but the answer is dozens.

Question 7: Average duration of monthly sessions from April to December. The text doesn't mention how long each session lasted. N/A.

Question 8: Quantifiable staffing improvements from increased hours. The article states hours were increased where staffing was "too thin", but no specific numbers. N/A.

Question 9: Number of mobile ordering changes. The article mentions "simplify its menu and smooth out its mobile ordering systems" but doesn't specify how many changes. N/A.

Question 10: The year Workers United hoped to finalize the framework. The text says they hoped to do so by the end of 2024. So 2024.

Question 11: The company's 1.5% annual guarantee is explicitly stated. Answer is 1.5%.

Question 12: The CEO who signaled a shift was Laxman Narasimhan, as mentioned earlier.

Question 13: The magnitude of labor law violations was "hundreds of times".

Question 14: The strike lasted five days as per the article. Even if it spread, the duration was five days.

Question 15: The organizing began in Buffalo in 2021.

Question 16: The current CEO (Brian Niccol) increased work hours at 3,000 stores.

Question 17: The consistently emphasized factor was understaffing and insufficient training, linked to pandemic and strike.

Question 18: The first company mentioned resisting unions is Amazon.

Question 19: The remarks about menu simplification and mobile ordering were by Brian Niccol.

Wait, let me verify each again:

1. The union's demand percentage isn't in the text. The company called their proposals unsustainable, but the exact number isn't given. So N/A.

2. Started at 10-15, spread to dozens more. The exact number on final day isn't there, so N/A.

3. Hundreds of times, so "hundreds".

4. Narasimhan.

5. No counter number given. N/A.

6. "agreed on dozens of issues related to work conditions" so dozens.

7. No duration info. N/A.

8. No quantifiable data, just increased hours. N/A.

9. No number of changes. N/A.

10. 2024.

11. 1.5% as stated.

12. Narasimhan.

13. Hundreds.

14. Five-day strike.

15. Buffalo.

16. Increased work hours.

17. Understaffing and insufficient training.

18. Amazon is first mentioned.

19. Brian Niccol.
