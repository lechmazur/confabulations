Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article.

1. **Question 1**: The article says Doechii was the third woman to win a Grammy for best rap album. The question asks how many Grammy awards she's won, with the two predecessors. Since she's third, that implies she won one. So answer is 1.

2. **Question 2**: Lady Gaga's "Abracadabra" is compared to her past. The article mentions "Bad Romance" and "Chromatica". The genre here? The text says "thumping house piano" from "Chromatica", so maybe house music? Wait, the question asks what genre Mekons revisit. Wait, no: "genre similar to the style explored by Mekons in their preview track 'Horror'". The Mekons track is post-punk. The question says Lady Gaga revisits a similar genre. The article says Gaga's "Abracadabra" has a "thumping house piano" but also mentions "refines the more recent sound of her mixed-bag 2020 release 'Chromatica' into something sharper". Hmm. Wait, maybe the genre Mekons used (post-punk) is what Gaga is revisiting? Wait, the article says "the sonic and aesthetic shards of her own past". The question is about a genre similar to Mekons' track. The Mekons track is post-punk. Does Gaga revisit that? The article says "self-referential nonsense syllables" like "Bad Romance", which is pop. Maybe the answer is "post-punk" but I need to check. Wait, the article says Mekons' song is "jagged, violin-topped post-punk". The question asks what genre Lady Gaga revisits in "Abracadabra" similar to that. The Gaga track's genre? The article says "thumping house piano" and "club sounds from 'Chromatica'". Chromatica was synth-pop/electronic. Maybe the answer is "house" or "club"? Wait, the question is phrased as "genre similar to Mekons' post-punk". Since the Mekons are post-punk, maybe the answer is "post-punk" but the Gaga song isn't. Hmm, maybe I misread. Wait the question says "similar to the style explored by Mekons in their preview track 'Horror'". The Mekons' style here is post-punk. So is Lady Gaga revisiting post-punk? The article says Gaga's "Abracadabra" uses "thumping house piano" from Chromatica. Maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "genre similar to Mekons' track" that Gaga revisits. Since Mekons are post-punk, but Gaga isn't doing that, maybe N/A? Wait, the question might be a trick. Wait, the article says Lady Gaga is "mining the sonic and aesthetic shards of her own past" which includes "Bad Romance", so maybe she revisits her earlier pop or dance styles. But the question wants a genre similar to Mekons' post-punk. Since the article doesn't say Gaga does post-punk, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe the Mekons' track isn't the key here. Let me re-read. The question is asking what genre does Gaga revisit in "Abracadabra" similar to the style of Mekons' "Horror" track. Since Mekons did post-punk, but Gaga's track isn't post-punk, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is about Gaga revisiting her own past genres. The article says "insistent 'Abracadabra'... is so 'Bad Romance'". Bad Romance was synth-pop/electropop. So maybe the genre is "pop" or "electropop". But the question requires similarity to Mekons' style. Since that's not mentioned, maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, tricky. Maybe I need to see the exact wording. The article says "Lady Gaga mines the sonic and aesthetic shards of her own past on the insistent 'Abracadabra'... the verse's thumping house piano refines the more recent sound of her mixed-bag 2020 release 'Chromatica' into something sharper". Chromatica was more electronic/synth. The Mekons track is post-punk. Since the question asks for a genre similar to Mekons' track that Gaga revisits, perhaps there's no direct link. So answer is N/A?

Wait, maybe the question is mixing up. Wait, the user might think that Lady Gaga is revisiting a genre similar to Mekons' post-punk. But the article doesn't say that. Therefore, the answer would be N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong in the way it's phrased, so answer N/A. Hmm, but I need to check again. Alternatively, maybe "post-punk" is the answer, but the article says Gaga's revisiting her own past, not Mekons. So probably N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Giveon's song mentions "six years gone down the drain". The question asks in what year the relationship began, mirroring the start of LL Cool J's career. The article says LL Cool J has been a hip-hop eminence for four decades, and his first album in 11 years. Since he's 56, let's see. If he started in 1985 (common knowledge), but the article doesn't state his start year. The article only says "hip-hop got its start in a Bronx apartment building in 1973". Wait, but LL Cool J's career start isn't in the text. The question wants the year Giveon's relationship began (current year minus six years), but the article doesn't give a current year. The article was published in 2024? The Destroyer single is mentioned as "forthcoming album 'Dan's Boogie' is a beachy summertime bop, released in winter", so maybe 2024. If "six years gone down the drain" is from 2024, then 2024-6=2018. But the question says mirroring LL Cool J's career start. The article says he's been in the game for four decades (since 1980s). If he started in 1985 (assuming 2024-40=1984?), but exact year not given. Since the text doesn't state LL's start year, and Giveon's song's year isn't specified, the answer is N/A. Because the article doesn't give the actual years.

4. **Question 4**: Macie Stewart's track uses a prepared piano and strings. Valerie June's upbeat track has a "brawny two-chord vamp" with saxophones and strings. The question asks what instrument both use. The answer is saxophones? Or strings? The question is about the instrument featured prominently in Macie Stewart's track that Valerie June also uses. Macie's track has "prepared piano and string trio", so strings. Valerie June's track has saxophones, cymbals, lead guitar, and strings. The question is about an instrument featured prominently in Macie's and also in Valerie's. The answer would be strings. Because both use strings. The article says Valerie June's track has "saxophones, cymbals, cranked-up lead guitar and a string section". So the instrument is "strings".

5. **Question 5**: Moses Sumney's "Hey Girl" was revamped with guest verses. The question asks another song by him with collaborations. The article mentions only "Hey Girl" with Syd and Meshell. The other songs mentioned by Sumney? The article doesn't list another track. So answer N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Destroyer's track mentions a beachy summertime bop, referencing the wind ("Hey, breeze"). Waxahatchee's "Mud" symbolizes a turbulent relationship. The question asks a weather condition both reference. "Breeze" is wind. "Mud" might relate to rain? The article says "Mud" has "I'm a feather blowing in your storm", so storm implies rain. But the question asks for a specific weather condition. The article says Destroyer's song talks to the "wind (breeze)", and "Mud" has a storm. So the answer is "storm" or "rain"? The question says "symbolizing a turbulent relationship" – "storm" in Mud. The weather condition in Destroyer's song is "breeze", but the question is about a weather condition that both reference. Since only "breeze" and "storm", but they are different. So maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "symbolizing a turbulent relationship" – "storm" in Mud, and Destroyer's song's breeze isn't turbulent. So the answer would be N/A. Unless the question is about "breeze" and "storm", but they are different. So answer N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Sleeper's Bell's new album "Clover" has a track with violin, like Mekons' song (which uses violin). The article says Mekons' track has "jagged, violin-topped post-punk". Sleeper's Bell's track? The article mentions "Bad Word" from Sleeper's Bell: "Blaine Teppema... captures the lingering wounds... over modestly strummed acoustic guitar and drums". No violin mentioned. So no track with violin. Answer N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The album preceding "Mayhem" (Lady Gaga's upcoming) is "Chromatica" (2020). The article says "thumping house piano from her mixed-bag 2020 release 'Chromatica'". So the answer is Chromatica.

9. **Question 9**: Coi Leray repeats "why" five times ("Why, why, why, why, why?"). Giveon's song mentions "six years gone down the drain". So the number of "why"s equals the years (6?), but Coi has 5. The question asks how many times she repeats "why" which matches the number of years (6). Since it's 5 vs 6, answer N/A? Or maybe the question is correct? Let me check. The article says Coi's song: "Why, why, why, why, why?" That's five times. Giveon's "six years gone down the drain". The question asks if the number of "why"s equals the years (six). Since it's five, the answer would be N/A. Because 5≠6.

10. **Question 10**: Missy Elliott's tour is "drawn from a pioneering three-decade career". The article says "Missy Elliott breaks down the inspirations for her first-ever headlining tour, drawn from a pioneering three-decade career." The tour's name isn't given. So answer N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The artist who is one of three women to win a major rap award (Doechii), released "Nosebleeds" quickly after winning, with a track shifting from stark electronic to double-time beat. The article says Doechii's "Nosebleeds" was released immediately, with the last part having a double-time beat. So the answer is Doechii.

12. **Question 12**: Valerie June's track says "find that joy joy in your soul", uses saxophones and strings, and she's resolutely upbeat. The question asks who is portrayed as exuding optimism. That's Valerie June.

13. **Question 13**: "Abracadabra" is by Lady Gaga, as per the article. The description matches: self-referential nonsense syllables (abracadabra, morta oo Gaga), refining past club sounds (Chromatica). So the artist is Lady Gaga.

14. **Question 14**: Macie Stewart is the composer with arrangements for SZA and Mannequin Pussy, and her album "When the Distance Is Blue" has prepared piano and strings, released March 21. So the answer is Macie Stewart.

15. **Question 15**: The revamp of "Hey Girl" with Syd and Meshell is by Moses Sumney. The question asks who is credited. The article says "Moses Sumney has revamped... to make it more gender-fluid by handing over verses to guests. Syd... Meshell..." So answer is Moses Sumney.

16. **Question 16**: Coi Leray's "Keep It" has calm piano, wisps of voice, emotional indictment. The article describes her track as such. So answer is Coi Leray.

17. **Question 17**: Blaine Teppema's track is "Bad Word" from Sleeper's Bell's "Clover", with lyrics about treating a name like a "bad word". The article says "We got right back together / Now you treat her name like a bad word." So the track is "Bad Word".

18. **Question 18**: Destroyer's track has "Hey, breeze, where you going?" and quirky lines like "a priest mistakes me for a priest". The artist is Dan Bejar (Destroyer). The question asks the performer's name. The article says "Destroyer's latest single... Dan Bejar's version of a beachy...". So the performer is Destroyer.

19. **Question 19**: The punk-era band is Mekons, with their track previewing "Horror" which includes "supernatural financialization". The article says "the tenacious punk-era band has released to preview its next album, 'Horror'". So answer is Mekons.

20. **Question 20**: The artist with debut LP "Glorious" is GloRilla, mentioned in the closing lines: "GloRilla onto rap's A-list. On her debut LP, 'Glorious'...". The closing lines mention her. The question asks who is highlighted in the closing lines. The last paragraph talks about GloRilla, LL Cool J, Missy Elliott, etc. The very last sentence is about hip-hop's home concept. The closing lines before that mention GloRilla and others. The question says "highlighted in the closing lines"—the last paragraph's last part mentions GloRilla's debut. So answer is GloRilla.
