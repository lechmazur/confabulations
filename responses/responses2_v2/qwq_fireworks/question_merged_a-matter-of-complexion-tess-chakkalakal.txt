Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one based strictly on the provided article. Let me go through each question and see what the article says.

1. The first question asks which white literary contemporary of Chesnutt wrote a detailed critique of "The Marrow of Tradition" in The Atlantic Monthly, leading to their falling out. Scanning the article, I remember that Howells was the editor of The Atlantic. The article mentions Howells as a contemporary and that Chesnutt had relationships with white contemporaries like Howells. However, the article says that Chesnutt's essay "A Multitude of Counselors" criticized Cable and Tourgee. There's no mention of a critique by a white contemporary leading to a falling out. Wait, the article says that after Chesnutt's essay, the relationship with Cable shifted. But the question specifies a critique of the novel in The Atlantic. The article mentions Howells was editor but doesn't say he wrote a critique. So maybe N/A?

2. The second question is about how many copies of "The Goophered Grapevine" sold in its first year. The article says it was the first work by a Black writer in The Atlantic in 1887 but doesn't mention sales numbers. So N/A.

3. The third question asks for the name of the Black-owned newspaper in Cleveland where Chesnutt worked. The article mentions The Daily Record in Wilmington, not Cleveland. No mention of Cleveland, so N/A.

4. The fourth question is about who wrote the intro to the 1901 edition of "The Marrow of Tradition". The article doesn't mention an introduction by a prominent Black intellectual. It just says Chesnutt wrote it. So N/A.

5. The fifth question is the title of Chesnutt's unpublished manuscript responding to Cable. The article talks about their collaboration but doesn't name an unpublished response. The essay "A Multitude of Counselors" is mentioned as criticizing Cable and Tourgee, but that's published. So N/A.

6. The sixth question asks how many Black residents were killed in the first hour according to The Daily Record's final edition. The article says "as many as hundreds of Black men dead" but doesn't specify first hour or exact numbers. N/A.

7. The seventh question is about the position Walter Hines Page offered Chesnutt at Houghton, Mifflin. The article mentions Page at Houghton, Mifflin but doesn't say what position he offered. So N/A.

8. Eighth question: Which short story won the Century Magazine prize in 1889. The article mentions "The Goophered Grapevine" in The Atlantic but not a Century Magazine prize. N/A.

9. Ninth question: The literary salon in Boston where Chesnutt met Howells. The article doesn't mention a specific salon name. N/A.

10. Tenth: Weeks on bestseller list for "The House Behind the Cedars". The article says it failed commercially but doesn't give weeks. N/A.

11. Eleventh question: White literary figure with dual role shaping Chesnutt's career. The article mentions Howells as editor of The Atlantic and novelist. So Howells? The article says Howells was both a novelist and editor, so that's the answer.

12. Twelfth: Title of Chakkalakal's work. The article says "A Matter of Complexion: The Life and Fictions of Charles W. Chesnutt". That's the title.

13. Thirteenth: The uprising led by Waddell is the Wilmington Massacre of 1898, as mentioned in the first part.

14. Fourteenth: Chesnutt's novel that Sundquist praised but commercially eclipsed, critiquing Waddell's narrative. The article says "The Marrow of Tradition" was Sundquist's praised work and it countered Waddell's "Lost Cause" narrative. So that's the answer.

15. Fifteenth: The pioneering figure with dialect-rich story in a prestigious magazine. The article says "The Goophered Grapevine" was first by a Black writer in The Atlantic, so Chesnutt.

16. Sixteenth: The 1891 essay by Chesnutt criticizing Cable and Tourgee. The article says "A Multitude of Counselors".

17. Seventeenth: Work cited as underscoring resilience of Black artistry. The article says Chakkalakal's book is a timely reminder, so "A Matter of Complexion".

18. Eighteenth: Counterpart to Chesnutt with Confederate background. The article mentions George Washington Cable as a former Confederate soldier. So Cable.

19. Nineteenth: City's history used as backdrop. The Wilmington Massacre is the backdrop, so Wilmington, NC.

20. Twentieth: Life story mapped in the text. The article is about Chesnutt's life, so Chesnutt.
