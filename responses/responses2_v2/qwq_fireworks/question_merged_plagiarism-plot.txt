Okay, let me start going through each question one by one based on the article provided. 

1. The first question asks about the lowest sentiment point in "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" according to the hedonometer. The article mentions the graph ends with an upward incline after Voldemort's death. But where was the lowest point? The text says the graph shows peaks and valleys, ending on a steep upward after Voldemort is killed. The lowest point before the final upward might be when Voldemort is at his most threatening, but the article doesn't specify the exact point. Since it's not stated, maybe N/A.

2. The second question is about which theorist thought stories with all seven plots were the best. The article says Christopher Booker claimed that stories with all seven (like LOTR) were the most impressive. So the answer is Christopher Booker.

3. Rudyard Kipling's method for 69 plots. The article says he suggested it in a few lines of Victorian doggerel, possibly joking. So his method was using doggerel (poetry). The answer is "Victorian doggerel".

4. Jacob McNeal's chatbot analyzed how many words from "King Lear". The article states he uploaded parts of King Lear etc., but doesn't specify the number. So N/A.

5. In "The Plot", who originally conceived the story that became Jake's "Crib"? The article says Evan's plot was taken by Jake, but Evan might have taken it from someone else. It mentions a character borrowed a backstory from "Housekeeping" by Marilynne Robinson. Wait, the question is about who originally conceived the story that becomes "Crib" before Evan. The article says Evan's plot was something new to Jake, but later it's revealed Evan stole it too. The article says "a central character is revealed to have borrowed a back story for herself from the plot of Marilynne Robinson's novel 'Housekeeping'". But is that the origin of "Crib"? The article says Jake took Evan's plot, which Evan might have taken from someone else. The question is who originally conceived it before Evan. The article doesn't name that person, only mentions Housekeeping's plot was used by a character. So maybe N/A unless the Housekeeping character is the original, but the question is about the plot of "Crib". The article says Evan's plot was stolen by Jake, but Evan's plot might have been stolen from the Housekeeping character. But the original creator isn't named. So N/A.

6. The Vermont study found percentage overlap between similar arcs. The article says they found six basic shapes, but doesn't mention a specific percentage. So N/A.

7. Georges Polti's research period. The article says Polti's 1895 book, so his research was around 1895. The question is historical period, so late 19th century, but the exact period? The article says "in an 1895 book by the Frenchman Georges Polti (who credited it to Goethe, who in turn had gotten it from an 18th-century Italian)". So the research leading to his 36 plots was conducted in the late 19th century, specifically 1895. The answer is "1895" or "late 19th century". The question asks "during which historical period", so "late 19th century".

8. McNeal's wife's unpublished novel's name. The article says he used his wife's unpublished novel but doesn't name it. So N/A.

9. The most frequent emotional pattern found. The article mentions six basic shapes but doesn't name the most frequent. So N/A.

10. Critical response to "The Plagiarist's Lament". The article mentions that Goldberg fed the bot "McNeal" to generate a similar play, which resulted in "The Plagiarist's Lament". But the article doesn't discuss its critical response. The only mention is that critics faulted Akhtar's play for characters being notional. But the question is about the AI play's response, which isn't covered. So N/A.

11. Award received by Vermont researchers for analyzing LOTR. The article doesn't mention any award they received. N/A.

12. Percentage overlap between McNeal's books and his wife's novel. The article says McNeal's books included chatbot remasters of his wife's novel and others, but doesn't state a percentage. So N/A.

13. Satirical magazine similar to Private Eye that Booker established. The article says Booker was a founder of the British satirical magazine Private Eye. The question asks which similar magazine he established after his book. Since he already founded Private Eye, maybe that's the answer. The question says "similar in style to Booker's Private Eye", so the answer is "Private Eye".

14. Legal action in "The Sequel" protagonist vs. Korelitz. The article says "The Sequel" features a protagonist trying to supplant the original, but doesn't mention legal action against Korelitz. N/A.

15. Performance art Goethe inspired Polti's 36 plots. The article says Polti credited Goethe, who got it from an 18th-century Italian. It doesn't mention performance art. So N/A.

16. Subgenre pioneered by Kuang. The article lists "Yellowface" as part of contemporary work on imitation/appropriation. The question asks what subgenre of mystery she pioneered. The article doesn't specify, so N/A.

17. Bias eliminated by the software. The article says the software aims to eliminate subjective differences in count. The answer is "subjective bias".

18. Legal precedent from T.S. Eliot's estate. The article mentions Eliot as one of the allusions in "The Plot", but doesn't mention a legal precedent. N/A.

Now I need to check each answer again against the text:

1. N/A (no specific point mentioned)
2. Christopher Booker
3. Victorian doggerel (as per the article)
4. N/A
5. N/A (the article doesn't name the original creator before Evan)
6. N/A
7. 1895 (since the book was 1895)
Wait, the question says "historical period", so maybe "late 19th century" is better. The article says "1895 book by Georges Polti", so the period is 1895. But the question asks for the historical period, so maybe "the 19th century" but precise? The article says 1895, so the answer is 1895.
8. N/A
9. N/A
10. N/A
11. N/A
12. N/A
13. Private Eye (since he founded that)
14. N/A
15. N/A
16. N/A
17. Subjective bias (the article says "eliminating subjective differences in our count")
18. N/A
