Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and not any outside knowledge. Let me start with the first question.

1. **Which Indigenous Australian tribe considered Hanging Rock sacred according to the film's depiction of their spiritual connection to the land?**  
The article mentions that Indigenous Australians regarded the Rock as sacred, but it doesn't specify a tribe. So, the answer is N/A.

2. **How many minutes into the film does Miranda's disappearance occur, setting up the parallel with Hitchcock's handling of Janet Leigh's character in Psycho?**

The article says there's a pond with swans but doesn't name it. Answer N/A.

4. **Which character first notices the stopped watches at Hanging Rock, foreshadowing the temporal distortion?**  
The text doesn't mention any character noticing stopped watches. N/A.

5. **What poem by Edgar Allan Poe does Miranda quote in full during her contemplative moment before the climb?**  
She quotes "What we see and what we seem are but a dream -- a dream within a dream," which is part of Poe's poem "A Dream Within a Dream." The question asks for the full poem's title, but she only cites part. Since she didn't quote it in full, maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "in full," but she didn't. So the answer is N/A.

6. **How many episodes of Lena Dunham's satirical remake "Lunchtime at Dangling Boulder" were produced before the project was abandoned?**  
The article mentions Lena Dunham joked about making it but doesn't say if it was produced or how many episodes. So N/A.

7. **What color were the Victorian-era uniforms worn by the Appleyard College students during their fateful picnic?**  
The article doesn't mention the color of their uniforms. N/A.

8. **Which character in Sofia Coppola's filmography was directly inspired by Miranda from "Picnic at Hanging Rock"?**  
The text says Sofia Coppola was impressed by the film but doesn't name a specific character inspired by Miranda. N/A.

9. **What temperature was recorded at Hanging Rock on the day of filming the disappearance scene, contributing to the dreamlike atmosphere?**  
No mention of temperature during filming. N/A.

10. **Who played the role of Miranda in the 2018 television mini-series adaptation?**  
The article mentions the 2018 mini-series but doesn't list the cast. N/A.

11. **Considering Gheorghe Zamfir's contribution to the atmosphere of *Picnic at Hanging Rock*, what similar musical element was employed in *The Last Wave* to enhance its exploration of Indigenous Australian themes?**  
The article states that *The Last Wave* addressed Indigenous themes, but there's no mention of specific music. N/A.

12. **Given that *Picnic at Hanging Rock* was anointed Australia's greatest movie, what similar honor was bestowed upon the television mini-series adaptation of 2018?**  
The article doesn't mention any honor for the 2018 mini-series. N/A.

13. **If Lena Dunham's satirical remake, "Lunchtime at Dangling Boulder," had been greenlit, which streaming service mentioned in the article would have been the most likely platform for its release, mirroring the distribution strategy of Tom Green's new projects?**  
Tom Green's projects are with Amazon Prime. The article says he has new projects there, so maybe Amazon Prime. But the question is hypothetical. The article says Lena joked about it, but no info on her platform. However, the closest is Amazon Prime since Tom's projects are there. But the question is about Lena's project. Since the article doesn't link Lena to any platform, maybe N/A. Wait, the article's "Tom Green's Return" section says his projects are on Amazon Prime. The question asks which service mentioned in the article (like Netflix, Max, Disney+, Amazon, Hulu) would be the likely platform, mirroring Tom's. So Amazon Prime. So the answer is Amazon Prime Video.

14. **In what year did Vincent Canby, in his *New York Times* review, describe the original *Picnic at Hanging Rock* as a film that was released after *The Last Wave*?**  
The article says *The Last Wave* was released in the U.S. before *Hanging Rock*. Vincent Canby's review is from 1979. Since *The Last Wave* (1977) was before *Hanging Rock* (1975?), wait, no, the article says *The Last Wave* was released before *Hanging Rock*. Wait, the article says: "Weir addressed this lack with 'The Last Wave' (1977), an occult thriller released in the United States before 'Hanging Rock.'" But *Hanging Rock* is from 1975. The article says the U.S. release of *The Last Wave* was before *Hanging Rock*, but the original release dates are 1975 (Hanging Rock) and 1977 (Last Wave). So in the U.S., Last Wave came out before Hanging Rock. Vincent Canby's review was in 1979, so he would note that. The question asks the year when Canby's review stated that Hanging Rock was released after The Last Wave. Since Canby wrote in 1979, the answer is 1979.

15. **Besides Miranda, what other character from *Picnic at Hanging Rock*, described as resembling a Botticelli angel, was highlighted by J. Hoberman as central to the film's Valentine's Day setting?**  
The article says Mademoiselle compares Miranda to a Botticelli angel. The question asks another character. Wait, the text says "Mademoiselle Dianne de Poitiers (Helen Morse), allows several of the girls to explore... led by Miranda, whom Mademoiselle compares to a Botticelli angel." So only Miranda is mentioned. The question is wrong, so answer N/A.

16. **Considering the thematic focus on power dynamics in sex scenes, as seen in *Anora*, what similar exploration of complex relationships was central to the plot of the original novel *Picnic at Hanging Rock*, according to the Australian Film Institute?**  
The article states the novel was inspired by a dream. The AFI anointed the film as greatest, but the question is about the novel's theme related to power dynamics. The article says the film's ending includes "dreams, blurred photos, secret shrines, public freakouts, visions and suicides." The original novel's plot according to the AFI? The article doesn't mention power dynamics in the novel. So N/A.

17. **What geological epoch, preceding the Miocene, is mentioned as being relevant to the setting of the new 4K restoration of the 1998 director's cut of *Picnic at Hanging Rock*?**  
The rock is from the Miocene epoch. The question asks for a preceding epoch. The article doesn't mention any other epoch. So N/A.

18. **How many young women, in addition to the schoolgirls, vanished at Hanging Rock, according to the IFC Center's program notes for the film's re-release?**  
The article says three schoolgirls and their teacher vanished. The question asks "in addition to the schoolgirls"â€”so the teacher is one. The total is 3 girls + teacher = 4, but the question specifies "young women" so maybe the teacher counts. The article says "three schoolgirls and their teacher" so the answer is 1 (the teacher). But does the teacher count as a young woman? The article says "their teacher," so perhaps the teacher is an adult. If "young women" excludes the teacher, then N/A. The article says "three schoolgirls and their teacher vanished," so total is 4, but "young women" might not include the teacher. The question is unclear, but since the article states "three schoolgirls and their teacher," maybe the teacher is counted separately, but the question asks for "in addition to the schoolgirls," so the answer is 1 (the teacher). But the article doesn't specify if the teacher is a young woman. Since the article doesn't clarify, N/A?

Wait, the article says "three schoolgirls and their teacher vanished". The question is asking how many young women besides the schoolgirls. If the teacher is a young woman, then 1. If not, then N/A. The article refers to the teacher as "Mademoiselle Dianne de Poitiers (Helen Morse)", and since she's an adult teacher, maybe she's not considered a young woman. The question might be tricky. Since the article doesn't specify, answer N/A.

19. **What specific type of Victorian artifact, abundant at Appleyard College, is described as contributing to the "outback uncanny" atmosphere in the same way that Black cinema is chronicling Black life at a different speed?**  
The article says "well-stocked with Victorian knickknacks" contributing to the "outback uncanny." The knickknacks are the artifacts. So the answer is Victorian knickknacks. The comparison to Black cinema is a separate point, but the question asks for the specific type of artifact. So "Victorian knickknacks".

20. **What role did the headmistress, played by Helen Morse, have in the events at Hanging Rock, according to the narrative structure reminiscent of *L'Avventura* and *Psycho*?**  
The headmistress is described as "dragonlike" and gave orders. The narrative structure involves characters vanishing, leading to a procedural. The article says the teacher allowed the girls to explore against orders. The headmistress's role is giving orders, but the narrative structure's role might be that her authority is disregarded. The question asks her role in the events. The article says the teacher (Mademoiselle) allowed the girls to go, against the headmistress's orders. So the headmistress's role was to have given the orders that were disobeyed, leading to the disappearance. The answer is that she was the headmistress who ordered the girls not to explore the rock, but her role in the events is that her orders were ignored. The question might want the role as the authority figure whose commands were disobeyed. The answer is "headmistress who ordered the girls not to explore the rock" but the article says "disregarding the orders of the school's dragonlike headmistress". So the role was giving the orders that were disobeyed. The answer is "gave orders that were disobeyed". Alternatively, the article says "disregarding the orders of the school's dragonlike headmistress", so her role was issuing the orders that were ignored. The question is about her role in the events according to the narrative structure like the other films. The answer should be that her orders were disregarded, leading to the disappearances. But the question asks "what role did the headmistress... have in the events". The answer is that her orders were disobeyed, leading to the girls' exploration. So the role was issuing orders that were ignored. But the exact wording from the article: "disregarding the orders of the school's dragonlike headmistress, the young French teacher... allowed several of the girls to explore the forbidden geological formation". So the headmistress's role was giving the orders that were disobeyed. So the answer is "issued orders that were disobeyed by the teacher and girls".
