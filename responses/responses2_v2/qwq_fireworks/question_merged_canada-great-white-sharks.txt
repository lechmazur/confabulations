Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks for the total weight of the brain tissue samples described as "reddish cubes" from the Long Island shark that Dr. Newton received. The article mentions that Dr. Newton received "reddish cubes taken from a shark found on Long Island, N.Y., on July 20 of that year." However, there's no specific weight mentioned for these samples. The text talks about the liver's weight (76 pounds) in the first shark but not the brain tissue samples' weight. So the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2:** This asks how many bacterial strains were identified in the genetic sequencing of the South Carolina shark's brain tissue. The article states that the genetic sequencing hasn't been completed yet. Since the process is ongoing, there's no data available. So N/A here as well.

3. **Question 3:** The question is about which Canadian university's marine biology department first linked porpoise consumption to meningoencephalitis. The article mentions that one shark had porpoise remains in its stomach but didn't have meningoencephalitis. The Atlantic Veterinary College at the University of Prince Edward Island did the necropsy, but they didn't find a correlation. The text doesn't mention any university making such a correlation. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Average depth before beaching. The article mentions a shark found in 30 feet of water near Halifax, but that's where it was recovered, not its swimming depth. There's no data on their typical depth before beaching. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Months between death and analysis for the shark with porpoise remains. The shark with porpoise in its stomach was part of the three necropsied by MARS. The article says the South Carolina shark's samples were sent later, but the porpoise shark's analysis was done. However, the timeline isn't specified. The shark was found in November 2023, but the analysis completion isn't mentioned. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Percentage of the shark population with brain inflammation. The article doesn't provide population statistics or percentages, only that out of nine deaths, most had brain inflammation. Without total population numbers, can't calculate percentage. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Dr. Jones' initial suspicion before the pattern emerged. The text says she first thought it was more interesting than alarming. The initial thought was about possible infection, but the question asks what she initially suspected before the pattern. The article says starvation was ruled out early. The cause wasn't obvious, so maybe she didn't have an initial bacterial suspicion yet. The text doesn't state her first suspicion, so N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Measured increase in brain tissue volume. The article mentions brain swelling but doesn't provide specific volume measurements. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Number of pathologists involved in protocols. The article states there are few protocols connecting officials with scientists. It doesn't mention how many pathologists developed the protocols. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Average time between death and preservation for conclusive cases. The first shark's necropsy was done the next morning while "really fresh," so maybe a day. Others might have varied. The article doesn't give average time, so N/A.
