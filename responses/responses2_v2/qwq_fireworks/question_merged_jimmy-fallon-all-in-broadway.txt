Okay, I need to go through each question and find the answers strictly based on the provided article. Let me start with question 1. The question is asking about Nick Kroll's role in the segment where Fallon portrayed a pirate softening toward a little girl. Wait, the article mentions that in the tender moment, Fallon and his fellow pirate softened toward a little girl. But does it say who else was in that scene with him? The article says Nick Kroll was part of the cast on Tuesday night, but the specific role isn't mentioned. The question is about Nick Kroll's role in that particular segment. The article doesn't specify his character's name there, so maybe the answer is N/A.

Question 2: How many minutes faster was Fallon's commute compared to Steve Allen's in 1954? The article says Fallon walked from 30 Rockefeller Plaza to the Hudson Theater in 8 minutes. It mentions that Steve Allen started "The Tonight Show" there in 1954. But the article doesn't give any info about Steve Allen's commute time, so we can't compare. Answer is N/A.

Question 3: Besides "Gypsy," what other Broadway production did Fallon mention Patti LuPone performing in during his Late Night years? The article says he remembered Patti LuPone performing from "Gypsy," and that's all. So no other show mentioned, so N/A.

Question 4: What prop sent by Fallon's dog Gary was near the balloons? The article states that the balloons were sent by Fallon's family (and his dog Gary). Wait, the wording is "sent by Fallon's family (and his dog Gary)"—maybe the dog is part of the family, but the prop is the balloons. The question is asking for a prop sent by the dog specifically. Since it's the family including the dog, but the balloons were sent by them collectively. The article doesn't mention another prop from the dog. So maybe the answer is N/A, or perhaps the balloons themselves? But the question says "prop sent by Gary", but the article says "sent by Fallon's family (and his dog Gary)"—so maybe the balloons were the prop, but since it's the family and the dog, maybe the answer is balloons. Wait the question says "prop, sent by Fallon's dog Gary"—but the article says the balloons were sent by the family and the dog. The wording is a bit ambiguous. Maybe the answer is "balloons" but the question is tricky. Alternatively, perhaps there's another prop. The article doesn't mention another item, so maybe N/A?

Wait, the exact quote is: "his family (and his dog Gary). 'Here we go. We're on Broadway,' Fallon recalled Miranda saying." So the balloons were sent by the family and Gary. But since the dog can't send balloons, maybe it's just the family, but the dog is mentioned as part of the group. The question is asking for a prop sent by the dog, but the article doesn't specify that. So probably N/A.

Question 5: What audio recording did Fallon listen to, as described by his wife? The article says Fallon put his lines on a voice memo and listened to them on Audible while walking to work. The wife knew he was nervous and he was listening to his own lines. The question is about the type of audio recording: it's his lines recorded as a voice memo, which he listened to via Audible. The answer should be "voice memo" or "his lines on a voice memo" but the exact term from the text is "voice memo". The question asks for the specific type, so "voice memo".

Question 6: In what year did Fallon identify with the Broadway community's focus, mirroring his childhood dream? The article says he identified with their singular focus because he wanted to be on SNL since childhood. The question is about the year he identified with that aspiration. The text doesn't mention a specific year, just that he wanted it since childhood. So N/A.

Question 7: What character did Aidy Bryant portray alongside Fallon's Elephant Man in a tender moment? The article mentions Fallon's roles include the Elephant Man, but it doesn't specify Aidy Bryant's role in that scene. The tender moment involved Fallon and his fellow pirate with a little girl. Aidy Bryant's character isn't named here. So N/A.

Question 8: What did the California fan praise after giving flowers? The fan attended both shows and gave flowers. The article says the audience cheered Fallon's efforts, but doesn't specify what the fan praised. So N/A.

Question 9: How many times a week does Fallon perform on Broadway? The article says he's performing in "All In" four days a week. Wait, the first line says "Four days a week, Jimmy Fallon performs for a TV audience of millions... But stepping onto the stage... made him nervous". Wait, the four days a week is for his TV show. The article says " Fallon will only appear for eight performances" but the schedule for "All In" is mentioned as four days a week? Wait, the article says " Fallon, 50, who on Tuesday night shared the stage with... will only appear for eight performances". The question is about the schedule mentioned for "All In". The article says "Four days a week, Jimmy Fallon performs for a TV audience... But stepping onto the stage of the Hudson Theater..." so the four days a week is for TV. The play's schedule isn't explicitly stated as four days a week. Wait, the article says " Fallon will only appear for eight performances" but the article might not say how many days a week he's performing. The question asks "according to the schedule mentioned for 'All In'?" The article says " Fallon, who on Tuesday night shared the stage... will only appear for eight performances". But the exact days per week aren't given. The play's general schedule isn't specified here. So N/A. Wait, but the article says " Fallon will only appear for eight performances" but the play itself has a rotating cast. The question is how many times a week Fallon is performing. Since he's only in it for eight performances, but the article doesn't state how many days a week those are spread over. Maybe the answer is N/A.

Wait, the first paragraph says "Four days a week, Jimmy Fallon performs for a TV audience of millions... But stepping onto the stage..." So the four days a week is TV. The play's schedule isn't mentioned in terms of days per week for Fallon specifically. The question is about Fallon's Broadway schedule for "All In". Since he's only in it for eight performances, but the frequency isn't given, so N/A.

Question 10: The historic venue he referenced as the birthplace of his show. The article says the Hudson Theater was where "The Tonight Show" started under Steve Allen in 1954. So the answer is "Hudson Theater".

Question 11: The legendary performer who didn't need a mic, from "Gypsy". The article mentions Patti LuPone from "Gypsy", so the answer is "Patti LuPone".

Question 12: The peculiar rehearsal habit involving tech that he feared embarrassment. He recorded his lines as a voice memo and listened to them on Audible. The method is using a voice memo/audiobook. The question asks what method he used, so "voice memo" or "listening to his lines via Audible". The exact answer from the text is "voice memo".

Question 13: Who directed "All In"? The article says it's directed by Alex Timbers. So the answer is "Alex Timbers".

Question 14: The role he described as an "interesting stretch" was the tender moment with the pirate and girl. The article says "when he and his fellow pirate softened toward a little girl in their care — which Fallon said was 'an interesting stretch for me'". So the role was the pirate.

Question 15: The unique challenge of theater vs TV. Fallon said theater requires doing it again and having to do better each time, unlike TV which writes daily. The unique challenge is having to repeat the performance and improve each time. The answer is "having to perform the same show repeatedly and improve each time" but the question asks for the challenge implied unique to theater. The article says "With this, I have to do it again... I could have done that better...". The answer is "repeating the performance and needing to improve each night".

But the question asks for the challenge unique to theater. The answer would be "the need to perfect the performance each night" but the exact phrasing from the text is "I have to do it again... I could have done that better..." So the challenge is the repetition and needing to get it right each time. The question might expect "repeating the performance" as the unique aspect. Alternatively, the article says "theater requires different muscles... With this, I have to do it again". So the answer is "having to perform the same show repeatedly".

Question 16: First person he saw at the theater was Miranda. The article says Miranda was the first person he saw upon arriving, standing next to the balloons. So "Lin-Manuel Miranda".

Question 17: The historical year he mentioned for the venue. Steve Allen started "Tonight Show" there in 1954. So the answer is "1954".

Question 18: The musical duo leading the band. The article mentions "a band led by the married couple the Bengsons". So the answer is "the Bengsons".

Question 19: The character with a distinctive physical condition. The Elephant Man. The article says he portrayed the Elephant Man among other roles. So "Elephant Man".
