Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start by going through each question and cross-referencing with the text.

1. **Question 1**: Which African nation's president specifically praised China's role in making the $35 billion solar initiative possible through their manufacturing capabilities?

Looking through the article, I remember that Akinwumi Adesina mentioned China's solar industry enabling the lenders to push solar. However, the article doesn't mention any African president praising China specifically. The text says China built the solar industry, but no president is named. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2**: How many African women die annually from indoor charcoal cooking according to Adesina?

The article quotes Adesina saying women are dying from cooking with charcoal, but no specific number or annual statistic is given. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Percentage reduction in diesel generator usage after the solar program?

The article states that currently, businesses use diesel generators, but there's no projected percentage reduction mentioned. N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Which European investment bank committed the largest portion?

The article mentions the World Bank and African Development Bank as part of the lenders. It doesn't specify which European bank contributed the most. The EU isn't named here. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Total private sector matching funds secured during the summit?

The article talks about $35B in loans but doesn't mention private funds or matching from the summit. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Number of villages for first phase?

No specific number of villages is given. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Timeline for completing all grids?

The article mentions the program but no specific timeline. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Which African country's pilot program was the model?

9. **Question 9**: Percentage for technician training?

No allocation percentage for training is mentioned. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Number of jobs created?

The article doesn't state a specific job number. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Percentage increase for NY solar farm vs. China's investment?

The NY solar farm got $950M. China's low-carbon investment was $828B. The question asks for a percentage increase compared to China's total. Wait, the article says China's spending increased by 23% from 2023. The NY project's funding isn't compared to China's growth rate. So the question is about the NY investment's % increase relative to China's 23%? Not clear. The article doesn't give a direct comparison. So N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Fossil fuel Babayev advocated for?

The article says African countries are using diesel generators. Babayev was mentioned in the crowd, but there's no statement from him about advocating a fossil fuel. So N/A.

13. **Question 13**: Number of EVs from Helion's $425M?

The question assumes EV cost based on spending trends. The article mentions EVs got $757B globally, but not per vehicle cost. Can't compute. N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Proportion for trash-burning like Miami's?

The article mentions Miami's incinerator but doesn't link it to the African loans. So N/A.

15. **Question 15**: Coal unit impacted by heat pumps?

The article says coal is 16% in the US. The specific coal unit mentioned is "401 coal units" but no name. So N/A.

16. **Question 16**: GHG emissions avoided by hydropower dam?

The article mentions China's hydropower plans but no specific emissions figure. N/A.

17. **Question 17**: Percentage of Africa's grid to replace to match Europe's solar/coal ratio?

Africa's grid is 75% fossil fuels, Europe's solar over coal. The article doesn't give exact numbers to calculate the percentage needed. N/A.

18. **Question 18**: Investment after 6 years at China's rate?

China's investment grew 23% from 2023. If $35B grows at 23% annually for 6 years, but the question says mirroring China's timeline (achieved 2030 target 6 years early). The article says China hit 1200 GW 6 years early. The question asks for total after 6 years. But the math isn't provided in the text. So N/A.

19. **Question 19**: Policy action similar to EU's subsidy?

Adesina's proposal isn't mentioned. The EU plans a subsidy for EVs, but Adesina's speech focused on energy access, not a specific policy like subsidies. N/A.

Alright, all questions checked. Most require N/A because the article doesn't provide specific numbers or details needed.
