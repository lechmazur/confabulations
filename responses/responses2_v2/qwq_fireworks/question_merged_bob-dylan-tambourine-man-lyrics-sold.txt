Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not anything else. Let's start with question 1.

1. The first question asks for the selling price of the original lyrics. The article mentions they sold for more than $500,000. So that's straightforward. The answer is over $500,000.

2. The second question is about how many boxes Myles found the lyrics in. The article says he sifted through 250 boxes. But the question is specifically about the number of boxes where the lyrics were found. The text says he unearthed them while organizing, but doesn't specify which box. So the exact number isn't given. Answer: N/A.

3. The third question asks which record label released the first version of "Mr. Tambourine Man". The article states the song was on Dylan's 1965 album "Bringing It All Back Home", but doesn't mention the label. So N/A here.

4. The fourth question is the model of the typewriter Dylan used. The article says "portable typewriter" and "Saturday Evening Post copy paper", but no model. So N/A.

5. How many home recordings were found? The article mentions "rare home recordings from musical titans" but doesn't specify the count. Answer N/A.

6. The date of the column is 1973, as stated in the text. The exact date isn't given, so just the year? Wait, the question asks for the date. The article says "a 1973 column for The New York Sunday News", so the exact date isn't there. So answer N/A.

7. Number of cigarettes Dylan smoked? The article mentions "chain-lit Camels cigarette smoke" but not the count. So N/A.

8. Dimensions of the speakers: the article says "six-foot speakers". That's the exact phrase, so the answer is six-foot.

9. The winning bidder's name isn't mentioned in the article. So N/A.

10. The time Dylan finished writing before crashing on the couch isn't provided. N/A.

11. The song that was replayed was "Can I Get A Witness?" by Marvin Gaye. The question links it to the "six-foot speakers" reference. The article says Dylan put the needle back each time the record finished. So the answer is "Can I Get A Witness?".

12. Original title of the album? The article doesn't mention any previous title for "Bringing It All Back Home". So N/A.

13. The literary figure compared to Dylan's editing? The article mentions Richard Thomas teaches classics and a course on Dylan's writing, but no specific author compared. So N/A.

14. Health condition from smoking? The article doesn't mention any health issues Dylan had attributed to his smoking during that session. The column mentions the smoke, but not a condition. N/A.

15. The social media platform's shutdown in China? The article says Dylan joined TikTok before it appeared set to be shut down in the US, not China. The question mentions China, so that's incorrect. So answer N/A.

16. Instrument influencing the tambourine motif? The hi-fi setup description mentions speakers, but no other instruments. The tambourine is in the song's title, but the setup's instruments? The article doesn't say. N/A.

17. Suze Rotolo's role in the biopic "A Complete Unknown"? The article states she appeared on the 1963 album cover and Dylan split with her before writing the song. But her role in the biopic isn't mentioned. So N/A.

18. Pulitzer Prize-winning author who collaborated? The article doesn't mention any collaboration with an author for authentication. Myles wants to archive, but no name given. N/A.
