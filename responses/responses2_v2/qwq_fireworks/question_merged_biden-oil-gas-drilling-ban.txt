Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make assumptions beyond what's written.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions that Trump imposed a 10-year moratorium on the Atlantic coast during his re-election campaign. But it doesn't say any governors initially supported Biden's ban before changing their position after consulting with the fishing industry. So, no info here. Answer N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The article doesn't provide specific barrel numbers for the Eastern Seaboard's potential production. It says there's been almost no exploration there since 1969. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The Northern Bering Sea is part of the banned areas, but the article doesn't state the percentage of natural gas reserves there. N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Biden cited the International Energy Agency (IEA) regarding stopping new oil/gas for climate reasons. The question asks which environmental org's data he used. The IEA isn't an environmental org, so maybe the article doesn't mention it. Wait, the article says environmental groups referenced the IEA. But the question is about Biden citing an environmental org. Since the article doesn't name one, N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The 2019 Alaska court ruling is mentioned, but the question asks for a 1970s precedent. The article doesn't reference any from that era. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The article mentions the ban safeguards fishing and tourism economies but doesn't give specific job numbers from a White House assessment. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The new California monuments' boundaries were based on tribal lands, but no specific tribes are named. The article doesn't mention which nations provided documentation. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The article says existing leases aren't affected, but no monetary value is given. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: No specific international company's study is cited for the eastern Gulf risks. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: No mention of a bipartisan congressional group. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The article says Obama banned ~98% of Arctic waters. Biden's order mirrors that, so 98%.

12. **Question 12**: Republicans could use budget reconciliation to require lease sales with a simple majority. The article mentions this possibility.

13. **Question 13**: The new California monuments' announcement on Tuesday would be impacted if the Arctic ban was overturned, as the lawsuit involved similar legal issues. The monuments' boundaries might be affected by drilling.

14. **Question 14**: The Gulf of Mexico produces 97% of offshore gas, which remains unaffected. The answer is 97%.

15. **Question 15**: The only active Arctic facility is the Beaufort Sea's single facility. That's the one mentioned.

16. **Question 16**: Trump placed a 10-year moratorium on the Atlantic coast, which had some moratorium since 2006. Wait, the eastern Gulf was under moratorium since 2006? The question says "under some form of drilling restriction since 2006" and Trump's 2020 moratorium. The eastern Gulf's moratorium started in 2006. Wait, the article says the eastern Gulf has been under moratorium since 2006. Trump's 2020 moratorium was on the Atlantic. Wait, need to check. The article says: "the eastern Gulf of Mexico has been under some form of drilling moratorium since 2006." Trump's 2020 moratorium was on the Atlantic. So the answer is the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

17. **Question 17**: Obama protected deepwater corals and rare fish in the Atlantic. The lawsuit was about that area.

18. **Question 18**: The article mentions Florida and Carolinas' congressional reps opposed Trump's 2018 plan. So those reps would oppose again.

19. **Question 19**: Biden cited the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster. Opponents would use that to argue against amendments.

20. **Question 20**: The Willow project in Alaska's National Petroleum Reserve was approved by Biden despite his promises. That's the one.
