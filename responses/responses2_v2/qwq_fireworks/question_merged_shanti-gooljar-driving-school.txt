Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any external knowledge. Let me start with the first question.

1. **Where in Connecticut does Ms. Gooljar usually dine on lobster and crab?**  
The article mentions she sometimes dines at a place on City Island called the Original Crab Shanty. Since City Island is part of the Bronx, but the question specifies Connecticut, I need to check again. Wait, no, the article says she goes to the Original Crab Shanty on City Island. Wait, City Island is actually in the Bronx, New York, not Connecticut. But the article says she sometimes dines there or her son's place in Connecticut. The question asks where in Connecticut, so maybe it's her son's location? But the article states she goes to the Original Crab Shanty on City Island, which is in NYC. The question might be a trick. The answer is N/A because the restaurant is in NYC, not Connecticut. Wait, the article says "sometimes we'll go to a place on City Island -- the Original Crab Shanty..." but City Island is in the Bronx. Since the question specifies Connecticut, there's no mention of a Connecticut location. So N/A.

2. **How many siblings did Ms. Gooljar have when she moved to a ground-floor space next to a police station?**  
The article says she moved to a ground-floor space after her sons were born, with her husband. The siblings part refers to when she immigrated from Guyana in 1972 with four siblings. The question is about when she moved to the ground-floor space, which was after having her sons. The number of siblings she had when moving isn't mentioned. The four siblings are from her own family when she immigrated. The question is about the number of siblings she had when moving to the ground-floor space. Since that's after her marriage and kids, but siblings are her own from before. The answer is N/A because the question is about her own siblings, which were four when she came to the US, but the move to the ground-floor space's time doesn't mention siblings. Wait, maybe the question is about her own siblings? The article says she came with four siblings, so she has four siblings. But the question is how many she had when moving to the ground-floor space. Since she had four siblings when she came, and the number doesn't change, maybe the answer is four? Wait, but the question is about when she moved to the ground-floor space. The article says "After the births of her sons... she and her husband upgraded from a studio to a ground-floor space..." So at that time, her own siblings are still her four, but the question is about her own siblings? The answer would be four, but the question is phrased as "how many siblings did Ms. Gooljar have" when moving there. Since she had four siblings when she came, and that's a fact given, but the question's context is about the move. Unless the ground-floor space's move had something to do with her siblings, which it doesn't. The answer is N/A because the question is about her own siblings when moving, which isn't specified. Wait, the article states she moved with her husband, so her siblings aren't part of that. So the answer is N/A.

3. **What driving school did Ms. Gooljar work at after deciding that being a paramedic was not for her?**  
The article says after two years as a paramedic, she turned to a driving school in the Bronx. The name isn't given. The question is asking for the name of the school, but it's not mentioned. So N/A.

4. **What make of car did Ms. Gooljar purchase when she decided to go freelance?**  
The article says she bought her own car but doesn't specify the make. So N/A.

5. **How many students failed Ms. Gooljar's road test in the year her husband died?**  
Her husband died in 2022. The article says "I can count on one hand the number of people who failed last year." "Last year" when the article was written? If the article is current, but the husband died in 2022, so the year he died would be 2022. The "last year" might refer to the previous year from when the article was written. But the article doesn't specify the exact year of publication. However, the question asks for the number in the year her husband died. The article states "I can count on one hand the number of people who failed last year." If "last year" was 2022 (the year he died), then the answer would be less than five. But the exact number isn't given. The question wants the exact number, so N/A because it's not specified.

6. **What is the name of the 94-year-old Ms. Gooljar is currently teaching?**  
The article mentions teaching a 94-year-old but doesn't provide their name. So N/A.

7. **What role did Kelly Reilly play in the show that Ms. Gooljar enjoys after her shower?**  
The show is "Yellowstone," and Kelly Reilly plays Beth Dutton. The article mentions "his character's daughter, Beth -- she's the bomb. I'd love to meet her. Maybe Kelly Reilly, who plays her, needs driving lessons..." So the role is Beth (Dutton). The full name might be needed, but "Beth" is sufficient. So answer: Beth.

8. **What prep school does Ms. Gooljar mention by name as a source of many of her students?**  
The article says she gets a lot of prep school students but doesn't name any specific school. So N/A.

9. **What was the occupation of Ms. Gooljar's friend whose funeral she attended in Virginia?**  
She was driving to her girlfriend's funeral. The occupation isn't mentioned. So N/A.

10. **What flavor of beef curry does Ms. Gooljar prepare for her son, Michael?**  
The article says she can cook beef curry but doesn't specify the flavor. So N/A.

11. **Which Oscar-winning actor's daughter character from a Western TV series does Shanti Gooljar admire enough to joke about potentially teaching them to drive?**  
The show is "Yellowstone," which is a Western. The actor is Kevin Costner, who plays John Dutton. His daughter's character is Beth, played by Kelly Reilly. Kevin Costner has won an Oscar for Dances with Wolves. So the answer is Kevin Costner.

12. **What type of shellfish does Shanti Gooljar specifically mention ordering during dinners at the Original Crab Shanty on City Island?**  
The article mentions lobsters and crabs. So both, but the question asks for the type she specifically mentions. The answer would be "lobster and crab" but maybe "crabs" as a type? The article says "eat lobsters and crabs," so both are mentioned. The question asks for the type, so maybe "lobster" and "crab" are separate. But the question is singular? Wait, the question says "type of shellfish" so perhaps the answer is both, but the options are to list them. The answer is lobsters and crabs, but the question might want one. Wait the exact quote: "eat lobsters and crabs". So the types are lobsters and crabs. But the question asks for "what type", so maybe either is acceptable. The answer would be "lobster and crab" but perhaps the question expects one. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "crab" since the restaurant's name is "Crab Shanty". Hmm, but the article says both. Since the question is "type", plural is okay? The answer is "lobsters and crabs".

13. **How many Dunkin' locations does Shanti Gooljar explicitly name as her regular coffee stops in the article?**  
The article mentions two: "the one in the Bronx on Webster Avenue, and the one in Harlem near 122nd Street." So two.

14. **Which deceased family member's profession is implied to have influenced Shanti Gooljar’s decision to prioritize safety during driving lessons?**  
She was a paramedic before, so maybe her husband's job? Or her own experience as a paramedic. The article says she prioritizes safety, but the question is about a deceased family member's profession. Her husband, Vinny, is deceased but his profession isn't mentioned. Wait, she was a paramedic herself, so maybe her own experience influenced her, but the question is about a family member. Since the husband's job isn't stated, maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "I'm more experienced. I'd never gotten a speeding ticket in 45 years of driving until September, when I was driving to my girlfriend's funeral in Virginia on the highway." But no family member's profession is mentioned except her own paramedic job. The question implies a deceased family member's job influenced her safety focus. Since the only deceased is her husband, but his job isn't stated, maybe N/A. Alternatively, maybe her paramedic background (her own job) influenced it, but the question specifies a family member. So N/A.

15. **What is the total number of instructors employed at Empire State Driving School, including Shanti herself?**  
The article says the school has five other instructors, so total is 6 (including her). So 6.

16. **Which New York City borough’s police station is adjacent to Shanti Gooljar’s current residence?**  
She lives in a three-bedroom apartment in the Bronx near where she lived when she immigrated. The current residence is next to a police station. So the borough is the Bronx.

17. **What specific type of vehicle modification does Shanti Gooljar require for her teaching cars to handle Manhattan traffic emergencies?**  
The article doesn't mention any specific modifications. So N/A.

18. **Which daytime television host’s child is explicitly named as having taken lessons from Shanti Gooljar’s school?**  
The article mentions teaching the offspring of Jerry Seinfeld, Rupert Murdoch, Vera Wang, Katie Couric. Jerry Seinfeld is a comedian, but Katie Couric is a TV host (daytime maybe on talk shows). So Katie Couric's child. The question is about a daytime TV host. Katie Couric is a former daytime talk show host. So the answer is Katie Couric.

19. **What is the exact age difference in years between Shanti Gooljar’s two sons, Philip and Michael?**  
Philip is 43, Michael is 38. The difference is 5 years.

20. **Which highway was Shanti Gooljar driving on when she received her first-ever speeding ticket in September?**  
The article says she was driving to her girlfriend's funeral in Virginia on the highway. The specific highway isn't named. So N/A.
