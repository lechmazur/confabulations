Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information given in the article and follow the strict instructions. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then check the article for the answers.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks about another mural in the neighborhood besides Jimi Hendrix. The article mentions passing a "large purple mural of Jimi Hendrix" but doesn't mention any other murals. So the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many years Nate studied under Thich Nhat Hanh. The article says Nate was a meditation teacher and introduced the author to the book, but there's no info on how long he studied. N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Specific OCD thought involving a household chore. The author mentions intrusive thoughts like worrying about praying before meals. That's a religious act, but the question specifies a household chore. The article doesn't mention a chore-related thought. N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Flavor of hummus. The article says "homemade dessert hummus" but doesn't specify the flavor. Since "dessert" is the type, maybe that's the answer? Wait, dessert hummus is a type, not flavor. The article doesn't mention a specific flavor like chocolate or something. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Year "The Miracle of Mindfulness" was written. The article states it's celebrating its 50th year in 2023 (since the article is current when written). So 2023 minus 50 would be 1973. But the article says it's his second book and the 50th anniversary. So the answer is 1973?

6. **Question 6:** Name of the meditation app recommended by Wirecutter. The article mentions "download a meditation app" and Wirecutter's recommendations, but doesn't name any specific app. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Vehicle the author thought about swerving into. The intrusive thought is "that I'd swerve into oncoming traffic." The vehicle would be oncoming cars. The question asks for the specific type, like cars. But the article just says "oncoming traffic," so maybe "oncoming traffic" is the answer? But the question specifies "vehicle," so perhaps "oncoming traffic" is acceptable. Wait, "oncoming traffic" refers to vehicles. The answer should be "oncoming traffic."

8. **Question 8:** Retreat center in New York. The article mentions the author wondered about retreats in New York but doesn't name any. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Total books by Thich Nhat Hanh. The article says over 100 titles, including "The Miracle of Mindfulness." The exact number isn't given, so N/A (since it's "more than 100," but the question asks for total, which can't be exact).

10. **Question 10:** Specific medication. The article mentions "a consistent schedule of therapy and medication" but doesn't name the drug. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Retreat center in New England where Brother Phap Luu originated. The article says he's a monk originally from New England, but doesn't name a retreat center there. N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Statistical probability cited. The author tried using logic/statistics against the traffic thought but the article doesn't mention a specific number or probability. N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Years between Deer Park's founding and Stefano's visit. Deer Park was founded 25 years ago (in 2023 minus 25 = 1998). The article says the author visited "last month" (assuming 2023), so 25 years. Answer is 25.
