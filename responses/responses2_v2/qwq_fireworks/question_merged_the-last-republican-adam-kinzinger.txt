4. **During which month in 2021 did Kinzinger conduct his final office interview with Pink where he discussed his views on conservative Christianity?**

    - No data on viewership. N/A.

11. **What prompted Kinzinger, described by McCarthy as a "Pelosi Republican," to label Pink a "Communist" before correcting himself to "Progressive," ultimately leading to the filming of "The Last Republican"?**

    - The film is "Hot Tub Time Machine," a comedy. So the genre is comedy.
