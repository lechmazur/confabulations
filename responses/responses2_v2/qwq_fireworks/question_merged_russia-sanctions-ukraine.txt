Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article and answer exactly what's asked. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. The first question asks about the percentage reduction in Russia's military capabilities due to sanctions, according to the dean of the London Business School (Sergei Guriev). The article mentions that Guriev argues sanctions hampered Moscow's ability to wage war effectively, but there's no specific percentage given. So the answer is N/A.

2. The second question is about a Middle Eastern nation identified by Patricia Cohen as the primary facilitator of Russia's oil exports. The article says Turkey and the UAE (United Arab Emirates) allowed goods to pass through. Since UAE is in the Middle East, that's the answer. Wait, the question says "primary," but the article mentions both. But the UAE is a Middle Eastern nation. So answer UAE.

3. Third question: number of Russian banks removed from SWIFT in the first six months. The article states Russia was banished from SWIFT, but doesn't specify the count. So N/A.

4. Fourth question: total value of Russian assets unfrozen by Chinese banks via alternative systems. The article doesn't mention any specific numbers here. N/A.

5. Fifth question: former Soviet republic that's a key intermediary for tech exports. The article mentions Turkey and UAE, but they aren't Soviet republics. Maybe none are mentioned. The answer would be N/A.

6. Sixth question: monthly interest rate for Russian businesses after being cut off from dollars. The article says the central bank raised rates to 21%, which is annual. Monthly would be 21%/12 â‰ˆ 1.75%, but the article doesn't specify monthly. So N/A.

7. Seventh question: number of European companies exempt from oil price cap. The article says the EU replaced sanctions with a price cap, but doesn't mention exemptions. N/A.

8. Eighth: average processing time for Russian payments via alternative systems. The article says SWIFT's absence increased cost and time, but no specific time mentioned. N/A.

9. Ninth: Russian oligarch cited by Andrew Shoyer as challenging sanctions in court. The article doesn't name any oligarchs in that context. N/A.

10. Tenth: percentage of shadow fleet tankers registered in countries with ties to both Moscow and Washington. The article mentions Russia's own shadow fleet but doesn't give registration details. N/A.

11. Eleventh: economist who fled to London in 2013 (Sergei Guriev) argued sanctions prevented Russia from winning by 2024. The article says Guriev argues without sanctions, Russia might have won by now. The question mentions 2024, but the article says "by now" (which is over 1000 days since 2022 invasion, so around mid-2024 maybe). The answer is Sergei Guriev.

12. Twelfth: percentage of LNG exports to EU. The article states the EU is still buying nearly 50% of Russia's LNG. So 50%.

13. Thirteenth: Ukraine terminated an agreement allowing gas transit via pipeline. The article mentions Ukraine refused to renew an agreement allowing gas transit through a pipeline. The name isn't given, but the answer is the agreement's name. Since the article doesn't specify the name, maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "what agreement" but the article only mentions "an agreement", so N/A.

Wait, the article says "Ukraine on Wednesday refused to renew an agreement that allowed for the transit of Russian gas via a pipeline that runs through its territory." The name of the agreement isn't provided, so the answer is N/A.

14. Fourteenth: Which partner at Sidley Austin highlighted SWIFT's effect on pharmaceuticals? The article says Andrew Shoyer, a partner there, stated that SWIFT's ban increased costs and time for exchanges including pharmaceuticals. So Andrew Shoyer.

15. Fifteenth: Alternative payment system Russia developed. The article mentions a "shadow fleet" but doesn't name the payment system. N/A.

16. Sixteenth: Think tank employing Elina Ribakova. The article says she is at the Kyiv School of Economics and nonresident scholar at Peterson Institute. So Peterson Institute for International Economics.

17. Seventeenth: Loophole involving tankers and insurance. The article says Russia developed a shadow fleet after restrictions on using Western tankers and insurance. The loophole is using their own vessels and insurance. The answer would be "developing its own shadow fleet of vessels" but the question asks for the loophole's name. Since it's not named, perhaps the answer is "using non-Western tankers and insurance" but the article says "after restrictions were put on Russia's use of Western oil tankers and oil spill insurance." So the loophole is using their own fleet. The article states "Russia developed its own shadow fleet of vessels to transport oil after restrictions were put on Russia's use of Western oil tankers and oil spill insurance." So the answer is "developing its own shadow fleet of vessels."

Wait, the question asks for the loophole involving tankers and insurance. The loophole is that they couldn't use Western tankers and insurance, so they made their own. The article says they developed a shadow fleet to bypass that. So the answer is "using their own shadow fleet of vessels not subject to Western sanctions."

But the question is phrased as "what loophole involving Western oil tankers and insurance policies did Russia exploit..." The loophole was the restrictions on using Western tankers and insurance, so the exploitation is using alternatives. The article says they developed their own. So the answer is "developing its own shadow fleet of vessels after restrictions on Western oil tankers and insurance." But the question wants the name of the loophole or the method. Since the article doesn't name a specific system, the answer is the action taken, but perhaps the question expects the answer to be "using non-Western tankers and insurance" but the article doesn't phrase it as a named loophole. The article's exact wording: "Russia developed its own shadow fleet of vessels to transport oil after restrictions were put on Russia's use of Western oil tankers and oil spill insurance." So the loophole is that they can't use Western ones, so they made their own. The answer would be the method, which is using their own fleet. The question asks for the loophole involving tankers and insurance, so the answer is "restrictions on Russia's use of Western oil tankers and oil spill insurance led to the development of a shadow fleet." But the question is phrased as "what loophole...", so maybe the answer is the specific restriction they bypassed. Alternatively, the article states the loophole was expanding trade with other countries, exploiting loopholes, and evading laws. But the specific one here is using their own fleet. Since the question asks for the loophole involving tankers and insurance, the answer is the development of the shadow fleet. The article says that's how they bypassed the restrictions. So the answer is "developing its own shadow fleet of vessels" or the loophole is the use of non-Western tankers. But the exact wording in the article is that after restrictions on their use of Western tankers and insurance, they made their own. So the loophole is the use of their own. The answer is "developing its own shadow fleet of vessels to transport oil."

But the question asks for the loophole, so maybe the loophole is the restrictions on Western tankers and insurance, which Russia exploited by creating their own. Since the article doesn't name it, perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait no, the question is asking for the specific loophole involving tankers and insurance. The loophole is that they can't use Western ones, so they use their own. The article says they developed their own shadow fleet after the restrictions. So the answer is that they used their own fleet, which is the loophole. The article's exact wording is "developing its own shadow fleet of vessels to transport oil after restrictions were put on Russia's use of Western oil tankers and oil spill insurance." Therefore, the answer is the development of the shadow fleet. Since the question asks for the loophole, the answer is "using their own shadow fleet of vessels" or "developing a shadow fleet after restrictions on Western tankers and insurance." The article's wording is precise here, so the answer is the method described. The question is phrased as "what loophole...", so the answer is the action taken, which is the shadow fleet. But the question might expect a specific term, but the article doesn't name it. So perhaps the answer is "using non-Western tankers and insurance" but that's inferred. Alternatively, since the article says the loophole was "developing its own shadow fleet," that's the answer.

Hmm, this might be tricky. Let me check the article again: "Russia developed its own shadow fleet of vessels to transport oil after restrictions were put on Russia's use of Western oil tankers and oil spill insurance." So the loophole here is that they can't use Western tankers/insurance, so they made their own. The loophole is the ability to use their own. The question asks for the loophole involving those restrictions. The answer would be "developing its own shadow fleet of vessels" as the method to bypass the restrictions. Since the article states that explicitly, the answer is that. So I'll go with that.
