Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided.

1. The first question asks for the title of Ali Smith's upcoming novel that's a thematic counterpoint to "Gliff" mentioned in the closing paragraph. Scanning the end of the article, the last paragraph says her next book is called "Glyph". That seems to be the answer here.

2. The second question is about the name Rose gives the gelding that symbolizes both a character and a substitute word. The article mentions "Gliff" is the horse's name given by Rose, serving as a substitute word. So the answer should be Gliff.

3. The term Briar finds in the dictionary that means a word with many meanings. The article states Briar found "polysemous" which is a clue to Smith's intentions. So that's the term.

4. The abandoned institution where Briar finds the dictionary. The text says "an abandoned library" where Briar discovers the dictionary. So library is the answer.

5. The single-word name Rose assigns to the horse. Again, that's Gliff, same as question 2. So answer is Gliff.

6. The group believed to outwit oppressive rules due to imagination. The article mentions "children -- especially those in early adolescence..." and their imaginative nature. So the answer is children.

7. Which sibling's account includes fables? The text says Briar's narrative is interrupted by fables. So Briar.

8. The next book's title after "Gliff" is mentioned as "Glyph" in the closing, same as question 1. So Glyph again.

9. The developmental stage highlighted for resistance. The article says children, especially around early adolescence, have the capacity. So early adolescence.

10. The primary enchantment credited is Smith's prose, described as the principal enchantment. So the answer is prose.
