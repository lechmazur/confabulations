Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not anything else. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks how many hotels with design elements like the original W Hotels that the new Starwood plans to open by 2030. The article mentions that the new Starwood has 14 hotels in five countries and plans to open 22 more by 2028. But the question is about 2030 and specifically those resembling W's design. The article doesn't mention anything beyond 2028, so 2030 isn't covered. So the answer should be N/A.

2. After stepping down in 2005, the article says he created three new chains: Baccarat, 1 Hotels, and Treehouse. Before launching 1 Hotels, he might have acquired something. Wait, the article says he created these after stepping down. The question is about what he acquired before 1 Hotels. The article mentions he created Baccarat first. But does it say he acquired a competing chain? The text says he created the brands, not necessarily acquired another chain. So maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says he created Baccarat, which licensed from the French company. But the question is about a competing chain he acquired. Hmm, maybe there's no info here. So answer N/A.

3. The article states that in 1994, Starwood Capital bought Westin from a Japanese corporation. The name of that corporation isn't mentioned. So the answer is N/A.

4. The article mentions the Baccarat in Manhattan and plans for Dubai, Maldives, and Rome. But when Marriott retired the Starwood name (which was before 2016, since Marriott bought Starwood in 2016), how many Baccarat locations were operational? The article only mentions the Manhattan location as operational at that time, since the others are in the pipeline now. So besides Manhattan, none were operational then. Answer is 0.

5. The question is about the year he clashed with executives leading to his departure and creating a rival chain like W. He stepped down in 2005 after years of clashes. The rival chain creation came after, but the question's "mirroring W's design" might refer to his new brands. The year of the clash leading to his departure would be around 2005. The article says he stepped down in 2005 after clashing. So the answer is 2005.

6. The question asks for an amenity at Sheraton besides the Heavenly Bed (which was for Westin). The article mentions he introduced the Heavenly Bed at Westin, but for Sheraton, it says he pored over details like pillows and porter handling. The specific amenity? The article doesn't mention another specific one at Sheraton. So maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "specific amenity beyond the Heavenly Bed". Since the Heavenly Bed was for Westin, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the attention to details like pillows counts, but it's not named. So N/A.

7. Excluding Austin, how many 1 Hotels in the US were operational when he reacquired Starwood (which was last year). The article says 1 Hotels has locations like Austin, but when he reacquired the name (last year), the current operational ones are mentioned in the pipeline. The article says "plans to open 22 by 2028, including 1 Hotels in Austin, Crete, Seattle..." So maybe before reacquiring, the existing ones? The article doesn't specify how many were already open. The question is tricky. Since the article doesn't state existing US locations except Austin, perhaps excluding Austin, it's N/A. Alternatively, maybe there was one in NYC? The article doesn't say. So N/A.
