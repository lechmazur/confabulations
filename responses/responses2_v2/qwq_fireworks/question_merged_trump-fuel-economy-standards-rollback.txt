Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article and follow the strict instructions. Let me start by reading through the questions again and cross-referencing them with the article.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about an initiative that the former Wisconsin representative (Sean Duffy) championed in Congress leading to his swift confirmation. The article mentions he was confirmed despite opposition over a freeze on federal grants and loans. But it doesn't specify an initiative he championed in Congress that led to his confirmation. So maybe N/A?

2. **Question 2**: How many Democrats supported his confirmation? The final vote was 77 to 22. Assuming the Senate has 100 members, but without knowing party breakdown, can't infer how many Dems supported. The article says "late wave of opposition from some Democrats", but the vote numbers don't split by party. So N/A?

3. **Question 3**: The Trump admin's stance on USAID was to close it. The question is about what action the transportation secretary took that mirrored this. The article says the admin called for USAID closure, but the transportation secretary's action related to federal funding? The memo mentions freezing grants and loans, which might be the same stance. So "freeze on federal grants and loans"?

4. **Question 4**: Biden's 2025 target for light trucks. The article says by 2031, light trucks need 45 mpg from 35.1. But the question is about 2025. The article doesn't mention 2025, so N/A?

5. **Question 5**: Legal precedent for CBS and Register's defense? The article says lawsuits lack merit but are harassing. The DEI section mentions West Point's D.E.I. ban. Maybe the precedent is First Amendment, but the question links to DEI actions. Not directly connected. So N/A?

6. **Question 6**: Percentage increase for cars between last year (48.7) and 2031 (65). Calculate: (65-48.7)/48.7 *100. But question asks for the mandate's percentage increase. The article states the numbers but not the percentage. Since it's a calculation based on given data, maybe answer is "N/A" because the question asks for the mandate's target, not the percentage. Wait, the question says "percentage increase" which can be calculated from the numbers given. So (65-48.7)/48.7 *100 â‰ˆ 33.5%. But the article doesn't state it as a percentage, so maybe N/A? The instructions say to infer if possible. Hmm, but the question specifies "mandate between last year and 2031", so maybe the answer is "33.5%", but since it's not in the text, perhaps N/A?

Wait, the article says the Biden standards require passenger cars to average 65 mpg by 2031, up from 48.7 last year. So the increase is 65-48.7 = 16.3, but the percentage is (16.3/48.7)*100. But the question asks for the percentage increase the Biden admin mandated. Since the article doesn't state the percentage, maybe N/A. Or is the question expecting the target number (65) but that's not a percentage. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Facility similar to one for migrants. The article mentions a tent city for 30k migrants. The memo's suggestion about oil reserves? The memo mentions vulnerabilities in the grid and national security risks of foreign materials. The question asks what facility the memo suggested was unnecessary due to oil refining. Maybe the tent city? But the memo's context is about fuel standards, not migrant facilities. Not directly connected. So N/A?

8. **Question 8**: Other Biden initiative related to Trudeau's comments. Trudeau talked about critical minerals linking to Trump's comments about making Canada a U.S. state. The transportation secretary's order might target EV battery materials (since the memo mentions foreign sources for battery materials). So maybe the initiative related to electric vehicle battery sourcing? The article says the order is part of rolling back Biden's EV promotion. The question says "specifically targeted by new order". The order is about fuel economy, but the memo also mentions issues with foreign materials. So perhaps the Biden initiative on EV battery materials? Not explicitly stated. So N/A?

9. **Question 9**: Vote tally for confirmation. The article says the final vote was 77 to 22. So answer is "77 to 22".

10. **Question 10**: Location for oil reserves like migrant detention? The article says migrants are held in Guantanamo. The question asks where the memo suggested storing oil reserves. The memo mentions national security risks of relying on foreign sources. The article doesn't mention storing oil reserves in a specific location. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Day the memo was issued. The article says "Tuesday" when Duffy signed the order. So answer is "Tuesday".

12. **Question 12**: Passenger car target by 2031. The article states 65 mpg. So answer "65".

13. **Question 13**: Who signed the rollback order? The article says Sean Duffy, former Wisconsin rep. So answer "Sean Duffy".

14. **Question 14**: Vote tally for confirmation. Same as question 9: "77 to 22".

15. **Question 15**: Model year for NHTSA review. The memo directs review from 2022 onward. So "2022".

16. **Question 16**: Military institution that cut clubs due to DEI ban. The article mentions West Point leaders complied with Trump's DEI ban by ending clubs. So "West Point".

17. **Question 17**: Canadian leader linked to critical minerals. The article says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau mentioned Canada's critical minerals. So "Justin Trudeau".

18. **Question 18**: Federal agency proposed to close. The article says Trump called for USAID closure. So "U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)".

19. **Question 19**: Media outlet targeted by lawsuits. The article mentions CBS News and The Des Moines Register. So one of them, but question asks for which one? The answer should include both? The question says "one of the targets", so either is correct. Since the question says "which media outlet", perhaps list both separated by comma? But instructions say to answer directly. The question says "one of the targets", so maybe either. The answer can be "CBS News" or "The Des Moines Register". The question doesn't specify to list both, so pick one. The article mentions both, so maybe the answer is both. But the instructions say "prefer to respond in a sentence fragment or words". So "CBS News and The Des Moines Register".

Wait, the exact wording: "list two people who did something, but the article only lists one, answer N/A". But here the question is about a media outlet, and the article lists two. The question says "which media outlet", so maybe the answer should include both. But perhaps the question allows either, but since it's a single answer, maybe list both. Alternatively, since the question says "one of the targets", but the answer requires both. Hmm, the question says "which media outlet" (singular) but the answer has two. The article says "cases against CBS News and The Des Moines Register", so both are targets. Since the question uses "which", maybe the correct answer is both. But the instructions say if the question asks for two but the article lists one, answer N/A. Here the question asks for one, but the article lists two. So either is acceptable. But the question says "which media outlet", so perhaps the answer is "CBS News" (the first one mentioned). Or maybe the answer should be both. Let me check the instructions again. The example includes an answer that's a single word. So maybe the answer is "CBS News" or "The Des Moines Register", but since the question is asking for one of them, but the article mentions both, perhaps the correct answer is both. However, the user might expect both. Alternatively, the question might be a trick, but the article says both, so the answer is "CBS News and The Des Moines Register".

20. **Question 20**: Detention facility historically linked to counter-terrorism holding migrants. The article mentions Guantanamo Bay, where migrants are held, previously for Al Qaeda. So "Guantanamo Bay".

Now, let me go through each question again with these thoughts and see if I missed any details.

For question 1: The article says Sean Duffy was confirmed despite opposition over the freeze on grants and loans. The question asks about an initiative he championed in Congress leading to his confirmation. The article doesn't mention any specific initiative he supported in Congress that caused his swift confirmation. So answer N/A.

Question 2: The vote was 77-22. The question asks how many Democrats supported. Since the total votes are 77 in favor, but we don't know how many Dems were in the "yes" votes. The opposition was from some Dems, but the total votes don't split by party. So N/A.

Question 3: The Trump admin's stance on USAID was to close it. The transportation secretary's action that mirrors this is the freeze on federal grants and loans, as mentioned in the confirmation opposition. So answer "freeze on federal grants and loans".

Question 4: The target for light trucks by 2031 is 45, but the question asks for 2025. The article doesn't mention 2025, so N/A.

Question 5: The legal precedent for the lawsuits' defense (First Amendment) isn't linked to DEI actions. The DEI and media lawsuits are separate topics in the article, so no direct link. N/A.

Question 6: The percentage increase isn't stated, so N/A.

Question 7: The memo didn't suggest a facility, but the tent city is for migrants. Since the question links to oil reserves, maybe N/A.

Question 8: The other Biden initiative related to Trudeau's critical minerals comment might be EV battery materials sourcing. But the article doesn't explicitly state the transportation secretary's order targeted that. The order is about fuel economy, so N/A.

Question 9: 77-22.

Question 10: The memo didn't mention storing oil reserves in a location, so N/A.

Question 11: Tuesday.

Question 12: 65.

Question 13: Sean Duffy.

Question 14: 77-22.

Question 15: 2022.

Question 16: West Point.

Question 17: Justin Trudeau.

Question 18: USAID.

Question 19: Both CBS and Register are mentioned. The answer should include both, as per the article.

Question 20: Guantanamo Bay.
