Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each question strictly based on that. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which famous Las Vegas magician performed at 69 Atlantic before moving to their current residency. The article mentions Eric Mead, but I need to check if he's linked to Las Vegas. The article says Eric Mead is based in Aspen, Colo., and doesn't mention Las Vegas. The only other magicians mentioned in the article's later parts are people like Penn & Teller (since Ondrej Psenicka was on their show "Fool Us"), but the article doesn't say he moved to a Las Vegas residency. So maybe the answer is N/A?

Wait, the question is about someone who was at 69 Atlantic before moving to their current residency. The article mentions Eric Mead as one of the first performers there. But does it say he moved to a Las Vegas residency? The article doesn't mention Las Vegas for him. The closing cultural notes mention Blue Man Group in Las Vegas but that's a separate part. So probably N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many types of limited edition cards with movie themes? The article lists "Vertigo" (a Hitchcock movie) as one example. Are there others? The text says "to name a few" after mentioning Vertigo, but only Vertigo is explicitly stated as a movie. The others like Smokey Bear and a mini-flea circus aren't movies. So the answer is 1?

Wait, the text says "a large selection of limited edition playing cards, with backs featuring Smokey Bear, a 'mini-flea' circus and the Alfred Hitchcock classic 'Vertigo,' to name a few." So Vertigo is one movie-themed card. The others mentioned aren't movies. Since "to name a few" implies there are more, but the article only explicitly lists Vertigo as a movie. Since the question asks for how many types are currently stocked, but the text only mentions Vertigo as a movie theme. The others aren't movies. So the answer is 1? Or since "to name a few" maybe more, but the exact number isn't given. Since the question asks for the number, and only one is specified, but "to name a few" suggests more, but without exact count, the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Renovation cost? The article says the building was dilapidated and they converted it, but there's no mention of cost. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Denis Behr's trick involved two cards signed by a spectator. The article says "signed by a spectator seated to his left". The question is the occupation of that person. The article doesn't mention their job, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Adam Rubin's previous venue. The article says Rubin co-owns 69 Atlantic. Before that, he was a children's book author. It doesn't mention him managing another magic venue. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Minimum age requirement? The article doesn't mention age restrictions. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Buck brothers' years touring. The article says they traveled the world in their 20s and 30s. Assuming they are twins, and now they are in their 40s maybe? The article doesn't state exact years. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Percentage of ticket sales from standing vs. seated. The article mentions tickets start at $75 for standing, but no sales data. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Children's book author who attends and is a consultant. The article mentions Adam Rubin wrote "Dragons Love Tacos", but there's no mention of him attending shows there as a consultant. Wait, the article says Emma Straub is the owner of Books Are Magic and went to see Eric Mead. The question is about a consultant. The text doesn't mention a consultant. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Attendance count for Eric Mead's opening. The article says the theater has 18 seats plus standing. But no specific numbers on attendance. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Connection between Dan Buck's career and the Party Popper Machine. The article describes the machine but doesn't link it to his cardistry. It says the store has whimsical items, but no direct connection stated. So N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Emma Straub's experience influencing inventory at Books Are Magic. The article says she owns the bookstore but doesn't mention any changes in inventory due to her experience. N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Magician trained under Dai Vernon and Ed Marlo. The article mentions Dave Williamson learned from those masters. So answer is Dave Williamson.

14. **Question 14:** Architectural feature causing claustrophobic design. The article says the store had extra space after laying out inventory, so the theater was in the remaining space. But the reason for the claustrophobic design is the 18-seat setting being intimate. The article says "the store had extra space" which they used for the theater, but the reason for the small size isn't an architectural feature like a small room. Wait, the article says "the store had extra space", but maybe the building's size necessitated it. The question asks for an architectural feature. The article says the building was dilapidated and far larger than needed, so they used the extra space. The theater's claustrophobic design is because it's 18 seats, but the reason is the available space. The article says "the store had extra space" so they used it. The architectural feature might be the building's size. But the question is about Dan Buck's explanation. The article says Dan Buck said they had space after laying out items, so the feature is the building's original size being larger than needed. But the exact architectural feature isn't mentioned. The answer might be N/A. Wait, the article says "the interior was a dilapidated mess, and far larger than Art of Play needed for its whimsical wares." So the building's original size (larger than needed) allowed them to create the theater. But the question is about the architectural feature that necessitated the claustrophobic design. Maybe the small space available? The article says "the theater finally provides: an 18-seat setting so intimate..." but the reason is the space they had. The architectural feature would be the existing structure's layout. Since the article doesn't specify a feature like a small room or something, perhaps N/A. Alternatively, maybe the building's age (130 years) but that's not directly linked. Hmm. The question states "according to Dan Buck's explanation of the renovation process." The article quotes Dan Buck saying they had space after laying out inventory. So the reason was the available space, not an architectural feature. So N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Total performances by Dave Williamson. The venue has two shows a night for two weekends. So two weekends = 2 nights each weekend? The article says "two a night for two weekends in a row, on Friday and Saturday." So each weekend has Friday and Saturday, two shows each night. So per weekend: 2 days x 2 shows = 4 shows. Two weekends would be 8 shows total. So answer is 8.

Wait, the question is how many performances Dave will complete during his residency. The article says shows are booked through May, and each performer does two weekends. The standard is two shows per night on Friday and Saturday. So two weekends would be 2 Fridays and 2 Saturdays, each with two shows. So total shows: 2 days/weekend * 2 weekends = 4 days, each with 2 shows: 4 *2=8. So answer is 8.

16. **Question 16:** Item using same tech as the glowing lightbulb. The article says the lightbulb uses "credit magnets and electricity." The Party Popper Machine is mentioned but uses gears. The lightbulb's tech is magnetic levitation. The article mentions "a glowing lightbulb that spins and levitates above a block of wood. (Credit magnets and electricity)." So the item is the glowing lightbulb itself. But the question asks which item from inventory uses same tech. The lightbulb is part of the inventory. So answer is the glowing lightbulb. But the question is phrased as "which item from Art of Play's inventory..." So the answer is the glowing lightbulb that spins and levitates. The exact name isn't given beyond "glowing lightbulb". The article says "a glowing lightbulb that spins and levitates above a block of wood." So the answer is that item. So the answer is "the glowing lightbulb" but the question wants the specific name. Since the article doesn't give it a name beyond that description, but the question allows the description. Wait, the question says "what specific connection..." but no, the question is asking for the item's name. Since the article doesn't name it beyond that description, perhaps N/A. Wait, the question is "What specific connection does Dan Buck's early career... to the design..." No, question 16 is about the item using same tech as the lightbulb. The lightbulb's tech is magnets. The Party Popper Machine uses gears and a button. So no connection. The only item using magnets is the lightbulb itself. So the answer is the glowing lightbulb. But the question is phrased as "which item...", so the answer is "the glowing lightbulb that spins and levitates" but since the article refers to it as such, maybe that's acceptable. The exact wording in the article is "a glowing lightbulb that spins and levitates above a block of wood. (Credit magnets and electricity)." So the answer is that item. So the answer would be "the glowing lightbulb" but since the question requires the exact name, but it's not named beyond that description, perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "utilizes the same magnetic levitation technology..." So the item is the lightbulb setup. Since the article mentions that item's tech is magnets, the answer is that item. So the answer is "the glowing lightbulb that spins and levitates above a block of wood." But since the question asks for the name, and it's not given a specific product name, maybe N/A. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the Party Popper Machine uses electricity and gears, not magnets, so no. The only item using magnets is the lightbulb. Since the question is about the same tech as Denis Behr's performance (the lightbulb was part of the store's items, not his trick?), wait the lightbulb is in the store's inventory, and Denis Behr's performance had a trick with cards flying. Wait, the lightbulb's levitation is separate. The article says Behr's trick involved cards flying. The lightbulb's tech is magnetic levitation. So the answer is the glowing lightbulb. Since the question asks for the item's name, but the article doesn't give it a name beyond the description, perhaps the answer is "the glowing lightbulb" as per the article's description. The question might accept that. So answer is "the glowing lightbulb that spins and levitates above a block of wood" but maybe just "the glowing lightbulb". But since the exact name isn't given, maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "a glowing lightbulb that spins and levitates above a block of wood. (Credit magnets and electricity)." The part in parentheses explains the tech. So the item is the glowing lightbulb. So the answer is "the glowing lightbulb".

17. **Question 17:** Historical event involving BQE construction influencing the location. The article says the store is across from where the Brooklyn Queens Expressway empties onto Atlantic Avenue. But it doesn't mention any historical event related to its construction affecting the choice. The reason given is that they found space in the building. So N/A.

18. **Question 18:** Ondrej Psenicka's Fool Us wins and booking timeline. The article says he stumped Penn & Teller three times on "Fool Us", prompting Penn's comment, and he is coming to 69 Atlantic. It doesn't say when he was booked in relation to his wins. Since the show is booked through May 2024, but the article is current (as of when written), but the question is about the correlation between his wins and securing the booking. The article doesn't mention the timeline, so N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Fred Armisen's career aspect credited to Blue Man Group. The closing cultural note says "A Blue Man Group Farewell: Over 34 years, the show gave Fred Armisen a drumming gig..." So the answer is his drumming gig.
