merged_open-socrates-agnes-callard.txt
Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. 

1. The first question asks which specific philosophical text Callard wrote as an undergrad that led her to try Socrates' methods at a museum. The article mentions she wanted to "be Socrates" and harassed strangers at a museum, but doesn't name any text she wrote. So, N/A.

2. Tolstoy's existential crisis at 50 is mentioned. The question is how many years he spent contemplating before that. The text says he was 50 when he had the crisis, but doesn't state prior years of contemplation. So, N/A.

3. The article says she divorced her first husband (a philosopher) and married a grad student philosopher. It doesn't name the grad student. So, N/A.

4. The article states Socrates alienated powerful politicians before his death but doesn't name specific philosophers he debated. So, N/A.

5. No percentage of Athenian politicians turning against him is given. The article mentions he alienated some, but no stats. N/A.

6. The framework is outlined when she calls her approach "hard-line intellectualist" on page 129. The question is which chapter that's in. Since the article doesn't mention chapters, can't answer. N/A.

7. The metaphor for misrepresented teachings about death: The article says Socrates was "diluted" like a sauce. So, "sauce" is the metaphor.

8. The article says philosophy helps move beyond "unthinking habit of getting through the next 15 minutes." But doesn't specify daily minutes for contemplation. N/A.

9. Callard's argument cites thinking resolving difficulties, but the article doesn't mention a psychological study. N/A.

10. The book price is $35, but the question is about the first edition at the U. Chicago bookstore. The article states the price as $35 but doesn't specify the bookstore's price or first edition. N/A.

11. The 20th-century Oxford linguistic analyst from Krishnan's book: The article lists Nikhil Krishnan's book about 20th-century Oxford thinkers. The refutation method's dual approach might relate to someone like Wittgenstein, but the text doesn't name a specific person. N/A.

12. The New Yorker profile mentions her divorcing a philosopher (first husband) to marry a grad student. Eilenberger's "The Visionaries" includes Arendt, Beauvoir, Rand, Weil. None are directly linked here, so N/A.

13. The book is 405 pages. Tolstoy is discussed in the opening, so page 1. No contradiction since 1 is less than 405. So N/A.

14. The question links a philosopher from Bakewell's book to 15-minute cycles. Bakewell's book is on humanist thought, maybe someone like Epicurus? But article doesn't mention this. N/A.

15. The Visionaries includes four philosophers. Bergson's "restless world" is from Herring's bio. The article lists the four as Arendt, Beauvoir, Rand, Weil. Maybe Rand? But they oppose communal thinking. The text doesn't say. N/A.

16. Bergson's followers had a cult following. The article mentions his cult following but doesn't describe rituals. Socrates died by hemlock. No info on rituals compared. N/A.

17. Socrates lived before the 700-year humanist history (which would end in the 14th century if starting from him). But midwifery metaphor is Socratic, so if Bakewell's book starts later, it's anachronistic. But the article doesn't state this. N/A.

Hmm, but let me check again. For question 7, the article says Socrates was "diluted" like a sauce. So the metaphor is "sauce".

Question 14: The article says Callard argues Socratic ethics resolve "savage commands". The question asks which philosopher from Bakewell's book she incorrectly suggests developed a parallel theory with 15-minute cycles. Since the 15 minutes is from Tolstoy's "next 15 minutes", maybe someone like Epicurus (if he had a similar idea), but the article doesn't mention that. So N/A.

Question 15: The Visionaries' four are Arendt, Beauvoir, Rand, Weil. The article says Bergson's "restless world" is in Herring's book. The question says which one is misleadingly associated via proximity. The Visionaries are listed before Bergson's mention. Maybe the last one in the list, Simone Weil, since she's close to Bergson in the text? But the article doesn't link them. So N/A.

I think most answers are N/A except question 7 and possibly others where the text has direct info. Wait, question 7's answer is "sauce". Let me confirm again. The article states: "Socrates has too often been 'diluted': treated like a 'sauce' that could enhance one's critical thinking instead of as the main event". So the term is "sauce".

Question 3: The article says she married a grad student philosopher after divorcing her first husband (also a philosopher). But the name isn't provided, so N/A.

Question 16: The article mentions Bergson had a cult following but doesn't describe rituals. So N/A.
