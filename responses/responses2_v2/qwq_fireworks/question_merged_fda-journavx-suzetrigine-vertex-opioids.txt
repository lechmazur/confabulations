Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information given in the article and answer each question exactly as per the instructions. Let me start reading through the questions again and cross-reference with the article.

1. The first question asks about the percentage of patients in the abdominoplasty trial who experienced complete pain cessation when treated with the dosage equivalent to two Vicodin pills. The article mentions that in one trial (abdominoplasty) and another (bunionectomy), patients were given either placebo, Vicodin, or suzetrigine. It says both suzetrigine and the opioid were better than placebo, but doesn't specify the exact percentage for complete cessation. Since the article doesn't give specific numbers, the answer is N/A.

2. The second question is about the number of individuals in the lumbosacral radiculopathy study who had worse side effects than Vicodin. The article states that in small studies, suzetrigine helped diabetic neuropathy but was no better than placebo in pinched spinal nerves (which is lumbosacral radiculopathy). However, there's no mention of side effect comparison numbers here. So N/A again.

3. The third question asks for the specific dosage the Alabama family used. The article mentions the family had the Nav1.7 mutation, but doesn't mention any specific dosage of Journavx for them. The standard is two pills a day, but the question is about their specific effective dosage. Since it's not stated, N/A.

4. The fourth question is about the percentage reduction in Nav1.7 activity if firewalkers take the standard dose. The firewalkers have a mutation blocking Nav1.7, so the drug targets Nav1.8. The article doesn't discuss how the drug would affect their channels. Thus, N/A.

5. The fifth question projects addiction cases if Journavx were prescribed as widely as Vicodin. The article says 85,000 people a year become addicted from opioids out of 40 million prescriptions. Since Journavx is non-addictive, the number would be 0. So the answer is 0.

6. The sixth question asks for an alternative treatment with comparable mechanism at lower cost. Dr. Loeser mentions Vicodin is "dirt cheap", so the answer is Vicodin. Wait, but Vicodin is an opioid. The question is looking for a comparable mechanism. Wait, the mechanism here is non-addictive? The article says suzetrigine's mechanism is blocking Nav1.8. The question asks for a treatment with comparable mechanism but cheaper. Since Vicodin is an opioid with different mechanism (acts on brain), maybe there's no such alternative mentioned. Wait, the article says suzetrigine is non-addictive because it doesn't enter the brain. The question's wording might be tricky. Alternatively, maybe acetaminophen plus hydrocodone (Vicodin) is the cheaper option but with different mechanism. The article says suzetrigine's mechanism is non-addictive, so maybe there's no alternative with the same mechanism. The question might be a trick, so N/A? Wait, the question says "comparable mechanism of action". Since suzetrigine's mechanism is blocking peripheral channels, maybe there's no other drug mentioned with that. The article doesn't mention any other drugs with same mechanism, so N/A? Wait, the article says "nonaddictive drugs to relieve pain" as a new generation. Maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, maybe the question is referring to something else. Wait, the question mentions Dr. Loeser's comment. He says Vicodin is cheap but has side effects. The alternative would be the opioid, but the question is about a comparable mechanism. Since the mechanism is different, there is none. So the answer is N/A.

7. The seventh question asks the average duration from the 250-person study before switching to OTC. The article mentions the 250-person study assessed safety and tolerability, but there's no info on how long they used it before switching. So N/A.

8. Eighth question: If Vertex developed a Nav1.7-targeting drug, what percentage of lumbosacral patients would improve based on small studies? The article says suzetrigine (Nav1.8) wasn't better than placebo in pinched nerves (lumbosacral), but the small studies showed help in diabetic neuropathy. The question is hypothetical about targeting Nav1.7. The article doesn't provide data on Nav1.7's effect on lumbosacral, so N/A.

9. Ninth question: Total cost difference for a bunionectomy patient with equivalent pain relief. The article says suzetrigine is $31/day (2 pills at $15.50 each). Vicodin (acetaminophen+hydrocodone) is "dirt cheap" at pennies. But the patient's treatment duration isn't specified. The question says "typical treatment duration", but the article doesn't state how long post-surgical pain lasts. So without days, can't calculate total. Answer N/A.

10. Tenth question: Percentage of bunionectomy patients with complete resolution within a week of stopping. The article says suzetrigine's effects disappear when stopped, but no specific percentage or timeframe. N/A.

11. Eleventh question: Surgical procedure with spinal compression that showed no improvement. The article mentions that in small studies, suzetrigine was no better than placebo in those with pinched spinal nerves (lumbosacral radiculopathy). The answer is lumbosacral radiculopathy, but the question asks for the surgical procedure. Wait, the question says "surgical procedure involving spinal nerve compression". The example given in the article is sciatica, which is a form of lumbosacral radiculopathy. But the trials were on surgery patients: abdominoplasty and bunionectomy. The spinal nerve compression study was in the 250-person trial (non-surgical pain from trauma or accidents?), or in the small studies. The article states that suzetrigine was no better than placebo in those with pinched spinal nerves. The surgical procedure causing spinal compression? Maybe not a surgery but the condition itself. The question might be referring to the pinched nerves (lumbosacral radiculopathy), so answer lumbosacral radiculopathy. But the question says "surgical procedure", so maybe it's the bunionectomy? No, that's foot surgery. The article doesn't mention a specific surgery causing spinal compression. The answer might be lumbosacral radiculopathy, even if it's not a surgery. The question might have a mistake, but per the text, the answer is lumbosacral radiculopathy. Wait, the question says "surgical procedure involving spinal nerve compression" but the studies mentioned were on surgery patients (abdominoplasty, bunionectomy), but the pinched nerve study was non-surgical. So maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, perhaps the question is wrong, but the article says "patients with pain from surgery, trauma or accidents" in the 250-person study. The lumbosacral radiculopathy is a condition, not a surgery. So answer N/A? Hmm. The article says in small studies, suzetrigine was no better than placebo in those with pinched spinal nerves (lumbosacral radiculopathy). The question asks for the surgical procedure that involved spinal compression. Since it's a condition, not a surgery, answer N/A.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the bunionectomy or abdominoplasty? No, those are different surgeries. The spinal nerve compression isn't a surgery mentioned. So the answer is N/A.

12. Twelfth question: Total patients across all trials given suzetrigine for postoperative assessment. The article mentions two trials each with ~1000 patients (so 2000 total), plus the 250-person study. But the 250 was for safety, not necessarily postoperative. The question specifies postoperative, so the two main trials (each 1000) plus maybe others? The trials for the two surgeries (abdominoplasty and bunionectomy) each had 1000 patients, so total 2000. The 250 might not be postoperative. So answer 2000.

13. Thirteenth question: Two sodium channels Dr. Waxman identified as critical. The article says Nav1.7 and Nav1.8. So answer Nav1.7 and Nav1.8.

14. Fourteenth question: Average daily cost difference between suzetrigine and Vicodin. Sujetrigine is $31/day (2 pills at $15.50). Vicodin is "dirt cheap" at pennies. The exact difference isn't stated, but the article says suzetrigine's price is much higher. Since Vicodin's cost isn't given numerically, can't compute exact difference. So N/A. Wait, but maybe the question is referring to the trials where they compared the two. The article says in the trials, patients got either placebo, Vicodin, or suzetrigine. The price of Vicodin per pill isn't given, but it's stated as "pennies per pill". The suzetrigine is $15.50 per pill. So two pills would be $31 vs. Vicodin's cost (say, $0.05 per pill for hydrocodone/acetaminophen, so $0.10 per day). The difference would be $30.90. But since the exact Vicodin cost isn't given, can't calculate. So N/A.

15. Fifteenth question: Year Dr. Waxman confirmed the familial syndrome via Erythromelalgia Association. The article says in 2004, the Erythromelalgia Association told him about the Alabama family. So the answer is 2004.

16. Sixteenth question: Neurological condition ruled out. The article says suzetrigine was no better than placebo in pinched spinal nerves (lumbosacral radiculopathy), but helped diabetic neuropathy. Wait, the question is which condition was ruled out. The article says in small studies, suzetrigine helped diabetic neuropathy but was no better than placebo in pinched spinal nerves. Wait, the question asks which condition was ruled out. The article says for lumbosacral radiculopathy (pinched nerves), suzetrigine wasn't effective, so that condition was ruled out? Or maybe the other way around. Wait, the article says "the company is going ahead with larger studies in both groups of patients" despite the small study's disappointment. So maybe it's not ruled out yet. Wait, the question is which condition did Vertex explicitly rule out? The article states that in small studies, suzetrigine was no better than placebo in those with pinched spinal nerves (lumbosacral radiculopathy), but they are proceeding with larger trials. So perhaps they didn't rule it out, so the answer would be N/A. Wait the question says "explicitly ruled out as a target based on their initial findings". The initial findings (small studies) showed no benefit for pinched spinal nerves, so maybe that's the condition they ruled out. Wait, but the article says they are proceeding with larger trials, implying they didn't rule it out yet. Hmm. The article says "the company is going ahead with larger studies in both groups of patients" (both diabetic and pinched nerves). So maybe they didn't rule it out. The question is asking which condition was ruled out, so perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the other condition: the article says in small studies, suzetrigine helped diabetic neuropathy but not pinched nerves. Wait, the question says "ruled out as a target", so perhaps the one where it wasn't effective. The article says "in small studies, Vertex found that suzetrigine helped those with diabetic neuropathy, but was no better than placebo in those with pinched spinal nerves". So they might have ruled out pinched spinal nerves as a target? But the article says they are proceeding with studies, so maybe not. The question is tricky. Since the article doesn't explicitly say they ruled out any condition, perhaps N/A. Alternatively, maybe the condition they ruled out is the one where it didn't work, but the company is still testing, so maybe not. Hmm. Maybe the answer is N/A.

17. Seventeenth question: Which side effect was completely absent in both suzetrigine and placebo? The article says side effects of suzetrigine were similar to placebo. The opioid (Vicodin) had side effects like nausea and drowsiness. Since suzetrigine's side effects were like placebo, the opioid's side effects (nausea, drowsiness) were not present in suzetrigine group. The question asks which side effect was completely absent in both suzetrigine and placebo. Since placebo wouldn't have those either, the answer might be the opioid's side effects, but the question is about side effects absent in both. The article says suzetrigine's side effects were similar to placebo, implying that the opioid's side effects (like nausea and drowsiness) were not present in either group. Wait, the article says "side effects of suzetrigine reported by patients were similar to the ones reported by those taking the placebo. The company also submitted data from a 250-person study that assessed the drug's safety and tolerability in patients with pain from surgery, trauma or accidents. Suzetrigine eased pain as much as the combination opioid. Both were better than the placebo at relieving pain." So the opioid (Vicodin) had its own side effects, but suzetrigine's side effects were like placebo. So the side effects like nausea and drowsiness (from Vicodin) were not present in suzetrigine or placebo groups. The question asks which side effect was completely absent in both suzetrigine and placebo groups. The answer would be the ones associated with Vicodin, like nausea and drowsiness. Since the question asks for an explicit mention, the article states "it does not have opioids' unpleasant side effects like nausea and drowsiness". So those side effects (nausea and drowsiness) were absent in suzetrigine group, but were present in Vicodin. Since placebo wouldn't have those either, the answer is nausea and drowsiness. But the question asks which one explicitly mentioned. The article lists "nausea and drowsiness" as the opioid's side effects that suzetrigine doesn't have. So the answer is nausea and drowsiness, but the question asks for a single side effect. Wait the question says "explicitly mentioned" in the article. The article says "it does not have opioids' unpleasant side effects like nausea and drowsiness". So the answer is nausea and drowsiness. But the question asks "what side effect", singular. Maybe the answer is both, but need to check. The question says "explicitly mentioned", so probably list them. The answer should be "nausea and drowsiness".

18. Eighteenth question: Percentage of patients who developed addiction annually. The article states Dr. Altshuler said 85,000 people a year become addicted out of 40 million prescribed. So 85,000/40,000,000 = 0.2125%, so 0.21%. But the question asks for the percentage, so 0.21% or approximately 0.2%. The article says "a small proportion" but exact number is 85,000 per 40 million. The answer is 0.21%, but the question might want the exact figure as a percentage. So 85,000 /40,000,000 = 0.002125, so 0.2125%, which rounds to 0.2%. But the article says 85,000 per year. The answer is 85,000 /40,000,000 = 0.2125%, so 0.21%. The question says "according to the data Vertex's chief scientific officer cited", so the exact percentage is 85,000 out of 40 million, so 0.2125%, which can be written as 0.2% or 0.21%. But the answer must be precise. The article says "85,000 people a year become addicted... out of 40 million prescribed". So (85,000 /40,000,000)*100 = 0.2125%, so 0.21%. The answer should be 0.2% or 0.21%. But the question might expect the exact figure as given. The article says "about 85,000" so maybe approximate. The answer is 0.2%.

Wait, the question is "what percentage of patients prescribed opioids for acute pain developed addiction annually". The article states that 85,000 people a year become addicted after taking a prescription opioid, out of 40 million prescribed each year. So the percentage is (85,000 /40,000,000)*100 = 0.2125%. So 0.21% or 0.2%. Since the article says "about" 85k, maybe the answer is 0.2%.

19. Nineteenth question: Non-surgical condition that showed improvement but not yet approved. The article says suzetrigine helped diabetic neuropathy in small studies but not pinched nerves. The company is proceeding with larger trials for both. The question asks which was statistically significant but not yet approved. Diabetic neuropathy showed improvement, so that's the answer. The article says "suzetrigine helped those with diabetic neuropathy, but was no better than placebo in those with pinched spinal nerves". So diabetic neuropathy is the condition that showed improvement. Since the article mentions that the company is going ahead with larger studies, implying it's not yet approved, so the answer is diabetic neuropathy.
