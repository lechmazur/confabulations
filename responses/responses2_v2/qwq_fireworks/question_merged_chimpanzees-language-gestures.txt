Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to go through each question carefully and check the article for the exact information needed. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question is asking how many years after Beryl joined the Ngogo community did Lindsay first start using the hand-on-eye gesture. The article says Beryl joined Ngogo in 2012. Then, Lindsay started the gesture when she was about 3.5 years old. To find out when Lindsay started, I need her birth year. But wait, the article doesn't mention Lindsay's birth year directly. However, the study was observed in 2022 when Dr. van Boekholt was there. The recordings showed Lindsay started at 3.5 years. If in 2022 she was 4.5 when the gesture became a request, maybe we can backtrack. Let me check again. The text says Lindsay started the gesture when she was 3.5, and that started to mean travel at 4.5. Beryl joined in 2012. Assuming Lindsay was born to Beryl after 2012, so if Beryl joined in 2012, maybe Lindsay was born in 2018 or so? But the article doesn't specify exact years. Wait, the study was in 2022, and the recordings before that showed her starting at 3.5. Let's see: if in 2022 she was 4.5, then she was born around 2017. Since Beryl joined in 2012, that's 5 years later. So the answer would be 5 years? But the article says "the recordings showed that Lindsay started making the hand-on-eye signal when she was about 3 1/2 years old." Since Beryl joined in 2012, Lindsay would have been born after that. So 3.5 years after Beryl joined would be 2015.5, so the time since Beryl joined would be 3.5 years? Wait, no. Wait, the question is how many years after Beryl joined did Lindsay first begin the gesture. If Lindsay was 3.5 when she started, and Beryl was there since 2012, then Lindsay's age when she started is 3.5, so if Beryl joined in 2012, Lindsay would have been born in 2012 + x years. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe the article doesn't give exact years for Lindsay's birth, so perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, the question is about the time between Beryl joining and Lindsay starting the gesture. The article says Beryl joined in 2012. Lindsay started the gesture when she was 3.5. So if Lindsay was 3.5 when she started, then the time since Beryl joined would be her age. Since Beryl was already in the community when Lindsay was born, the time since Beryl joined is at least Lindsay's age when she started. So 3.5 years? But the question says "how many years after Beryl joined" the gesture began. So that would be Lindsay's age when she started, which is 3.5. But the question asks for years, so maybe 4 (rounded?) but the article says "about 3 1/2". The answer would be 3.5, but the instructions say to use exact numbers from the text. The text says "about 3 1/2 years old". Since the question asks for years, it's 3.5. But the answer needs to be in whole numbers? Wait the instructions say "if the answer is not provided and cannot be logically inferred, write N/A". The article says "when she was about 3 1/2 years old". So the answer is 3.5. But the question is asking how many years after Beryl joined. Since Beryl joined in 2012, and Lindsay started at 3.5, so the time since Beryl joined is exactly Lindsay's age, so 3.5 years. So the answer is 3.5? But the options are to write numbers. Maybe the answer is 4? Or perhaps the article doesn't give the exact age in years since Beryl's arrival, so maybe it's N/A? Wait, the article says "Beryl is missing an eye. (Scientists don't know the back story; the eye was already missing when Beryl joined the Ngogo community in 2012.)" So Beryl joined in 2012. The gesture started when Lindsay was 3.5, so if Lindsay was born in 2012 + x, then 3.5 years after 2012 would be 2015.5. So the time since Beryl joined is 3.5 years. So the answer should be 3.5. But the question says "how many years", so maybe 4? Wait, the article says "about 3 1/2", so maybe they want 3.5 written as a number. Let me check the instructions again. They say "prefer to respond in a sentence fragment or words, not in full sentences." So maybe just "3.5" as the answer. But I need to check if the question is answerable. Since the article states when Beryl joined and when Lindsay started the gesture relative to her age, and assuming Lindsay was born after Beryl joined, then yes, the answer is 3.5 years. So I'll put 3.5.

2. The second question asks which other mother-child pairs developed their own unique gestures. The article mentions that several other young chimps were seen making the motion but not regularly or with the same intent. It doesn't mention any other specific pairs. So the answer is N/A.

3. The reason for Beryl's missing eye: the article says "Scientists don't know the back story; the eye was already missing when Beryl joined the Ngogo community in 2012." So the answer is N/A.

4. How many of the 80+ gestures were developed through mother-child interactions like Lindsay's? The article doesn't give a number. It only discusses Lindsay and Beryl's case. So N/A.

5. What percentage of young chimps attempted to replicate the gesture? The article says "Several other young chimps in their community were also seen making the motion, but none did so with regularity or with the same intent." But no percentage is given. So N/A.

6. When did researchers first observe Lindsay using the gesture with others? The article doesn't mention her using it with others besides her mother. It says others made the motion but not with the same intent. So the answer is N/A.

7. The distance maintained: the article says "researchers accompany them for hours at a time, often observing from just a few yards away." So "a few yards".

8. How many generations since the 1990s? The article doesn't mention generations, only that the study is ongoing since the 90s. So N/A.

9. Average age when chimps stop riding? The article mentions Lindsay is "getting too old to ride" but doesn't give an age. N/A.

10. Which previous study by van Boekholt first documented this? The article says he first noticed it during his second field season in 2022. No previous studies mentioned. N/A.

11. How Beryl lost her eye: the article says it's unknown. N/A.

12. Wisdom's offspring count: the article says she's 74 and expecting another chick, but doesn't state total. N/A.
