Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks which senior Chinese banking official announced a specific percentage target for bond market stabilization during the Friday press conference alongside the central bank's announcement. I'll need to look through the article for mentions of officials and press conferences. The article mentions Liao Min, a vice minister of finance, speaking at a news briefing on Friday, but he talked about increasing the budget deficit, not a percentage target for bonds. The central bank's announcement didn't mention a specific percentage either. So, there's no mention of a percentage target or the official who announced it. The answer here is N/A.

2. The second question is about how many billions of dollars in deposits Chinese households moved from real estate into commercial banks in the previous quarter. The article says households have been pumping record sums into deposits but doesn't specify an exact amount in billions. Since there's no number given, the answer is N/A.

3. The third question asks for the primary reason the Harvard expert gave for the discrepancy between the January 4th policy and the bond suspension. The article quotes Mark Wu from Harvard saying, "Talk about sending mixed signals..." so the reason is the mixed signals. The answer should be "sending mixed signals".

4. The fourth question asks which three cities had the steepest housing price declines. The article mentions housing prices falling steeply but doesn't name specific cities. So N/A.

5. The fifth question is about the interest rate threshold that would trigger resuming bond purchases. The article says the central bank mentioned resuming "depending on the supply and demand conditions" but doesn't mention a specific rate. So N/A.

6. The sixth question is about the renminbi's value against Asian currencies before the policy. The article says the renminbi weakened against the dollar, especially in less regulated trading, but doesn't mention Asian currencies specifically. So N/A.

7. The seventh question asks the percentage of deposits redirected into bonds. The article states banks invested money in bonds due to rising deposits but doesn't give a percentage. N/A.

8. The eighth question is which international institution praised China's approach. The article mentions the World Bank's economists but they argue for expanding the social safety net, not praising the bond move. So N/A.

9. The ninth question is the timeline for the stimulus programs. The article mentions expanding a rebate program this week but doesn't give a specific timeline beyond that. The answer is N/A.

10. The tenth question asks how many months of factory price declines preceded the decision. The article says wholesale prices fell over 2% last year, but not the exact months. N/A.

11. The eleventh question is which asset investors avoided, leading them to bonds and deposits. The article says they shunned riskier assets like stocks and real estate. The answer is stocks and real estate.

12. The twelfth question asks who criticized the measures for mixed signals. The Harvard director Mark Wu is quoted making that comment. So Mark Wu.

13. The thirteenth question is the official who mentioned increasing the deficit. The article states Liao Min, the vice minister of finance, did so at the news briefing. So Liao Min.

14. The fourteenth question contrasts with the Fed's tool. The Fed used bond purchases (quantitative easing), which China is now suspending. The answer is bond purchases.

15. The fifteenth question compares market drops. The CSI 300 fell over 1%, Hang Seng 0.8%, so CSI 300 had a larger drop.

16. The sixteenth question asks why households deposited despite low interest. The article says they sought safety due to falling stocks and housing. So seeking safety.

17. The seventeenth question's economic indicator with low movement. The article mentions chronically low inflation as a stagnation sign. The answer is inflation.

18. The eighteenth question's recent period's announcement contrasted with the bond suspension. The central bank said on Jan 4 to make ample money available, which is contrasted with the recent suspension. So January 4th announcement.
