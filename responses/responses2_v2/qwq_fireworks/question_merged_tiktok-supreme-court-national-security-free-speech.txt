Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. I need to be careful to answer exactly based on the text and avoid any external knowledge.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks which Supreme Court justice who previously argued for deferring to government assessments later ruled against such deference in the TikTok case. From the article, Elena Kagan was the solicitor general arguing for deference in the 2010 case before joining the court. However, the TikTok case isn't resolved yet, and the article doesn't mention her stance there. Wait, the article says the TikTok case is upcoming (hearing on Friday), so maybe there's no ruling yet. Hmm, maybe the question is a trick? The article mentions that in the 2010 case, Kagan argued for deference, and she later joined the court. But in the TikTok case, the court hasn't ruled yet. The question might be referring to someone else? Wait, the article says that in the 2010 case, she was the solicitor general. The question is about a justice who argued for deference before but then ruled against it in TikTok. Since the TikTok case hasn't been decided, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says the court will most likely act quickly, but the question is about a justice who did so in the TikTok case. Since the case is pending, the answer might be N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different case? Let me check again. The article mentions Kagan as the solicitor general in the 2010 case. The question might be looking for her, but since the TikTok case hasn't been decided yet, the answer is N/A. Or maybe the article implies she was part of a ruling that didn't defer? The article says in the 2010 case, she joined the court later, and the court ruled for the government (deference). So no, she was part of the deference. The question is about someone who later ruled against deference in TikTok. Since the TikTok case hasn't been decided, maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, maybe the article doesn't mention any such justice yet, so the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The question asks how many users were manipulated with disinformation. The article states the government claims TikTok could harvest data and spread disinformation, but there's no specific number given. The article doesn't mention evidence presented about actual manipulation numbers. So answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The Lamont case was unanimous, so the vote count was 9-0? The article says it was unanimous. The question asks for the vote count that established precedent for government's right to restrict foreign media. Wait, actually, the case was about striking down a law requiring people to declare receiving communist propaganda. So the vote was unanimous against the government's restriction. Therefore, the government's right to restrict was not upheld here. The question is phrased as "established precedent for the government's right to restrict foreign-owned media platforms"—but the case went against the government. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait the question is asking what was the vote count in the case. The article says it was unanimous. So the vote count was 9-0 (assuming all justices at the time agreed). But the case was a ruling against the government's restriction, so the precedent is against the government's right. But the question is about the vote count, which was unanimous. The answer is 9-0? Or maybe 8-0 if there were 8 justices. Wait the article just says "unanimous". The exact number isn't given, so maybe N/A? Wait the article says "unanimous", so the vote count was unanimous. So the answer is "unanimous" but the question asks for the vote count. Since the article doesn't specify the exact number, maybe N/A? Hmm. The question says "how many" so if it's unanimous, perhaps 9-0? But the article doesn't state the number of justices, so maybe N/A. Wait the article says "the court struck down a law requiring people... to say so in writing. That decision, Lamont v. Postmaster General, had several distinctive features. It was unanimous." So the answer is "unanimous", but the question asks for the vote count. Since the article only says "unanimous", perhaps the answer is "unanimous". But the question asks for the vote count (like 9-0). Since the article doesn't specify, maybe N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "unanimous". But the user wants numbers. Since the exact number isn't given, I think N/A is better. Wait the user says to infer if possible. Since it's unanimous, but without knowing the total justices, can't give exact count. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Which Republican senator submitted evidence of TikTok's connection to Chinese intelligence? The article mentions Senator Mitch McConnell as a sponsor of the law, stating ByteDance is controlled by China. But does it say he submitted evidence? The article says McConnell "urged them to uphold the law" and wrote that the right to free speech doesn't apply to a corporate agent of China. But there's no mention of submitting evidence. The question is about evidence showing direct connection. The article doesn't specify that McConnell provided evidence, so N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The Pentagon Papers ruling's deadline for clearance? The article says the court rejected the government's attempt to prevent publication. The case was about prior restraint, and the ruling allowed publication. The question is about a deadline set by the ruling. The article doesn't mention any deadline established by the Pentagon Papers ruling for clearance. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: How many agents compromised after Pentagon Papers? The article mentions the government warned about endangering agents and peace talks, but the article doesn't state any proven number. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Percentage of users under 25? The article says "for many of them, and particularly younger ones, TikTok has become a leading source...", but no specific percentage. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Which previous case did Roberts cite as precedent in his preliminary TikTok ruling? The article mentions the 2010 Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project case, which Roberts wrote the majority opinion. The TikTok briefs cite that case. But the question is about Roberts citing it in his preliminary ruling. The article says in the 2010 case, Roberts wrote for the majority. The TikTok case's briefs cite that case, but the article doesn't say Roberts cited it in a preliminary TikTok ruling. The question might be about a different case. The article says the TikTok case's decision hasn't happened yet (hearing on Friday). So maybe N/A. Alternatively, maybe the 2010 case is the one, but the question is about Roberts citing a prior case. Since the article says in the 2010 case Roberts wrote the opinion, but in the TikTok case, the briefs cite that case. The question is about Roberts citing it in his preliminary ruling. Since the article doesn't mention that, answer is N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Evidence ByteDance presented about algorithm independence? The article doesn't mention any evidence presented by ByteDance. The government's claims are stated, but ByteDance's evidence isn't detailed. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: How many times did Kagan recuse herself after joining the court? The article mentions she joined the court six months after arguing the 2010 case. It doesn't mention her recusals in other cases. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The first case with "marketplace of ideas" and right to receive info. The article says Lamont was the first with those elements. So the answer is Lamont v. Postmaster General.

12. **Question 12**: The senator is Mitch McConnell, as stated in the article.

13. **Question 13**: Vote margin in 2010 case. The article says 6-to-3. So 6-3.

14. **Question 14**: The act more aggressive than the communist propaganda statute. The TikTok law is said to be more aggressive by the Knight Institute's brief. The article states: "the law banning TikTok is far more aggressive than the one limiting access to communist propaganda." So the answer is the law banning TikTok (the act mentioned is the law enacted in April, but the article refers to it as "the act" in the brief's context. The question says "which legislative act"—the article calls it "the act", so the answer is the law banning TikTok, but the exact name? The article refers to it as "the law enacted in April by bipartisan majorities". The question asks for the name. Since the article doesn't give a specific name like "TikTok Ban Act", just refers to it as "the law", so the answer is the law banning TikTok. But the question might expect the term used in the article: "the act" in the Knight brief. So the answer is the law banning TikTok, but since the question asks for the name, maybe "N/A" if the article doesn't name it. Alternatively, the article says "the law banning TikTok", so answer is that. The question says "according to a brief from a prominent First Amendment institute...", which is the Knight Institute. The article says: "the law banning TikTok is far more aggressive than the one limiting access to communist propaganda." So the answer is the law banning TikTok. But the question says "legislative act", so perhaps the answer is "the law enacted in April" but the article doesn't give an official name. Since the question requires the exact name from the text, and the text just calls it "the law", maybe N/A? Wait the article refers to it as "the act" in the Knight's brief: "the act prohibits it entirely." So the answer is the law (or act) banning TikTok. The question asks for the name, but since the article doesn't specify beyond "the law" or "the act", perhaps the answer is "the law banning TikTok". The question might accept "the act" as per the article's wording. The exact phrase in the article is "the act prohibits it entirely." So the answer is "the act" (referring to the TikTok ban law). So the answer is the law banning TikTok (or "the act" as per the article's reference).

15. **Question 15**: Which company's control is highlighted? ByteDance's, as stated in the article. The question asks for the company's name, so ByteDance.

16. **Question 16**: The administration rebuffed in Pentagon Papers was Nixon's, so the answer is the Nixon administration.

17. **Question 17**: The executive director is Jameel Jaffer, as stated.

18. **Question 18**: Elena Kagan's position when arguing for deference in 2010 was U.S. Solicitor General.

19. **Question 19**: The brief for TikTok users suggests labeling origin instead of banning. The article says: "allowing Congress at most to require labeling of the ideas' origin." So the answer is labeling (or "requiring labeling of the ideas' origin").

20. **Question 20**: The ACLU compared the TikTok ban to shutting down The New York Times entirely, as per the article's statement: "It is as though, in Pentagon Papers, the lower court had shut down The New York Times entirely." So the answer is The New York Times.
