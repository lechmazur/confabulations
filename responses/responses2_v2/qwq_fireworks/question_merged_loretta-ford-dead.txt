Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions beyond what's written.

1. The first question asks what percentage of nurse practitioners Dr. Ford directly trained at the University of Rochester. The article mentions that her program started as continuing education, not degree-granting. There's no specific percentage stated about how many she trained directly. The article does say there are over 350,000 now, but no data on her direct training. So, answer N/A.

2. The second question is about how many years after her husband's death she was inducted into the Hall of Fame. Her husband died in 2014, and she was inducted in 2011. Wait, that can't be right. The induction was in 2011, but her husband died in 2014? That would be negative years. Wait, the article says she married in 1947, and her husband died in 2014. The induction was in 2011, so that's before his death. So the answer would be N/A because the question is asking after his death, but the induction was before. 

3. The third question asks which medical journal she founded. The article mentions the "unification" model and research by nurse practitioners, but doesn't name any specific journal. So N/A.

4. The fourth question is the rank from U.S. News the year before her death. She died in 2023 (since she died on Jan 22, 2023, as per the article's date given in the first paragraph?), but the article says "last year U.S. News and World Report ranked it the top job in the country" when the article was written. Wait, the article's current year isn't clear. Wait, the article was written in 2023? The first paragraph says she died on Jan 22, so the article is from 2023. The U.S. News ranking was "last year" from the article's perspective, which would be 2022. The question asks the year before her passing (2022?), so the year before 2023 is 2022, so the rank was top. The answer is top.

5. The fifth question asks when she gave a speech at Princeton. The article mentions a speech at Duke University in 1970. Princeton isn't mentioned. So N/A.

6. The sixth question: the military branch she joined after her fiancé's death. The article says she joined the U.S. Army Air Forces, so answer that.

7. The seventh question: the title of the Healthy Women article from 2022. The article only mentions she was quoted in it, but not the title. So N/A.

8. The eighth question: the dollar amount of the Kennedy grant. The article mentions Kennedy and Johnson administrations supported innovations, but no specific grant amount. So N/A.

9. The ninth question: the name of the licensing protocol. The article says she helped create state-level protocols but doesn't name them. N/A.

10. The tenth question: the eye condition diagnosis. The article says her poor eyesight disqualified her from flying, but doesn't specify the diagnosis. So N/A.

11. The eleventh question: the clinical framework at Rochester. The article mentions the "unification" model, so that's the answer.

12. The twelfth question: years between 1965 and 1986. 1986 minus 1965 is 21 years. So 21.

13. The thirteenth question: the president associated with rural Colorado work. The article says Kennedy and Johnson administrations supported public health, so probably Johnson, but the question says "most closely associated" during her rural work. The article mentions both Kennedy and Johnson, but the work in rural Colorado started in the 60s, so maybe both, but the question might expect Johnson's era as the main one. The answer would be Johnson? Wait the question says "during the era when Dr. Ford expanded her work in rural Colorado", and the article says "the Kennedy and Johnson administrations were bringing a new sense of urgency". So maybe both, but the question asks for a specific president. The answer might be Kennedy and Johnson, but the question says "which U.S. president"—so perhaps the article mentions one? Wait the article says "the Kennedy and Johnson administrations were bringing a new sense of urgency..." So it's both, but the question asks for one. Hmm. The question says "most closely associated with these reforms"—maybe the one who's mentioned alongside the rural work? The answer might need to be "N/A" if it's both. Wait the question says "which U.S. president’s administration—mentioned in connection with a surge in public health initiatives—is most closely associated with these reforms?" The article says both Kennedy and Johnson, so maybe the answer is both, but the question asks for one. Since the question says "most closely associated", maybe the answer is "N/A" because it's both. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is "Johnson" since the program was in 1965, which is during Johnson's presidency (Kennedy was assassinated in 1963). So Johnson's administration is the one after Kennedy. The article says "the Kennedy and Johnson administrations were bringing a new sense of urgency", so both. But since the question asks for one, maybe it's N/A? Wait the question might expect the answer as "Kennedy and Johnson" but the options might be a single name. Since the question says "which U.S. president’s administration", singular, perhaps the correct answer is "N/A" because it's two. Alternatively, maybe the main one is Johnson? The program started in 1965, which was under Johnson. So answer Lyndon B. Johnson? The article says "Kennedy and Johnson", but the question wants one. Since the question is about the era when she expanded her work in rural Colorado, which was when? The article says she worked in rural Colorado, leading to the program in 1965. Kennedy was president until 1963, so Johnson was president by 1965. So the answer would be Johnson. So answer Lyndon B. Johnson.

14. The fourteenth question: the educational model implemented by her mentor, who is the mentor of a nursing school dean who received hate letters. The dean mentioned is Eileen Sullivan-Marx, who studied under Dr. Ford. The model was the "unification" model. So the answer is the unification model.

15. The fifteenth question: the global conflict that led her to join the Army Air Forces. Her fiancé was killed in combat in 1942, implying WWII. So World War II.

16. The sixteenth question: years between bachelor's in 1949 and doctorate in 1961. 1961-1949=12 years.

17. The seventeenth question: the personal tragedy during wartime. Her fiancé was killed in combat.

18. The eighteenth question: the observation she made about late-night decisions. The quote is "Who do they think makes decisions at 3 a.m.?" So the answer is "Who do they think makes decisions at 3 a.m.?"

19. The nineteenth question: years between 1961 and 2011. 2011-1961=50 years.

Now, let me check each answer again against the article text to ensure accuracy.

1. N/A (No percentage given)
2. N/A (Induction was before her husband's death)
3. N/A (No journal named)
4. Top (The article says "ranked it the top job in the country last year"—if the article is from 2023, then last year is 2022, which is the year before her death in 2023)
5. N/A (Speech was at Duke, not Princeton)
6. U.S. Army Air Forces
7. N/A (No title given)
8. N/A (No amount specified)
9. N/A (No protocol name)
10. N/A (No diagnosis name)
11. Unification model
12. 21
13. Lyndon B. Johnson (since 1965 was under his presidency)
14. Unification model (she implemented it, so the mentor's model is hers)
15. World War II
16. 12
17. Her fiancé's death in combat
18. "Who do they think makes decisions at 3 a.m.?"
19. 50
