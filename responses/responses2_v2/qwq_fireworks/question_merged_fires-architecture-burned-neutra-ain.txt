Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. 

1. The first question asks which architect's granddaughter is the executive director of both the Eames Foundation and the Los Angeles Conservancy during the wildfires. The article mentions Lucia Dewey Atwood as the executive director of the Eames Foundation and a granddaughter of Charles and Ray Eames. However, there's no mention of her being associated with the Los Angeles Conservancy. The Conservancy's president is Adrian Scott Fine. Since the question combines two roles she doesn't hold, the answer is N/A.

2. The second question is about how many Judson Studios windows were salvaged from the church. The article states that Judson Studios made the windows, including the rose window, but doesn't mention any being salvaged. It just says the church was destroyed. So N/A.

3. Third question: total square footage of surviving Park Planned Homes. The article says all but six of the 28 homes were destroyed. But it doesn't provide the square footage of each home or the total of the surviving ones. So N/A.

4. Fourth question: Which Japanese architect influenced the pagoda-like roofline of Scripps Hall. The text says the roofline was Japanese-influenced but doesn't name an architect. So N/A.

5. Fifth question: Original planned floors for Nature Friends building. The article says each floor was added as funds allowed, but doesn't state the original plan. So N/A.

6. Sixth question: Purchase price of Scripps Hall by Pasadena Waldorf. The article mentions the school bought it in 1986 to save it, but no price is given. N/A.

7. Seventh question: Material Neutra used for sliding glass walls. The article says Neutra's home had "expansive glass windows" and "sliding glass walls" but doesn't specify the material beyond glass. So answer is glass.

8. Eighth question: Original color of Business Block before pink. The text says it was painted pink "for a time," implying the original color wasn't pink, but the article doesn't state what it was. So N/A.

9. Ninth question: Elevation of Buff and Hensman's house. The article mentions it's on Malibu's La Costa Beach with a panoramic view but doesn't give the feet above sea level. So N/A.
