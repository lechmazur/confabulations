Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and don't assume anything else. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. The first question asks which restaurant's reopening timeline was tied to payroll restoration after insurance failed. The article mentions Drew Wallace and the Bull and Beggar. It says they started paying employees again, and their hope to reopen by late January. The insurance part is mentioned for others like Curate and Chai Pani, but the direct link here is Bull and Beggar.

2. The second question is about the number of ceramic pigs at Curate. The article says each table had one, but there's no specific number given. The studio was destroyed, but the count isn't mentioned. So N/A.

3. The third question is about a federal program with a 3.5% interest rate. The article mentions federal programs are loans but doesn't specify the program name or interest rate. So N/A.

4. Fourth question: Meherwan Irani's weekly cost for water. The text says $7,000 a week for each of his three restaurants. Wait, the question says "total weekly cost". So 3 times $7k is $21,000. But the article says "about $7,000 a week for each of his three Asheville restaurants". So total weekly is 7,000 *3 = 21,000. But the question might be asking per restaurant? Wait, the question says "total weekly cost for... three restaurants". So yes, 21k. But check the exact wording. The article says "about $7,000 a week for each of his three Asheville restaurants, an amount..." So total weekly is $21,000. The answer is 21,000.

5. Fifth question: Which restaurant used Padovano broccoli from Evan Chender's tunnels before the storm. The article says Evan Chender's farm supplies Neng Jr's and others. Specifically, "restaurants of Neng Jr's and a handful of others". The broccoli is mentioned in his tunnels, so Neng Jr's is the answer.

6. Sixth question: The business that relocated to the college parking lot with 25% sales drop. The farmers' market moved there, and Gwen Englebach's sales were 75% of previous, implying a 25% decline. So the relocated business is the farmers' market. The article says "the vendors have moved to a parking lot... sales about 75% what they were at the old market last January." So the answer is the farmers' market, but the question says "local business mentioned"—the article refers to the market's vendors, so the business is the farmers' market itself. The answer is the River Arts District farmers' market, but the article just calls it "the city's oldest and most popular farmers’ market". The name isn't given, so maybe the answer is "the River Arts District farmers' market". But the question says "which local business mentioned"—maybe the answer is the farmers' market, but the exact name isn't given. Wait, the question says "which local business mentioned"—since the article refers to "the vendors" moving, but the business itself is the market. The answer is "the River Arts District farmers’ market".

7. Seventh question: Which chef partnered with James Beard Foundation on insurance fraud policy. The article mentions the Chef Action Summit with the James Beard Foundation, but the partner isn't named. Katie Button and Molly Irani talked about insurance issues. The article says "the chamber is repeating the promotion in February. Everyone... the storm changed them... the bureau is working with the James Beard Foundation to sponsor a food-policy symposium in April, the Chef Action Summit." But which chef is the partner? The question is about a chef who partnered due to their own claims. Molly Irani (Chai Pani) mentioned insurance not paying. The article says "Ms. Button... insurance company has not reimbursed... an all-too-common experience... Molly Irani... none of their establishments received...". The question asks which chef partnered with JBF for policy. The article doesn't explicitly say a chef did, just that the bureau is working with JBF. So maybe N/A. Wait, the symposium is sponsored by the visitor's bureau and JBF, but the chef's name isn't linked. So answer N/A.

8. Eighth question: The date when the flood disrupted the industry. The hurricane hit on Sept. 27, as stated in the article: "when Hurricane Helene tore through western North Carolina... on Sept. 27". So the date is September 27, 2023.

9. Ninth question: The weekly expense for private water by a restaurateur. The answer is Meherwan Irani's $7,000 per week per restaurant, but the question is about the restaurateur who mentioned the cost. The article says "Mr. Irani said private water cost him about $7,000 a week for each of his three Asheville restaurants". So the weekly expense per restaurant is $7,000. The question asks for the expense he reported, which is $7,000 per week (but per restaurant? Or total? The question says "for maintaining his establishments"—so total would be 3x7k=21k. But the question might refer to per restaurant. Wait the wording is "incur[ed] a cost for private water delivery; what is the weekly expense he reported for maintaining his establishments?" The article says "about $7,000 a week for each of his three", so per restaurant it's $7k. But the total is 21k. But the question says "he" (Mr. Irani) reported the cost. The answer would be $7,000 per week per restaurant, but the question is ambiguous. However, the question says "the weekly expense he reported for maintaining his establishments"—so total. But the article says "for each of his three... an amount that would have been far out of his budget..." So the total is $21k. But maybe the question is asking per restaurant? The question might be a bit unclear, but the exact quote says "about $7,000 a week for each of his three Asheville restaurants", so the answer is $7,000 per restaurant, but the question might want the total. However, the question is phrased as "the weekly expense he reported for maintaining his establishments"—so total. So answer 21,000.

Wait, but the question says "what is the weekly expense he reported for maintaining his establishments?" The article says he paid $7k per restaurant weekly, so total is 21k. So that's the answer.

10. Tenth question: Which menu model was adopted by a restaurant that delayed a wine shop. The article mentions Neng Jr's considering a fixed-price model instead of a la carte. The answer is fixed-price menu.

11. Eleventh question: The dining establishment managed by Drew Wallace scheduled to reopen Jan 31. That's the Bull and Beggar.

12. Twelfth question: Which organization reported 14 million visitors with a 154:1 ratio. The local Chamber of Commerce is mentioned: "According to the local Chamber of Commerce, leisure and tourism make up... the visitor-to-resident ratio... 14 million visitors came..."

13. Thirteenth question: The ceramic pigs were from a pottery studio destroyed. The article says "the pottery studio that made the expressive little ceramic pigs that hold toothpicks on every table at the downtown tapas restaurant Curate. So the studio is the one that made them, but the name isn't given. The answer is the pottery studio, but the question asks for the business name. Since it's just referred to as "the pottery studio", maybe answer N/A, but the article says "the pottery studio that made... Curate". The studio's name isn't provided, so N/A? Wait, no, the question says "which creative operation—known for producing..." so perhaps the studio is the answer, but since no name, maybe answer N/A. Alternatively, maybe the studio is part of Curate? No, it was destroyed. The text says "the pottery studio that made... Curate". So the studio itself is the answer, but the name isn't given. So N/A.

Wait, the article says "the pottery studio that made the expressive little ceramic pigs..." but doesn't name it. So the answer would be N/A.

14. Fourteenth question: Farm owner from Boone who died in landslide. The article mentions Brittany Robinson, owner of Four Winds Farm in Boone, killed by a landslide.

15. Fifteenth question: New venue for the farmers' market. They moved to Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College's parking lot.

16. Sixteenth question: Second-largest economic sector after healthcare/education. The article says "leisure and tourism make up the second-largest business sector".

17. Seventeenth question: High-profile visit bringing media attention. The article mentions President Trump's visit on Friday, which brought attention to Helene's devastation. The answer is President Trump's visit.
