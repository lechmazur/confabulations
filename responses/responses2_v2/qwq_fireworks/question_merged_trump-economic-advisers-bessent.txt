Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I'm only using the information from the provided article and follow the strict instructions. Let me start by reading each question carefully and cross-referencing the article for answers.

1. **Question 1**: Who negotiated the CARES Act and became a finance professor at the UMD? The article mentions Michael Faulkender as deputy Treasury secretary, who was involved in the CARES Act and is a finance professor at the University of Maryland. That's him.

2. **Question 2**: The person under Soros and the 3-3-3 plan. The article says Scott Bessent was with Soros and promotes the 3-3-3 plan. So that's Bessent.

3. **Question 3**: Project 2025 and White House budget director. Russell Vought is mentioned as part of Project 2025 and was the budget director. Correct.

4. **Question 4**: Adviser to Romney/McCain criticized for immigration. Kevin Hassett supported more immigration and was criticized by conservatives. Yes, that's him.

5. **Question 5**: Trade negotiator with Canada/Mexico and disciple of Lighthizer. Jamieson Greer was part of Lighthizer's team and worked on those deals. Makes sense.

6. **Question 6**: Treasury pick in prison over Jan 6 and Harvard economist. Wait, the Treasury Secretary is Bessent, but the question says "Treasury pick" who was in prison. Wait, no, Peter Navarro was in prison for refusing to cooperate with the Jan 6 inquiry. But he's the Senior Counselor, not the Treasury pick. The Treasury pick is Bessent. Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The article says Peter Navarro served four months in prison. The question asks about the Treasury pick? Wait no, the question says "Treasury pick"—maybe it's a mistake. But the answer should be Navarro, even if the question is wrong. But according to the article, the Treasury pick is Bessent. The question is asking about someone in prison related to Jan 6, which is Navarro. The question's wording might be off. Since the question says "Treasury pick", but the answer isn't there. Wait, the deputy Treasury Secretary is Faulkender, but he wasn't in prison. The only one in prison was Navarro. The question's first part might be wrong, so the answer is N/A? Wait no, the question says "Treasury pick"—maybe it's a trick. The correct answer is Peter Navarro, even if the role is not Treasury. But the question specifies "Treasury pick"—so since the Treasury Secretary is Bessent, who wasn't in prison, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, no. Let me read again: "Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Michael Faulkender...". The question is about someone who was in prison. The article says Peter Navarro was in prison. He's the Senior Counselor. So the question's first part is wrong. Therefore, since the question asks about the Treasury pick, but Navarro isn't in Treasury, the answer would be N/A. Wait, but maybe the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The question is: "Which Treasury pick spent four months in prison..." The Treasury pick would be Scott Bessent (Treasury Secretary) or Michael Faulkender (Deputy). Neither of them were in prison. Peter Navarro was in prison but he's not a Treasury pick. So the answer is N/A. Wait but that can't be. The question must have an answer. Let me check again. Wait, the article says Peter Navarro was a trade adviser during first term and served time. The question is about someone who was a Treasury pick. Since he's not in Treasury now, maybe the answer is N/A? Hmm, this is tricky. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick, but I'll have to go with N/A here unless I missed something. Wait no, the question says "Treasury pick"—so unless Navarro was part of Treasury, which he wasn't in this term. So the answer is N/A. But that might not be right. Alternatively, maybe the user made an error, but I must follow the text. So N/A for question 6.

Wait, no. Wait the question says "Treasury pick"—maybe it refers to someone in the Treasury department. The only ones in Treasury are Bessent and Faulkender. Neither were in prison. So the answer is N/A. But maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the article again: "Peter Navarro... served four months in prison last year after refusing to cooperate with a congressional inquiry into the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol." So the person is Navarro, but he's not a Treasury pick. The question is wrong, so answer is N/A. 

Hmm, but maybe the user made a mistake, but I have to follow the text. So Q6 answer is N/A.

Wait, but maybe the question is referring to someone else? Let me think again. The only other person with prison time is Navarro. Since he's not in Treasury, the answer is N/A. 

Moving on, maybe I'll come back to this.

5. **Question 7**: Adviser involved in counterfeit goods and pandemic health equipment. Peter Navarro did both those things. Yes, he's the one.

8. **Question 8**: Criticism of the National Economic Council director (Kevin Hassett) was for supporting immigration. The article says he was criticized for views favoring more immigration. So the answer is "supporting immigration" but the question asks for the primary criticism. The answer should be "criticized for favoring immigration" but maybe the exact wording? The article says "rankled some conservative activists who were unhappy about his views favoring more immigration." So the criticism was his stance on immigration. So the answer is "supporting increased immigration" as per the question's wording. So the answer is "supporting increased immigration."

9. **Question 9**: 3-3-3 plan, Soros, trading against a European currency (like the pound). The article says Scott Bessent did that. So answer is Bessent.

10. **Question 10**: Pandemic relief ($2T), business school. Michael Faulkender was involved in CARES Act and is at UMD's business school. Correct.

11. **Question 11**: Project 2025 and budget oversight. Russell Vought was part of Project 2025 and is OMB director. Yes.

12. **Question 12**: Handling trade with China, worked with Lighthizer. Jamieson Greer is the trade negotiator, disciple of Lighthizer. So him.

13. **Question 13**: Restructure trade, Harvard doctorate, former Treasury role during pandemic. Stephen Miran has Harvard PhD, was at Treasury during pandemic, and supports tariffs. Yes.

14. **Question 14**: Firm on tariffs, counterfeit control, Jan 6 prison. Peter Navarro again. 

15. **Question 15**: Cutthroat trader, lost family on 9/11, trade oversight. Howard Lutnick of Cantor Fitzgerald, whose brother died, and now has authority over trade. Yes.

16. **Question 16**: Tax policy, advised Romney/Bush/McCain, led economic advisory council. Kevin Hassett. Correct.

17. **Question 17**: Tax policy reporter from Washington. Andrew Duehren. The article's credits say Andrew covers tax policy.

18. **Question 18**: Trade and international economics, over a decade experience. Ana Swanson. The article says she covers trade and has over a decade experience.

Wait, going back to Q6, maybe I made a mistake. The question says "Treasury pick"—if the answer is not there, but Navarro isn't in Treasury. The article says "Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Michael Faulkender...". The only Treasury picks are Bessent and Faulkender. Neither were in prison. So Q6 must be N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is about someone else? Let me check again. The article mentions Peter Navarro as the Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing. So he's not part of the Treasury. Therefore, the answer is N/A for Q6.

But I might have missed something. Let me confirm each again.

1. Michael Faulkender: Yes, CARES Act and UMD.

2. Scott Bessent: Soros and 3-3-3.

3. Russell Vought: Project 2025 and budget director.

4. Kevin Hassett: criticized for immigration.

5. Jamieson Greer: disciple of Lighthizer.

6. N/A.

7. Peter Navarro: counterfeit and pandemic.

8. "supporting increased immigration".

9. Scott Bessent.

10. Michael Faulkender.

11. Russell Vought.

12. Jamieson Greer.

13. Stephen Miran.

14. Peter Navarro.

15. Howard Lutnick.

16. Kevin Hassett.

17. Andrew Duehren.

18. Ana Swanson.

So that's all. Let me write the answers accordingly.
