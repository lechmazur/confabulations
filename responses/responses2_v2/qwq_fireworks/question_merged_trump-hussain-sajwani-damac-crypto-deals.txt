Okay, let me go through each question one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer strictly based on that. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question is asking which Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund provided the initial $3 billion investment to World Liberty Financial before Trump and his sons helped launch the crypto venture. Looking through the article, I remember that World Liberty Financial is mentioned in the context of Steve Witkoff being involved, and that both Trump and his sons helped start it. However, the article doesn't mention anything about a $3 billion initial investment from a specific sovereign wealth fund. The article talks about Jared Kushner's funding from Qatar and Abu Dhabi, but that's for his private equity company, not World Liberty Financial. So I think the answer here is N/A because there's no info on the initial $3B investment's source related to World Liberty Financial.

2. Next, question 2 asks how many Trump-branded golf courses DAMAC completed in Qatar between 2017-2023. The article mentions DAMAC partnered with Trump a decade ago for the first golf course in the Middle East, and they have plans to build a second which has been delayed. The article doesn't specify Qatar specifically, just mentions the Middle East. Also, the first one was in Dubai, not Qatar. Since the question is about Qatar, and the article doesn't mention Qatar, the answer is N/A.

3. Question 3 is about the percentage increase in Phoenix Holdings' stock in the first month after Affinity's $129M investment. The article states that Phoenix's stock surged since the investment, but there's no specific percentage given for the first month. So N/A here.

4. Question 4 asks the month in 2023 when Dar Al Arkan first announced plans to build in Miami. The article says Dar Al Arkan disclosed plans to start projects in the US according to a Reuters report, but the exact month isn't mentioned. So N/A.

5. For question 5, how many environmental review waivers were granted to DAMAC for data centers. The article mentions Trump promised expedited reviews but doesn't say how many waivers were already granted. So N/A.

6. Question 6 asks for the revenue from LIV Golf at Doral in 2022. The article states that LIV events boost the profile and that the 2022 event was used, but no specific revenue figure is given. Answer N/A.

7. Question 7: Which Trump executive negotiated the Jeddah tower with Dar Global in September. The article mentions Dar Al Arkan and Dar Global's projects in Jeddah, but doesn't name the Trump executive involved in negotiations. So N/A.

8. Question 8: Number of meetings Donald Trump Jr. had with Greenland officials about mineral rights. The article says he traveled to Greenland with officials, but doesn't mention any specific meetings or the topic of mineral rights. So N/A.

9. Question 9: Interest rate on Kushner's extended Saudi agreement. The article mentions the extension to 2029 but no interest rate details. N/A.

10. Question 10: Square feet of data centers DAMAC committed in first phase. The article says $20B investment in data centers but no square footage. N/A.

11. Question 11: Which Middle Eastern country's fund joined Qatar in Kushner's funding. The article states Kushner got $1.5B from Qatar and Abu Dhabi's sovereign funds. So Abu Dhabi is the answer here. The UAE's sovereign wealth fund, since Abu Dhabi is part of UAE. But the question asks for the country, so "Abu Dhabi" might be part of UAE, but the article says "sovereign wealth funds of Qatar and Abu Dhabi". So the country would be UAE? Wait, but Abu Dhabi is a city in UAE. The sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi is part of UAE's. The article says "Qatar and Abu Dhabi", so the country for Abu Dhabi's fund is UAE. But the question asks for the country's name. The answer should be Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund is part of UAE, but the article refers to "Abu Dhabi" as the country? Probably the correct answer is UAE, but the article specifies "sovereign wealth funds of Qatar and Abu Dhabi". Wait, maybe it's the UAE's fund. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the article says "Qatar and Abu Dhabi", so the country is UAE (since Abu Dhabi is part of UAE). But the question says "Middle Eastern country", so UAE would be the country. Alternatively, maybe the article says "sovereign wealth funds of Qatar and Abu Dhabi", but Abu Dhabi is a city, so perhaps the country is UAE. The article might have a typo, but according to the text, it says "sovereign wealth funds of Qatar and Abu Dhabi". Wait, Abu Dhabi is a city, but the sovereign wealth fund would be from the UAE. Maybe the correct answer is UAE, but the article might have meant the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, which is part of UAE. Since the question asks for the country's name, the answer is UAE. Alternatively, maybe the article explicitly says "Abu Dhabi" as the country? Let me check again. The article says: "the sovereign wealth funds of Qatar and Abu Dhabi". Wait, perhaps the article refers to the UAE's funds, but the way it's written, it's Qatar and Abu Dhabi (as separate entities). But since Abu Dhabi is part of UAE, the country is UAE. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistake and they meant the UAE. But according to the text as written, the answer is Abu Dhabi, but since that's a city, the country would be UAE. The question asks for the country's name, so UAE is the correct answer. But the article says "Abu Dhabi", so perhaps the answer is UAE. Alternatively, maybe the article says "Abu Dhabi" as the country, but that's incorrect. Since the article says "sovereign wealth funds of Qatar and Abu Dhabi", but Abu Dhabi is part of UAE, the answer would be UAE. Alternatively, maybe the question is correct and the answer is Abu Dhabi, but since that's a city, it's N/A. Wait, the article says "sovereign wealth funds of Qatar and Abu Dhabi". The UAE has the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, so the correct country is UAE. But the question says "Middle Eastern country", so UAE is the answer. Therefore, the answer is UAE (United Arab Emirates). But the article might have intended that. So the answer is UAE.
