Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article provided. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and cross-referencing the article to find the answers.

1. The first question is about Matthew Barbini's clients and the percentage that need help with arm positioning. Wait, the article mentions that Matthew Barbini is the director of performance for USA Swimming, and Angie Peluse has clients who need coaching. But I don't see any percentage mentioned regarding Barbini's clients. The article says Peluse's clients are about half like the author. Since the question is about Barbini's clients, which isn't discussed, the answer should be N/A.

2. The second question asks how many practice sessions Nadine Ford recommended for flutter kick. The article mentions Nadine Ford advises to use fins and feel resistance, but I don't see a specific number of sessions she recommended. The author's coach Peluse suggested 4-6 lessons with practice in between. But the question is about Ford's recommendation, which isn't specified. So N/A.

3. The third question is about how many times the author practiced breathing out underwater in a 25-yard pool during initial training. The article mentions practicing breathing out underwater slowly and steadily, but doesn't specify the number of laps or sessions. Since the question assumes a 25-yard pool and a twice-weekly practice, but the article doesn't give exact numbers, this is N/A.

4. The fourth question asks the name of the Charlotte-based organization that would recommend fins. The article says Nadine Ford is the founder of Mahogany Mermaids in Charlotte. She suggested using fins during kickboard drills. So Mahogany Mermaids is the answer.

5. The fifth question is about how many laps the author swam before correcting breathing timing. The first lesson was in a 24-foot pool where he did the catch-up drill. The article doesn't specify the number of laps before correction. So N/A.

6. The sixth question asks for the equipment besides kickboard to mimic resistance with fins. Ford said to use fins first, then take them off and mimic the feeling. The equipment is fins. Wait, the question asks for what to use to mimic after removing fins. Wait, the article says "then we take them off and try to mimic that." The equipment used before was fins, so the answer is fins. But the question says "besides a kickboard," so the answer is fins.

7. Seventh question: How many lessons beyond initial four to eliminate sinking? The article says 4-6 lessons for untrained swimmers. The author took four, so maybe two more? But the question is about Barbini's recommendation. The article doesn't mention Barbini giving this specific advice, so N/A.

8. Eighth question: Number of times author reminded himself the wall wasn't moving. The advice from Ford was to "relax. drop your head" and the author had to practice keeping head down. The question assumes he looked up once per lap. If he practiced a session focused on head position, how many times he had to remind? The article doesn't state the number of laps in a session, so N/A.

9. Ninth question: Proportion of Peluse's clients who are experienced swimmers needing catch-up drill. The article says half her clients are like the author (know how to swim but need coaching). It doesn't specify if they're experienced or not. The question asks for experienced swimmers, so maybe half? But the article doesn't clarify, so N/A.

10. Tenth question: Total weeks spent improving, assuming weekly lessons and group meetings. The ideal is weekly lessons for a month or two. If he followed 4-6 lessons (so 4-6 weeks), plus group meetings 3x a week, but the question asks for total weeks. The article says "a month or two," so maybe 8-10 weeks? But exact number isn't given, so N/A.

11. Eleventh question: The marker to look at instead of the wall. The author was told to look straight down at the centerline at the bottom of the lane. So the answer is the centerline of the lane.

12. Twelfth question: Accessory for leg movement. The article mentions fins as recommended with kickboard. So fins.

13. Thirteenth question: Key propulsive force for elite swimmers. Barbini said for elite swimmers, the kick is the most propulsive part at top speed. Wait, but the article clarifies in a note that kicking is secondary for distance swimmers, but improving it helps. The question is about elite swimmers' primary propulsive force, so answer is kick.

Wait, the article says: "For elite swimmers at top speed, the kick is the most propulsive part of the stroke". So the answer is kick.

14. Fourteenth question: Incorrect head position causing sinking. The author looked ahead, forcing chest up and feet down. So the incorrect focus is looking ahead.

15. Fifteenth question: Name of the drill for arm positioning. The catch-up drill is mentioned.

16. Sixteenth question: Breathing method. The article says breathe in above water, breathe out underwater slowly and steadily. The method is exhaling underwater in a slow trickle.

17. Seventeenth question: Metaphor for kick. Kicking off slippers, so slippers.

18. Eighteenth question: Over-reliance on arms. The author focused too much on arms instead of legs. The answer is arms.

19. Nineteenth question: Director who had injury. Matthew Barbini transitioned after injury in teens.

20. Twentieth question: Recurring challenge segment. The author still struggles after first few laps. So the answer is after the first few laps.
