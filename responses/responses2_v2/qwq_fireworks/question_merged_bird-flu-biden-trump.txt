Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by going through each question and checking the article for answers.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks which pharmaceutical company received funding for an mRNA vaccine against H5N1 in dairy cows. The article mentions that the Biden administration awarded $176 million to Moderna for developing an mRNA vaccine. So the answer should be Moderna.

2. **Question 2:** It's about how many dairy workers had severe respiratory symptoms from milk splashes. The article states that most cases in the US were mild, except the Louisiana case. The Louisiana patient was in critical condition but the article doesn't specify if they were a dairy worker or if there were others. Since the question specifies "dairy workers" and "severe respiratory symptoms," and the article mentions that the majority were mild, maybe the Louisiana case is the only severe one. But the article says "scores of people in the US have contracted bird flu... most from infected cows or poultry." The severe case in Louisiana was followed by a note that the majority of cases were mild, which might mean that the Louisiana case is the only severe one. But the question is about dairy workers specifically. The article says "when dairy workers are infected by a splash... they get a lower dose that does not lead to severe symptoms." So maybe none of them had severe respiratory symptoms. The answer might be 0, but I need to check again. The article says "the overwhelming majority of cases have been mild... the case involving Louisiana patient was followed by an unsettling finding..." The Louisiana patient's case was severe. But was that patient a dairy worker? The article says "exposed to sick and dead birds in a backyard flock," which might not be a dairy worker. So perhaps there are none. But the article says "scores of people... most of them from infected cows or poultry." The Louisiana case might be part of that group. But the exact number isn't given. Since the question asks specifically about dairy workers, and the article says that dairy workers get milder cases, the answer might be 0. But the question is tricky. Alternatively, maybe the Louisiana case isn't a dairy worker. The article says "exposed to backyard flock," so maybe not a dairy worker. So the answer would be N/A? Wait, the article says "scores of people in the US have contracted bird flu over the past year, most of them from infected cows or poultry." The Louisiana patient's case was severe, but the article doesn't specify if they were a dairy worker. Since the question asks specifically about dairy workers developing severe symptoms from milk splashes, and the article states that dairy workers get milder cases because of lower doses, the answer might be 0. But the article doesn't explicitly state this. Hmm. Since the question requires a direct answer, and the article says "the overwhelming majority of cases have been mild," but the Louisiana case was severe, but it's unclear if that was a dairy worker, perhaps the answer is N/A because the exact number isn't provided. I'll go with N/A for now.

3. **Question 3:** Total amount by Agriculture Department on fighting bird flu in humans between spring 2022 and Louisiana case. The article says the Agriculture Department spent $1.5 billion on fighting the virus among animals, and the HHS spent $360 million on protecting people. The question specifies "in humans," so the Agriculture's spending is on animals. So the answer is $360 million? Wait, no. Wait the question is about the Agriculture Department's spending on humans. The article says "Most of that, $1.5 billion, was spent by the federal Agriculture Department on fighting the virus among animals. The remainder, about $360 million, has been spent by the Health and Human Services Department on efforts to protect people." So the Agriculture didn't spend on humans. So the answer is $0? The question is asking for the Agriculture's spending on humans. Since they spent on animals, the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "fighting bird flu in humans" by the Agriculture Department. Since the article states that Agriculture focused on animals, the answer is N/A.

4. **Question 4:** When did the White House implement mandatory testing for interstate dairy cow transport? The article mentions that the Biden administration "mandated testing of dairy cows moving across state lines." The timing isn't specified except that it's part of recent measures. Since the announcement was on Thursday (the article's present), but the question is when did they first implement it? The article doesn't give a date, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Percentage of $306 million for diagnostic tools in backyard poultry. The article says the $306 million is for "improving hospital preparedness, early stage research on therapeutics, diagnostics and vaccines." The breakdown mentions $103 million for tracking and testing exposed people and outreach. It doesn't specify a percentage for diagnostics in backyard poultry. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Number of genetic mutations in BC teenager's sample matching Louisiana's. The article says "one of the mutations identified in the Louisiana patient also turned up in a viral sample from a teenager in British Columbia." So the answer is 1.

7. **Question 7:** Recovery rate for mild cases among livestock workers. The article says "overwhelming majority of cases have been mild... dairy workers... get a lower dose that does not lead to severe symptoms." But recovery rate isn't stated. Since it's mild, maybe 100%, but the article doesn't say. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** First state to implement the national milk testing strategy. The article doesn't mention which state was first, just that the strategy was established. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Number of commercial manufacturers contracted by CDC for tests. The article says "contracted with commercial manufacturers to make diagnostic tests." It doesn't specify how many, so N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Mortality rate predicted by CSIS report. The article mentions the report criticized the response but doesn't give a specific mortality rate. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Department whose unspent funds are used for $306M. The article states the funds come from HHS's unspent appropriations. "The $306 million comes from funds that have been appropriated but not spent by the Health and Human Services Department." So answer is Health and Human Services Department.

12. **Question 12:** Political figure who said to pause infectious disease measures. The article mentions Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (Trump's nominee) said he would "give infectious disease a break for about eight years." So the answer is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

13. **Question 13:** Official who noted the $306M distribution. The article says Dr. Paul Friedrichs, director of the White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy, stated the funds would be distributed in two weeks. So his name is Paul Friedrichs.

14. **Question 14:** Virus strain discussed for funding. The article is about H5N1.

15. **Question 15:** State declaring emergency over dairy cows. The article says California declared a state of emergency over bird flu in dairy cows. So California.

16. **Question 16:** Amount Agriculture spent on animals vs HHS on people. The Agriculture spent $1.5 billion on animals, while HHS spent $360 million on humans. The question asks for the Agriculture's amount. So $1.5 billion.

17. **Question 17:** Testing mandate for interstate dairy cows. The article says the administration mandated testing of dairy cows moving across state lines. So the answer is mandatory testing for interstate dairy cow transportation.

18. **Question 18:** Concern about budget cuts implied by timing. The article mentions concern that the next Trump administration might slash budgets of CDC and NIH. The timing is before potential administrative changes, so the concern is about budget cuts. Answer: slash budgets of CDC and NIH.

19. **Question 19:** Research organization critiquing response. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) is mentioned as criticizing the response.

20. **Question 20:** Genetic finding in Louisiana patient. The article says the samples had mutations that might help H5N1 infect people more easily. The specific finding is gene mutations that could increase transmission potential.
