Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article. Let me start by going through each question and cross-referencing with the text.

1. The first question asks about a real-life literary theorist who used striptease as a metaphor in lectures, which was parodied in Morris Zapp's presentation in "Small World". The article mentions that Morris Zapp's character was inspired by Stanley Fish, and the striptease metaphor is part of his lecture. So the answer should be Stanley Fish.

2. The second question is about a novel where a character loses their job after admitting they didn't read "Macbeth". Wait, the article says Howard Ringbaum admits to not reading "Hamlet", not "Macbeth". Since the question specifies "Macbeth", this would be incorrect. Therefore, the answer is N/A because the article mentions "Hamlet", not "Macbeth".

3. The third question asks for the critical work where Lodge linked poststructuralism to the hermeneutic fallacy using the striptease analogy. The article mentions "The Modes of Modern Writing" (1977) where he discusses metaphor vs. metonym, but the specific hermeneutic fallacy quote is in "Small World". Wait, the critical work might be "The Modes of Modern Writing" since that's his structuralist/poststructuralist analysis. Wait, the article says "The Modes of Modern Writing" is where he discussed modernists using metaphor and anti-modernists using metonym. The hermeneutic fallacy line is part of Morris Zapp's lecture in "Small World", which is a novel, not a critical work. The question is about a critical work. Hmm. Maybe the answer is N/A because the hermeneutic fallacy reference is in the novel, not a critical work. Wait, the question says "argued that poststructuralist theory could be likened to the hermeneutic fallacy", which is in the novel's text. The critical work that introduced the typology is "The Modes of Modern Writing", but the hermeneutic fallacy line is in the fiction. So the answer might be N/A here. Wait, the question is about the critical work. Since the article says "The Modes of Modern Writing" is where he expanded his observation into a typology, but the hermeneutic fallacy is part of the novel's content. So the answer is N/A because the critical work's title isn't linked to that specific analogy. Alternatively, maybe the question is confused. Let me check again. The article states that in "Small World", Zapp's lecture includes the "hermeneutic fallacy" quote. The critical work in question would be the one where he discussed that analogy, but the article doesn't say he wrote about that in a critical work. So the answer is N/A.

Wait, the question says "argued that poststructuralist theory could be likened to the hermeneutic fallacy". The article mentions that in the novel's context, so the critical work isn't mentioned here. Therefore, answer N/A.

4. The fourth question asks which novel includes the V1 and Spitfire scene from his childhood. The article says in his memoir, he recalls witnessing a V1 flying bomb chased by a Spitfire during the Blitz. The novel in question is "The British Museum Is Falling Down"? Wait, no, the article mentions that the scene is in his memoir's first volume. But the question is about a novel. Wait, the article says "In his first published novel, 'The Picturegoers' (1960)...", but the scene with the V1 is in his memoir. The article says: "Mr. Lodge recalled his childhood as happy... During the German bombardment... a black V1 suddenly appeared overhead pursued by a Spitfire..." This is from his memoir, not a novel. The question asks which novel includes that scene. Since the article doesn't mention that scene being in any novel except maybe "The Picturegoers"? Wait, "The Picturegoers" is set in his hometown, but the V1 scene is part of his memoir. The article might not have the novel that includes this. So the answer is N/A unless the article says otherwise. Wait, the article says "he recounted in his memoirs", so the novel doesn't include this. Therefore, answer N/A.

Wait, the article says "he wrote in the first volume of his memoirs" about the V1 scene. So the novel that includes this is not mentioned, so N/A.

5. The fifth question: Which cardinal received "The British Museum..." from Anthony Burgess? The article says Graham Greene sent it to Cardinal John Heenan. So the answer is Cardinal John Heenan.

6. The sixth question: In "How Far Can You Go", the line is about disappearance of Purgatory. The article's quote is: "On the whole, the disappearance of Hell was a great relief, though it brought new problems." The question mentions Purgatory, but the article says Hell. So answer N/A because it's about Hell, not Purgatory.

7. The seventh question: The fictional university modeled after Duke? The article says Rummidge is the fictional school, but the inspiration for Zapp was Stanley Fish at Duke. The question says "modeled after his experiences at Duke University" – but Rummidge is the fictional place compared to Oxford/Ivy League. The article says Zapp's character was inspired by Fish at Duke, but the university in the novel isn't Duke itself. The question is which university in the novels is the grimy counterpart, modeled after Duke? The article says the trilogy's setting is at middle-class schools like Rummidge. The mention of Duke is about Fish's office door. So the answer is Rummidge.

Wait, the question says "modeled after his experiences at Duke University". The article says Fish was at Duke, but the fictional university (Rummidge) isn't modeled after Duke. The question might be a trick. The answer is Rummidge, but the model is not Duke. The question's phrasing might be wrong. Since the article says Rummidge is the fictional school, that's the answer.

8. The eighth question: First novel's title, exploring working-class in a fictional Dorset town. The article says his first novel is "The Picturegoers" (1960), set in "Brickley", a version of his hometown. He served in Dorset's Royal Tank Regiment, but the novel's setting is Brickley (his hometown, which was in South London, but the army was in Dorset). The question says "modeled after Dorset" – no. The article says Brickley is a fictionalized version of his hometown (Brockley, South London). So the answer is "The Picturegoers".

9. The ninth question: Biographical novel about H.G. Wells that was better received than the Henry James one. The article mentions "A Man of Parts" (2011) about Wells was more acclaimed than "Author, Author" (2004) on James. So answer "A Man of Parts".

10. Tenth question: Retirement year from Birmingham, coinciding with "Nice Work" (1988). The article says he retired in 1987 to become a full-time writer. "Nice Work" was 1988. So the answer is 1987.

11. Eleventh question: Which character delivered the striptease lecture causing fainting? Morris Zapp in "Small World".

12. Twelfth question: Critical study introducing metaphor/metonymy typology. "The Modes of Modern Writing" (1977).

13. Thirteenth question: The theorist whose name was on the office door at Duke. Stanley Fish, who used Zapp's name.

14. Fourteenth question: Aircraft observed during the Blitz. The article mentions a V1 flying bomb and a Spitfire.

15. Fifteenth question: 2008 novel with DEATH MENU. "Deaf Sentence".

16. Sixteenth question: Tract with Catholic imprimatur. "About Catholic Authors".

17. Seventeenth question: Fictional town for his hometown in first novel. Brickley.

18. Eighteenth question: Familial class described. Lower-middle-class.

19. Nineteenth question: Later work on a pioneering science writer. "A Man of Parts" about H.G. Wells.
