Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. I need to be careful and make sure I'm not making any assumptions beyond what's written.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks how watching Aaliyah's "Try Again" through a fish-eye lens influenced her analysis of post-9/11 media. The article mentions "bling rap videos shot through a fish-eye lens" in the context of Shade's essays, but there's no direct link stated between that specific video and post-9/11 media consumption. The answer might be N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The name of the environmental nonprofit where her father worked isn't mentioned. The article says he was an environmentalist engineer who called SUVs "Stupid Ugly Vehicles," but no specific organization is named. N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The mother recommended Susan Faludi's "Backlash" for second-wave feminism. The question asks for another feminist author's work after Faludi, but the text doesn't mention another. The answer is N/A unless I missed it. Wait, the text says her mother recommended "Backlash," so maybe the question is about another author, but there's none listed. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The selling price of the avocado farm isn't given. The article mentions the sale helped fund her college but no figure. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The month in 2008 when Starbucks implemented the open-door policy isn't stated. The article only mentions the recent reversal, not the original implementation date. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The AOL chatroom's name isn't provided. It just says she entered an AOL chatroom at 13. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The number of plastic tree frogs in each goody bag isn't specified. The article mentions they were included but doesn't give a count. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The Stanford professor under whom Uncle Paul studied isn't named. He was a dropout who invested in startups. No professor mentioned. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The circulation number of the gossip blogs isn't provided. The article says reading them made her want to "go full Amish," but no numbers. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The color Pantone pushed was "pale dogwood," as stated: "doesn't extend to the denatured Tumblrish 'pale dogwood' color so relentlessly pushed by Pantone." So the answer is pale dogwood.

11. **Question 11:** The tech her father used to denounce SUVs? He called them "Stupid Ugly Vehicles," but the tech advancement similar to Starbucks' growth isn't mentioned. Maybe the SUVs themselves? Or the environmental movement? The question is about a tech advancement. Maybe the SUVs are the opposite, but the answer isn't clear. N/A.

12. **Question 12:** The object symbolizing the national mood during her birthday party. The article mentions a sourdough bread bowl used in play, scolded by a homeless man. The bread bowl itself? Or the plastic frogs? The question says "physical object" from the party. The bread bowl was part of the Embarcadero tour with her uncle, not the party. Wait, the birthday party had plastic frogs. The national mood was described as "ecstatic, frenetic and wildly hopeful" from Fukuyama's "end of history." The birthday items like iMacs, plastic frogs, etc., but the question asks for the object symbolizing that mood. Maybe the iMac? The article says "plastic tree frogs... iMacs, inflatable chairs... float through her girlhood dreamscape." The iMac is tech, maybe symbolizing the tech optimism. But the question is about the specific object from the party. The party had plastic frogs, but the national mood's symbol might be the iMac. But the question says "during her rainforest-themed fourth birthday party" so the plastic tree frogs are part of the party. Alternatively, the iMac might be part of the broader era. The question is tricky. The article says the birthday party included plastic tree frogs in goody bags and other plastic items. The national mood's symbol could be the iMac, but it's not explicitly stated. Maybe the answer is N/A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the iMac is a tech symbol of the time. Hmm, maybe the answer is "iMac" but I need to check. The question says "physical object... during the party" that symbolizes the mood. The plastic frogs are part of the party's theme, but the national mood's symbol would be something else. Maybe the answer is N/A.

13. **Question 13:** The third plastic item besides butterflies and chairs. The article lists "butterfly hair clips, iMacs, inflatable chairs" as floating through her dreamscape. So the third is iMacs. So the answer is iMacs.

14. **Question 14:** The media used by classmates to distribute porn. The article says they sent porn via actual male classmates, but the specific media? The text says "watching 'Girls Gone Wild' ads and reading cruel gossip blogs makes you want to go full Amish." So maybe "Girls Gone Wild" ads? The question asks for the specific form of media. The answer would be "Girls Gone Wild ads."

15. **Question 15:** The event foreshadowed by Uncle Paul's advice, similar to Aaliyah's crash. The article mentions that Shade's narrative leap about Aaliyah's crash foreshadowing 9/11 "in nothing but a pop-hypnotized teen's imagination." But the question is about what Uncle Paul's wealth foreshadowed. The uncle's investments (like Nokia stock) represented the era's false prosperity. The financial crisis of 2008? The article says the era ended with the 2008 crisis. So maybe the answer is the 2008 financial crisis. The question states "mirroring Aaliyah's plane crash in its impact on the national psyche" and "foreshadowed by Uncle Paul's investment advice." The uncle's wealth was part of the neoliberal boom that ended with the crisis. So the event would be the 2008 financial crisis.

16. **Question 16:** The governmental body that failed like "The Template" with Trump. "The Template" is described as moral wrong, press, protest, government response. The failure was Trump's election, so the government body might be the federal government or Congress, but the article says "government response" as part of the template. The answer might be "the government" but needs specificity. The question says "analogous to Shade's description of 'The Template' failed to effectively respond to Trump's first election." The template's failure is the government's response, so perhaps "Congress" or "the federal government," but the text doesn't name a specific body. N/A.

17. **Question 17:** The literary work recommended alongside Faludi's "Backlash" that addressed Russia's economic policies. The article only mentions her mother recommended "Backlash." No other book is listed. N/A.

18. **Question 18:** The Seattle establishment like the avocado farm's trajectory. Starbucks is mentioned as going from a niche to ubiquity and labor issues. The answer is Starbucks.

19. **Question 19:** The marketing demographic for Paris Hilton's style, which Shade's birth year (1988, millennial) and exposure to Carson Daly (not Johnny) targeted. The answer is "millennials."
