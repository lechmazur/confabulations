Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I'm only using the information from the provided article. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question is asking about music mentioned by both the licensed clinical social worker (Nedra Glover Tawwab) and Dr. Jasmohan S. Bajaj. From the article, Nedra mentions a playlist with gospel music and Megan Thee Stallion. Dr. Bajaj talks about coffee benefits, but wait, the question also mentions "brain-boosting benefits" from coffee. Wait, Dr. Bajaj says coffee helps the brain, so the music part is from Nedra. But the question is about music favored by both. Wait, the question says "music mentioned as part of a recharging playlist by the licensed clinical social worker who advocates for 'Stop, Breathe, Be'". Wait, the social worker is Nedra, and she has a playlist including gospel and Megan Thee Stallion. Dr. Bajaj's part is about coffee, so maybe the brain-boosting is coffee, not music. So the music part is only from Nedra. But the question says the social worker's 'Stop, Breathe, Be'—no, wait, 'Stop, Breathe, Be' is from Dr. Aditi Nerurkar. Wait, the question might have a mix-up. Wait, let me check again. The licensed clinical social worker is Nedra Glover Tawwab. She mentions her playlist includes gospel and Megan Thee Stallion. Dr. Jasmohan S. Bajaj (hepatologist) recommends coffee for brain benefits. The question is asking for music mentioned by both? But Dr. Bajaj doesn't mention music. Hmm, maybe I misread. The question says "music... also favored by Dr. Jasmohan... for its brain-boosting benefits?" But Dr. Bajaj's brain benefit is from coffee, not music. So maybe this is a trick question where the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "music mentioned as part of a recharging playlist by the social worker" and "also favored by Dr. Bajaj for its brain-boosting benefits". Since Dr. Bajaj's brain benefits are from coffee, not music, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The social worker's music is gospel and Megan Thee Stallion. The hepatologist's coffee benefits the brain. The question is asking for music that is also favored by the hepatologist for brain benefits. Since the hepatologist's brain benefit is from coffee, not music, there's no overlap. So answer N/A?

Wait, maybe the question is a trick. The first part is the social worker's music, and the second part is the hepatologist's brain-boosting benefits via coffee. The question is asking for music that is also favored by Dr. Bajaj for brain benefits. Since he doesn't mention music, the answer is N/A. So question 1's answer is N/A?

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The question says "music mentioned as part of a recharging playlist by the licensed clinical social worker who advocates for 'Stop, Breathe, Be'". Wait, the social worker is Nedra, and she doesn't advocate for 'Stop, Breathe, Be'—that's Dr. Aditi Nerurkar. Wait, maybe the question has an error. Wait, the question says "the licensed clinical social worker who advocates for 'Stop, Breathe, Be'". But the 'Stop, Breathe, Be' is from Dr. Nerurkar. So perhaps the question is mixing up people. Therefore, maybe the answer is N/A. So I'll note that.

Moving on to question 2. The question asks besides the Harvard Study of Adult Development, what other long-term study, hinted at by a sleep specialist, might explore the effects of 4-7-8 breathing on longevity? The sleep specialist who mentions 4-7-8 breathing is Michael Breus. The Harvard Study is mentioned by Dr. Waldinger. The question is asking another study related to a sleep specialist's advice. The article mentions "Harvard Study of Adult Development" by Dr. Waldinger. The sleep specialist's 4-7-8 technique is for sleep, but the question is about a study that might look into its effect on longevity. Since the Harvard Study of Adult Development is already mentioned, the other study might be the one that Dr. Waldinger is part of, but that's the Harvard one. Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A because no other study is mentioned. Alternatively, perhaps the "Food is Medicine Institute" study? Not sure. Let me think again. The question says "hinted at by a sleep specialist". The sleep specialist is Michael Breus, who gives the 4-7-8 tip. The article doesn't mention any specific study he's part of related to longevity. So maybe N/A?

Hmm, maybe the answer is "N/A".

3. The third question asks which university associated with an expert (who recommends a pre-sleep ritual with a partner and distant light) also has a professor studying rituals on team cohesion. The expert with the ritual involving a partner and TV is Dr. Indira Gurubhagavatula at Penn Medicine (Penn Medicine is part of University of Pennsylvania). The professor studying team rituals is Michael Norton at Harvard Business School. So the university would be Harvard. Wait, the expert with the partner ritual is Dr. Gurubhagavatula at Penn, so the university would be University of Pennsylvania. But the team rituals expert is Michael Norton at Harvard. So the question is asking which university is associated with both? Since they are different, answer N/A? Or perhaps the question is combining two different experts. Wait, the question says "the expert" (the one with the partner ritual) is from a university that also has the team ritual professor. Since the partner ritual expert is at Penn, and the team ritual is at Harvard, so the answer would be N/A. So maybe N/A.

Wait, let me check again. Dr. Gurubhagavatula is at Penn Medicine (University of Pennsylvania). Michael Norton is at Harvard. So different universities. So answer N/A.

4. Fourth question: kitchen appliance mentioned by the Cochlear Center director (Dr. Frank Lin) for hearing protection and relevant to the N.Y.U. professor's advice. Dr. Lin mentions covering ears when using a blender. The N.Y.U. professor is Marion Nestle, who talks about avoiding ultra-processed foods. The blender is the appliance. So the answer is blender.

5. Fifth question: physical action recommended by the University of Iowa's Michelle Voss (movement snacks like touching doorway, monkey bars, etc.) and also part of the deathbed test. The deathbed test involves three questions, but the action might be "stopping" or "pausing"? Wait, the deathbed test's first question is "On my deathbed, will I be mad I did it?" So the action related might be "stopping" or "pausing". Alternatively, the physical action from Voss's advice is like touching a doorway, which is a movement. The deathbed test's steps don't involve a physical action, so perhaps N/A. Wait, the question says "specific physical action" that's part of the deathbed test. The deathbed test is a decision-making tool, not involving physical actions. So maybe N/A. Alternatively, the action could be "stop" from "Stop, Breathe, Be" but that's from Dr. Nerurkar. Wait, the deathbed test's first step is "Stop whatever you're doing" as part of the "Stop, Breathe, Be" method? Wait, no, the deathbed test is separate. The death doula's "deathbed test" is a three-question decision method. The physical action from Voss is like touching doorway. The death test doesn't involve that. So maybe N/A.

Hmm, perhaps the "stopping" action is part of both? The deathbed test's first step is "Stop whatever you're doing" as part of the "Stop, Breathe, Be" method? Wait, no, "Stop, Breathe, Be" is from Dr. Nerurkar. The death test's first step is the question, not an action. So maybe the answer is N/A.

6. Sixth question: day of the week mentioned by Harvard's director (Dr. Waldinger) for social connections (Friday noon meeting) and relevant to alcohol abstinence breaks. The alcohol abstinence is from Johannes Thrul at Johns Hopkins. The question asks which day is mentioned for both. Dr. Waldinger has a Friday meeting. The alcohol abstinence might involve specific days like Dry January, but the question says "implicitly relevant". Since the answer is Friday? Because the meeting is on Friday, and the alcohol abstinence might be a weekly thing? Not sure. Alternatively, the question might be about the day when the abstinence starts, but the article says "Dry January, Sober October", so months. The question says "day of the week". Maybe N/A. Or perhaps the answer is Friday because the meeting is on Friday, and the alcohol abstinence could be weekly, but there's no day mentioned except Friday. So answer is Friday.

7. Seventh question: numerical value for hand-washing duration (20 seconds by Dr. Peter Chin-Hong) and part of the 4-7-8 breathing. The 4-7-8 involves 4 sec inhale, 7 hold, 8 exhale. The total is 19 seconds per cycle. But the question asks for a numerical value common to both. The 20 seconds for hand-washing and 4-7-8's 4,7,8. The only common number is 20 and 8? Not sure. The question might be looking for 20 (from hand-washing) which is not part of the breathing technique. Alternatively, the 8-second exhale? The question says "key component of a breathing technique recommended by a sleep specialist for nighttime awakenings". The sleep specialist (Michael Breus) uses 4-7-8. The hand-washing is 20. No overlap. So answer N/A.

Wait, the question says "numerical value associated with optimal hand-washing duration" (20) and "key component of a breathing technique (4-7-8)". The numbers are different. So answer N/A.

8. Eighth question: specific location for movement snacks (University of Iowa's Michelle Voss mentions doorway, playground, etc.) and relevant to managing anxiety via "Stop, Breathe, Be". The anxiety advice is from Dr. Nerurkar, whose method is a pause action, not a location. The question asks for a location that's part of both. The movement snacks include places like doorway, playground, etc. The anxiety advice doesn't mention a location. So maybe the answer is doorway? But the anxiety method is about stopping actions, not location. So perhaps N/A. Or maybe the "bedroom" since the sleep specialist's advice? Not sure. The question says "implicitly relevant to managing anxiety given by the Harvard physician". The Harvard physician's method is "Stop, Breathe, Be", which is done anywhere. So maybe N/A.

9. Ninth question: percentage associated with cocoa content (70% from Dr. Mozaffarian) and fluoride toothpaste (Carlos Gonzalez-Cabezas). The toothpaste doesn't mention percentage. The question asks if the percentage is relevant to fluoride advice. Since the toothpaste's effectiveness isn't tied to a percentage, maybe N/A. Unless the 70% is the minimum cocoa, but fluoride's percentage isn't mentioned. So answer N/A.

10. Tenth question: item to keep out of bathroom (magazines, phones by Dr. Sophie Balzora) and discouraged from the bedroom by the Cleveland Clinic sleep specialist (Alicia Roth). The bathroom items are magazines/phones. The bedroom advice is to not have reading paraphernalia (so phones are also in bedroom). So the answer is phones or magazines. The question asks for a specific item. The first mentions "magazines, phones" so the answer is magazines or phones. The sleep specialist says not to have reading items in the bedroom, which includes phones. So the item common to both is phones or magazines. Since the question says "specific item", maybe phones.

11. Eleventh question: expert whose hemorrhoid advice involves avoiding media in the bathroom. Dr. Sophie Balzora says to keep magazines/phones out of the bathroom to avoid extra time, which can cause hemorrhoids. So the answer is Dr. Sophie Balzora.

12. Twelfth question: two daily rituals involving electronic devices regulated by the Rutgers professor (Peter Economou) to improve sleep via meditation. The professor shuts down phone and meditates before bed, and meditates in the morning before phone. So the two rituals are: 1. shutting down phone at night before bed, 2. not checking phone first thing in the morning. So the items are phone-related: shutting down and not using in AM. The answer should be "phone" twice, but the question asks for two rituals. The rituals are turning off phone before bed and not using it upon waking. So the items are "phone" in both cases. The question asks for the specific items, so "phone" and "phone" but maybe phrased as "phone at night and morning" or similar. The exact answer is "phone before bed and phone in the morning" but the question asks for the items, so "phone" is the item. But the answer requires two rituals involving electronic devices. The answer is: shutting down phone before bed and not looking at phone upon waking. The items are both phones. So the answer is "phone".

Wait, the question says "two daily rituals involving electronic devices". The rituals are: 1. shutting down the phone at night, and 2. not looking at it in the morning. The electronic device is the phone. So the two rituals involve the phone. The answer would be "phone" as the item, but the question asks for the two rituals. The answer format requires the specific item, so maybe "phone" is the answer. Alternatively, the rituals are "shutting down the phone before bed" and "not checking the phone upon waking", so the items are both phones. The question asks for the specific item, so the answer is "phone".

13. Thirteenth question: dietary combination by Tufts director (Dr. Mozaffarian's dark chocolate and nuts) noted to have high levels of a specific antioxidant class (phenolics) beneficial for gut microbiota by the hepatologist (Dr. Bajaj). The Tufts director's combo is nuts and cocoa (dark chocolate), which have phenolics. The hepatologist says coffee benefits the microbiota. But the question links the combo's antioxidants (phenolics) to gut health. So the answer is phenolics.

14. Fourteenth question: physical activity suggested by University of Iowa researcher (Michelle Voss) for toothbrushing to improve balance. The researcher recommends actions like brushing on one foot. So the activity is "brushing on one foot".
