Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information given in the article and answer exactly as per the instructions. Let's start with the first question.

1. The question is asking which former EEOC commissioner initiated the AI recruitment practices program that Andrea Lucas criticized as discriminatory. The article mentions that Charlotte Burrows started initiatives on AI and recruitment to expand diversity. Since Lucas wanted to root out D.E.I.-motivated discrimination, it's likely she opposed that. So the answer should be Charlotte Burrows.

2. After Trump removed the two commissioners (Burrows and Samuels), the EEOC had two left: the acting chair Andrea Lucas and Kalpana Kotagal. The article says they were left with just two commissioners. So the answer is 2.

3. Charlotte's lawyer's argument about her removal's constitutionality. The article states she called it unprecedented and said she'd explore legal options. The primary legal argument would be about the terms being cut short, possibly violating the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. But the article doesn't explicitly state the legal argument, just her calling it unprecedented. Since the question is about her lawyer's argument, maybe the answer is "unprecedented removal violating term limits" but the article doesn't specify the legal precedent. Wait, the article says "the removals may leave the agency without a quorum" but the legal argument isn't explicitly stated. Hmm. The exact argument isn't given, so maybe N/A? Wait, the text says Samuels said her removal violates the law and undermines the EEOC as an independent agency. Burrows says her removal is unprecedented. The question is about Charlotte's lawyer's argument. Since the article doesn't specify the legal basis, maybe N/A. Wait, the article says Burrows "retained a lawyer" and called it unprecedented, but the exact legal argument isn't stated. So answer N/A.

Wait, the question is asking for the primary legal argument presented by her lawyer. Since the text only says she called it "unprecedented" but doesn't mention her lawyer's specific legal argument, maybe the answer is N/A. Let me check again. The text says: "Burrows, who has retained a lawyer, called her removal unprecedented and said that she would 'explore all legal options available to me.'" The lawyer's argument isn't specified beyond the term being cut short. So maybe N/A.

4. The Justice Department indicated that Trump's executive order would affect cases after his inauguration. The article says "Shortly after Mr. Trump was inaugurated, the Justice Department asked a federal judge..." So the timing is "shortly after" his inauguration, which was Jan 20. The answer is "shortly after his inauguration" but the question asks when the DoJ first indicated. The article says "Shortly after Mr. Trump was inaugurated..." So the answer is "shortly after his inauguration".

Wait the exact wording: "Shortly after Mr. Trump was inaugurated, the Justice Department asked a federal judge to cancel oral arguments..." So the answer is "shortly after his inauguration".

5. What role did Jocelyn Samuels play in the EEOC's response to Trump's rescission of Johnson's order? The article says the three Democratic commissioners (Burrows, Samuels, Kotagal) posted a statement on X taking issue with the decision. So Samuels co-authored the statement. The role is co-authoring the statement. The answer is "co-authored the statement on X".

6. Who succeeded Andrea Lucas as general counsel? Wait, the general counsel fired was Karla Gilbride. The article says "The E.E.O.C's general counsel, Karla Gilbride, was also fired on Monday night". The question asks who succeeded Lucas as general counsel. But Lucas is the acting chair. The article doesn't mention who replaced Gilbride. So N/A.

7. What percentage of cases were affected by the loss of quorum? The article states that removing two commissioners left them without a quorum, but doesn't mention a percentage. So N/A.

8. Which Senate committee confirmed Burrows? The article says she was appointed by Obama and "confirmed by the Senate", but doesn't name the committee. So N/A.

9. How did Kotagal's work experience influence her approach to DEI? The article doesn't mention her previous work. Only that her term expires in 2027. So N/A.

10. Timeline between Trump's executive order and the X statement. The article says "Shortly after Mr. Trump was sworn in on Jan 20, he rescinded the executive order on Jan 21. The commissioners posted a statement on X on Jan 21. So the timeline is "the same day" (Jan 21). The question is "how many days between the order and the statement?" The answer is "the same day" but the question asks for the timeline, which is "on Jan 21, 2024" (assuming the year is 2024, but the article doesn't specify. The exact wording: "Shortly after Mr. Trump was inaugurated, the Justice Department..." and "on Jan 21 to rescind..." So the statement was posted on Jan 21. The executive order was issued on Jan 21. So the timeline is "the same day".

11. Legal precedent cited by Burrows? The article says she called it "unprecedented" but doesn't mention citing a specific precedent. So N/A.

12. What type of case might Lucas prioritize, given Samuels' past role at HHS's OCR? Samuels was director of HHS's OCR, which handles civil rights. So maybe cases involving sex discrimination or DEI policies. The question is about a specific type of case that OCR under Samuels handled. The article says "rooting out unlawful D.E.I.-motivated race and sex discrimination" so maybe cases against DEI policies. But the answer would be "cases involving unlawful DEI policies" but the question asks what specific type Samuels handled at HHS. The article doesn't specify, so N/A.

13. Years prior to end of her first term when Samuels was removed. Her term didn't end until July 2026, but when was her first term? The article says she was appointed in 2020 and had a second term ending in 2026. So first term would have ended in 2024 (assuming terms are 5 years). If she was removed in 2024, but the article says her term was set to end in July 2026. Wait the article says "Ms. Samuels said her term did not end until July 2026. She previously worked at UCLA and as director of the Office for Civil Rights..." So she had a second term. Her first term would have ended in 2024 (assuming 5 years from 2020 start). If she was removed in 2024, but the removal happened in 2024 (the article is current as of when?), the timing isn't clear. The article is about events in January 2024 (since Trump was sworn in on Jan 20). So if her first term ended in 2024 (say July 2024), then removed in January 2024, that's 6 months early. But the question is about the first term. Wait the article says "Ms. Samuels had been confirmed for a second term that would end in 2026". So her first term would have ended in 2022? Assuming a 4-year term, so 2020-2024? Maybe the exact years aren't given. Since the article states her second term ends in 2026, but doesn't say when her first term started, so the question can't be answered. Answer N/A.

14. Legal argument related to Johnson's 1965 EO. The article says the Justice Department asked to cancel arguments because Trump's EO changed the facts. The argument would be that Trump's new EO supersedes Johnson's, making the case moot. The answer is "Trump's executive order rendered the case moot".

15. Who referred media inquiries to Victor Chen? The article says "Ms. Lucas declined to comment and referred all media inquiries to Victor Chen..." So the answer is "Andrea Lucas".

16. Other agency's general counsel fired the same night. The article mentions Trump fired the NLRB's general counsel and one commissioner. The question is about another federal agency besides EEOC and NLRB. The article says "Mr. Trump also fired the general counsel and one of the commissioners of the National Labor Relations Board on Monday, also effectively hobbling that body." So the NLRB's GC was fired. The question is asking besides EEOC and NLRB, but the only other mentioned is NLRB's GC. So maybe N/A because the only other is NLRB, which is mentioned. Wait the question says "besides the EEOC and the NLRB", so the answer would be N/A since only those two are mentioned. Wait the article says "The E.E.O.C's general counsel... was fired... Mr. Trump also fired the general counsel and one of the commissioners of the N.L.R.B." So the only other is the NLRB's GC. Since the question excludes those two agencies, answer N/A.

17. Charlotte's term expiration month. The article says her term was set to expire in 2028. The exact month isn't stated. So N/A.

18. Initiative Burrows started that contradicts Lucas's aims. The article says Burrows focused on AI and recruitment to expand diversity, which Lucas wants to root out as "woke". So the answer is "AI and recruitment practices to expand diversity and inclusion".

19. Date of the statement on X. The article says "on Jan. 21 to rescind... The two fired commissioners, along with Ms. Kotagal, posted a statement on X taking issue with Mr. Trump's decision on Jan. 21..." So the date is Jan. 21.

20. Name of the judge who canceled the argument. The article says "the judge, according to a notation on the docket, agreed to cancel..." but doesn't name the judge. So N/A.
