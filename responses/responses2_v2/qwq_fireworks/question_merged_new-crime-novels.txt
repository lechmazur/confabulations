Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the provided article. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked without adding any assumptions or external knowledge.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks what prompted the legal action by the husband of Jack Swyteck's client. The article mentions that the case was filed under seal at the request of the State Department. The husband's legal action is because the wife fled Iran with their daughter, and he wants custody. The prompt is his desire to get his child back. The answer should be "custody" or "custody battle".

2. **Question 2:** Julia Harte retired after the 1994 case and was contacted in 2024. The time difference is 30 years. The question specifies "how many years after retirement", so 2024 - 1994 = 30.

3. **Question 3:** Carrie Starr established roots in Chicago before returning to the reservation. The article states she was in Chicago's police force.

4. **Question 4:** Scott Turow's novel with Rusty Sabich taking a new case is mentioned as "Presumed Guilty". The question mentions a client fleeing Iran, but the article links "Presumed Guilty" to Rusty Sabich's new case, so the title is "Presumed Guilty".

5. **Question 5:** Dove is a reporter and creative writing professor in Kansas. The question asks for her profession, so "reporter" and "creative writing professor". Since it's one profession, maybe just "reporter" since both are listed but the question might accept either. Wait, the article says "Dove, a reporter and creative writing professor in Kansas". The question asks for the profession, so both? But the question says "profession", so maybe list both. But the answer format prefers concise. The question says "profession", so either is correct. But the article says "reporter and creative writing professor", so maybe "reporter" is sufficient as the primary?

Wait, the question says "what profession does Dove hold", so both are correct. But maybe the answer expects both? The instructions say to answer directly. Let me check the article again: "Dove, a reporter and creative writing professor in Kansas, sensitively tackles..." So the answer should include both? But the question says "profession", so perhaps list both: "reporter and creative writing professor".

6. **Question 6:** Leonid McGill is mentioned as Mosley's second detective, and it says he wasn't built for many installments. The article states that Joe "King" Oliver is back for a third time. So Leonid McGill has fewer. The question is how many installments he's been in. The text says "his latest, Leonid McGill, his second, is more idiosyncratic but wasn't built for many installments." So maybe only a couple? The article doesn't specify the exact number. It says "second" but the count isn't given. Since the article doesn't state the number, the answer is N/A?

Wait, the article says "his second, is more idiosyncratic but wasn't built for many installments." The question is asking how many installments he's been featured in. Since it's not stated, maybe N/A? But the question might be tricking us. Wait, the article says "Leonid McGill, his second, is more idiosyncratic but wasn't built for many installments." So maybe he has fewer, like 2 or 3? But the article doesn't say exactly. Since the info isn't there, answer N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The spectral figure has "antlers". The article states "the spectral figure of a woman with deer antlers: 'She could clearly see the silhouette of a beautiful woman turned to the rising sun, her crown of antlers glorious and deadly.'" So the object is "deer antlers".

8. **Question 8:** Scott Turow is known for legal thrillers, specifically mentioned as a "best-selling legal thriller writer". The question asks for the type of case Jack Swyteck is involved in. The article says "a veteran best-selling legal thriller writer has a new book... featuring his signature defense attorney character." So Scott Turow's known for legal cases, so the answer is "legal thriller" or "legal cases". Wait, the question says "specific type of case mentioned in connection with Jack Swyteck". Wait, Jack is Grippando's character. The question links Turow to his type of case. The article says Turow's "Presumed Innocent" had a prosecutor, and his new book has Rusty Sabich taking a new case. The question asks what type of case Turow is known for. Since he's a legal thriller writer, the answer is "legal thriller" or "courtroom drama". But the article says "the reviewer mentions Scott Turow is 75. Rusty Sabich... taking on a new case in Presumed Guilty." The specific case here isn't stated, but Turow is known for legal cases. The question asks "specific type of case... mentioned in connection with Jack Swyteck, Scott Turow known for...". Wait, the question might be mixing up characters. Since Jack Swyteck is Grippando's, the question is perhaps a trick. The article says Turow is known for legal thrillers. The exact answer might be "legal thriller".

9. **Question 9:** James Grippando has written 19 books with Jack Swyteck over 30 years. The question asks how many other defense attorneys he's created besides Jack. The article states "signature defense attorney character" (singular), implying only Jack. So the answer is "0".

10. **Question 10:** The attorney contending with a dossier from the FBI spouse is Jack Swyteck. The article says his wife Andie is an FBI agent who tells him about the State Department dossier. The question asks for the defendant attorney, which would be Jack.

11. **Question 11:** The central figure handling Native American injustices is Carrie Starr, as she's the tribal marshal investigating the disappearances.

12. **Question 12:** The retired prosecutor is Rusty Sabich, mentioned in Scott Turow's "Presumed Guilty".

13. **Question 13:** The detective is Julia Harte, who was contacted about the 1994 case重现.

14. **Question 14:** The award-winning writer who shifted to autobiographical work is Nnedi Okorafor, mentioned as exploring a traumatic event in her most autobiographical novel.

15. **Question 15:** The novelist probing South Korea's past is Han Kang with "We Do Not Part".

16. **Question 16:** The segment celebrating African storytelling is "A 'Renaissance' in African Publishing".

17. **Question 17:** The first and most iconic sleuth is Easy Rawlins.

18. **Question 18:** The legal thriller with sealed docs and geopolitical ties is "GRAVE DANGER" by Grippando.

Now, let's verify each against the article:

1. The husband's legal action is for custody, so "custody" is correct.

2. 2024-1994=30 years.

3. Chicago.

4. "Presumed Guilty".

5. Reporter and creative writing professor. Since the question asks for profession, both are correct. The article says both, so need to include both.

6. The article says Leonid McGill is the second and "wasn't built for many installments", but exact number isn't given. So N/A.

7. Deer antlers.

8. The question links to Jack Swyteck's case but Turow's known for legal thrillers. The answer is "legal thriller".

9. Only Jack, so 0.

10. Jack Swyteck.

11. Carrie Starr.

12. Rusty Sabich.

13. Julia Harte.

14. Nnedi Okorafor.

15. Han Kang.

16. "A 'Renaissance' in African Publishing".

17. Easy Rawlins.

18. GRAVE DANGER.

Now, ensuring all answers are per the instructions.
