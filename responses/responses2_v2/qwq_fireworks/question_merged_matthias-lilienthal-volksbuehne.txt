Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks where Dercon moved after leaving the Volksbuhne. The article mentions that Chris Dercon was the director after Castorf, but after his resignation, it doesn't say where he went next. The text only states that he resigned after six months. So the answer is N/A because there's no info on his next city.

2. The budget cuts were 130 million euros from the municipal culture budget. The question asks how many euros were cut, so that's 130 million. The article says Berlin slashed 130 million euros from the municipal culture budget, so the answer is 130 million.

3. If Pollesch had followed Dercon's model, which focused on international productions, then maybe in-house works would be cut. The article says Dercon moved away from in-house works. Since budget cuts require cutting something, the answer is in-house works or staff ensemble productions.

4. The article says Lilienthal was chief dramaturg in the 1990s at Volksbuhne. The question asks the playhouse where he served before the budget cuts (which happened later). Since the budget cuts are recent, the answer is Volksbuhne.

5. Klaus Dorr resigned due to sexual misconduct accusations. The question asks the primary reason he gave. The article says he took responsibility for the accusations, so the reason is taking responsibility for the accusations.

6. Dercon was accused of turning the theater into one for tourists. The article mentions he was a former director of the Tate Modern in London. So his nationality is British.

7. The feces were left during Dercon's tenure. The article says Castorf did Marxist reworkings like "The Brothers Karamazov" and "The Master Builder". But the activists left feces under Dercon, not because of Castorf's work. The question links the feces to a specific Marxist play by Castorf, but the article doesn't mention which play caused the feces incident. So N/A.

8. The question asks for Florentina Holzinger's production during Castorf's final year (2017). The article mentions her piece "Tanz" had a short run in New York, but it doesn't say when it premiered at Volksbuhne. Since Castorf left in 2017, maybe "Tanz" was part of that? But the text says "has a short run at the Skirball Center in New York next week" (when the article was written, but not the original premiere date). So N/A unless "Tanz" was the one, but the article doesn't confirm it was during Castorf's time. So answer N/A.

9. The newspaper was Die Zeit, with critic Peter Kummel praising Pollesch. The question is before the budget cuts announcement. Since the praise was in Die Zeit before the cuts (since the cuts were announced later), the answer is Die Zeit.

10. The Cape Verdean choreographer is Marlene Monteiro Freitas, mentioned alongside Holzinger in the advisory roles.

11. Lilienthal starts in 2026, as stated in the article.

12. The former director credited with Marxist classics is Castorf.

13. The Cape Verdean is Marlene Monteiro Freitas, alongside Holzinger.

14. The shortfall is 2 million euros as mentioned in the article.

15. The director criticized for undermining political roots is Dercon, because he shifted focus to international productions.

16. Klaus Dorr resigned in 2021 due to sexual misconduct.

17. Rene Pollesch died in February, and he was a playwright and director with a democratic style.

18. Lilienthal plans to expand dance offerings, as stated in his news conference.

19. Daniel Harding is the conductor and pilot.

20. "Les Miserables" is the French musical unpopular in Paris but being reworked.

Let me check each again carefully:

1. Dercon's next city: N/A. Correct.

2. 130 million euros. Yes.

3. In-house works or staff ensemble productions. The article says Dercon moved away from in-house, so if budget cuts, those would be cut. Answer: in-house works (staff ensemble productions).

4. Volksbuhne. Correct.

5. Dorr's reason: took responsibility for accusations. Correct.

6. Dercon's nationality: British (Tate Modern in London). Yes.

7. Which play caused feces? The article says the feces were during Dercon's time, but the specific play by Castorf isn't linked to that incident. So N/A.

8. Holzinger's "Tanz" is mentioned as having a run in NY, but the article doesn't say when it premiered at Volksbuhne. So N/A.

9. Die Zeit. Correct.

10. Marlene Monteiro Freitas. Yes.

11. 2026. Correct.

12. Castorf. Correct.

13. Same as 10: Marlene Monteiro Freitas.

14. 2 million euros. Correct.

15. Dercon. Correct.

16. Klaus Dorr. Correct.

17. Rene Pollesch. Correct.

18. Dance. Correct.

19. Daniel Harding. Correct.

20. Les Miserables. Correct.

I think that's all. Let me make sure none are missed and answers are exact as per the text.
