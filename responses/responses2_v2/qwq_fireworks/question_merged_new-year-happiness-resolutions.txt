Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and don't make any assumptions beyond what's written.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions that Lori tried to drink eight glasses of water a day for 25 years but failed. The question asks for the goal she maintained successfully. Wait, but she didn't maintain it successfully; she failed. The question might be a trick. Wait, the first sentence says "the daily water consumption goal that... she maintained successfully for 25 years before changing her approach." Wait, no, actually, she failed. The article says "I vowed to drink eight glasses... And for 25 years, I failed." So the answer is N/A? Because she didn't maintain it successfully. The question is phrased as "maintained successfully," but she didn't. So the answer would be N/A. Wait, but maybe I misread. Let me check again. The question says "what was the daily water consumption goal that Lori... maintained successfully for 25 years before changing her approach?" But she didn't maintain it successfully. She failed every time. So the answer is N/A. Because she didn't succeed in maintaining it. The question is about the goal she maintained successfully, but she didn't. So answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Dan Harris is mentioned as someone who talks about understanding the "why" behind goals. The article says Harris "tries to understand the 'why' behind his goal." The question asks which meditation technique he recommended for this. But the article doesn't specify a particular meditation technique, just the idea of understanding the "why." So maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "meditation technique," but the article doesn't mention a specific technique, just the concept of understanding the "why." So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The question is about how many miles Lori ran in her first guided session with Chris Bennett. The article mentions she started running last year, used an app with Bennett's guidance, but there's no mention of the distance. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Oliver Burkeman's framework. The article says Burkeman is a productivity expert and author of "Meditation for Mortals." He talks about starting poorly, like jogging for 10 minutes badly. The question asks about the psychological framework he developed. The article doesn't name a specific framework, just his advice. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The month when PJ Harvey's Philadelphia performance coincided with the Paul Taylor Dance Company show. The article lists the performances as "PJ Harvey in Philadelphia, the Paul Taylor Dance Company in upstate New York" as part of her 2023 list. But it doesn't say they were in the same month. So the answer is N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Chris Bennett's reason for celebrating existing habits. The article says Bennett advised to "double down on the healthy habits you already have and then celebrate them." The primary reason given is that these habits are already being done, so not to take them for granted. The answer is "they are already doing them" or "already have them." The exact quote is "We do really great, awesome things that we would make a resolution to do if we weren't already doing them." So the primary reason is that they are already doing them. The answer is "they already have them" or similar. The question asks for the primary reason, so the answer is that celebrating existing habits prevents taking them for granted, but the exact phrasing from the text is "they already have them." So the answer would be "they already have them."

7. **Question 7:** How many days she maintained journaling before changing. The article says she tried journaling but failed after a few days. The question asks how many days before incorporating into her new system. The article doesn't specify a number, just "a few days." Since it's not exact, the answer is N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Dan Harris's mindfulness technique credited for helping others during their middle school years. The article mentions Harris meditates and exercises because they make him effective for others. But the question specifies during their middle school years. The article says Harris and the author went to middle school together, but it doesn't say he used meditation then. The mindfulness technique he credits now is meditation. But the question is about during their middle school years. Since there's no info on his middle school habits, answer is N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Percentage improvement in happiness from her photo method. The article doesn't mention any percentage, so N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Number of dinner dates pre-scheduled. The article says she emails friends and makes dinner dates but doesn't specify a number. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Meditation technique Dan Harris uses for commitment to exercise. The article says he meditates and exercises because they make him effective, but doesn't name a specific technique. So N/A.
