Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me read through the questions again and then go back to the text to find the answers.

1. **Question 1**: How did Peter Yarrow's father's role at Radio Free Europe directly influence the political themes in Peter, Paul and Mary's song "The Great Mandala" about war protesters? 

The article mentions Peter's father worked at Radio Free Europe, a CIA-funded organization, but there's no direct link stated between that role and the song's themes. The song's political themes are attributed to Yarrow's own lyrics, not his father's job. So answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: How did the #MeToo movement's impact on Peter Yarrow's 2019 performance cancellation relate to the founding principles of his nonprofit Operation Respect, launched in 2000?

Operation Respect aims to combat bullying and promote tolerance. The cancellation was due to protests over his past misconduct, which conflicts with the nonprofit's principles of respect.
