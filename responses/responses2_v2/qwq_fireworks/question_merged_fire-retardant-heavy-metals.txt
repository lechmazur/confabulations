Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each exactly as per the instructions. Let me start by going through each question carefully.

1. The first question asks for the percentage of heavy metals in groundwater systems specifically in Southern California between 2009-2021. The article mentions that a third of the 400 tons were in Southern California. So the answer should be 33% or "a third", but the question specifies groundwater systems. Wait, the article says "a third of that in Southern California" but the total was 400 tons released into the environment. It doesn't specify groundwater, so maybe that's not mentioned. Hmm, maybe I need to check again. The article says "a third of that in Southern California" from the 400 tons. But the question is about groundwater specifically. Since the article doesn't specify groundwater vs other environments, this might be N/A. Wait, but the question is about the percentage in Southern California. The article says a third of the total 400 tons were in Southern California, so that's 33%. But the question is about groundwater systems. The article doesn't specify that. So maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "the researchers estimated that between 2009 and 2021, more than 400 tons of heavy metals were released into the environment from fire suppression, a third of that in Southern California." So the 400 tons total, with a third in Southern California. But the question is about the percentage of heavy metals in groundwater systems. Since the article doesn't mention groundwater specifically, only the environment, this would be N/A. So answer is N/A.

2. The second question is about the chemical in the red dye causing chromium contamination. The article mentions that the retardant contains heavy metals like chromium and cadmium. The red dye is added for visibility, but the question is which chemical in the dye is the primary source of chromium. The article doesn't link the dye's chemical to chromium; it just says the retardant has chromium. The dye's purpose is visibility, but the chromium is part of the retardant's components. So no specific chemical in the dye is mentioned for chromium. Answer N/A.

3. The third question asks for the measured increase in efficiency using DC-10s compared to helicopters. The article says DC-10s can deliver up to 9,400 gallons, but there's no comparison to efficiency percentages. The article doesn't provide a measured efficiency increase number. So N/A.

4. The fourth question is about tons of ammonium polyphosphate from the nine planes. The article mentions the planes are being deployed, but doesn't state how much ammonium polyphosphate they released. The total retardant used is mentioned as 440 million gallons over 13 years, but that's the total. The specific nine planes' contribution isn't given. So N/A.

5. The fifth question is about the cadmium concentration triggering the permit requirement. The article states that the Montana court ruled the Forest Service needed a Clean Water Act permit, but doesn't mention a specific ppm level. So N/A.

6. The sixth question asks which Native American territories had highest contamination. The article doesn't mention Native American territories at all. So N/A.

7. The seventh question is about miles of buffer zones. The article says the Forest Service set buffer zones around lakes and rivers but doesn't specify the number of miles. So N/A.

8. The eighth question asks the percentage of retardant remaining active in soil after six months. The article mentions retardant lasts longer than water but doesn't give a percentage. So N/A.

9. The ninth question is about firefighting personnel for the VLATs. The article mentions the two DC-10s joining the fleet but doesn't state the number of personnel required. So N/A.

10. The tenth question: Perimeter Solutions says how much of the 400 tons were from outside Southern California. The article says the research estimated a third in Southern California, so two-thirds (about 266 tons) would be outside. But the question is according to Perimeter's assessment. The article states that Perimeter disputed the analysis, saying they evaluated a different version. However, the question is about the percentage attributed to areas outside SC by Perimeter. Since they disputed the findings, maybe they didn't provide their own assessment. The article doesn't give Perimeter's numbers, so N/A.

11. The eleventh question asks the specific permit type. The article says the judge ruled they needed a permit under the Clean Water Act. The answer is "Clean Water Act permit" or "National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit" but the article just says "permit under the Clean Water Act". So the answer is "Clean Water Act permit".

12. The twelfth question is about legislation by the insurance regulator. The article mentions the top regulator wants insurers to pay full limits without itemization. The question asks for the specific legislation's name, but the article doesn't name it. So N/A.

13. The thirteenth question: the compound preventing evaporation that causes health risks. The article says retardant contains ammonium polyphosphate and doesn't evaporate like water. The question asks for the chemical responsible for health risks. The article mentions heavy metals as harmful, but the compound preventing evaporation is ammonium polyphosphate. But the health risks are from the heavy metals, not the ammonium polyphosphate itself. Wait, the question says "specific chemical compound... primarily responsible for the increased health risks". Since the heavy metals are the toxic part, but the question links it to the compound preventing evaporation. The article says the retardant's toxicity comes from heavy metals. The compound preventing evaporation is ammonium polyphosphate, but the health risks are from the metals. The question might be a trick here. The answer would be ammonium polyphosphate? Or is it the heavy metals? The article states that the retardant contains the heavy metals, so the health risks are from them. But the compound that prevents evaporation is ammonium polyphosphate. The question is phrased as "the chemical compound... described by Mr. Florea as a component of the retardant that prevents evaporation... responsible for increased health risks". Wait, but the health risks come from the heavy metals, not the ammonium. The article says the retardant contains heavy metals and other harmful compounds. So maybe the answer is N/A, because the compound preventing evaporation (ammonium polyphosphate) isn't the health risk. The health risks are from the heavy metals, which are separate. So the question is wrong, so answer N/A.

14. The fourteenth question: which heavy metal had highest concentration in rivers. The article mentions chromium and cadmium as examples, but doesn't specify which was highest. So N/A.

15. The fifteenth question: the month of the wildfires prompting Harris's visit. The article says Harris visited during her first visit since the "devastating wildfires last month" and mentions the "Agony of the List" article. The article was published in the present (as of the time of the fires), but the exact month isn't given. Since the article mentions Kamala Harris's visit as recent, but without a specific date, it's N/A.

16. The sixteenth question: testing protocol mentioned by Dan Green. The article says Perimeter's retardants underwent "extensive testing to confirm they meet strict standards for aquatic and mammalian safety." The question asks for the specific protocol's name, but the article doesn't mention it. So N/A.

17. The seventeenth question: alternative method mentioned. The article ends with "How L.A. Can Protect Itself From Wildfires: Around the world, other communities are experimenting with ideas that Los Angeles could borrow as it rebuilds..." but doesn't specify the method. So N/A.
