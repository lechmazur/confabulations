merged_are-smart-thermostats-worth-it.txt
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based strictly on the article provided. I need to make sure I don't use any outside knowledge and only the facts from the text.

1. **Question 1**: The MIT associate dean, Christopher Roland Knittel, mentions owning six smart thermostats and talks about the benefit of turning on the thermostat before arriving home from a trip. The article doesn't mention any specific percentage reduction he achieved during international travel. The question asks for a percentage from his personal experience, but the text doesn't provide that number. So, answer N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The 20,000-device study found that 12% of thermostats were consistently overridden, but it doesn't specify which manufacturer's thermostat had the highest override rate, especially on weekends. No brand is mentioned here, so N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The article states that radiant systems (like floor or wall heating) are less effective with smart thermostats because they take longer to heat up. However, there's no specific data on average monthly savings for radiant floor systems in cold climates. Answer N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The Canadian study mentions saving $3.50 a month by shifting energy use to times when electricity is cheaper. The article doesn't specify how many hours per day this shift required. So, N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Dr. Clapp's 2022 study found that some overrides led to more energy use, but there's no mention of a percentage increase during peak summer months. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The text discusses issues with radiant systems and multi-story homes might have Wi-Fi issues, but no specific brand is linked to this. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The payback period for traditional furnaces (built before 1990) isn't specified separately. The general range given is 5-26 years based on EPA's $50 savings. Since the question specifies older furnaces, but no data, N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The DoE says adjusting temp by 7-10°F for 8 hours can save up to 10% on bills, but the article doesn't give kWh saved annually. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The Georgia Tech study by Wichman mentions $3.50 savings from load shifting, but no percentage attributed to motion sensors alone. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The EPA's 8% estimate vs. manufacturer's 26% is mentioned, but no specific months are noted for discrepancies. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The 2022 study by Clapp found overrides led to more energy use, but the 12% increase isn't mentioned. The 12% figure refers to overridden thermostats, not increased consumption. So N/A.

12. **Question 12**: The Canadian study says shifting loads saves about $3.50 monthly, which matches the question. So answer $3.50.

13. **Question 13**: The University of Chicago's study (Clapp) says human behavior isn't factored in, but the question asks for a factor unrelated to climate with no effect. The article mentions house efficiency and climate as big factors, but no other factors stated as having no effect. N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Radiant systems take longer to heat, making load redistribution ineffective. The "critical flaw" is their slow response time. The article says they're less effective with systems that take time to heat. So answer: slow heating response time.

15. **Question 15**: HomeAdvisor's installation costs are $200-$500. The EPA's $50/year savings would make payback 5-10 years (assuming $250-500). The highest cost ($500) would take 10 years (500/50). The question asks how many years longer than EPA's estimate (which is 5-26; the lower end is 5). So 10-5=5. But the article says "based on the E.P.A. estimate of $50 savings per year... could take anywhere from five to 26 years". The highest installation cost (up to $500) plus device cost (up to $800) would total up to $1300. At $50/year, that's 26 years. The question is about "premium" thermostat (max $800) with max installation ($500) totaling $1300. 1300/50 = 26, which is 21 years longer than the 5-year minimum. So answer 21. Wait, but the question says "how many years longer than the EPA's payback estimate". The EPA's estimate is 5-26, so the EPA's own estimate includes that range. The question might be comparing HomeAdvisor's high cost scenario (device + installation) to the EPA's average savings. So device max $800 + installation $500 = $1300. At $50/year, that's 26 years. The EPA's payback is "from five to 26", so the highest scenario is exactly 26, which is 21 years longer than the 5-year minimum. So answer 21.

16. **Question 16**: The article doesn't mention any manufacturer using real-time gas prices in algorithms. N/A.

17. **Question 17**: The 20,000-device study mentions 12% were overridden consistently, but not due to occupancy sensor issues. N/A.

18. **Question 18**: The environmental benefits mentioned are about avoiding coal/natural gas generators, but the study by Palmer (from the Canadian study with Wichman) says it helps avoid those generators. The article says "Karen Palmer... economist... Canadian study" and mentions avoiding generators. The question asks which institution's team claimed benefits from preventing nuclear activation? The text doesn't mention nuclear, so N/A.

19. **Question 19**: The DoE says adjusting 7-10°F during 8 hours can save up to 10%. The question asks for the minimum adjustment that eliminates savings. If you don't adjust enough, maybe less than 7°F would negate savings. The article says "seven to 10 degrees... can slash up to 10%", implying that less might not save. But no exact percentage given for elimination. N/A.

20. **Question 20**: The 2012 models had features that caused 2-4% overconsumption when overridden. The newer models have advanced features like load shifting. The question asks which feature was removed. The article says newer models have more advanced features, but doesn't name a removed feature. N/A.
