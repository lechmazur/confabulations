Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. 

1. **Question 1:** Which automotive company's proving grounds did Jean Jennings work at before becoming a taxi driver in Ann Arbor?  
Wait, the article says she became a cabdriver before working at Car and Driver. Let me check again. The text mentions she worked as a mechanic and test driver at the Chrysler Proving Grounds after her cab job. Wait no, actually, the timeline is: before Car and Driver (1981), she drove a cab, repaired engines, and crash-tested Chryslers. Wait, the exact line: "Before joining Car and Driver in 1981, she had driven a cab, repaired engines and crash-tested prototype Chryslers at the company's proving grounds outside Detroit." So Chrysler's proving grounds. But the question asks which company's proving grounds she worked at before becoming a taxi driver. Wait, the order here is important. She worked at Chrysler proving grounds after being a cabdriver. Wait, the sequence in the article: "Before joining Car and Driver in 1981, she had driven a cab, repaired engines and crash-tested prototype Chryslers..." So the cab driving was before the Chrysler job. So the question is phrased as "before becoming a taxi driver"â€”but that's the reverse. The question is incorrect because she worked at Chrysler's proving grounds after being a cab driver. Since the question is about before becoming a taxi driver, the answer would be N/A because she was a mechanic at Chrysler after being a cab driver, so there's no company mentioned for before the cab job. Wait, the question is phrased as: "before becoming a taxi driver in Ann Arbor?" So before she became a taxi driver, which company's proving grounds did she work at? The article says she worked at Chrysler Proving Grounds after her cab job. Therefore, the answer is N/A because there's no info about a proving grounds job before her cab driving. Wait, the question is which company's proving grounds did she work at before becoming a taxi driver? Since she was a cab driver before working at Chrysler's proving grounds, the answer is N/A because she didn't work there before the cab job. So answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many times was Jean Jennings arrested during her motorcycle journey across China?  
The article mentions she rode a motorcycle across China but doesn't say she was arrested. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** What was the name of the police officer's girlfriend who received a manicure from Jean Jennings in La Paz?  
The text says she gave the officer's girlfriend a manicure but doesn't provide the girlfriend's name. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** What year did Jean Jennings win the National Magazine Award for her column about demolition derbies?  
The article says in 2009, Automobile won a National Magazine Award for a column by Jamie Kitman, not Jean. So her column about the derby isn't mentioned as the award winner. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** During which auto show did Bob Lutz first meet Jean Jennings and offer her a position at Car and Driver?  
The article mentions Bob Lutz was best man at her wedding in Geneva. There's no mention of him hiring her or meeting at an auto show. The hiring was by David Davis. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** How many episodes did Jean Jennings appear on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" discussing automotive engineering?  
The article says she talked engines with Jay Leno on "The Tonight Show," but the number of episodes isn't stated. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** What was the selling price of Jean Jennings' blog "Jean Knows Cars" when she closed it in 2016?  
No mention of selling the blog, only that she shuttered it. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Which famous racecar driver taught Jean Jennings how to navigate the 1916 Benz through New Zealand?  
The article mentions she traversed New Zealand in a 1916 Benz but doesn't name a racecar driver who taught her. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** What was the circulation increase percentage at Automobile magazine during Jean Jennings' first year as editor in chief?  
No specific percentage given. The article states she continued to build readership but no exact figure. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** What make of car did Jean Jennings drive during the demolition derby she wrote about in her 1983 column?  
The column excerpt mentions "my port side" but doesn't specify the car make. Wait, but the article says she won a demolition derby, but the specific make during that incident isn't given. Wait, the text says "the first big smack almost threw me into the back seat..." but the car's make isn't named. So N/A? Or maybe it's implied. Wait, maybe not. The answer would be N/A because the car's make isn't stated in that context.

Wait, the article says she won a demolition derby and in the quote she mentions the alligator clip, but the car's make isn't specified. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** How many National Magazine Awards did *Automobile* win under the guidance of the former cab driver who once motorcycled across China?  
The article states that in 2009, Automobile won one National Magazine Award for Jamie Kitman's column. So under her guidance, it was one. So answer is 1.

12. **Question 12:** What was the name of the editor of *Automotive News* who hired Jean Jennings at *Car and Driver* after she worked as a mechanic?  
Wait, the article says she was hired by David E. Davis Jr. at Car and Driver. The editor of Automotive News was her father, Robert Lienert. But he didn't hire her at Car and Driver. The person who hired her was Davis. So the question is incorrect. The answer is N/A because the editor of Automotive News (her father) didn't hire her at Car and Driver. The one who hired her was David Davis. So the question is about the editor of Automotive News who hired her at Car and Driver, which didn't happen. So N/A.

13. **Question 13:** In what city did the former editor-in-chief of *Automobile* marry Tim Jennings, with the president of General Motors as the best man?  
The wedding was in Geneva, with Bob Lutz (Chrysler president) as best man. The question mentions president of General Motors, but Lutz was Chrysler's president. Since the article says Bob Lutz (Chrysler), not GM, but the question specifies GM president, so discrepancy. However, the city is Geneva. The answer is Geneva, but the question's premise about GM might be a trick. But the article says "Bob Lutz, the president of Chrysler" so the answer is Geneva regardless of GM vs. Chrysler. So answer is Geneva.

14. **Question 14:** What role did the person who introduced Jean Jennings to David E. Davis Jr. play at the Chrysler Proving Grounds?  
The person who introduced her was her brother Paul, who was an editor at Autoweek. The Chrysler job was arranged by her brother. Wait, the text says her brother Paul, then an editor at Autoweek, found her a job as a mechanic at Chrysler Proving Grounds. So Paul's role was editor at Autoweek, not at Chrysler. The role at Chrysler was mechanic/test driver for Jean. The question is about the person (Paul) who introduced her to Davis. Paul's role at Chrysler Proving Grounds? No, he was at Autoweek. The Chrysler job was her own role. The question is: the person (Paul) who introduced her to Davis had what role at Chrysler Proving Grounds? He didn't work there; he found her the job. So N/A.

15. **Question 15:** What publication did Jean Jennings, who once gave a police officer's girlfriend a manicure to avoid a ticket, write for alongside P.J. O'Rourke and Jim Harrison?  
The article says when Davis started Automobile with Murdoch, she wrote there alongside those authors. So the answer is Automobile.

16. **Question 16:** What brand of vehicle did Jean Jennings use to demonstrate the fancy electronic voice system that helped her avoid a speeding ticket in Baja California, as described by the writer who covered her career after she started her blog?  
The article says she showed the police her Datsun's electronic voice system. The writer is Clay Risen, but the question refers to the writer who covered her after the blog. The article mentions Scotty Reiss, but the description of the Datsun is in the main text. The vehicle was a Datsun. So answer is Datsun.

17. **Question 17:** What was the name of Jean Jennings' blog, mentioned by Scotty Reiss, that she started after leaving *Car and Driver* in 2014?  
The article says she started her blog in 2012, named "Jean Knows Cars." Scotty Reiss is quoted but the blog name is stated. So answer is Jean Knows Cars.

18. **Question 18:** What was the name of the childhood friend of the demolition derby winner, who later worked for her at *Esquire*, and described her writing as bringing adventure to car enthusiasts?  
The childhood friend is Kathleen Hamilton, who later worked at Automobile. The question mentions Esquire, but the article says Kathleen worked at Automobile with her. The description about "adventure" is from Kathleen's interview. The question's mention of Esquire might be a mistake. The answer is Kathleen Hamilton, but the question's detail about Esquire might conflict. Wait the article says "Kathleen Hamilton, a childhood friend who later worked for her at Automobile..." So the answer is Kathleen Hamilton. The mention of Esquire is from another part where she wrote for Esquire, but the friend worked at Automobile. So answer is Kathleen Hamilton.

19. **Question 19:** What was the original name of the woman who taught Oprah Winfrey how to change a tire, before she married the dispatcher at her cab company?  
Her original surname was Lienert. She married Tom Lindamood first, so before marrying him (as her first husband), her name was Jean Marie Lienert. The question is asking her original name before first marriage. The article states she was born Jean Marie Lienert. So answer is Jean Marie Lienert.
