Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks which Yale professor's teachings led Tom Johnson to embrace repetition and stasis during his undergrad. The article mentions he took a seminar with Elliott Carter at Yale. However, it says he found himself embracing repetition instead of Carter's 12-tone methods. So the answer might be Carter, but the article says he moved away from that. Wait, the question is about the professor whose teachings led him to repetition. Hmm, maybe it's not Carter. Wait, the article says he studied with Carter and Morton Feldman. Wait, Feldman was his private teacher in NYC, not at Yale. The article says: "As an undergraduate, he took a seminar with the eminent composer Elliott Carter and dabbled in 12-tone composition... But he found himself embracing repetition and stasis instead of cerebral complexity." So the professor at Yale was Carter, but his own shift was away from Carter's methods. The question is asking whose teachings led him to that, but maybe the answer is N/A because it was his own choice, not the professor's teachings. Wait, the question says "led Tom Johnson to embrace repetition and stasis in his compositions during his undergraduate years?" Since he was at Yale, but the article says he moved away from Carter's 12-tone towards repetition. So perhaps the answer is N/A because the professor's teachings were in 12-tone, but he chose repetition on his own. Hmm, tricky. Let me check again. The question is phrased as "led by Yale professor's teachings"—so if the professor's teachings caused that, but the article says he embraced repetition instead of the cerebral complexity (like 12-tone). So maybe the answer is N/A because it wasn't due to the professor's teachings but his own shift. So I think the answer is N/A here.

2. The second question asks how many performances of "An Hour for Piano" were documented in European venues between 1983 and 1986. The article mentions that in 1983 he moved to Paris, and that "An Hour for Piano" was from 1971. But there's no specific count of performances in Europe during that period. The article doesn't mention numbers, so the answer is N/A.

3. The third question asks the name of the downtown NYC venue where he premiered a math-based composition on Mandelbrot's fractals. The article says in the 1980s he immersed himself in Euclid and Mandelbrot, and mentions works like "Rational Melodies" and "The Chord Catalog." The premiere venue isn't mentioned here. The Kitchen is mentioned as a venue where he documented others, but not for his own premiere of that specific work. So N/A.

4. Fourth question: Which French composer collaborated on "Nine Bells" in 1979? The article says "Nine Bells" was his own work where he walked among bells. There's no mention of a collaborator, so N/A.

5. Fifth question: Total duration of the first performance of his rhythmic combinations at The Kitchen. The article mentions "Nine Bells" (1979) lasted nearly an hour, but that's in a grid of bells. The Kitchen is a venue where he wrote about others, but the question links to a different piece. The article doesn't specify the duration for the rhythmic combinations' first performance. N/A.

6. Sixth question: How Rita Hutcherson's instruction influenced the math structures in "The Chord Catalog." The article says Hutcherson encouraged his composing, but the math influence came later with Euclid and Mandelbrot. No direct link mentioned between her teaching and "The Chord Catalog." So N/A.

7. Seventh question: Attendance count at the Paris premiere of the Bonhoeffer oratorio. The article mentions the oratorio exists but no attendance numbers. N/A.

8. Eighth question: Which column detailed Johnson's experience in Phil Glass's opera chorus while documenting Yoshi Wada's concert. The article says he sang in Glass's "Einstein on the Beach" chorus for a column and also wrote about Yoshi Wada's show. The column that covered both? The article states "for one memorable column, Mr. Johnson sang in the chorus for Mr. Glass's landmark opera 'Einstein on the Beach.'" But the Yoshi Wada concert was in 1973. The question links both in one column? The article doesn't say they were in the same column. So N/A.

9. Ninth question: German theorist whose writings inspired "Riemannoper." The article says "Riemannoper" is based on excerpts from a German music lexicon by Riemann. So the answer is Riemann.

10. Tenth question: Which young composer's performance did Johnson describe regarding gongs, possibly misinterpreted as his own work evolution. The article mentions Rhys Chatham's 1973 show with gongs. So the answer is Rhys Chatham.

11. Eleventh question: Element that emerged naturally with little refinement. The article quotes him: "projects where the logic (the music) seems to arise naturally from some discovery outside of myself, and where everything comes together with a minimum of tampering (of composing)" So the answer is "minimum of tampering" or "logic arising naturally," but the question asks for the element, which is "the logic (the music)" but the key phrase he used was "minimum of tampering (of composing)" so maybe "minimum of tampering" or "projects where logic arises naturally." Wait the question is asking for the element he claimed emerged naturally with little refinement. The exact wording is "where everything comes together with a minimum of tampering (of composing)" so the element is "the logic (the music)" arising naturally. But the question wants the element, so maybe "the logic" or "music arising naturally." The article says "the logic (the music) seems to arise naturally from some discovery outside of myself, and where everything comes together with a minimum of tampering." The element he claimed is that the music/logic comes naturally with little tampering. The question asks what element emerged naturally with little refinement. The answer would be "the logic (the music)" but the key term he used is "minimum of tampering" but the question wants the element, so perhaps "the logic arising naturally" but the exact answer might be "projects where the logic... comes together with a minimum of tampering" but the question wants the element. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "the logic" or "the music." Wait the question is phrased as "what element in his compositional process did Tom Johnson claim would emerge naturally with little after-the-fact refinement?" The element is "the logic (the music)" but the answer is likely "the logic (the music)" but the article uses that exact phrase. Alternatively, the answer is "projects where the logic... comes together with a minimum of tampering." But the question wants the element, so maybe "the logic arising naturally from external discoveries" but the exact quote is "the logic (the music) seems to arise naturally from some discovery outside of myself, and where everything comes together with a minimum of tampering (of composing)" so the element is the logic/music arising naturally with minimal tampering. The answer might be "the logic (the music)" but the question might expect "the logic" or "the music's logic." Alternatively, the key term is "minimum of tampering (of composing)" but the question is about the element that emerges naturally. Hmm. The question is about what element emerged naturally with little refinement. The element is the logic/music itself. So the answer is "the logic (the music)" but since the article uses that exact phrase, maybe that's the answer. However, the question might expect "the logic" as the element. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "the projects where logic arises naturally," but perhaps the correct answer is "the logic (the music)" as per the quote. Let me check again. The quote says "projects where the logic (the music) seems to arise naturally... with a minimum of tampering." The element is the logic/music arising naturally. The answer should be "the logic (the music)" but since the question asks for the element, perhaps "the logic" is sufficient. Alternatively, the answer is "the music" but the exact wording in the article is "the logic (the music)" so I'll go with that.

12. Twelfth question: Whom did Johnson observe undergoing global evolution in minimalism? The article mentions Phil Glass's transformation into an international phenomenon. So the answer is Phil Glass.

13. Thirteenth question: Which European city became his base after moving from NYC? The article says he moved to Paris in 1983 and remained there. So Paris.

14. Fourteenth question: Who is his surviving spouse? The article states his wife is Esther Ferrer.

15. Fifteenth question: Quantifiable presentation of tonal possibilities in one octave. The article mentions "The Chord Catalog" which presents 8,178 chords in an octave. So the answer is "The Chord Catalog" or the number. The question asks what quantifiable presentation did he design, so the answer is "The Chord Catalog" which features 8,178 chords. But the question says "what quantifiable presentation"—so the name of the work is "The Chord Catalog."

16. Sixteenth question: One-word description he used to define his approach. The article says he used the term "minimal" and was proud of it. So "minimal."

17. Seventeenth question: Composition requiring soloist to bow while speaking. The article mentions "Failing" (1975) where a soloist does that. So "Failing."

18. Eighteenth question: Which genre did he presage that later found imitators worldwide? The article says he noted the rise of American minimalism, which became a genre with imitators. So "American minimalism."

19. Nineteenth question: Opera he participated in as chorus member. The article says he sang in Glass's "Einstein on the Beach" for a column. So "Einstein on the Beach."
