Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions beyond what's written.

1. **Question 1:** The completion rate difference between ulipristal plus misoprostol and mifepristone plus misoprostol. The article says the ulipristal group had a 97% completion rate, similar to mifepristone. So the difference is 0%? Or maybe they are the same. The question mentions "controlled trial portions" but the study might not have a comparison group. Wait, the article states "similar to the regimen using mifepristone." Since there's no comparison group in the study itself, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "in the controlled trial portions"—but the study might not have a controlled trial part. Hmm, the article says "no comparison group of patients," so the difference can't be calculated. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Dr. Gomperts' dosage in Europe. The article mentions she's studying low doses of mifepristone for birth control, not ulipristal. Wait, the question is about ulipristal. The article says "low doses of mifepristone as a weekly birth control pill." So Dr. Gomperts isn't mentioned prescribing ulipristal here. So answer N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Which state's AG first filed litigation against Ella post-study? The article mentions the Texas AG suing a NY doctor about sending pills, but that's about abortion pills, not Ella. Students for Life of America said they'd consider litigation over Ella, but the question is about a state attorney general. The article says Project 2025 wants to remove Ella from ACA coverage, but not which state sued. The revived lawsuit has three states as plaintiffs, but that's about mifepristone, not Ella. So no info on a state AG suing Ella. Answer N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Severe side effects percentage. The study mentions "no serious complications." So 0%? But the question is about "severe side effects"—maybe that's the same as serious complications. So 0%? The article says "no serious complications," so answer 0%.

5. **Question 5:** Project 2025's recommendation to replace Ella. The article says Project 2025 wants Ella removed from ACA coverage because it's a "potential abortifacient." But what replaces it? The text doesn't say. The question asks what should replace it. Since it's not mentioned, answer N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Days after Supreme Court's 2022 decision Dr. Winikoff started research. The article says she became interested after the decision, but no exact days. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** FDA's reason for changing Plan B's label in 2022. The article states the FDA changed it to clarify Plan B acts before pregnancy, not affecting existing ones. The primary reason given was to correct the mechanism, so the answer is to clarify that it doesn't work if pregnant.

8. **Question 8:** Which company funded the Mexico City study. The article mentions Perrigo manufactures Ella but doesn't say they funded the study. The study was co-led by Mexican researchers but no funding info. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Optimal dosing interval between ulipristal and misoprostol. The article says "followed by misoprostol," but the exact interval (like 24-48 hours as with mifepristone?) isn't specified. The standard regimen for mifepristone uses 24-48 hours, but the study might have used same. But article says "the second drug" but not interval. Since it's not stated, N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Number of states in revived lawsuit. The article says the suit was revived with three states as plaintiffs. So answer 3.

11. **Question 11:** Dosage used in Mexico study. The study used 60mg (double the 30mg in Ella). The question combines Perrigo's statement (which says 60mg vs Ella's 30mg) and Dr. Gomperts' research (not relevant here). Answer 60mg.

12. **Question 12:** Legal action Students for Life would take against FDA's label change. The question is about their reaction to Plan B's label change. The article says they would consider litigation over Ella, but the question is about Plan B's label. The article doesn't mention them acting on Plan B's change. So N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Legal argument if Texas sues Perrigo. Dr. Harrison's statement says ulipristal works like mifepristone. The lawsuit against the NY doctor was about sending abortion pills. So Texas might argue Ella can cause abortion, hence should be restricted. The central aspect is Ella's potential as an abortifacient. Answer: Ella's potential as an abortifacient.

14. **Question 14:** Percentage of pregnancies terminated by standard 30mg Ella. The study used 60mg for abortion. The standard Ella dose (30mg) is for contraception. The article says Ella doesn't terminate pregnancies. So 0%? The question is tricky because it's about the study's pregnancies. The study's participants used 60mg. So the standard 30mg isn't used in the study for abortion. So answer 0%.

15. **Question 15:** Other use of misoprostol mentioned in the lawsuit context. The article says misoprostol has various uses and isn't targeted as much. The revived lawsuit is about mifepristone, but misoprostol's other uses? The article says misoprostol can cause abortion on its own but is more effective with mife. The other use might be for inducing labor or ulcers? The text says "has various medical uses" but specifies "can also facilitate an abortion on its own." The other use isn't listed, so maybe N/A. Wait, the question is in the context of the lawsuit. The article mentions the lawsuit's focus on mifepristone, but misoprostol's other uses? The article says "has various medical uses" but doesn't name them. So N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Supreme Court action on the revived lawsuit with 3 states. The article says the Supreme Court rejected the initial suit, but the revived one with three states—what did the Court do? The article doesn't mention the current status of the revived lawsuit, so N/A.

17. **Question 17:** Name of Dr. Gomperts' telemedicine org. The article mentions her as founder of telemedicine organizations providing abortion pills. The name isn't given. So N/A.

18. **Question 18:** Primary mechanism of the drug in WA pilot program. The pilot allows pharmacists to prescribe abortion pills (mifepristone and misoprostol). The question asks for the primary mechanism of the drug in the program, which is mifepristone. The FDA label for mifepristone says it blocks progesterone. So answer: blocking progesterone.

19. **Question 19:** Lead author also researching mifepristone birth control. The lead author is Dr. Beverly Winikoff. The article mentions Dr. Gomperts is studying low-dose mifepristone for birth control, but the lead author of the study is Dr. Winikoff. So her name is Beverly Winikoff.

20. **Question 20:** Hormone blocked by both drugs. Both mifepristone and ulipristal block progesterone. The article states that ulipristal "blocks the activity of progesterone" like mifepristone. So answer: progesterone.
