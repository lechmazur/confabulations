Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to make sure I answer each exactly based on the text without any external knowledge. Let's go step by step.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions Rhoda (Davis) Feiffer sold dress designs after her husband's shop failed. The question asks for the type of business she ran. The answer should be "dress designs".

2. **Question 2**: The peak number of newspapers was mentioned as 100. The question specifies after moving to NYT in 1997, but the article says "reaching 100 newspapers at its peak" when discussing syndication. Since the peak is mentioned before leaving the Voice (he left in 1997 but continued monthly in NYT), the answer is 100.

3. **Question 3**: The documentary about "The Phantom Tollbooth" is called "The Phantom Tollbooth: Beyond Expectations" and premiered at the New Yorker Festival, not Tribeca. The question mentions Tribeca, so answer N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The Obie Award was for the Off-Broadway "Little Murders" production. The article says he won an Obie after the Off-Broadway run, which was two years after the 1967 Broadway run. 1967 +2 is 1969. But need to check exact date. The article states "for which he won an Obie Award." The question asks the year. Since the Off-Broadway run was after the Broadway closure, and the original Broadway was 1967, but the article says "for a new staging of 'Little Murders,' which ran for 400 performances two years after its brief and critically panned Broadway run, and for which he won an Obie Award." So two years after 1967 would be 1969. So answer 1969.

5. **Question 5**: The reporter was Jenny Allen, working for Life magazine, not Esquire. The question mentions Esquire, so N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The graphic novel in 1995? The article mentions "Kill My Mother" in 2014 as his return to adult themes. Wait, the article says in 2014 he returned to adult themes with "Kill My Mother", which is a monochromatic tribute to film noir. The question says 1995, which doesn't match. So answer N/A.

7. **Question 7**: "Bernard and Huey" closed the Slamdance Film Festival in Park City, Utah in 2018. The answer is Slamdance.

8. **Question 8**: The character modeled after Bernard Mergendeiler was played by Art Garfunkel in "Carnal Knowledge". The question says modeled after the Spirit, but the article says "modeled after Bernard Mergendeiler". The Spirit was created by Eisner, but the question has an incorrect premise. The answer is N/A because the question incorrectly states the model was the Spirit. Wait, the article says "the role Mr. Feiffer later said was modeled after Bernard Mergendeiler". So the answer should be the character's name. Wait, the question asks for the character's name. The article says "Art Garfunkel (in a role Mr. Feiffer later said was modeled after Bernard Mergendeiler)". The character's name isn't given here. So the answer is N/A because the text doesn't name the character. 

9. **Question 9**: The film was "Popeye" written by Feiffer based on Segar's strip, not the Fleischer animations. The question says based on Fleischer's, which is incorrect. The article says he based it on Segar's original. So answer N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The 2010 graphic novel for middle-school is "The Odious Ogre" (co-reunion with Juster). The 2024 interview mentions "Amazing Grapes" as his first for that age. The question asks for 2010, so "The Odious Ogre".

11. **Question 11**: The noir-inspired graphic novel with Halley is "Kill My Mother" series. The question mentions co-authored with Halley? The article says "Kill My Mother" was with daughter Kate, not Halley. Halley is a playwright. The answer would be N/A because the question specifies Halley, but the book was with Kate. 

12. **Question 12**: The play in 1969 as part of "Oh! Calcutta!" which was an anthology. The article mentions "a segment of 'Oh! Calcutta!' (1969)". The question asks which play won a Tony for revival with Elliott Gould. The revival of "Little Murders" was mentioned, but the Tony was for "Knock Knock" in 1976. The question is about a play that premiered Off-Broadway in 1969 as part of Oh! Calcutta and later won a Tony. Since the segment was part of that show, but the Tony was for another play. So the answer is N/A because the question is about a play that was part of Oh! Calcutta and later won a Tony. The article says "Little Murders" had a revival with Gould, but the Tony was for "Knock Knock". So the answer is N/A.

13. **Question 13**: The screenplay for Robert Altman's "Popeye" had a cameo by Will Eisner? The article mentions Feiffer worked with Eisner early on, but the question's detail isn't in the text. The article says "when E.C. Segar's daughter saw the movie, Mr. Feiffer told The Comics Journal in 1988, she called to tell him that he had captured the essence of her father's creation..." No mention of Eisner cameo. So N/A.
