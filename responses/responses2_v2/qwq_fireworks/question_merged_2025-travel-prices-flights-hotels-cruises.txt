Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information given and avoid any external knowledge. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks for the percentage increase in economy hotel rates in the Caribbean linked to cruise industry incentives. The article mentions that economy hotels have a .2% increase, but the cruise incentives aren't tied to that. The Caribbean's airfares are down 17%, but that's for air, not hotels. So maybe N/A?

Wait, the question says "mirroring the trend observed in the cruise industry" which uses incentives over price cuts. But the economy hotel rates are up .2%, but that's a negligible rise, not an increase due to cruise incentives. So the answer might be N/A because the question is about the hotel rate increase percentage in the Caribbean due to cruise trends, which isn't specified.

2. **Question 2**: Kayak found a decrease in international airfares. The article states that international fares fell, with Asia down 7% and Caribbean 17%. But the question asks for the overall decrease for all destinations. The text doesn't give an overall percentage, just specific regions. So N/A?

3. **Question 3**: The chief economist from Hopper said spring/summer 2025 fares are up double digits compared to 2024. The exact percentage isn't given, just "double digits". So the answer is "double digits".

4. **Question 4**: The ship with 382 port calls was Life at Sea's 3-year cruise. The article mentions "Life at Sea cruise" with 382 port calls. So the answer is "Life at Sea".

5. **Question 5**: The cruise lines offer incentives like prepaid gratuities and shipboard credits. The general manager of Cruiseline.com said they prefer these over fare cuts. So the discount type is "prepaid gratuities" or "shipboard credits". The question asks for the specific type most commonly offered. The answer would be "prepaid gratuities" or "shipboard credits", but the question says "most commonly offered" and the article lists both. Maybe the first one mentioned? "prepaid gratuities".

6. **Question 6**: The CLIA reported 2024 passengers up 9% from 2023. The question asks for that percentage. Answer is 9%.

7. **Question 7**: The projected 2025 passengers are 37 million (from CLIA). The answer is 37 million.

8. **Question 8**: The Caribbean's fares were down 17% in 2025 compared to 2024 according to Kayak. The question is about the Caribbean's decrease, so 17%.

9. **Question 9**: Cruise Critic says summer 2025 cruises (3-10 days) up 6%. So 6%.

10. **Question 10**: STR reported U.S. hotel rates rose 1.6% in first 11 months of 2024, but the question is about 2025. Since 2025 data isn't provided, it's N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The Caribbean is getting MSC World America (European design) and had a fare drop. The question links the region with both the ship and airfare drop. The region is Caribbean.

12. **Question 12**: Economy hotel rates in 2025 are projected to rise .2%, as per the article. So .2%.

13. **Question 13**: The cruise line avoiding fare cuts to keep occupancy high despite criticism is Royal Caribbean (Icon class ships criticized). The article says cruise lines prefer incentives over cuts. The general manager of Cruiseline.com mentioned this. The question asks which line's decision is linked to environmental criticism. Royal Caribbean's Icon class is criticized, so the answer is "Royal Caribbean".

14. **Question 14**: The question asks for the % increase in passengers attributed to prepaid gratuities. The article says CLIA reported 9% increase in 2024, but no info on what's due to incentives. So N/A.

15. **Question 15**: Luxury hotels vs inflation. The article says hotel rates grow gradually below inflation. But luxury hotels are doing better, but their exact rate vs inflation isn't given. The answer is "below the rate of inflation" for U.S. hotels in general. Since luxury are better, maybe their growth is higher than economy's .2% but still below inflation? The article says "gradually below inflation" for all U.S. hotel rates. So luxury's growth is still below inflation. So answer "below inflation".

16. **Question 16**: Asia's fares down 7%, and increased cruise departures? The article says Asia fares down, but no info on cruise departures from there. So N/A.

17. **Question 17**: Unique cabin for solo travelers? The article mentions cabin types changing for solo cruising but doesn't specify types. So N/A.

18. **Question 18**: Hopper says domestic fares remain above until midyear 2025, so after midyear they might drop. The question asks which month? The article says "until midyear at least", implying after midyear (like July?), but exact month isn't given. N/A.

19. **Question 19**: Environmental criticism of Icon ships. The article mentions environmental groups criticizing them for being megaships. The specific feature? Probably their size or environmental impact, but the exact feature isn't listed. N/A.

20. **Question 20**: Days into the voyage when fraud charges began. The Life at Sea was 1,095 days, but when did passengers start suing? The article says "those who signed up are seeking fraud charges instead" but doesn't mention days elapsed. So N/A.

Wait, let me check again each question with the text.

For question 15: The article says "U.S. hotel rates... are expected to grow gradually -- below the rate of inflation." So luxury hotels are doing better than economy, but the growth rate for luxury is still below inflation? The question asks how luxury's price growth compares to inflation. The answer is "below the rate of inflation" because the overall U.S. hotel rates are below inflation, and luxury is part of that. So yes, the answer is "below inflation".

For question 16: The article says Asia fares down 7%, but does it mention increased cruise departures from there? The article mentions cruise ships in Caribbean, but not Asia. So N/A.

Question 19: The environmental criticism is about the megaships (size?), but the text says "they have drawn criticism from environmental groups." The exact feature isn't specified. So N/A.
