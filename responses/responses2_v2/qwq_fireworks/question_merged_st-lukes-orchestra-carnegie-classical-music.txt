Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks about a contemporary composer's work premiered at the DiMenna Center during an early music festival. The article mentions that St. Luke's focuses on early music and less traveled repertoire, and under Bernard Labadie, Bach's works became a cornerstone with an annual festival. Since Bach isn't contemporary, maybe another composer? Wait, the article says "presenting a greater proportion of its own work: increasing its presence at Carnegie, guiding emerging artists through a composition institute, offering more performances at the DiMenna Center." But I don't see a specific contemporary composer named here. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A?

Wait, the article says "annual festival" of Bach under Labadie, so Bach isn't contemporary. The question mentions a contemporary composer's premiere. The article doesn't specify any contemporary composer's work at DiMenna for an early music festival. So probably N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Original St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble size in 1974. The article states they started as chamber concerts in 1974, then grew to symphonic scale. But the exact number isn't given. The article mentions the core, then the orchestra with 65 tenured, but not the original. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Box office revenue from film scores at Radio City. The article mentions they do fee engagements like "The Lord of the Rings" but doesn't specify box office numbers. It says they earn around a fifth of revenue from these, but exact figures not given. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Year Bernard Labadie started the Bach festival. The article says Labadie was named principal conductor after a private audition in 2016, and his tenure ends in spring with the St. John Passion. It mentions he brought Bach to the forefront with an annual festival. Since he started in 2016, the first festival would be 2016 or 2017? The article says "annual festival" but no exact start year. The answer might be N/A unless inferred. Since his appointment was in 2016, maybe 2016? Wait, the text says "annual festival" but doesn't specify the start year. So N/A.

Wait, the article says "annual festival" but the exact year isn't mentioned. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Attendance for Pichon's canceled 2020 Park Ave Armory performance. The article mentions the 2020 lockdown caused the cancellation but doesn't state the attendance figure. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Number of rehearsals with Christian Gerhaher before "Der Doppelganger." The article doesn't mention rehearsal counts. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Percentage of tenured musicians in Met Orchestra. The article says Benjamin Bowman, the concertmaster for the Carnegie concert, is also a Met concertmaster. But it doesn't state the percentage. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Conductor who turned down principal before Labadie. The article says Labadie was appointed after a private audition, but doesn't mention someone else declining. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Initial budget for DiMenna Center. The article states it was a $37 million project, but doesn't mention an initial proposed amount. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Number of annual performances by Heras-Casado from 2011-2017. The article says Heras-Casado was principal conductor from 2011-2017, but the number of performances he conducted each year isn't stated. N/A.
