Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. I need to make sure I don't use any outside knowledge and strictly follow the instructions. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks which modern mollusk species is the direct descendant of Punk ferox. The article mentions that Punk and Emo are forerunners of today's worm-mollusks. But it doesn't specify a particular modern species. So maybe the answer is N/A since it's not named.

2. The second question is about how many microns were ground away to reveal the spines. The article says they ground at 20-micron intervals. But the exact number to reveal the structure isn't given, just the interval. So maybe 20 microns is the answer here, but the question is about how much was needed to reveal the complete structure. Since it's the interval between each slice, I think the answer is 20.

3. The average body length from CT scans. The article doesn't mention any measurements of the body length. So N/A here.

4. The chemical composition in nodules making X-rays ineffective. The article states the fossil and rock are similar in density. So the answer is their similar density, but the question asks for chemical composition. Wait, maybe the chemical composition isn't mentioned. The article says "too similar in density to be easily differentiated by X-rays." So the answer is their density similarity, but the question specifies chemical composition. Since the text doesn't mention the chemical part, maybe N/A? Hmm, tricky. The article says "the fossilized creatures and the rock surrounding them are too similar in density." Since density relates to composition, but the exact chemical isn't stated. So maybe N/A?

Wait, but the question is about the chemical composition. Since the article doesn't specify which chemical made them similar in density, perhaps the answer is N/A. Or maybe the fact that their densities are similar is the key. But the question is about chemical composition. Since the article doesn't say, maybe N/A.

5. Dr. Sutton's background in folk music influencing taxonomy. The article says he's into folk/country but named them after punk and emo. It doesn't say his musical taste influenced the classification system. So N/A.

6. Percentage of aculiferan species with spiky features. The article says these are unusual finds, but no percentage given. N/A.

7. Marine predator responsible for damage marks on Emo. The article doesn't mention any predators causing damage. N/A.

8. Temperature conditions enabling preservation. The article mentions the ancient seafloor but doesn't specify temperature. N/A.

9. Number of complete Punk ferox specimens recovered. The article mentions finding similar fossils but doesn't state the count. N/A.

10. Dating method confirming 430 million years. The article says the discovery is 430 million years old but doesn't mention the method. N/A.

11. How many millions before dinosaurs? The article says "nearly 200 million years before the first dinosaurs." So 200.

12. Feature compared to a rebellious hairstyle. The spikes on the body, specifically the upward spikes for Punk. The answer is spikes or spines.

13. Thickness of each layer during grinding. The article says 20-micron intervals. So 20 microns.

14. Subculture for the downward spines. The emo nickname is from "emo" bangs, so emotional/emo subculture.

15. Term for the nodule after slicing. The article says "sad-looking pile of dust."

16. Subgroup's diversity highlighted. The aculiferans, as they were thought less adventurous but these show diversity.

17. Scanning tech ineffective? CT scans were tried but ineffective because of density. So CT scans.

18. Fossil site location. England-Wales border.

19. Asteroid with organic molecules. Bennu.

20. Drug trials causing symptoms. The first extra headline mentions trials making people vomit, shiver, etc. So "drug trials that purposely make people vomit, shiver and ache" or more succinctly, the topic is "drug trials causing vomiting and shivering" but the exact phrase from the article is "drug trials that purposely make people vomit, shiver and ache" so the answer should be that exact phrase. Wait the question says "what research topic... noted as growing interest?" The article says "drug trials that purposely make people vomit, shiver and ache have become a research area of growing interest." So the answer is that topic's name, which is just the trials themselves, so the answer is "drug trials that purposely make people vomit, shiver and ache" but maybe they want a shorter term. The question says "what research topic" so perhaps the answer is the exact phrase given in the article.

Now let me go through each again carefully.

1. The article says "Punk and Emo, the forerunners of today's worm-mollusks" but doesn't name a specific modern species. So N/A.

2. The grinding process was done at 20-micron intervals. The question is how many microns needed to reveal the structure. Since each slice is 20 microns, the answer is 20.

3. No body length mentioned. N/A.

4. The problem was density similarity, not chemical composition. Since the question asks for chemical composition, and the article doesn't specify that, answer is N/A.

5. No influence mentioned. N/A.

6. No percentage given. N/A.

7. No predator mentioned. N/A.

8. No temperature stated. N/A.

9. Number of specimens not stated. N/A.

10. Dating method not mentioned. N/A.

11. 200 million years before dinosaurs. Correct.

12. The spikes inspired the punk hairstyle. The answer is "spikes" or "spiky spines".

13. 20-micron intervals. So 20.

14. The emo nickname comes from the emo subculture. So "emo".

15. "sad-looking pile of dust".

16. The subgroup is aculiferans.

17. The ineffective tech was CT scans (X-rays via CT).

18. England and Wales border.

19. Bennu.

20. The research topic is the drug trials mentioned. The exact answer from the text is "drug trials that purposely make people vomit, shiver and ache".

So I'll structure all these into the required format.
