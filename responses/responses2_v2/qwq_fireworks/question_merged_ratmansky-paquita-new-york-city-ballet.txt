Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the given article and follow the instructions strictly. Let's start with the first question.

1. The question asks how many ballets Ratmansky created for American Ballet Theater during his time as artist in residence before joining Alvin Ailey. The article mentions Ratmansky restaged many old ballets for ABT, including a lavish "Sleeping Beauty," but it doesn't specify the number. Since it's not given, the answer is N/A.

2. The second question is about Maria Tallchief struggling with an element in the Pas de Trois. The article says Maria Tallchief is being celebrated, but her struggles aren't mentioned. The question might confuse her with another dancer. The answer is N/A.

3. The third question asks the year Ratmansky first used Sergeyev's notations for "The Sleeping Beauty" at Paris Opera Ballet. The article states he restaged "Sleeping Beauty" for ABT, not Paris Opera Ballet. So N/A.

4. The fourth question is about Guillaume Diop's challenge with the corps de ballet. The article mentions Diop as a Paris Opera Ballet member but doesn't link him to "Paquita" rehearsals. So N/A.

5. The fifth question asks the title of Brown's ballet Ratmansky wanted to restage. The article mentions Ronald K. Brown's "Grace" but says Ratmansky did "Solitude" and "Paquita." No other title mentioned. N/A.

6. The sixth question connects a partnering moment to a viral West Coast Swing video. The article doesn't link any specific moment in rehearsals to viral videos. N/A.

7. The seventh question asks the original title Balanchine restaged in 1951. The article says Balanchine restaged the Pas de Trois from Petipa's "Paquita." So the original title is "Paquita."

8. The eighth question is about the music Ratmansky initially used. The article mentions mazurka-like music in rehearsal but doesn't say he switched due to Tallchief's centennial. The original music used was Petipa's, so initial music isn't specified. N/A.

9. The ninth question: Ratmansky suggested Phelan's passe low, mirroring Lindy Hop. The article says Ratmansky asked if she preferred high or low, and she chose high. Lindy Hop isn't mentioned here. N/A.

10. Tenth question: Ratmansky relies on Sergeyev's notations for Grand Pas. The article states Sergeyev's notations are the base. So answer is Sergeyev's.

11. Eleventh question: Balanchine's reimagined Pas de Trois paired with Ratmansky's. The question mentions combining a mid-century choreographer (Balanchine) with Ratmansky's final act. So the answer is Balanchine's version of the Pas de Trois.

12. Twelfth question: The central female role's agency is given by Petipa and successors. The article says Petipa gives the ballerina space to be an artist. The answer is the ballerina.

13. Thirteenth question: Balanchine's muse celebrated in her centennial. The article mentions Maria Tallchief as Balanchine's muse. So her name.

14. Fourteenth question: The Soviet émigré using fame for esoteric art is Baryshnikov. The article says Mikhail Baryshnikov does this.

15. Fifteenth question: Paris Opera Ballet dancer celebrated for fashion and diversity. The article mentions Guillaume Diop in that role.

16. Sixteenth question: Ratmansky's instruction to avoid stylization. The article quotes him saying "Don't be stylized or mannered... Find the you in it!" So the answer is "Don't be stylized or mannered; find the you in it."

17. Seventeenth question: Years Ratmansky restaged traditional ballets before NYC Ballet. The article says 10 years before 2023 (since he was there since 2023). 2023 minus 10 is 2013, so 10 years.

18. Eighteenth question: The formation's name is the diagonal stretching downstage to upstage. The article describes it as "a great diagonal stretching downstage to upstage." The name isn't given, so N/A.

19. Nineteenth question: Which Petipa ballet is indirectly honored via comparisons. The article mentions "Sleeping Beauty" and "Paquita." The comparison is to "Sleeping Beauty" but the question might refer to "Paquita." Wait, the article says Ratmansky's "Sleeping Beauty" was for ABT. The question says "indirectly honored through comparisons with both a sumptuous Sleeping Beauty and the innovatively transformed Grand Pas." The answer would be "The Sleeping Beauty."

Wait, let me check again. The article says Ratmansky's restaging of "Sleeping Beauty" was for ABT, so the comparison to that production might be the answer here. The question is which Petipa ballet is honored through comparisons with both the lavish "Sleeping Beauty" and the Grand Pas in this production. The Grand Pas is part of "Paquita," so maybe "Paquita" itself? But the question says "indirectly honored," so perhaps "Sleeping Beauty" is the answer here. But the question might be tricky. The article says "Paquita" is being done now, but the comparison includes "Sleeping Beauty" as part of his past work. So the answer would be "The Sleeping Beauty." Alternatively, maybe "Swan Lake" or "Raymonda" but those aren't mentioned. The question says "indirectly honored through comparisons with both a sumptuous Sleeping Beauty and the innovatively transformed Grand Pas featured in this production." Since "Paquita" is the current one, the other is "Sleeping Beauty." The answer is "The Sleeping Beauty."
