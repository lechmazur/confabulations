Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by going through each question and checking the article for the answers.

1. **Question 1:** How many years after Tahar Haddad's fictionalized death did Hind's husband express his disapproval? The article says Hind is in 2013, and Haddad died in 1935. Subtracting gives 2013 - 1935 = 78 years. Wait, the question is about the novel's portrayal. The text mentions "Years later, just before he dies" for the letter, but Hind's part is in 2013. So 2013 - 1935 is 78. But the question is about the time between his death and Hind's husband's disapproval. Since Hind is acting in 2013, that's 78 years. So answer is 78.

2. **Question 2:** Object leading to paralysis. The text says Zbaida falls or is pushed on the stairs. But the object that caused paralysis is the stairs? Wait, the question says "symbolic of Rassaa's progressive values". The Rassaa family allowed education. Maybe the letter? But the letter's mishandling caused the conflict. Wait, the question says "object... led to paralysis". The stairs? Or maybe the European-influenced education? Hmm. The article says "In a scuffle on the stairs, Zbaida falls... and is paralyzed". The stairs are the physical object. But the question says "symbolic of Rassaa's progressive values". The Rassaa family's progressive values allowed education, which led to her being targeted. Maybe the letter? The secret letter's interception caused the chaos leading to the scuffle. So the object might be the letter, but the question says "object... led to paralysis". The actual object is the stairs. But the answer might be the stairs. Alternatively, maybe the European education is the symbolic thing, but the question asks for an object. Hmm, maybe the answer is "the stairs" but I need to check the article again. The article says "In a scuffle on the stairs, Zbaida falls...". The object is the stairs. But the question says it mirrors Tunisia's struggles with modernization. Maybe the stairs symbolize progress? Not sure. Alternatively, the European education (a value) led to her being targeted, hence the scuffle. But the object causing paralysis is the stairs. I think the answer is "stairs".

Wait, the question says "object... led to Zbaida's paralysis, mirroring Tunisia's own struggles with modernization?" Maybe the European education (a value) is the symbolic object, but the actual object causing paralysis is the stairs. The question might be looking for the letter? Because the letter's mishandling caused the conflict. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the European-influenced education is the object? The article says "European-influenced patriarch is considered progressive for allowing his daughters to be educated". So the education (a value) led to her being targeted, leading to the scuffle on the stairs. But the question asks for an object. Maybe "the stairs" is the answer here. I'll go with stairs.

3. **Question 3:** European city where Ghenim studied linguistics. The article says she teaches at Tunis University, but where did she study? The article doesn't mention where she studied, only that she teaches in Tunisia. So the answer is N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Literary prize. The article says "Shortlisted for the International Prize for Arabic Fiction". So that's the answer.

5. **Question 5:** Household chore Hind excelled at. The article mentions Zbaida's mother lists chores like embroidery, sewing, cleaning offal for osban. But Hind is Zbaida's granddaughter. The question asks what Hind excelled at, demonstrating rejection of oppression. The article says Hind is seeking the truth, but doesn't mention chores. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Tahar's profession in Ennaifer household. Tahar was a tutor for the Rassaa family, not Ennaifer. The article says he was a tutor for the Rassaa family. The Ennaifer is the family Zbaida married into. So his role in Ennaifer's household isn't mentioned. Wait, the question says "within the Ennaifer household". Since he was a tutor for Rassaa, not Ennaifer. So N/A? Or maybe he didn't hold a profession there. So answer is N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Rusty Sabich's profession. The article says Rusty Sabich is a retired prosecutor. The question is about his ailment. The article doesn't mention his health issues. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Establishment promoting Ghenim's novel. The article mentions "A 'Renaissance' in African Publishing: A new ecosystem of publishers, bookstores, literary magazines and festivals..." So the answer is "publishers" or "bookstores"? But the question is about Tunisia specifically. The article says "published in Tunisia", but the promotion in the context of African Renaissance could include those entities. The question says "within Tunisia" but the article doesn't specify which. Since the article lists "publishers, bookstores, literary magazines and festivals", the answer could be any of those. But the question asks which "establishment" played a role. Since the article says "Europa" is the publisher, maybe "publishers"? But the question is about the "Renaissance in African publishing", so the answer is "publishers".

9. **Question 9:** Title of the secret document. The article says "secret letter to Zbaida". The title isn't given. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Color of the metal box. The article says "metal box hidden in the 'evil-smelling' basement" but doesn't mention color. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Object Hind seeks in the basement. The article says "determined to find a metal box hidden in the basement... promising to contain the truth". So the answer is "metal box".

12. **Question 12:** Male family member arranging Zbaida's marriage. The article says her father arranged her marriage to the Ennaifer son. So her father (Rassaa family patriarch). The question asks "which male family member", so Zbaida's father (from Rassaa family) arranged her marriage. The article says "her father arranges for her to marry the son of the prominent Ennaifer family instead". So the father is the Rassaa patriarch. The question says "within the Ennaifer household"? No, the father is Rassaa. The question says "male family member", so answer is "her father" or "Zbaida's father". The article refers to him as "her father", so the name isn't given. Wait, the question says "which male family member", so maybe the father's name? The article doesn't give his name. So answer is "her father" (since the question allows the role). But the options might require a name. Since the article doesn't specify his name, perhaps "N/A"? Wait, the question is "which male family member", so the Rassaa father arranged it. The article says "her father" so the answer is "Zbaida's father" but the question might need the name. Since the name isn't provided, answer is N/A? Wait, no, the question says "which male family member", so the role is "father". So answer is "her father".

13. **Question 13:** Character absent from recounting her own experience. The article says "the story is told and retold by 11 members... but never by Zbaida herself." So Zbaida is the one not telling her own story. The question asks about the accident on the stairs, so Zbaida is the answer.

14. **Question 14:** Document sent by Haddad that caused tragedy. The secret letter is mentioned. The answer is "secret letter".

15. **Question 15:** Historical figure's controversial stance. The article mentions Tahar Haddad's real-life stance on gender equality. So the figure is Tahar Haddad himself.

16. **Question 16:** Family member confessing abuse and hidden orientation. The article says "In his chapter Mhammed reveals his sexual abuse at 5, his shame over his closeted homosexuality..." So Mhammed.

17. **Question 17:** Character returning to reclaim mansion. Hind does this, as mentioned in the article.

18. **Question 18:** Metaphorically described as a supernatural being of truth. The article quotes Hind saying "a jinn of truth is emerging naked and barefoot" referring to Zbaida. So Zbaida is the one metaphorically described as a jinn.

19. **Question 19:** Underlying societal system uniting oppression. The article says "the oppressions of patriarchy are not confined..." so patriarchy.

20. **Question 20:** Number associated with timespan compared to Haddad's life. Haddad died at 36 in 1935. The narrative spans seven decades (from early 20th century to 2013). The timespan is 78 years (2013-1935). The question asks for the number, maybe 4 generations? The article says four generations. Or the 7 decades? The question says "timespan of the narrated accounts" which is seven decades (from early 20th century to 2013). The activist lived 36 years. So the number 7 (decades) vs 36? The answer is 7 decades, but the question is phrased as "which number... creates a chronological tension". The article mentions "four generations" but the timespan is seven decades. The question might be referring to the 7 decades vs his 36 years. So the answer is 7 (for decades) or 4 (generations)? The question says "number associated with the timespan" so 7 decades. The number is 7.
