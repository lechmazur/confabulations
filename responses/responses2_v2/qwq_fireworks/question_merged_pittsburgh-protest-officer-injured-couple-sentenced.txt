merged_pittsburgh-protest-officer-injured-couple-sentenced.txt
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict instructions.

1. **Total restitution by Brian alone for university property?** The article says the couple were ordered to pay $1,400 to the university and $47,284 to the officer. But the question asks for Brian alone. Since it's combined for both, maybe they split it, but the article doesn't specify individual amounts. So N/A.

2. **Libertarian journalist who organized the debate?** The article mentions Brad Polumbo as a libertarian journalist participating, but it says the protest was over a debate between Michael Knowles (from Daily Wire) and Brad Polumbo. It doesn’t say who organized it. So N/A.

3. **How many officers had back surgery?** The sergeant had back injuries requiring surgery. The article doesn’t mention others, so only one. Answer is 1.

4. **Building where Krystal placed smoke bombs?** The smoke bombs were near a building for an event at the O’Hara Student Center. The building itself is the O’Hara Student Center.

5. **Political motivations from DeRiso’s statement?** The lawyer said Brian made a poor decision but didn’t mention political motives. The article says the couple conspired against law enforcement, but DeRiso’s statement didn’t cite motivations. So N/A.

6. **Time the sergeant deflected the device?** No time mentioned. N/A.

7. **Number of protesters arrested with DiPippas?** The article says the couple pleaded guilty but doesn’t mention others arrested. N/A.

8. **Duration of psychological evaluation?** The sentence details don’t include this. N/A.

9. **University department that investigated?** The article mentions the University of Pittsburgh’s spokesperson but doesn’t say which department investigated. N/A.

10. **Decibel level of explosion?** Not mentioned. N/A.

11. **Type of explosive the university spokesperson condemned?** The spokesperson talked about not tolerating violence, but the specific explosive isn’t named. The article mentions a firework and smoke bombs. The question asks what type similar to Krystal’s concealment. The firework was used by Brian. The spokesperson’s statement was general, so N/A.

12. **Action Aimee Ortiz took after being impacted?** Aimee is the reporter; the article doesn’t say she was injured. She reported on the incident. N/A.

13. **Right-leaning publication Brad represented?** Brad was a libertarian journalist, and Michael Knowles is from The Daily Wire (right-leaning). The question asks which publication Brad represented. The article says Brad is a libertarian journalist but doesn’t mention his publication. So N/A.

14. **Years sentenced for attacking officers protecting Knowles and Polumbo?** Brian got 5 years. The question specifies the attacker, so 5.

15. **Total restitution in a similar UC case?** The article mentions UC in another context but doesn’t discuss a similar case there. N/A.

16. **Additional charge similar to Houston protesters?** Brian also pleaded guilty to conspiracy. The question mentions protesters in Houston's schools with similar charges. The other charge is conspiracy. So conspiracy.

17. **Injury type related to UC admissions?** The article links Aimee’s reporting to UC admissions policies, but injuries there aren’t mentioned. N/A.

18. **Krystal’s lawyer’s other client?** Her lawyer is Michael Ovens. The article mentions a superintendent in Houston’s schools as part of another story. But the lawyer for Krystal is Michael Ovens, and the superintendent’s lawyer isn’t mentioned. So N/A.

19. **City with similar incident prompting Trump’s order?** The article mentions Trump’s executive order on antisemitism but doesn’t link it to another city. The order was signed by Trump, but the example given is about universities in general. N/A.

20. **Primary topic of the event?** The event was a transgender rights debate between Knowles and Polumbo. The primary topic is transgender rights.
