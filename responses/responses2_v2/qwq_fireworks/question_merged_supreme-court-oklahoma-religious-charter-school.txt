Okay, let me go through each question one by one. 

1. The first question asks which Supreme Court justice authored the majority opinion in the Oklahoma Supreme Court's ruling that blocked St. Isidore. The article mentions that the Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked it, and in their majority opinion, they wrote about the slippery slope. But it doesn't name the justice who wrote it. So the answer should be N/A.

2. The second question is about how many students were enrolled during its brief operation. The article says the school was blocked after being approved, but there's no mention of actual enrollment numbers. So N/A again.

3. The third question asks for the percentage of the curriculum dedicated to religious vs secular. The article states that religious teachings are embedded throughout lessons, including math and reading, but doesn't give specific percentages. So N/A here too.

4. The fourth question is when Governor Stitt first announced support. The text says he backed it but doesn't mention when he first announced it. N/A.

5. The fifth question about taxpayer funding amount in the first year. The article mentions taxpayer dollars would pay for it but no specific figure. N/A.

6. Sixth question: which religious organizations filed amicus briefs supporting Oklahoma's position. The article mentions a coalition including Americans United for Separation of Church and State opposing, but not which groups supported Oklahoma. So N/A.

7. Seventh question: criteria for the state board's 3-2 vote. The article says the board approved it but doesn't list the criteria used. N/A.

8. Eighth question: number of other states with pending applications. The text doesn't mention other states' applications. N/A.

9. Ninth question: academic metrics St. Isidore had to meet. The article doesn't specify their performance requirements compared to traditional schools. N/A.

10. Tenth question: who was appointed as first principal. The article mentions the school would be managed by the Archdiocese and Diocese but doesn't name a principal. So N/A.

All answers are N/A except maybe checking again for question 6. Wait, the article says a coalition of religious leaders opposed, but the question is about those supporting Oklahoma's position (which was against the school). Wait, actually, the Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked it, and the state's attorney general was against the school. So the question is which religious groups filed briefs supporting Oklahoma's position (i.e., opposing the school). The article mentions "a coalition of religious leaders, advocates of public schools and some other state Republicans say the proposal is unconstitutional." So maybe those religious leaders are part of that coalition. But the question is about amicus briefs supporting Oklahoma's position. The article doesn't mention any specific religious organizations filing briefs, only that some leaders opposed. So still N/A.
