Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. I need to be careful to answer exactly based on the text and not use any outside knowledge. Let me go through each question and check the article for answers.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions Meta planning to create non-human "people" on their platforms. But the question asks which company developed an AI system for communicating with deceased historical figures via VR. The article doesn't mention any specific company other than Meta's general plans. So probably N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The documentary "Eternal You" discusses AI replicas but doesn't name a specific platform using blockchain. The article doesn't mention blockchain, so N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The article quotes Sherry Turkle, not another futurist besides Clarke. Arthur C. Clarke is mentioned, but the other person quoted is Sherry Turkle. So the answer here is Sherry Turkle.

4. **Question 4:** The article says Meta announced plans to create non-human people on their platforms. The question is about a social media platform that already implemented a feature for interacting with AI-generated influencers. The article mentions Meta's plans but not implementation yet, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The article states Sherry Turkle refers to AI as a "brilliant device that knows how to trick you into thinking there's a there there." No specific neurological condition is named, so N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The article doesn't mention any pharmaceutical companies partnering with AI startups for grief-targeted antidepressants. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The article doesn't specify a time in the documentary where a user breaks down. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** No government agency is cited investigating data privacy violations in the text. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The article doesn't mention a fictional novel inspiring the tech. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The text doesn't mention an Oscar-winning director falsely attributed as an executive producer. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The term "death capitalism" is used by one of the subjects. That's the answer.

12. **Question 12:** The reviewer notes changes over 12 months between the festival run and rewatch. The duration is a year, so 12 months.

13. **Question 13:** The article references Arthur C. Clarke's adage about advanced tech and magic. So Arthur C. Clarke.

14. **Question 14:** Meta is mentioned as planning to systematically generate non-human people. So Meta.

15. **Question 15:** The reviewer uses "illusion" to describe the interactions. The article says "an illusion of talking to their dead loved ones" and the film feels like a warning against the illusion.

16. **Question 16:** The article states AI is addressing longings that religion once solved. So religion.

17. **Question 17:** The documentary's title is "Eternal You."

18. **Question 18:** The article mentions earning affiliate commissions from ticket purchases, so the revenue arrangement is affiliate commissions.

19. **Question 19:** The eerie quality is described as "uncanny."

20. **Question 20:** The reviewer explicitly says it's "not magic," refuting that term.
