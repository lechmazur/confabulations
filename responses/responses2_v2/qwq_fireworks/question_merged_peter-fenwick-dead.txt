Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I'm only using the information from the provided article and nothing else. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks for the percentage of letter writers who reported both a tunnel and meeting deceased relatives. The article says 50% reported traveling through a tunnel, and nearly 40% met someone like deceased relatives. But there's no specific overlap percentage mentioned. So I can't infer that; it's N/A.

2. Dr. Fenwick started receiving letters after his 1988 BBC documentary. The question is about when he first began receiving them at Maudsley Hospital. Wait, the article mentions he worked at Maudsley Hospital, but when did he start getting the letters? The documentary was in early 1988, so the letters came after that. But the question asks the decade. Since 1988 is in the 1980s, the answer would be the 1980s. But the article says he began studying NDEs in the mid-1970s. Hmm, but the letters came after the documentary in 1988. Wait, the first letters were after the 1988 documentary. The question is about when he first began receiving letters at Maudsley. The article says he worked there but doesn't specify when the letters started there. The letters started after 1988, so the decade would be 1980s. But maybe the question is about when he first started getting letters in general, which was 1988, so the decade is 1980s. So answer is 1980s.

3. He worked with George Harrison of the Beatles on meditation research. The question is how many Beatles members he worked with. Since George is one, the answer is 1.

4. The patient who changed his mind had near-fatal complications during heart surgery. The condition mentioned is heart surgery complications. So the answer is heart surgery complications.

5. His father stopped his gunpowder trick during dinner. The article says his father disrupted the plot. So the answer is his father.

6. The primary reason pilots in training don't have NDEs is because they either go unconscious or become confused. The article states that Fenwick pointed out pilots in training with anoxia don't have NDEs but go unconscious or try to land on clouds. The reason given is the acute anoxia leads to unconsciousness or confusion, so the answer is acute anoxia.

7. The article says he wrote four books with his wife, including "The Truth in the Light." But the question is how many he wrote independently before collaborating. The text doesn't mention any books he wrote alone before. So N/A.

8. The garden vision had flowers like Madonna lilies, delphiniums, and roses. The majority? The article says "those that attracted me most were Madonna lilies, delphiniums and roses, but there were many more." It doesn't specify which was the majority. So N/A.

9. The article says he worked at Maudsley Hospital in London, but his initial training? He studied at Cambridge and then medical school there. The question is which medical institution in Kenya. His father was in Kenya, but the article says he was born there, but his medical training was in Cambridge and London. So no info on a Kenyan institution. N/A.

10. The question is percentage reporting both increased spirituality and elimination of fear. The article says 42% more spiritual and 82% less afraid. But no overlap data. So N/A.

11. The training regimen he cited was pilots in simulators undergoing acute anoxia. The answer is pilot training simulators.

12. The article states 72% saw a bright light. So 72%.

13. He was president of the Scientific and Medical Network. That's the organization.

14. He collaborated with his wife Elizabeth on books. So the answer is his wife Elizabeth Fenwick.

15. The fraction who became less afraid was 82% (the article says 82% were less afraid). So 82%.

16. The gates were golden. The woman described golden gates leading to the garden.

17. As a child, he laid gunpowder trails. So the answer is building small bombs or laying gunpowder trails.

18. The influential book was "Life After Life" by Moody, which he encountered and was skeptical of but then changed his mind after a patient's story.

19. The metaphor he used was looking down a "deep, dark hole into the brain" when being a neurosurgeon, which he found unattractive. So the metaphor is a deep, dark hole.

20. The most common impact was becoming less afraid of dying (82%) or convinced of survival. The question asks the most commonly reported. The article says 82% were less afraid, which is higher than 48% convinced. So the answer is less afraid of dying.
