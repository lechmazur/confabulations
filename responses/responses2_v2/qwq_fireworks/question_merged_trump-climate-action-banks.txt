Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict instructions. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks about the percentage of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero that the Citigroup CEO represented. The article mentions that the Glasgow alliance changed its rules so that firms could stay involved without being members of target-setting groups. Bank of America and Citigroup's CEOs are still part of the Glasgow alliance. However, the article doesn't state what percentage they represent. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The lawsuit by Texas and others was against asset managers, not Meta. The question mentions Meta, but the lawsuit was against BlackRock and others. Since the question incorrectly links the lawsuit to Meta, the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The Net Zero Banking Alliance still has over 130 members, mostly European. Climate Action 100+ lost prominent members but the exact number isn't given. Without knowing original members or Climate Action's current numbers, can't calculate difference. N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The U.K. Sustainable Investment and Finance Association expressed disappointment but no specific action on BlackRock's clients. The article says BlackRock's European clients have net zero targets. The question asks about an action taken by the association, which isn't mentioned. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The Federal Reserve withdrew due to political/legal pressure, but the primary reason for joining isn't stated. The article says they left the network, but why they joined initially isn't in the text. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The Glasgow alliance allowed staying involved without being in target-setting groups. This rule change affected JPMorgan's CEO's membership status. The answer is the rule change allowing non-membership in target groups while staying in the alliance.

7. **Question 7:** The article says Canada's banks quit the Net Zero Banking Alliance but doesn't mention a new alliance they created. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** BlackRock said leaving wouldn't affect their sustainable investment products. The question asks what they ceased offering, but the article states they continued. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** At COP26, the Glasgow Alliance had $130 trillion in assets. The disbanded insurers' alliance isn't tied to this number. The answer is $130 trillion.

10. **Question 10:** Rajgopal mentions Europe's stricter climate targets and disclosures. The regulatory change in Europe forcing disclosures is the answer.

11. **Question 11:** The Federal Reserve's withdrawal is linked to Trump's presidency. The political leader is Trump.

12. **Question 12:** BlackRock left due to causing confusion and legal inquiries, as stated in their letter.

13. **Question 13:** The insurers' alliance disbanded after losing half its members. The answer is the Net Zero Insurance Alliance (though the exact name in the text is "the net zero alliance for insurers").

14. **Question 14:** Canada's banks left "this month," but the article's timeframe is around Trump's inauguration. The exact day isn't given, so N/A. Wait, the article says "on Friday" the Fed withdrew, but Canada's exit is mentioned without a specific day. So N/A.

15. **Question 15:** The term used was "energy security" implying fossil fuels.

16. **Question 16:** COP26, the UN climate summit in 2021, launched the Glasgow Alliance.

17. **Question 17:** Trump's stance influenced regulatory exits and Meta's board changes. So Trump.

18. **Question 18:** James Alexander's group, the U.K. Sustainable Investment and Finance Association, expressed disappointment.

19. **Question 19:** Texas led the lawsuit against BlackRock and others.

20. **Question 20:** The Glasgow alliance allowed CEOs to stay in the umbrella group without being in target groups. So the Glasgow alliance.

Wait, let me verify each again:

1. N/A (No percentage given for Citigroup's representation)
2. N/A (Lawsuit was against asset managers, not Meta)
3. N/A (No original numbers for comparison)
4. N/A (No action mentioned by the association)
5. N/A (Reason for joining not stated)
6. The Glasgow rule change allowing non-target members
7. N/A (No new alliance mentioned)
8. N/A (They didn't cease products)
9. $130 trillion
10. Europe's increased climate regulations/disclosures
11. Trump
12. BlackRock
13. The insurers' alliance (Net Zero Insurance Alliance, but article says "Climate Action 100+ lost members" but the disbanded one is insurers. So "the Net Zero Alliance for Insurers")
14. N/A (No specific day for Canada's exit)
15. Energy security
16. COP26
17. Trump
18. U.K. Sustainable Investment and Finance Association
19. Texas
20. Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero
