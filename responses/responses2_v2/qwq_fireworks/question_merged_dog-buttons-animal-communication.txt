Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article provided. Let me start by skimming through each question and then looking back at the article for answers.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks about Federico Rossano's initial pilot study breed before expanding. I remember the article mentioned Rossano's study involved dogs and cats, but the pilot study's breed? Hmm. Wait, the article says Rossano's study was with 10,000 dogs and cats, but the pilot might be part of the 2020 study. Wait, the article says "the study that Rossano and his team began in 2020 is the largest... with 10,000 dogs and cats". There's no mention of a specific breed for the pilot. Maybe I missed it. The article does mention "dogs like Bunny and Parker" but not their breeds in the pilot context. Since it's not specified, maybe N/A?

Wait, no. Wait, in the section about Rossano, he mentions a study with Leo Trottier, but the article says "the study that Rossano and his team began in 2020... with 10,000 dogs and cats". The question says "initial pilot study before expanding". The article might not mention the pilot's breed. Since it's not stated, the answer is N/A. But wait, maybe the pilot used his own dogs? No, the article doesn't say that. So answer N/A?

Wait, no, the article says "the study that Rossano and his team began in 2020... 10,000 dogs and cats". The question asks for the breed used in the initial pilot before expanding. Since the article doesn't mention a pilot using a specific breed, answer is N/A. But maybe I missed a part. Let me check again. The article mentions Rossano's study was the largest ever, but no specific breed for pilot. So N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Alexis Devine's shift in career after pandemic disrupted her wearable-art. The article says she moved into selling buttons and moved to a cabin. But the question is about the jewelry she transitioned to. Wait, the article says "Earlier this year, she moved into a stylish two-story cabin... Devine got Bunny as an 8-week-old puppy... She had a successful career as a wearable-art designer. When the pandemic began, her fashion shows were canceled. More time for Bunny. 'She was my next big project,' Devine said." So after her wearable-art career was disrupted by the pandemic, she transitioned to buttons. The question asks what jewelry she transitioned to. Wait, the article says she moved into selling buttons through her online store with Alexis Devine and Leo Trottier. But "jewelry" here? The question says "specific type of jewelry did she transition to creating after her wearable-art career was disrupted by the pandemic?" But the article says she moved to buttons, not jewelry. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, no. Wait, the article says "Alexis Devine and Leo Trottier have sold more than two million buttons." So she transitioned to selling buttons, but buttons aren't jewelry. The question mentions jewelry, so perhaps the answer is N/A. But the question might be a trick. Wait, the original career was wearable-art designer. After pandemic, she started the buttons business. So she didn't create jewelry, but buttons. The question says "jewelry" but the answer is buttons? But the question says "specific type of jewelry", so N/A.

Wait, the question might be a trick. The article says "Devine got Bunny as an 8-week-old puppy. 'I wanted a different complexity of relationship you can only get with a dog,' she said. She chose a sheepadoodle because she wanted a smart and active dog, one that could offer 'a real connection.' At the time, she had a successful career as a wearable-art designer. When the pandemic began, her fashion shows were canceled. More time for Bunny. 'She was my next big project,' Devine said. 'I knew before I brought her home that I wanted to teach her to talk.' Devine spent those months making jewelry at the coffee table in her living room, in front of her...". Wait, making jewelry? The article says "Devine spent those months making jewelry at the coffee table...". Wait, is that correct?

Wait, let me check again. The exact text is: "Devine spent those months making jewelry at the coffee table in her living room, Bunny and the buttons spread out right in front of her." Wait, so she was making jewelry while teaching Bunny buttons? Or was she making buttons as part of her project? Wait, the article says "making jewelry at the coffee table... Bunny and the buttons spread out right in front of her." So she continued her jewelry making? But the pandemic caused her fashion shows to be canceled. So her wearable-art career was disrupted, so she started making jewelry? Or perhaps the answer is that she transitioned to buttons, but the question is about jewelry. Since the article says she was making jewelry during that time, maybe the answer is jewelry? Wait, no. The question is about what she transitioned to after her wearable-art career was disrupted. The article says her fashion shows were canceled (wearable-art), so she had more time for Bunny. She then started the buttons business, but the article says she was making jewelry at the same time. The question is about her shift in career. The article says "she moved into a stylish two-story cabin... Alexis Devine and Leo Trottier have sold more than two million buttons." So her new career is buttons. The jewelry part might be part of her old career. So the answer would be N/A, as the question asks for jewelry she transitioned to, but she transitioned to buttons. So answer N/A.

Wait, but the question says "specific type of jewelry did she transition to creating after her wearable-art career was disrupted..." The article says she was making jewelry while working with Bunny. Maybe she continued jewelry but that's unclear. The article says her fashion shows were canceled, so she had more time for Bunny. The article doesn't mention her shifting to another jewelry type. So answer N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Stella's emotion after delayed mealtime. The article says "Stella was narrating what she saw... After a year, Stella was saying BED LATER and WANT OUTSIDE NOW. One day, the end of daylight saving time delayed Stella's mealtime. She asked for food, and Hunger told her to wait. In protest, she stomped over to her buttons and pressed LOVE YOU NO." So the emotion expressed was LOVE YOU NO. The specific emotion is "love you no" which is a phrase, but the emotion is anger or protest. The question asks for the specific emotion, so the answer is "LOVE YOU NO".

4. **Question 4:** John Lubbock's terrier Van associated which object with "tea". The article says "John Lubbock was among the first Victorian naturalists to perform language experiments on an animal. He taught a terrier puppy named Van how to associate cards imprinted with words like 'bone' or 'tea' with the objects they named." So the object is "tea" which is associated with the word "tea". Wait, the question is asking for the object. The word on the card was "tea", so the object would be "tea". Wait, the cards had words, so the object is the actual tea. The question says "what specific object did John Lubbock's terrier, Van, learn to associate with the word 'tea'". The object is tea. So the answer is "tea".

5. **Question 5:** Herbert Terrace's critique of Nim's longest sequence. The article says "The longest sequence Nim ever signed, after years of confinement and training, was 'Give orange me give eat orange me eat orange give me eat orange give me you.'" So the answer is the exact phrase given.

6. **Question 6:** Juliane Kaminski's research on hormone. The article says "when humans and dogs look each other in the eye, each species produces oxytocin, the same hormone that bonds mothers to their children." So the answer is "oxytocin".

7. **Question 7:** Clive Wynne's button phrase for his dog Xephos. The article states: "Wynne recorded 'My name is Xephos' into the button, and he taught Xephos to press it." So the answer is "MY NAME IS XEPHOS".

8. **Question 8:** Cache pressed what phrase leading to discussion with Horowitz. The article says "a golden retriever named Cache pressed WORRIED when his owner turned on the stove to cook dinner, because he wasn't a fan of all the sizzling and popping." Wait, but the question is about Cache repeatedly pressing a phrase leading his owner to think he wanted a specific location. Wait, the article mentions Cache pressing "BACKYARD WATER" until the owner thought he wanted to swim in the river. The question says "repeatedly pressed, leading his owner to believe he wanted to access a specific location, prompting a discussion with Alexandra Horowitz". So the answer is "BACKYARD WATER".

9. **Question 9:** Stella's first word. The article says "Ellie's first word... would be OUTSIDE. 'Outside' was one of the recommended first words... Hunger taught Stella to use buttons. Stella caught on, pressing OUTSIDE to use the bathroom." So Stella's first word was "OUTSIDE".

10. **Question 10:** 1980 event discrediting animal language studies. The article mentions "In 1980, a New York Academy of Science conference was held with the mocking purpose of declaring animal-language endeavors a failure and the scientists frauds." So the answer is "New York Academy of Science conference".

11. **Question 11:** Researcher influencing 2020 study's methodology. The article says Rossano's study was influenced by Christina Hunger's work, but the question is about which researcher's work on primate communication influenced the methodology. The article mentions "the methodology used in the 2020 citizen-science study involving dogs and talking buttons" was influenced by previous studies. Wait, the article says "Rossano's study... circumvent Covid restrictions... less likely to suffer from the problems and ethical lapses that afflicted past animal-language studies." But the methodology might be from Hunger's approach. Alternatively, the article mentions "Christina Hunger's blog of Stella's progress went viral, and other dog owners started experimenting with the buttons. Those accounts themselves went viral. A movement grew." So the methodology was based on Hunger's approach. But the question asks which researcher's work on primate communication influenced it. Wait, maybe the primate studies like Nim Chimpsky? The article says "Rossano saw an opportunity to learn what else they could do. But he was cautious... the study would not rely on a single animal... unlike past studies like Project Nim." The methodology was different from Project Nim, so maybe not influenced by primate studies. Alternatively, the article mentions "Christina Hunger... created by a speech-language pathologist... inspired by her work with Stella." So the answer might be Christina Hunger, but the question specifies primate communication. Wait, the article says "Christina Hunger... thought that dogs are about as smart as a 2 ½-year-old human, and Hunger knew that toddlers of that age typically compose sentences of two or three words." So she used methods from child language teaching. The question is about a researcher's work on primate communication. Maybe Herbert Terrace? No. Alternatively, the article mentions "the methodology of the 2020 study was influenced by the work of..." but I can't recall. Wait, the article says "Rossano's study... decentralized data collection... unlike Project Nim which had rotating volunteers and ethical issues." So maybe the methodology was influenced by previous primate studies but in a different way. Wait, the question says "researcher's work on primate communication directly influenced the methodology used in the 2020 citizen-science study". Hmm, perhaps the answer is not present. Alternatively, the article mentions "Christina Hunger's informal pedagogy". Since the question is about a primate researcher, maybe no. Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "Rossano's study... less likely to suffer from the problems and ethical lapses that afflicted past animal-language studies." The methodology was different, so perhaps not influenced by primate studies but by Hunger's approach. Since the question specifies primate communication, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, perhaps the answer is Christina Hunger's work, but she's not a primate researcher. Alternatively, the article mentions "the methodology of dog-button learning created by Christina Hunger". So no, the question wants a primate researcher. Since the article doesn't mention any primate researcher's work influencing the 2020 study's methodology, answer N/A.

Wait, the article says "Rossano's study... circumvent... by conducting a citizen-science study from the participants' homes. Because the study would not rely on a single animal... unlike past studies like Project Nim." So the methodology was different from Project Nim, which was a primate study. So perhaps the methodology was influenced by avoiding the flaws of Project Nim, but the question asks for a researcher's work that directly influenced it. Since Project Nim's lead was Herbert Terrace, but he's a critic, maybe not. The article says "Rossano saw in the buttons an opportunity to learn... but was cautious." Maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the article says "the methodology used in the 2020 study... was inspired by the work of..." but I can't find that. So answer N/A.

Wait, the article says "the methodology of the button-based communication was created by Christina Hunger, a speech-language pathologist". So the 2020 study's methodology is based on her work, not a primate researcher. So the answer is N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Anatomical feature unique to dogs discovered by Kaminski. The article states "Dogs have a muscle around their eyes for the sole purpose of making big, sad puppy-dog faces. Wolves do not have this muscle." So the answer is "muscle around their eyes".

13. **Question 13:** 20th-century animal referenced as cautionary example. The article mentions Clever Hans the horse: "The more scientifically minded skeptics bring up Clever Hans, the horse whose owner toured Germany at the turn of the 20th century to prove he could do mathematical calculations and ended up showing that animals can be very good at picking up on unconscious cues." So the answer is "Clever Hans".

14. **Question 14:** Hormone released during eye contact. The article says "when humans and dogs look each other in the eye, each species produces oxytocin, the same hormone that bonds mothers to their children." So the answer is "oxytocin".

15. **Question 15:** Victorian scientist's terrier in phonetic card experiments. The article mentions John Lubbock's terrier Van: "John Lubbock was among the first Victorian naturalists to perform language experiments on an animal. He taught a terrier puppy named Van how to associate cards imprinted with words like 'bone' or 'tea' with the objects they named." So the scientist is John Lubbock, and his terrier's name is Van. The question asks for the scientist's name. So the answer is "John Lubbock".

16. **Question 16:** Lead investigator of Project Nim who is a critic. The article says "Herbert Terrace, who led the Nim study, is now a critic of such anecdotes...". So the answer is "Herbert Terrace".

17. **Question 17:** Dog that lost six pounds. The article mentions Ellie the German shepherd: "She went through a period of insisting on more FOOD after dinner; I assumed she was being greedy until I finally weighed her and found she'd lost six pounds." So the answer is "Ellie".

18. **Question 18:** Linguistics term for Parker's "SQUEAKER CAR". The article says "multiword phrases like Parker's are creative, spontaneous and flexible expressions of language, a quality that the linguist Charles Hockett called productivity." So the term is "productivity".

19. **Question 19:** Dog that pressed "FIRE" without "CONCERNED". The article says "Bunny pressed FIRE but not CONCERNED." So the answer is "Bunny".

20. **Question 20:** Methodological flaw in Project Nim rectified by Rossano's study. The article mentions "Project Nim... a rotating cast of student volunteers... Nim was disruptively shuttled among homes and caregivers." So the flaw was "rotating caregivers" or "lack of stable environment". The article says Rossano's study avoided this by using decentralized data from many pets' normal lives. The answer is "rotating caregivers" or "unstable environment". The article says "the study would not rely on a single animal trained by researchers in a lab but rather on thousands of animals living their normal lives, it was less likely to suffer from the problems and ethical lapses that afflicted past animal-language studies." The main issue with Project Nim was the lack of consistency in training and environment. The answer is "rotating cast of student volunteers" or "shuttling among homes and caregivers". The exact wording from the article: "Project Nim, the flagship study of this era, enlisted a rotating cast of student volunteers to train Nim in American Sign Language, all while young Nim was disruptively shuttled among homes and caregivers." So the flaw is "rotating cast of student volunteers" and "shuttling among homes". The answer is "rotating caregivers" or "rotating cast of student volunteers". The article says "the study would not rely on a single animal... unlike past studies like Project Nim which had rotating volunteers and ethical issues." So the answer is "rotating cast of student volunteers" or "shuttling among caregivers". The question asks for the primary methodological flaw. The answer is "rotating cast of student volunteers" or "shuttling among homes and caregivers". The article's exact phrase for the flaw: "Project Nim... rotating cast of student volunteers... Nim was disruptively shuttled among homes and caregivers." So the main flaw was "rotating cast of student volunteers and unstable environment". The article says Rossano's study avoided this by using decentralized data. The answer is "rotating cast of student volunteers".
