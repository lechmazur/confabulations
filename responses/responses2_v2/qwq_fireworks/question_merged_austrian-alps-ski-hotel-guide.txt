Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not infer anything beyond that. Let me go through each question step by step.

1. **Question 1:** The user is asking for the traditional Austrian dish that an Italian-born design curator (Alice Liechtenstein) found strange at first but later embraced. The article mentions she talks about kaiserschmarrn, which is a pancake dish served with raisins and rum. The text says she found it odd that people danced in ski boots but now gets it. So the answer should be kaiserschmarrn.

2. **Question 2:** The question is about the duration of the sunrise hike to Serles from Innsbruck. The article says Aldo Sohm mentions leaving at 3 a.m. to catch sunrise and that it's steep but doesn't mention the time taken. Since there's no specific time given, the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The question asks about a rare vintage of Rochelt's apricot eau de vie at the Bond museum. The article only mentions Rochelt is known for apricot but Aldo Sohm prefers their quince. The museum's collection isn't detailed, so N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The Riedel CEO Max Riedel developed the O series stemless glasses. The article says he's in his 40s and the company was founded in the 18th century. The decade isn't specified, but the question might be looking for when he did it. Since the article doesn't state the decade, but mentions he's current, maybe it's recent? However, the exact decade isn't given, so N/A.

Wait, the article says "Max Riedel, is in his 40s and is the one who came up with the famous O series of stemless wineglasses." Since he's the current CEO, maybe the O series was developed in the current decade. But the text doesn't specify when, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The minimum altitude for a Skihaus. The article describes Der Wolf as a Skihutte at the top of the mountain, but no specific altitude is given. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The architect of Bad Aussee's thermal baths. The article mentions Bad Aussee as a spa town but doesn't name the architect. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Meters of fabric for a dirndl. The article says stores sell fabric by the meter but doesn't specify quantity. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Winning time of last year's Hahnenkamm race. The article mentions the race happens every year but no specific time. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Woodworking technique for breadboards. Werkraum Bregenzerwald uses local maple and slotted breadboards without metal. The technique isn't named. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Max occupancy of geodesic domes in Bad Gastein. The article mentions the Congress Center has domes but no occupancy info. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Cuisine at Hallerwirt. The text says Hallerwirt serves traditional food with a twist like special sausages or sauces. So the answer is traditional Austrian with a modern twist.

Wait, the question is asking specifically what cuisine Robert Rabensteiner suggests. He mentions Hallerwirt serves traditional food with a twist. So the answer is traditional Austrian food with a twist.

12. **Question 12:** Other material besides floral cotton at Ausseer Handdrucke. Alice mentions silks and floral cotton. So the answer is silks.

13. **Question 13:** Hotel in Saalbach with tasting menu and local sourcing. Alice mentions Dahoam in Saalbach has a tasting menu tracing to local producers. So the answer is Dahoam.

14. **Question 14:** Architectural style of Hotel Alpenstern and Congress Center. The Congress Center is Brutalist with domes. Hotel Alpenstern is designed with local ash, so maybe Brutalist? The article says the Congress Center is an example of 1970s Brutalism. The question asks if Hotel Alpenstern shares the same style. The article says Hotel Alpenstern is designed by a local architect using local ash but doesn't mention Brutalism. So N/A unless it's implied. Since the question says "according to the local tourism guidelines mentioned," but no info, so N/A.

Wait, the question says "which architectural style... is also reflected in the design of Hotel Alpenstern." The Congress Center is Brutalism. The article doesn't say Hotel Alpenstern is Brutalism. It just says built from local ash. So N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Museum at 10,000ft in Solden connected to a film. The Ice Q at 007 Elements (Bond museum) is mentioned as being at 10,000ft. So the answer is Ice Q.

16. **Question 16:** Family-run hotel in Saalbach with tasting menu and local producers like Biohotel Schwanen. Alice's recommendation in Saalbach is Wiesergut, which has breakfast trolley. But the tasting menu is Dahoam. Wait, the question says "family-run" and mentions Biohotel Schwanen (which has organic focus). The Wiesergut is family-run with breakfast, but the tasting menu is Dahoam. The question might be Dahoam, but the article says Dahoam is in Saalbach and has tasting menu. So answer is Wiesergut? Wait the question says "praised for its connection to local producers, much like the organic focus of Biohotel Schwanen". The Wiesergut's description mentions "almost everything is grown locally, some on their own farm". So that's the one. The question is asking for the name, which is Wiesergut.

17. **Question 17:** Rochelt's brandy type. Aldo says they're famous for apricot but he likes quince. The question asks the specific type that's typically Tyrolean. Since quince is mentioned as more Tyrolean, the answer is quince.

18. **Question 18:** Oldest building in Lech with Wiener schnitzel. The answer is Hus Nr. 8, as mentioned by RR: "Hus Nr. 8 [occupies one of] the oldest buildings in Lech. It's simple and traditional and it serves the best Wiener schnitzel."

19. **Question 19:** Oberlech hotel with award-winning wine list. Aldo Sohm mentions Burg Vital in Oberlech with an incredible restaurant and award-winning wine list. So the answer is Burg Vital.

20. **Question 20:** Art center in Vorarlberg by Bettina Steindl with a Skihutte like Der Wolf. The article says Bettina runs CampusVare. The question asks for a center with a Skihutte similar to Der Wolf (which is a Skihutte). The answer might be CampusVare, but the article doesn't mention a Skihutte there. The question might be a trick. Since the user says "similar to Der Wolf, known for its light-filled interiors," but the text doesn't link CampusVare to a Skihutte, so N/A.
