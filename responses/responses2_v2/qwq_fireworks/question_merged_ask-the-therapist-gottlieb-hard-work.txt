Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. 

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions that Lori Gottlieb answers readers' questions in her column. However, the text doesn't state how many questions she typically answers. The example given is just one query, but no number is provided. So, answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The boyfriend's napping is seen as a character flaw (like laziness) but the therapist suggests his work-life balance is healthy. The article also mentions the personals in Vermont thriving. The aspect here is his taking a nap as a sign of mental health. So the answer is napping.

3. **Question 3:** The therapist's perspective values work-life balance, but the article doesnâ€™t mention specific business card designs for "pitch me." So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The TikTok series #WomenInMaleFields involves negative experiences. The writer's issue is her partner's napping. The therapist says she might envy him. The negative experience would be judgment of his napping. So the answer is judgment of napping habits.

5. **Question 5:** The memoir is mentioned as her work, but the title isn't given in the text. The article only refers to it as "a memoir about her work as a therapist." So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The article states the boyfriend works less than 40 hours but doesn't give a percentage. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The article mentions "dating app fatigue" but doesn't name any specific app. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The therapist advises conversation but doesn't mention location sharing. The article's location sharing part is a separate paragraph. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Parents want over 40 hours, but the exact max isn't stated. The boyfriend works under 40. So the parents' ideal is over 40, but the question asks for the max the boyfriend should do per parents. Since they want him to work as much as possible, but the question's phrasing is tricky. The answer might be "40-plus" but the question says "ideally dedicate to maximizing earnings" so "40-plus hours".

10. **Question 10:** The therapist doesn't mention PowerPoint presentations in financial planning. The article only says some use them in "pitch me." So N/A.

12. **Question 12:** The hashtag is #WomenInMaleFields.

13. **Question 13:** The strategy is completing work efficiently to have free time, which the writer sees as laziness. So "completes work efficiently" or "completes his work in less than 40 hours".

14. **Question 14:** The therapist challenges the idea of maximizing earnings, questioning what defines a successful life. The metric is "maximizing earnings".

15. **Question 15:** The article says "less than 40 hours", but exact number isn't given. So N/A.

16. **Question 16:** The hypothetical scenario is losing a job, illness, or retirement. The answer is "losing a job, becoming too ill to work, or retiring".

17. **Question 17:** The therapist suggests possible envy of his ability to rest.

18. **Question 18:** The therapist says their approaches could complement each other, creating a "powerful partnership" with balance. The dynamic is complementary partnership.
