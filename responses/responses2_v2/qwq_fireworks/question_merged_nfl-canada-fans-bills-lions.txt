Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each question exactly as asked. Let me go through each question and check the article for the answer.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions the Detroit Lions held a watch party in London with over 3,000 fans. The exact number is stated as "more than 3,000", so the answer is 3000.

2. **Question 2**: The Buffalo Bills and Lions played preseason games historically. The article says the Bills and Lions played preseason games, so the answer is Detroit Lions.

3. **Question 3**: The NFL has over two dozen corporate sponsors in Canada. "Two dozen" is 24, so the answer is 24 or more. But the exact number isn't given, so maybe "N/A"? Wait, the question says "how many Canadian corporate sponsors"—the article states "the N.F.L. has more than two dozen corporate sponsors in Canada." Since it's "more than two dozen," but we can't know the exact number, so "N/A".

4. **Question 4**: The Bills moved a home game to Detroit because of snowstorms in Buffalo. The question asks beyond weather-related causes? Wait, the article says "because of snowstorms in Buffalo." So the reason is snowstorms, so answer is snowstorms.

5. **Question 5**: London, Ontario fans originally watched Cleveland Browns games via TV signals. The article says "fans in London received television signals that let them watch Browns and Lions games." So the answer is Cleveland Browns.

6. **Question 6**: The Lions-Vikings game's final score isn't mentioned. The article says the Lions "ran away with the game" but no score. So "N/A".

7. **Question 7**: Bill Haddow is 95 now. He attended the 1957 game. Current year is 2023? The article doesn't say when it was written, but Super Bowl LIX is 2025? Wait, the article mentions "last Sunday" and "this weekend" so likely current year is 2023 or 2024. If 2023, then 2023-1957 = 66 years old. But the article doesn't specify the current year. Hmm, maybe the article is from 2023? The Super Bowl LIX is 2025, so maybe the article is written in 2024 or 2023. Wait, the Bills played their second-stringers to end the regular season last Sunday, which would be December 2023 (since Super Bowl is typically in February). So if he's 95 now, subtract 1957: 2023-1957=66. But the article doesn't state the current year. Since the question asks his age when he attended in 1957, given his current age is 95. Assuming the article is current, but without the exact year, can't calculate. So "N/A"?

Wait, the article says "Bill Haddow, Charlie Smith's 95-year-old grandfather, who attended the Lions' title game in 1957". So he was at the 1957 game when he was, say, current age minus (year now - 1957). But since the current age is 95, and the event was in 1957, if the article is written in 2023, then 2023-1957=66 years since the game. So his age then would be 95 - (2023-1957) = 95 - 66 = 29. But without knowing the current year from the article, we can't. The article mentions Super Bowl LIX, which is 2025. So if the article is written in 2024 or 2025, then the current year is 2025. 2025-1957=68, so 95-68=27? But the article doesn't specify the exact current year, so this is an inference. The question might require exact, so maybe N/A?

Hmm, tricky. The article states his current age as 95 and that he attended the 1957 game. The difference between 1957 and the current year (when the article was written) is needed. Since the article is about Super Bowl LIX, which is 2025, so current year is 2025. 2025-1957=68 years. So his age in 1957 was 95-68=27. But the article doesn't state the current year, so maybe it's better to say N/A?

Wait, the article says "Ken Belson is a Times reporter covering sports..." and the Super Bowl LIX is the current event. The Super Bowl LIX is the 59th, so since Super Bowl I was in 1967, LIX is 59, so 2025 (since 1967+58=2025). So the article is written in 2025. So 2025-1957=68. 95-68=27. But since the question asks for his age when he attended, which would be 27. But the article doesn't explicitly state the current year, so is this an allowed inference? The instructions say to infer logically. Since the Super Bowl LIX is 2025, the article's current year is 2025. So answer is 27 or 28? Wait, 2025 minus 1957 is 68 years. So if he is 95 now, he was 95-68=27 in 1957. So the answer is 27? But the article doesn't state the current year, but the Super Bowl LIX is 2025, so that's a logical inference. So maybe answer is 27.

8. **Question 8**: The Buffalo Bills' executive named is Pete Guelli, as stated in the article.

9. **Question 9**: The team with only one playoff win in 65 years and no championship is the Lions. The article says "their last NFL title was in 1957... they had won just one playoff game in 65 years".

10. **Question 10**: The Bills moved a game to Detroit because of snowstorms. The article says "the Bills played a home game in Detroit because of snowstorms in Buffalo in 2022".

11. **Question 11**: The team working to dissolve the border is the Bills, as per Pete Guelli's quote about making Canadians feel part of the team.

12. **Question 12**: The bar is Joe Kool's in London, Ontario.

13. **Question 13**: The teams London fans could watch originally were Browns and Lions. The Bills became accessible via streaming. So the missing team initially was the Bills.

14. **Question 14**: The team with a drought since the 1960s and 8 straight playoffs is the Toronto Maple Leafs (Stanley Cup since 1967, but in the NFL context, maybe the Bills? Wait, the question mentions "despite consistent playoff appearances over eight seasons"—the article says Maple Leafs have 8 straight playoffs but lost in first round. The question is about an NFL team, so maybe the Lions or Bills? Wait the Lions had a 65-year playoff drought. Wait, the question says "endured a drought dating back to the 1960s despite consistent playoff appearances over eight seasons"—the Maple Leafs are NHL, so the NFL team would be the Bills? The article says "Buffalo Bills... lost each time in the 1990s, but after long fallow periods, now..." but the eight seasons are Maple Leafs. Since the question specifies NFL, perhaps the answer is the Lions? Wait, the article says the Lions had a 65-year playoff win drought until last season (before last season they had one playoff win in 65 years). Wait the question says "endured a drought dating back to the 1960s"—the Maple Leafs' drought is from 1967, but they are NHL. The NFL teams mentioned with long droughts: Lions (last title 1957, playoff win until recent), Bills (last title in A.F.L. 1960s, Super Bowl losses in 90s). The "consistent playoff appearances over eight seasons" would be the Maple Leafs, but they're not NFL. The question must refer to an NFL team. The article says "the Maple Leafs haven't won a Stanley Cup since 1967, but have made the playoffs for eight straight seasons". Since the question is about an NFL team, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "interweaving various sporting narratives" but the team in question must be an NFL team. Alternatively, maybe the answer refers to the Lions? The article says "the Lions had won just one playoff game in 65 years" but their drought is from 1957. The eight seasons part is Maple Leafs. So perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait the question says "despite consistent playoff appearances over eight seasons"—maybe the answer is the Lions, but they didn't have 8 straight playoff appearances. The Bills had five straight division titles. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait the article mentions the Maple Leafs' 8 straight playoffs but that's NHL. The question specifies "team that has endured a drought dating back to the 1960s despite consistent playoff appearances over eight seasons"—so the only possible NFL team here might be the Bills, but they had playoff appearances in the 90s, but the drought is since their Super Bowl losses. Wait the article says "the Bills won two A.F.L. titles in the 1960s and played in four consecutive Super Bowls in the 1990s, but lost each time. After long fallow periods, both teams now..." So their drought since 1990s. Not 1960s. The Maple Leafs are the only ones with a 1967 drought, but they're not NFL. So maybe the question is a trick and the answer is N/A? Or perhaps the article's "Toronto Maple Leafs" are mentioned as the team with the drought since 1967, but the question specifies an NFL team. Therefore, the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "which team is alluded to here?" Maybe the answer is the Maple Leafs but since the question specifies NFL, then N/A. Hmm. This is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the answer refers to the Lions? Their last title was 1957, so drought since before the 60s. The 8 seasons part doesn't fit. Maybe the answer is N/A here.

15. **Question 15**: The watch party with 3000 fans and a mascot is the Lions' event in London. The article mentions the Lions held a watch party in London with over 3000 fans and Roary.

16. **Question 16**: The young fan and father's story: Reid Collins and his father John support the Bills. The article says Reid wears a Josh Allen jersey, and his father got rekindled by the Bills in the 90s.

17. **Question 17**: The team building a new stadium in Orchard Park is the Bills. The article says "The Bills are building a new stadium in Orchard Park, N.Y., ensuring they will stay put."

18. **Question 18**: The "rust bucket teams never sleep" comment was by Ross Cockburn, and it refers to Bills and Lions. The remark is made in the context of both teams being contenders, so the subtle promotion is for both, but the question asks which team it promotes. Since the speaker is a Bills fan (as he mentions O.J. Simpson era Bills), maybe the answer is Buffalo Bills. But the quote is about mutual respect between both. The question says "which team does this remark subtly promote?" Since it mentions both, but the quote is made in Joe Kool's, which is in London equidistant between both, maybe it's neutral. The question might expect Buffalo Bills as the team the speaker supports. Alternatively, the answer is both, but the options likely expect one. The article says "Rust Belt cities don't get a break, which is why I'm happy for both teams." The comment about rust bucket teams never sleeping is from the bartender who rooted for Bills when O.J. was there. So the remark promotes both, but the question wants the team central to the remark. Since the quote is about both, but the answer should be the Bills? Or the question might have a specific answer. Let me check the article again: "Rust Belt cities don't get a break, which is why I'm happy for both teams." The "rust bucket teams" refers to both Bills and Lions. The question asks which team does the remark promote? Since it's a general comment about both, maybe the answer is N/A? Or maybe the team the speaker supports (Bills) is the promoted one. But the question might expect "Buffalo Bills" as the answer since the quote is from a Bills fan. Alternatively, the answer is both teams, but the format requires one. Since the question says "which team is central to this narrative?" Maybe the answer is N/A, but perhaps the article implies both, but the question might have the answer as Bills or Lions. Alternatively, since the quote is from a Bills fan, the remark subtly promotes both, but the answer is "Buffalo Bills" because the speaker is a Bills fan. Hmm. The exact quote is "If the Bills and Lions are in the Super Bowl, it'll end in a tie." The comment is about both teams, but the remark's origin is from a Bills fan. The question asks "which team does this remark subtly promote?" Since the speaker is a Bills fan, maybe it's promoting the Bills, but the remark is about both. Alternatively, since the quote is about both, maybe the answer is "Buffalo Bills and Detroit Lions", but the question might want one. The question might have the answer as "Buffalo Bills" because the speaker roots for them. Alternatively, since the quote mentions both, but the question requires a single team, perhaps N/A. Wait the question says "which team does this remark subtly promote?" It might be that the remark is neutral, promoting both, but the answer expects one. The article says "Rust Belt cities don't get a break, which is why I'm happy for both teams." So the remark is promoting both, but the question might accept "Buffalo Bills" or "Detroit Lions" or both? Since the format requires a single answer, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, the answer is Buffalo Bills because the speaker is a Bills fan. I'm a bit stuck here. The article's quote is from Ross Cockburn, the bartender who started rooting for the Bills when O.J. was there. So he's a Bills fan, but his remark is about both teams. The question is which team does the remark "subtly promote"? Maybe it's promoting both, but since the answer must be one, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, the answer is Buffalo Bills because the speaker is a Bills fan, but the remark refers to both. Hmm. Maybe the answer is N/A here. Alternatively, the question might accept "Buffalo Bills and Detroit Lions" but the instructions say to answer with the exact team name. Since the question is about the remark promoting a team, and the remark is about both, but the options don't have a combined answer, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Detroit Lions because the article mentions their shared history. I'm not sure. Let me check again. The article says "Rust Belt cities don't get a break, which is why I'm happy for both teams." The "rust bucket teams" refers to both, so the remark promotes both. But the question asks for one team. Since the user might expect one, but the correct answer is both, but the format requires one, maybe N/A. Alternatively, since the quote is in the context of the Bills and Lions being contenders, the answer is the Bills as the primary team in the article's focus? Not sure. Let me tentatively put N/A here.
