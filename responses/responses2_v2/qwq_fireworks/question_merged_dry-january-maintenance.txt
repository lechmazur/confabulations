Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the given article. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and cross-referencing the article to find the answers.

1. The first question asks about the percentage of participants maintaining reduced alcohol consumption at the 9-month follow-up. The article mentions a 2016 study where participants drank less six months after, but there's no data for 9 months. So that's N/A.

2. Laura Van Antwerp planned to drink in Bangkok but ended up at the airport. The article says she imagined having wine in Bangkok when she arrived, so the answer is Bangkok.

3. Gillian Tietz recommended replacing alcohol-centered gatherings. The article says she suggested going to a movie or coffee date instead of dinner/happy hour. That's two alternatives, so the answer is 2.

4. Dr. Emery's physiological marker for liver function? The article doesn't mention liver function specifically. He talks about lower tolerance but not a marker like enzyme levels. So N/A.

5. The week with most sleep improvements? The article doesn't specify which week of Dry January had the most significant sleep gains. N/A.

6. Average reduction for 60-day abstinence? The article mentions Ms. Tietz's 60-day recommendation but no specific average reduction. N/A.

7. Dr. Schacht's effective technique? He mentions checking in with the body and setting goals. The article says he recommends tracking consumption. Maybe "tracking consumption" but the question asks for the technique. The article says "name that goal and track your consumption", so the technique is tracking. But the question might be looking for a term like "self-monitoring". Wait, the exact wording: "behavioral modification technique most effective...". The article says "name that goal and track your consumption to hold yourself accountable." So the technique is "tracking consumption" or "goal setting and tracking". The answer would be "tracking consumption" but maybe the article uses a term? The article says "track your consumption", so the answer is "tracking consumption" but the question might expect a specific term like "self-monitoring". But the article doesn't use a specific term for the technique, just mentions tracking. Hmm. Since the question is about Dr. Schacht's research, the article states: "He added that if your goal is to moderate your drinking, it is important to name that goal and track your consumption to hold yourself accountable." So the technique is tracking consumption. But the question asks for the "most effective" technique. Since the article doesn't compare techniques, but this is what he recommends, maybe the answer is "tracking consumption". But I need to check if the question expects a different term. Alternatively, maybe "mindful drinking" is the technique? No, the technique here is tracking. Let's see the exact wording again. The article says "track your consumption", so the answer is "tracking consumption". But the question says "behavioral modification technique", so maybe "self-monitoring" is the term. However, the article doesn't use that exact term, so maybe it's N/A? Wait, the question is asking for Dr. Schacht's research. The article says "Dr. Schacht, an associate professor... who studies treatment for alcohol and addictive disorders." His research's identified technique? The article says he encourages checking in with the body and tracking consumption. Since the question is about his research, perhaps the answer is "tracking consumption" but since the article doesn't explicitly state it as a technique, maybe N/A? Hmm, tricky. The question is about Dr. Schacht's research identifying the most effective technique. The article says he "encourages people to really check in with their bodies after any period of abstinence... Does your body feel better..." and later mentions tracking. Maybe the answer is "checking in with the body" but the question is about behavioral modification techniques for maintaining habits. Since the article doesn't explicitly name a technique, maybe N/A? I'll go with N/A because the article doesn't state it as a specific technique.

8. Laura's savings during her first Dry January. The article says she saved money but doesn't give a figure. So N/A.

9. Neurological changes at 60 days vs 30? The article mentions Ms. Tietz felt she was "waking up from a dream" at 60 days, which implies improved clarity. The question asks for the change observed in study participants. The article only mentions her personal experience, not a study. So N/A.

10. Psychological assessment tool for tracking drinking patterns? The article doesn't mention any specific tool like a questionnaire or app. It says to track consumption but not which tool. So N/A.

11. The expert who links the 2016 study and mentions sleep, exercise, savings. The article says Dr. Schacht mentions the body's signals, and the 2016 study is mentioned after that. Wait: "Experts are very clear that Dry January is not a replacement for treating alcohol use disorder. But it can offer participants a physical and mental reset, and there is also evidence that most participants want to change their drinking habits beyond those 30 days. A study in 2016 found that subjects continued to drink less six months after the challenge than they did before." So the person linking the study and the improvements might be Dr. Schacht. The first part: "I always encourage people to really check in with their bodies after any period of abstinence... Does your body feel better when you don't do this? If it does, that's a really important signal you should listen to." So Dr. Schacht is the one talking about the physical signals (sleep, etc.), and then the article mentions the 2016 study. The question says "who offers this perspective while also implicitly linking it to the study from 2016?" So the answer is Dr. Schacht.

12. The city originally planned was Bangkok, as per question 2's answer. So same answer: Bangkok.

13. The influencer who suggests swapping post-work drink with nonalcoholic and changing venues. The article says Gillian Tietz recommended going to a movie or coffee instead of dinner/happy hour, so she is the one.

14. The social media personality who regretted not documenting emotions and cravings. The article mentions Laura Van Antwerp runs "Your Sober Pal" and regrets not writing down her feelings. So the answer is Laura Van Antwerp.

15. Specialist cautioning about tolerance leading to different intoxication. Dr. Emery warned about lower tolerance making the same amount more intoxicating. The article says: "Drinking the same amount you're used to is probably going to produce a different intoxication profile than you're used to," he said. So Dr. Emery.

16. The number of days where Ms. Tietz felt like waking up from a dream. The article says at 60 days without alcohol. So 60.

17. The duration for reduced drinking after the challenge. The study says six months. So 6.

18. Expert recommending a goal-oriented plan for the rest of the year. The article says Dr. Schacht: "What do I want to do for the rest of the year?" Dr. Schacht said. He added that if your goal is to moderate your drinking, it is important to name that goal and track your consumption..." So Dr. Schacht.

19. The person who said "No one wants to hear that!" when recommending more abstinence. The article says Ms. Tietz recommended 60 days and said "No one wants to hear that!" So Gillian Tietz.

20. The individual who runs the social media account and lamented not documenting. That's Laura Van Antwerp, who runs "Your Sober Pal" and expressed regret. So Laura Van Antwerp.
