Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and don't infer anything beyond what's written. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks which New Orleans restaurant Johnson operated his red beans dinners from before the Red Beans Roadshow. The article mentions he started the Roadshow by packing his car and partnering with chefs in other cities, but it doesn't specify a particular restaurant in New Orleans where he initially hosted them. It says he cooked at home first, so the answer is N/A.

2. The second question is about how many gallons of turkey gumbo he distributed as Gumbo Claus. The article states he made "gallons of gumbo" but doesn't give a specific number. Since it's not exact, the answer is N/A.

3. The third question asks the name of the brass band at the Ladies and Men of Unity parade where he had his cardiac arrest. The text mentions the parade but doesn't name the band, so N/A.

4. The fourth question is about the Indigenous tribe he photographed. The article says the Mardi Gras Indians honored Indigenous people who helped escaped slaves, but doesn't name a specific tribe. So N/A.

5. The fifth question asks the year he started the Monday tradition. He moved to New Orleans in 2001 and quickly started, but the exact year isn't given. Since "quickly" is vague, N/A.

6. The sixth question is the number of photos in his first Mardi Gras Indian exhibition. The article mentions his images were exhibited but doesn't specify the count, so N/A.

7. The seventh question is the title of his pre-Katrina guidebook. The text says he wrote a guidebook published just before Katrina, but the title isn't provided. Answer is N/A.

8. The eighth question asks which club first allowed him to photograph their ceremonies. The article doesn't mention a specific club granting permission first, so N/A.

9. The ninth question is about the recipe his mother taught him. The article says he learned from his mother in New Iberia, but the specific recipe isn't named. N/A.

10. The tenth question is how many episodes of "The Splendid Table" he was on. The article mentions a 2017 appearance on the show, but not the number of episodes. Since it's singular, maybe 1? Wait, the exact wording is "on the public radio show 'The Splendid Table'" once. So answer 1.

Wait, let me check again. The article says: "Mr. Johnson said in 2017 on the public radio show 'The Splendid Table.'" So that's one episode. So answer is 1.

11. Eleventh question: How many books did he write after Hurricane Katrina? The article states he wrote four books, including one published before Katrina. Since it doesn't specify post-Katrina count, can't answer exactly. So N/A.

12. The twelfth question is the day of the week for memorial processions. The article says "nightly second lines... are usually reserved for... members" and mentions a memorial for Johnson on Monday. The question is about the day when he hosted them. The text says "more are to come this week," but doesn't specify the regular day. Wait, the article says "on most Sundays, one of the 40 clubs hosts an elaborate four-hour parade known as a second line." But memorial processions are separate. The question is about the day Johnson typically hosted them. The article says "nightly second lines for people who have died... are usually reserved for club members..." but it's unclear if Johnson did them on a specific day. The answer might be N/A since it's not specified.

Wait, the question is "How many episodes..." so maybe the answer is N/A. Wait no, let me go back. The question 12: "What day of the week did Pableaux Johnson typically host the memorial processions for deceased members of the social aid and pleasure clubs?" The article says "nightly second lines... are usually reserved for..." but Johnson's memorial was on Monday. The article doesn't say he hosted them regularly on a specific day, just that one was arranged for him on Monday. So the answer is N/A.

13. The thirteenth question is which university awarded his degree. The article says he graduated from Trinity University in San Antonio with a degree in history, religion, and sociology. So answer Trinity University.

14. Fourteenth question: The retired college dean named as top 100 cooks. The article mentions Freddye Hill as a retired dean and documentary photographer, but the top 100 was Johnson himself. So answer N/A.

15. Fifteenth question: The city where he started gumbo parties before Oxford. The article says in Austin, Texas, he started gumbo parties. So Austin.

16. Sixteenth question: The ingredient besides the listed ones at the suppers. The menu was red beans, rice, cornbread, and whiskey for dessert. The question asks for another ingredient always present. The text says "whiskey for dessert" so whiskey is there. But the question asks for an ingredient besides those three, which is whiskey. Wait the question says "besides red beans, rice, and cornbread", so the answer is whiskey. But the article says "whiskey for dessert" so it's present. So answer whiskey.

17. Seventeenth question: The name of the show where he discussed the kitchen table. The article mentions "The Splendid Table" where he talked about the kitchen vs. dining table. So that's the show's name.

18. Eighteenth question: The type of camera he used. The article doesn't mention the brand or type of camera, just that he had one. So N/A.

19. Nineteenth question: His spouse when he made the documentaries. The documentaries were in 2016, and his marriage ended in 2006. So he was divorced by then. So answer N/A.

20. Twentieth question: The benevolent society that organized the parades he photographed. The article mentions "social aid and pleasure clubs" and specifically the Ladies and Men of Unity, but the question asks for the general name. The clubs are the benevolent societies, but the specific name of the organization that organized the parades is the social aid and pleasure clubs. Wait the question says "what was the name of the benevolent society that organized the four-hour elaborate parades..." The text says "one of the 40 clubs hosts an elaborate four-hour parade known as a second line". The clubs are the social aid and pleasure clubs, but the question wants the name of the specific society. Since it's any of the 40, but the article doesn't name a specific one, except Ladies and Men of Unity where he died. But the question is about the general term. Wait the article says "social aid and pleasure clubs" which were formed as Black benevolent societies. So the answer is social aid and pleasure clubs. But the question asks for the name of the benevolent society, so maybe the answer is "social aid and pleasure clubs". But the question might expect a specific name. Wait the question says "the benevolent society that organized the four-hour parades", but it's the clubs in general. Since the article refers to them as "social aid and pleasure clubs", that's the name. So the answer is social aid and pleasure clubs.
