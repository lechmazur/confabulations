Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not anything else. Let's start with question 1: How many milliliters... The article mentions the study but doesn't give specific measurements like milliliters for the largest aggregation. So that's N/A.

Question 2 asks about the Texas horned lizard's scales. The text says Dr. Rykaczewski mentioned water-guiding channels similar to those in Texas horned lizards. So the answer should be "water-guiding channels".

Question 3 is about the temperature range during experiments. The article doesn't mention temperature settings, so N/A.

Question 4: Dr. Schuett's years of field observations. The text says he's seen the behavior many times but no specific years. N/A again.

Question 5: Percentage of snakes showing cantilevering. The article describes the behavior but no percentage is given. N/A.

Question 6: Chemical properties of scales. The text says scales are hydrophobic and hydrophilic, so "hydrophobic and hydrophilic".

Question 7: Number of snake species compared. The article mentions king snakes as a contrast, so maybe 1? But it says "desert-dwelling snakes" compared, but only king snakes are mentioned. So 1?

Question 8: Average size of aggregations. The article mentions "massive aggregations" but no numbers. N/A.

Question 9: Minutes spent drinking. No time frames given. N/A.

Question 10: Elevation range. The article doesn't mention elevation affecting behavior. N/A.

Question 11: Drinking behavior in large clusters. The article says they sip off neighbors more in large groups. The exact behavior is "leaning over and taking sips off their neighbors".

Question 12: Which species coils into a pancake? Prairie rattlesnakes, as stated in the first part.

Question 13: Species without microstructured scales. King snakes are mentioned as having smoother scales.

Question 14: Researcher from PA who said "kissing". Dr. Boback is from Dickinson College in PA and made that remark.

Question 15: Unusual head-channeling. The article mentions 12 snakes had water channeled from head to mouth via unknown mechanism. The answer is that phenomenon.

Question 16: Bear in Altadena's crawl space. The article states a 525-pound bear found there.

Question 17: Marine mammal with songs like human language. Humpback whales are mentioned.

Question 18: Mammal in Egypt after 5000 years. Spotted hyena.

Question 19: Bird's name. Wisdom the Laysan albatross.
