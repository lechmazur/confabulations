Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The traumatic event in Chloe's past that caused her family to move. The article says Chloe "has endured a trauma that is already haunting her and her family before they move in." But it doesn't specify what the trauma was. So I should answer N/A because there's no detail given about the event itself.

2. **Question 2**: The article mentions scenes are separated by "a few seconds of black." It doesn't say minutes, so "a few seconds" isn't the same as minutes. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The ghost spends time in Chloe's closet and tidies the bathroom when she showers. The closet and bathroom are mentioned. But which is the most? The article says "hangs out in Chloe's closet" and "tidies up" the bathroom. It doesn't specify which is more, so maybe the closet? But the question is about the room observed. The bathroom is part of her shower scene, but the closet is explicitly stated as a place the ghost stays. I think the answer is the closet. Wait, but the bathroom is where the ghost is outside when she showers. Hmm. The article says "hangs out in Chloe's closet" and "when she takes a shower, it stays outside the bathroom and tidies up." So the closet is a place it spends time. The bathroom is another, but the question is which room it spends the *most* time. Since the article doesn't compare durations, maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "the room" so perhaps the closet is the answer. Let me check again. The text says "likes to hang out in Chloe's closet" and "when she takes a shower, it stays outside the bathroom and tidies up." So the closet is a specific place mentioned as where it hangs out. The bathroom is another, but maybe the closet is the answer. I'll go with Chloe's closet.

4. **Question 4**: The ghost's height relates to its former identity. The article says "(The height of the ghost's point of view is a tell.)" So the height indicates the former person's height, helping identify who they were. The significance is that the height reveals the ghost's identity. So the answer is that the height indicates the ghost's former human identity's stature, helping identify them.

5. **Question 5**: The color of the wraparound porch. The article mentions "a wraparound front porch" but doesn't specify color. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Soderbergh used two pseudonyms: Peter Andrews and Mary Ann Bernard. The article states he used two, so the answer is 2.

7. **Question 7**: Time between ghost's first appearance and the family moving. The article says "the house is empty, the next it's inhabited" but doesn't specify the time. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Which character first notices the ghost? The article doesn't mention who first becomes aware. It just says the ghost follows the family, but no specific person is noted as the first to notice. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Why does Rebekah favor Tyler? The article says "Rebekah's squirmy devotion to their son, Tyler... whose arrogance can edge into cruelty." It doesn't state the underlying reason. Maybe because Tyler is the son? Or his behavior? The article doesn't explain why she favors him, just describes his traits. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The ghost tidies the bathroom connects to its former job. The article says the tidying suggests "it's not -- or, rather, wasn't -- a creep." But there's no mention of the ghost's former occupation. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Rebekah's overbearing behavior due to past trauma? The article doesn't mention her past trauma causing her behavior. It just says she's devoted to Tyler. N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Architectural feature affecting the ghost's manifestation. The article doesn't discuss specific features like basement layout or porch affecting the ghost's presence. N/A.

13. **Question 13**: Ghost's tidying confirms identity via attic records. The article doesn't mention historical records in the attic linking the ghost's actions to a deceased family member. N/A.

14. **Question 14**: The decade reference to "Lady in the Lake" (1947) through the POV technique. The article mentions the 1947 film, so the era is the 1940s. Answer: 1940s.

15. **Question 15**: Legal dispute from documents found by Chris. The article doesn't mention any legal disputes discovered by Chris. N/A.

16. **Question 16**: Tyler's confrontation with Ryan triggers ghost's outburst. The article mentions Ryan as Tyler's friend but no confrontation causing an outburst linked to Chloe's trauma. N/A.

17. **Question 17**: Rebekah's medical condition. The article doesn't mention her having a medical condition or using medication. N/A.

18. **Question 18**: Historical event on the land's history. The article doesn't reference any 19th-century tragedy related to the house's land. N/A.

19. **Question 19**: Brand of camera equipment. The article doesn't mention specific brands used by Soderbergh. N/A.

20. **Question 20**: Final mirror shot symbolizing forgiveness. The article mentions the ghost's POV evolving but doesn't discuss the final mirror shot's symbolism related to closure. N/A.
