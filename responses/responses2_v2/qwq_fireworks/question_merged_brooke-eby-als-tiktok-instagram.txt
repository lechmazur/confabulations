Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article provided. Let me start by skimming through each question and then finding the exact details in the text.

1. The first question asks about the brand collaboration for adaptive clothing. The article mentions she worked with a clothing brand that makes styles for people with disabilities. The exact name isn't given, so maybe it's N/A? Wait, no, the question says "brand collaboration" but the text just says "a clothing brand". Since the name isn't specified, the answer should be N/A. Wait, but the question also mentions alongside the National Funeral Directors Association. The text says "companies such as a clothing brand..." so "such as" implies that's an example, but the actual name isn't given. So answer N/A.

2. The second question: Chris Equale's friend used which platform to gain followers. The text says Chris was a creator of a popular dog account on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. The question is which platform he primarily used. The article says "popular dog account with millions of followers on TikTok and Instagram and YouTube" but doesn't specify which one primarily. Since the question says "primarily", but the text doesn't say, maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "TikTok and Instagram" first. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A as the exact platform isn't stated as primary. Wait the question says "before encouraging her to share her story". The text says he encouraged her, so maybe the platforms he used were those three. Since the question is which platform he primarily used, but article doesn't say, so answer N/A.

Wait, looking back: "Chris Equale, who was one of the creators of a popular dog account with millions of followers on TikTok and Instagram and YouTube". The platforms are listed, but which is primary? The question asks "primarily used". Since it's not specified, the answer is N/A.

3. The third question: the 2014 event for ALS awareness. The article mentions the Ice Bucket Challenge. She referenced that in her videos. Yes, that's the answer.

4. The fourth question: How many years longer as a slow progressor? The article says one in 10 live more than a decade post-diagnosis. The typical survival is 3-5 years. So potentially 5 to 10 years longer. But the question is "how many years longer than the typical ALS survival rate". The typical is 3-5, so the slow progressors can live up to 10+ years. The difference would be around 5-7 years. But the exact number isn't given. The text says "one in 10 people with A.L.S. live more than a decade post-diagnosis". So the typical is 3-5, so potentially 5 years longer (10 -5 =5). The answer might be "up to 10 years", but the question asks "how many years longer than the typical". Since the typical is 3-5, the answer would be "up to 10 years" but the article doesn't state it as a specific number. The question might want the maximum possible, so 10-3=7? Or maybe the answer is N/A because it's not exact. Wait the question says "potentially grant her, according to her medical team?" The text says "doctors still don't know..." but the article mentions that she was told she's a slow progressor, and the A.L.S. Therapy Development Institute says 1 in 10 live more than a decade. So the answer is "more than a decade" but the question is asking "how many years longer". Since the typical is 3-5, the difference is more than 5 years. The exact number isn't given, so maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "how many years longer than the typical ALS survival rate does Eby's status as a 'slow progressor' potentially grant her, according to her medical team?" The article says her doctors told her she was a slow progressor, but the info on 1 in 10 living more than a decade is from the Therapy Development Institute. Since the question says "according to her medical team", but the article doesn't specify the exact number her doctors told her. So maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, tricky.

Wait the article says: "doctors still don't know what causes ALS for the other 90 to 95 percent. In September 2021... doctors still don't know..." Wait, the part about slow progressors: "The family took some comfort in learning that Eby was what doctors called a slow progressor. One in 10 people with A.L.S. live more than a decade post-diagnosis, according to the A.L.S. Therapy Development Institute. There was a chance she would be one of them." So the source here is the institute, not her medical team. The question asks "according to her medical team". Since the text doesn't say her doctors told her that, but the info comes from the institute, the answer would be N/A. But maybe the question is considering the info in the article, even if the source isn't her medical team. Wait the question says "according to her medical team", so if the article doesn't state that, then N/A.

Hmm, this is a tough one. Let me note that and come back.

5. Fifth question: Which celebrity's podcast? The article says she appeared on Christina Applegate's and Jamie-Lynn Sigler's podcast. So the answer is Christina Applegate.

6. Sixth question: Medical equipment offered for free. The article says followers message her with tips or info or offers for free medical equipment (she accepts only items not covered by insurance). The specific type isn't mentioned, so answer N/A.

7. Seventh: Which city did she fall in before seeing the neurologist? The text says she was in Maryland when she visited a neurologist after falling in Charleston, SC. Wait, the article says: "At a pit stop in Charleston, S.C., Eby fell once, and then again, which concerned her enough to visit another neurologist back in Maryland. He ran more tests..." So the falls were in Charleston, but the neurologist who gave the concerning news was in Maryland. The question asks "in which city did Eby experience a fall that led her to consult a neurologist who delivered the initial concerning news about her condition?" Wait, the initial concerning news was when? Let me check the timeline. The first neurologist who raised concerns about ALS was before she moved to Maryland. Wait, the timeline: After the Charleston falls, she went to Maryland neurologist who ran tests and said he didn't like what he saw. That led to the diagnosis. So the falls were in Charleston, SC. The neurologist was in Maryland, but the falls happened in Charleston. The question is which city did she fall in that led her to consult the neurologist. So answer is Charleston, SC.

8. Eighth question: Nonprofit organization to connect ALS patients with tech professionals? The article says she founded ALStogether, a community on Slack where caregivers and people with ALS can connect and swap resources. The question says "connect ALS patients with tech industry professionals for career support". The article mentions caregivers and patients, not specifically tech industry. So the answer might be N/A. The name is ALStogether, but the purpose as per the article is caregivers and patients swapping resources. The question's detail about tech professionals isn't there. So N/A.

9. Ninth question: Household item for declining hand strength before bidet. The article says her mom bought foam handles for silverware. The bidet was installed "to get ahead of when my hands get super weak." So the foam handles were before the bidet. The answer is foam handles. The question asks the name of the item, so "foam handles".

10. Tenth: Primary reason for stopping travel in late November, unrelated to mobility. The article says "The leg weakness is one thing... There's really nothing to replace your arms." She said "The leg weakness is one thing, Eby told her followers. She had a wheelchair for that. 'There's really nothing to replace your arms.'" So the reason for stopping travel was the arm weakness, which is part of her physical mobility. Wait, the question says "unrelated to her physical mobility limitations". Hmm, that's confusing. Wait the question says "primary reason... unrelated to physical mobility limitations". Wait the text says she stopped traveling because it was too taxing. The exact quote: "it had become too taxing." The reason given is that her arms are weaker, which is part of her physical condition. The question might be trying to trick me here. The answer is N/A because the reason is related to her physical condition. The question says "unrelated", so maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question is phrased as "primary reason... unrelated to her physical mobility limitations". The article says the reason was the arm weakness, which is a mobility issue. So the answer is N/A.

Wait the article says: "The leg weakness is one thing... There's really nothing to replace your arms." So the problem with her arms (mobility) is why she stopped traveling. The question is asking for the reason unrelated to mobility, so since the reason is due to mobility, the answer is N/A.

11. Eleventh question: Company that provided private jet. The article says Salesforce flew her on their private jet. So the answer is Salesforce.

12. Twelfth: Character from The Addams Family. The article mentions comparing herself to Thing, the roaming hand. So the answer is Thing.

13. Thirteenth: Substance from college party. The pudding pool. The article says "five things that definitely did not cause my terminal illness... we all got in and wrestled in it. (Scrunching her face, she added, 'There's got to be some class-action on that party.')". The substance was pudding.

14. Fourteenth: Which leg had weakness when moving to NYC. The article says her left calf had tightness, then left foot weakness. So left leg.

15. Fifteenth: Science fiction weapon mentioned after cane post. The messages from the dating app included "If I bring my light saber..." So lightsaber.

16. Sixteenth: Household fixture installed for winter. The bidet was installed "to get ahead of when my hands get super weak." So bidet.

17. Seventeenth: Family member providing support, highlighted in videos. Her father Cliff is mentioned as a "lovable side character", doing a fit check and talking about his tie being "fancy like Applebee's". So the answer is Cliff.

18. Eighteenth: Handle combining her name and Limp Bizkit. The handle is "limpbroozkit" (part of her name between Limp Bizkit). The answer is limpbroozkit.

19. Nineteenth: Organization for final arrangements. The National Funeral Directors Association, which she collaborated with on a video about getting affairs in order. So National Funeral Directors Association.

20. Twentieth: Adaptive utensil with foam handles. The article says foam handles on silverware. So foam handles.
