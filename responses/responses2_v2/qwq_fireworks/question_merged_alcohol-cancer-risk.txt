Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information given and follow the strict instructions.

1. **Question 1**: The Australian study data mentions that for one drink a day (7 drinks/week), the breast cancer risk was 13.1%. The question asks for exactly 3 drinks per week. Since the article only provides data for less than one/week and one/day (7/week), there's no specific data for 3 drinks/week. So N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The article says Elizabeth Platz from Johns Hopkins discussed drinking and smoking compounding head and neck cancer risk. The question is about pancreatic cancer. The meta-analysis linked heavy drinking to higher pancreatic cancer risk, but the researcher named for that specific correlation isn't mentioned. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The International Agency for Research on Cancer's working group found that long-term quitting reduces oral and esophageal cancer risk, but the year isn't stated. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The article states 741,300 cases were attributable to alcohol in 2020. Total global cancer cases aren't provided, so can't calculate the non-attributable number. N/A.

5. **Question 5**: A standard drink is 5 ounces of wine. Convert to milliliters: 5 oz â‰ˆ 148 mL. The article says 5-ounce glass is a standard drink. So answer is 148.

6. **Question 6**: The 2019 survey said only 45% of Americans recognized the link. No info on which demographic group had higher awareness. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The 2013 study mentioned light drinking (up to one/day) had a 17% higher oral/pharynx and 5% breast, 30% esophageal. But for two drinks/week, the article doesn't specify. The question is about two drinks/week. The data given is for one/day or two/day. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The report says it's unclear when risk returns to baseline. Dr. Naimi mentions cutting back helps but doesn't specify months. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The article states women metabolize alcohol slower but doesn't name the metabolic pathway. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The article says binge drinking's cancer risk isn't clear compared to regular drinking. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Men developing breast cancer? The article says for men consuming less than one/week, 10% any alcohol-related cancer, but no specific breast cancer for men. Also, the question is about binge drinking (4+ drinks in 2 hours). Since breast cancer in men isn't mentioned, N/A.

12. **Question 12**: The meta-analysis by Dr. Naimi? Wait, the article says a large meta-analysis compared light/moderate/heavy drinkers. The risk for stomach cancer was 15-20% higher for heavy drinkers vs non-drinkers. The exact percentage isn't given, so N/A. Also, the question asks for his conducted study, but the meta-analysis isn't attributed to him specifically.

13. **Question 13**: The woman has family history, slower metabolism, smokes, and one drink/day. The report says one drink/day increases esophageal cancer risk. The 2013 study mentioned a 30% higher for esophageal at up to one/day. But absolute risk isn't given for esophageal specifically. The question asks for absolute risk percentage, which isn't provided here. N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Dr. Hawk isn't mentioned with laryngeal cancer stats. The article states the Australian study's data for less than one/week for overall cancers but not laryngeal specifically. N/A.

15. **Question 15**: The working group found quitting reduces oral/esophageal, but the survey was about general awareness. The question asks about liver cancer and the percentage of Americans who knew. No data on that. N/A.

16. **Question 16**: The 2013 study says up to one/day had 17% higher oral/pharynx. The question is for two/day. The article doesn't specify for two/day in that study. N/A.

17. **Question 17**: The 13.1% is breast cancer for seven drinks/week (one/day). The question asks for another cancer. The article mentions other cancers linked but doesn't specify which had 13.1%. N/A.

18. **Question 18**: The man has colon cancer predisposition, two drinks/day, poor diet. The article links heavy drinking to pancreatic cancer (four+/day), but two drinks/day might not reach that. The absolute risk for pancreatic isn't given. N/A.

19. **Question 19**: The meta-analysis says heavy drinkers had over twofold higher gallbladder cancer than non-drinkers. Light drinkers (less than one/week) are the reference. So light drinkers compared to themselves? The question is about light vs the reference group (same as light?), so N/A. Or maybe the light drinkers are the reference, so the relative risk for light drinkers would be 1, but the question is about light drinkers compared to the reference (which is them). So N/A.

20. **Question 20**: The Australian study excluded non-drinkers to avoid "sick quitter". If Nina's study includes people with good habits, but the original data for men at one/day was 11% any alcohol-related. Since the question is about the same methodology but with better habits, the article doesn't provide adjusted data. N/A.
