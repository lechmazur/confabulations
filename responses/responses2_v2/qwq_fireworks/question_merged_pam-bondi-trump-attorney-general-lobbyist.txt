Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I use only the information from the provided article. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then check the article for the answers.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks for the total amount paid to Ballard Partners for services related to the Cuban piers dispute. The article mentions Carnival paid fees, but specifically, when discussing Marsha Lazareva, it states Ballard Partners got $350,000. However, the Cuban piers dispute is about Carnival's case. Wait, the article says "the Russian money manager Marsha Lazareva... lobbying campaign intended to set her free... generated $350,000 in fees for Ballard Partners." The Cuban piers dispute with Carnival isn't linked to a specific fee amount here. So maybe the answer is N/A because the article doesn't mention fees for the Cuban piers case, only the Lazareva case. Hmm, but the question combines all related fees across different clients and cases for the Cuban piers. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The article says "the work began with the Russian businesswoman... generated $350,000 in fees for Ballard Partners." The Cuban piers dispute with Carnival is a separate case but the article doesn't mention fees for that specifically. So the answer might be N/A because the question combines fees related to Cuban piers, but only Lazareva's fees are mentioned. Wait, but the question says "combining all related fees mentioned across different clients and cases". The Cuban piers case is Carnival's, but the article doesn't state the fee for that. The only specific fee mentioned is the $350k for Lazareva. So maybe the answer is $350,000? Wait, but the question is about the Cuban piers dispute, so maybe that's not related. The article says Carnival hired Bondi and Ballard, but the fee isn't specified. So the answer would be N/A because the Cuban piers case's fees aren't mentioned. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** This is a hypothetical about investing the $25k in 5-Hour Energy stock. The article says ETC Capital (5-Hour Energy's investment fund) donated $10k to Bondi's PAC. The question assumes if the $25k was invested in the stock, and if the stock price mirrored the fines (millions in fines and settlements). The outcome would be a percentage loss. But the article doesn't give stock price info or the exact fines. The 5-Hour Energy case resulted in settlements requiring millions in fines and reimbursements. But without actual stock price data, we can't compute the percentage. So answer N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The Travelocity lawsuit outcome and its relation to Carnival's 2022 ruling. The article says Bondi's office withdrew the Travelocity lawsuit. For Carnival, a 2022 ruling ordered $110M in damages. But the question asks if the Travelocity outcome is determined by the same ruling as Carnival. The article doesn't link them directly. The Travelocity case was dropped, while Carnival's case was a separate lawsuit. So the answer is N/A because they're different cases.

4. **Question 4:** Matt Gaetz's reason for withdrawing is mentioned in the article: he faced opposition even within his party. The question ties it to the Travelocity case outcome. But the article doesn't state that Gaetz's withdrawal was due to the Travelocity case. So answer N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The Trump admin official present with Micky Arison besides Sec of State and NS Advisor who testified. The email says "Trump's secretary of state and national security adviser, among others, the court records show. 'I'd really like to help these people...' " The other official isn't named here. Wait, maybe the answer is not given. The article says "the conversation included Ms. Bondi, as well as Mr. Trump's secretary of state and national security adviser, among others..." but no specific name. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** If Tandy Bondi worked on Accretive instead of Carnival, what was the penalty on Lazareva? The article says Lazareva was sentenced to 10+ years and over $30M in repayments and fines. The question ties this to the number of clients (30), but the penalty is $30M+ so answer $30 million.

7. **Question 7:** The company whose chairman sponsored Trump's show leading to the Oval Office meeting. The article mentions Micky Arison (Carnival's chairman) had a meeting with Trump after sponsoring "The Apprentice". So answer Carnival Corporation.

8. **Question 8:** The PAC that received $25k from Trump Foundation same month as Harris not investigating Trump U. The article says the $25k donation was in Sept 2013, same month as ETC's $10k donation. The PAC is "And Justice for All".

9. **Question 9:** Foreign entity involved in Kuwait embezzlement with failed UN appeal. The article mentions Marsha Lazareva's Kuwait case, so the entity is her firm or the Russian firm? The article says "a firm once run by a Russian businesswoman", so the answer is the firm run by Marsha Lazareva.

10. **Question 10:** Private prison company Bondi lobbied for. The article says Geo Group.

11. **Question 11:** Carnival's feared damages were up to $600M as mentioned in the email.

12. **Question 12:** Former FBI director who worked with Bondi on Lazareva. The article mentions Louis Freeh.

13. **Question 13:** The event on Mackinac Island was the Republican Attorneys General Association meeting.

14. **Question 14:** The state that sued Trump U resulting in $25M settlement was New York. The article mentions NY's suit leading to $25M, and Bondi's PAC got the $25k donation around the same time.

15. **Question 15:** Federal agency lobbied for MLB's Cuban players. The article says Bondi lobbied the Trump admin to reconsider a decision blocking Cuban players' path, implying the Department of Homeland Security or State? But the question asks for specific agency. The article says "the White House to pressure Kuwait to release her" but for MLB, maybe the Department of Homeland Security? Not specified. The article says "pushing Mr. Trump to reconsider a decision that blocked a deal to ease Cuban players' path to U.S. teams. The effort resulted in another White House meeting..." So the agency might be the Department of Homeland Security, but the exact name isn't given. Wait, the question says "according to disclosure records" which the article mentions "federal agencies" but not the specific one. So N/A? Or maybe the State Department? The article says "lobbying Congress, the State Department..." So maybe the State Department? Wait, the question is about MLB's lobbying. The article says "the league was pushing Mr. Trump to reconsider a decision that blocked a deal to ease Cuban players' path to United States teams. The effort resulted in another White House meeting..." The decision was likely from the executive branch, so maybe the Department of Homeland Security or State? The article doesn't specify. So N/A?

Wait, the article says "as the league was pushing Mr. Trump to reconsider a decision that blocked a deal to ease Cuban players' path to United States teams. The effort resulted in another White House meeting, which Ms. Bondi participated in, according to Mr. Ballard." Since it's a presidential decision, maybe the agency is the Department of Homeland Security, but without explicit mention, it's N/A. Alternatively, maybe the Department of Justice? The article doesn't say, so answer N/A.

16. **Question 16:** The Florida lobbyist who hosted fundraiser and later hired her is Brian Ballard, as stated in the article.
