Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided.

1. The first question asks which designer made the gown in Napoleon III's apartments, similar to the 1957 movie gown. The article mentions a Dior gown by John Galliano from 2004 in Napoleon III's apartments. The 1957 reference is Audrey Hepburn in "Funny Face" wearing Givenchy. So the answer is John Galliano for Dior.

2. The maximum daily visitors allowed at the Louvre. The article states the Louvre has capped daily attendance at 30,000 to reduce overcrowding. So that's straightforward.

3. The institution moving fashion from basement to the main entrance's gift shop area. The Met is mentioned: "the Met is in the midst of a renovation that will relocate the fashion department from the basement... to the former gift shop in the Great Hall."

4. The emperor's apartments used for the exhibit. The article says the exhibition is in Napoleon III's apartments. So Napoleon III is the answer.

5. The architectural feature criticized as inhospitable. The memo mentions the glass pyramid by I.M. Pei was called "very inhospitable."

6. The Brooklyn Academy of Music's digital installations. The article says "Techne" with four digital installations at BAM.

7. The Louvre-Lens exhibition title about artists' clothing choices. The article mentions "The Art of Dressing: Dressing Like an Artist" opening in March at Louvre-Lens.

8. The fundraising target from the gala. The article states the goal was a million euros, exceeded by selling over 30 tables.

9. The luxury house contributing to Louvre and having a permanent space. Dior is mentioned (Galliano's gown), and the end says Saint Laurent, Dior, and Alaia have permanent spaces. So Dior.

10. Percentage of non-French visitors. The article says 66% are first-timers, but the question is about non-French. It states 23% are French, so 77% are non-French. Wait, the exact line: "Only 23 percent of visitors to the Louvre are French; the rest are foreigners." So the answer is 77%.
