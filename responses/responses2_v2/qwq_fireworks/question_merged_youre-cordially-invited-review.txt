Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and follow the strict format. Let's start with the first question.

1. The question asks about an animal symbolic of surrealist elements in Stoller's films, mentioned in the wedding rehearsal scene. The article says, "at least one alligator is wrestled. (There's the surrealist swerve.)" So the answer is alligator.

2. Jenni's profession: The article states she's the daughter of Jim and mentions her fiancé is her college sweetheart. It doesn't specify her job. The question might be a trick because "girl dad" refers to Jim, not her job. Since there's no info, it's N/A.

3. The review compares the rom-com's rhythm to a dance, specifically mentioning "tap-dancing back and forth." So the answer is tap-dancing.

4. The societal shift in the double-booked wedding premise. The article mentions the film's focus on family togetherness and control, but the specific trend? The double-booked weddings might reflect modern individualism or scheduling conflicts. Wait, the article says "what we think about power, hierarchies, love and individual agency." Maybe individual agency in planning weddings? But the question asks for a specific trend. The article says "the fun is seeing how it occurs, in this case with a combination of comedy of errors and comedy of manners." Maybe not a direct societal shift. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "reflected in the double-booked wedding premise" – perhaps the idea of people wanting to have weddings at the same place, showing maybe the importance of personal connection to locations? Not sure. The article mentions both families wanting the same island, so maybe the trend is weddings at family heritage locations. But the question asks for a societal shift. The article's intro says rom-coms reveal cultural attitudes. The double-booking might symbolize the clash between individual desires and family traditions? Not sure. Maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "the fun is seeing how it occurs... comedy of errors and comedy of manners." Maybe the societal shift is the blending of personal and traditional wedding elements. Still not sure. Let me check the article again. The article says the double-booking is the premise, so the societal shift might be the emphasis on personalized weddings at specific locations, leading to conflicts. But the exact answer isn't directly stated. Maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "specific societal shift", but the article doesn't name one. So N/A?

Wait, the article says "what we think about power, hierarchies, love and individual agency is all wrapped up in the details we infuse into that resilient narrative arc." The double-booked wedding might reflect individual agency in choosing wedding locations, so maybe the societal shift is the prioritization of personal significance over tradition in wedding planning. But the question wants the specific shift reflected. Since the article doesn't explicitly state it, maybe N/A. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the article says "the film takes a few memorable surrealist swerves" but that's about style. I'll go with N/A for now.

5. The question asks what award the movie won, highlighting its failure. The article mentions "Bros" didn't fare as well, but doesn't say "You're Cordially Invited" won any. So N/A.

6. The setting is on a tiny island. The question asks what transportation is absent. The article mentions the weddings are on the same tiny island, but there's no mention of transportation issues. Maybe boats? Since it's an island, maybe they drive, but if it's a tiny island, maybe ferry? The article says "how did that guy get to that room? Why is it sunny out now?" but not about transportation. So N/A.

7. The comedic technique underutilized in Ferrell's performance. The review says Ferrell's impish flair for improvisation is seen but he doesn't get to let loose enough. Apatow's style includes improv? The article says "raunchy but kind of sweet, and these in particular take a few memorable surrealist swerves." Maybe improvisation is the technique underutilized. The question asks about Apatow's technique, so perhaps "improvisation" is the answer.

8. Snack food that's "janky" like the film. The reviewer compares it to flimsy rom-coms. The article doesn't mention specific snacks, so N/A.

9. Legal document overlooked. The double-booking would involve contracts. The article says "the chaos of the double-booking" but doesn't mention a specific document. Maybe the wedding licenses or venue contracts. Since it's not stated, N/A.

10. Other show on Amazon Prime with a double-booked event. The article mentions Tom Green's return on Prime but no specific show. So N/A.

11. The day hinted at for weddings: both want June 1. The article says "Maybe on June 1?" for both. So the answer is June 1.

12. The performer with restrained improvisation is Ferrell. The article says Ferrell's impish flair is seen but not enough. So answer: Will Ferrell.

13. The actor embodying controlled yet empathetic big sister is Reese Witherspoon, as Margot. The article says "Witherspoon has her tightly wound but good-hearted big sister thing down perfectly."

14. The central venue is the tiny island where both families' weddings are planned. The article mentions "the same inn on the same tiny island" and "summer with their grandmother." So the venue is the inn on the tiny island. The exact name isn't given, but the answer is "the same inn on the same tiny island" or just the tiny island? The question asks for the venue, so maybe "the inn on the tiny island" but the article says "the tiny island" as the location. Since the exact venue name isn't given, but it's the inn, maybe "the inn".

Wait the article says "the same inn on the same tiny island where he and her mother tied the knot" and "the tiny island where Margot and Neve spent summers with their grandmother". So the venue is the inn on the tiny island. But the question asks for the venue's name? The article doesn't give a name, so perhaps "the inn on the tiny island" is the answer. But maybe the answer is "the tiny island" since that's the setting. Hmm. The question says "venue", which is the inn. Since the article refers to "the inn", the answer is "the inn".

15. The directorial legacy as a benchmark. The article mentions Judd Apatow's influence, so maybe Apatow's legacy. The question says "implicitly evoked as a benchmark for the film’s intended tone?" The film is in the Apatow tradition, so the answer is Judd Apatow.

16. The animal in the wrestling scene is the alligator. The article says "at least one alligator is wrestled".

17. The narrative element causing confusion is continuity issues. The article mentions "continuity does not feel completely settled -- how did that guy get to that room? Why is it sunny out now?" So the answer is continuity errors.

18. The character determined to organize the wedding despite family issues is Margot (Witherspoon). The article says Margot isn't on great terms but wants to plan the wedding. So answer: Margot.

19. The political period is the Obama administration. The article says "during roughly the years of the Obama administration".

20. The platform is Amazon Prime Video. The article ends with "On Amazon Prime Video."
