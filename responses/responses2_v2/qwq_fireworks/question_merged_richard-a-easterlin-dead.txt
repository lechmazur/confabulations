Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information given in the article. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then check the article for the answer.

1. **Question 1**: Which university awarded Richard Easterlin his undergraduate degree in economics before he went on to earn his master's and PhD from the University of Pennsylvania?  
   The article mentions he got a master's in engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology, then switched to economics. His economics degrees (master's and PhD) are from UPenn, but undergrad isn't mentioned. Wait, the article says: "Richard earned a master's degree in engineering from the Stevens Institute of Technology... He earned a master's in economics in 1949 and a Ph.D. in 1953, both from the University of Pennsylvania." There's no mention of an undergraduate degree in economics. The first degree was engineering. So the question is about undergraduate economics, which isn't stated. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2**: How many Japanese citizens were surveyed between 1958 and 1987 to establish their happiness levels relative to the country's economic growth?  
   The article states that Japanese incomes jumped fivefold during that period, but doesn't mention the number of people surveyed. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: What was the primary methodology Richard Easterlin used to measure happiness levels in his 1974 paper?  
   The article says he examined opinion polls from 19 countries. So the methodology was opinion polls.

4. **Question 4**: Which economic journal published Easterlin's original 1974 paper?  
   The article doesn't name the journal. It just mentions the paper title. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: What percentage increase in happiness did Easterlin find was associated with each additional dollar of income?  
   The article doesn't give a specific percentage. It says happiness doesn't rise commensurately, but no % per dollar. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Who was the first academic to challenge Easterlin's paradox before Wolfers/Stevenson's 2008 paper?  
   The article mentions Wolfers and Stevenson in 2008, but doesn't name anyone before them. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: During which decade did Easterlin conduct his initial surveys of American happiness levels post-WWII?  
   The article says since WWII, but when exactly? The 1974 paper was based on data since WWII, so maybe the surveys were in the 1950s-60s? But the article doesn't specify the decade of the surveys. The question is about the decade of the initial surveys. Since he published in the 70s, maybe the data was from the 50s or 60s. But the article says "since World War II" but doesn't specify. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: What statistical method did Wolfers and Stevenson use in their 2008 paper?  
   The article doesn't mention the statistical method, just that they used a broader body of opinion polls. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: How many years did Easterlin serve as chair of the economics department at UPenn before moving to USC?  
   The article says he was chair three times, but not the number of years. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: What was the name of the research center Easterlin established at USC?  
   The article doesn't mention a specific center. He was a professor there, but no center named. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: What percentage increase in happiness did the Japanese report between 1958-1987?  
   The article says Japanese incomes increased fivefold but they didn't report being happier. So the answer is 0% or N/A. Since it says "no happier," maybe 0%? But the question asks for percentage increase. The article states "Japanese people said that they, too, were no happier." So the increase is 0%. But the question specifies "according to surveys cited by the University of Pennsylvania economist..." which is Easterlin. So answer 0%.

12. **Question 12**: In what year did the IZA Prize winner (Easterlin) publish his seminal paper?  
   The IZA Prize was in 2009. His seminal paper was 1974. The question says "seminal paper challenging the link..." which is the 1974 one. So 1974.

13. **Question 13**: What engineering degree did the Broward County commissioner's son (Easterlin) get before switching?  
   His father was a commissioner. Easterlin got a master's in engineering from Stevens Institute. So the degree is engineering.

14. **Question 14**: Besides income and happiness, what other demographic trend did he analyze?  
   The Easterlin effect on baby booms and busts (fertility rates related to jobs).

15. **Question 15**: What policy recommendation did he make in the 1990s related to Wolfers/Stevenson's findings?  
   The article says he changed his mind, believing factors like health and family life matter more. The question asks about a policy recommendation related to Wolfers/Stevenson's findings (which argue GDP matters). But Easterlin's own recommendation was about focusing on health and family, not directly related to Wolfers' findings. The question says "related to the findings of Wolfers and Stevenson". Since Wolfers argued GDP and happiness are linked, maybe Easterlin's recommendation was to not focus solely on GDP? The article says he thought policies shouldn't aim for GDP growth. But the question is about his policy recommendation related to their findings. The article states "he was skeptical that wealth explained their happiness" but the policy recommendation he made was in the 90s: "he changed his mind... recognizing that factors other than income were important... Improvements in health and family life have substantial impact." So the policy would be to focus on those instead of income. The answer is: policies should focus on health and family life, but the question asks for the specific recommendation related to Wolfers/Stevenson. The article doesn't explicitly link his policy change to their work, just his own. The question might be looking for "policymakers shouldn't seek to raise GDP" as his earlier stance, but he changed his mind. Wait, the article says: "Most radically, some economists have said the paradox implied that policymakers shouldn't seek to raise G.D.P., because it would make little difference to people's sense of well-being." But Easterlin's own later policy view was that other factors matter more. The question is about his specific recommendation in the 90s. The article states "he changed his mind in the 1990s, recognizing that factors other than income were important to a sense of well-being. 'Improvements in income have relatively little effect on happiness," he said... whereas improvements in health and family life have substantial impact." So his policy recommendation would be to prioritize health and family policies over income. The answer should be "policies should focus on health and family life" but the question wants the specific recommendation related to Wolfers/Stevenson's findings? Maybe the answer is N/A, but the article says he changed his policy view to focus on non-income factors. The question says "related to the findings of Wolfers and Stevenson" which argue GDP does matter. Since Easterlin's recommendation was based on his own views, not theirs, maybe N/A. Hmm. The question is tricky. The article says "he changed his mind in the 1990s, recognizing that factors other than income were important to a sense of well-being." So the policy recommendation would be to focus on those factors. The answer is: "focus on improving health and family life" but the question says "specific policy recommendation related to Wolfers and Stevenson's findings". Since their findings support GDP's role, but Easterlin's recommendation is against that, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe "that policymakers shouldn't focus on GDP" but that was the implication of his paradox. However, in the 90s he changed to other factors, so maybe the answer is "focus on health and family policies". The article states he recognized those factors, so the recommendation is to prioritize them. The answer is "focus on health and family life" but need to check exact wording. The article says "he changed his mind... recognizing that factors other than income were important... Improvements in health and family life have substantial impact." So the policy would be to focus on those. The question asks for the specific recommendation related to Wolfers/Stevenson's findings. Since their work supports GDP's role, but Easterlin's change is independent, perhaps the answer is "N/A". Alternatively, maybe the policy is "not to prioritize GDP growth", but the article says "he was skeptical that wealth explained their happiness". The answer is likely "N/A" because the question ties it to Wolfers/Stevenson's findings, which he disputed. But the question says "related to the findings of Wolfers and Stevenson", which argue that GDP does matter. Easterlin's policy recommendation would be against their findings, so maybe he recommended against relying on GDP growth. The article mentions that some economists (not Easterlin) said policymakers shouldn't seek GDP. Easterlin's own shift was to focus on other factors. The question says "what specific policy recommendation, related to the findings of Wolfers and Stevenson, did Easterlin make...". Since Wolfers argue GDP does matter, but Easterlin's own stance was that it doesn't, his recommendation would be to not focus on GDP, which is what some economists said based on his paradox. But the article says "he changed his mind in the 1990s, recognizing that factors other than income were important". So his policy recommendation would be to focus on those factors. The exact wording in the article: "Although Mr. Easterlin long believed that no public policies would increase the sum of human happiness, he changed his mind in the 1990s, recognizing that factors other than income were important to a sense of well-being." So the policy recommendation is that policies should focus on those factors (health and family). Therefore, the answer is "focus on improving health and family life" but the question asks for the specific recommendation. The article says "Improvements in health and family life have substantial impact." So the answer is "focus on health and family life" but need to see if exact terms are used. The article uses "improvements in health and family life", so the policy recommendation would be to prioritize those. So the answer is "focus on improving health and family life".

16. **Question 16**: What was the income increase in Japan according to Easterlin's research?  
   The article states "Japanese incomes jumped fivefold from 1958 to 1987". So fivefold, which is 500% increase. The question asks "how many times more", so the answer is fivefold, but the question says "how many times more did incomes rise"—so the answer is five.

17. **Question 17**: What was the name of the journal where his 1974 paper was published?  
   The article doesn't mention the journal's name. N/A.

18. **Question 18**: What Nobel Prize-winning economist contradicted Easterlin?  
   The article mentions Daniel Kahneman, a Princeton psychologist and Nobel laureate in economics, who said there's evidence against the Easterlin paradox.

19. **Question 19**: What was the title of the podcast where Wolfers acknowledged Easterlin's contribution?  
   The article says Wolfers wrote in a blog entry for the "Freakonomics" podcast. So the podcast's name is "Freakonomics".

20. **Question 20**: What aspect of family life had a greater impact than income, according to Easterlin?  
   The article states "improvements in health and family life have substantial impact" compared to income. So family life is part of that. The answer is "family life".
