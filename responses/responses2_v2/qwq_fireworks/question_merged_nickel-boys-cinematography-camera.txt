Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and avoid any external knowledge.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks which experimental filmmaker's work with light studies through glass windows influenced "Nickel Boys." Scanning the article, I remember Sam Ellison mentioned Nathaniel Dorsky, who made silent films about light studies. The article specifically says he used a glass on a table with light from a window. So the answer is Nathaniel Dorsky.

2. **Question 2**: RaMell Ross's previous documentary "Hale County..." – the article doesn't mention any Academy Award nominations for that. It just says it was at Sundance and moved Fray. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The Sony Venice in Rialto mode's frame rate? The article mentions Rialto mode allows a tiny camera but doesn't specify frame rate. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Brandon Wilson's challenging scene with eye contact. The article mentions Ellison found dormitory and classroom scenes hard due to gaze timing. But the question specifies Brandon Wilson. The text says Ellison had the hardest scene, not Wilson. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Lighting for dissociative states? The article talks about SnorriCam and production design but doesn't mention specific lighting. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Number of takes for SnorriCam with Diggs. The text says they worked with Diggs on shoulder movements but no number of takes. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Runtime of the flogging scene not shown. The article says the scene was shot with the camera looking away, but no duration given. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Cinematographer who mentored Ellison. The article says Ellison started as a PA and did jobs but doesn't mention a mentor. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Percentage of first vs third-person. The article says "shot almost entirely" from first-person but no exact percentage. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Malick's influence on dormitory shots. The article mentions Malick's influence on Fray but doesn't link to specific camera movements. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Ramsay's influence on intimacy. The article says Ramsay's work was influential, especially "Small Deaths" and "Holy Cow" for evocative emotion. The question asks about a scientist's short film, but "Holy Cow" is about girlhood. Wait, maybe "Small Deaths" is the one? The article says "shorts 'Small Deaths' and 'Holy Cow,' which is about girlhood and puberty." The question mentions a scientist, which isn't mentioned. So maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "exemplified by her short film about a scientist" – but the article doesn't mention that. So N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Max screen size for Rialto mode. The article says Sony Venice can be shown on IMAX-like screens. So answer IMAX.

13. **Question 13**: Oscars nominated for, including Best Cinematography. The article says two nominations: Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay. It doesn't mention Cinematography. So N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Year of Sundance premiere for "Hale County..." The article says in 2018. So 2018.

15. **Question 15**: Physical action during handheld scenes. The article says Fray wore the costume, actors put arms under his armpit, cheek-to-cheek. So the action is putting arms under armpits or cheek-to-cheek.

16. **Question 16**: Camera rig for dissociation. The article mentions SnorriCam, which is used in action movies and attached to the actor. The question says "romantic comedies" but the article says action. But the answer is SnorriCam.

17. **Question 17**: Pulitzer author adapted. The article says Colson Whitehead's Pulitzer-winning novel. So Colson Whitehead.

18. **Question 18**: Ellis-Taylor's emotion. The article says she channeled loneliness and isolation from not having a scene partner, mirroring Hattie's feelings. So loneliness/isolation.

19. **Question 19**: Dorsky's film format. The article says 16-millimeter, not 35. So N/A.

20. **Question 20**: Other location with challenging gaze. The article mentions classroom scenes with Hamish (superintendent) giving a speech. The actor's last name rhymes with "skater" – Linklater (Hamish Linklater). So classroom.
