Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I'm only using the article provided and not any outside knowledge. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. The first question asks which Republican senator changed their position after seeing Musk's social media posts. The article mentions that Republicans changed their minds after Elon Musk and Donald Trump condemned the bill, but it doesn't specify a senator's name. So that's N/A.

2. Bruce Lerner's average consultation time isn't mentioned. The article says he had 10 telehealth visits but no duration. So N/A.

3. The percentage of Medicare users in 2020 who had technical issues: The article cites a study where almost 40% said telemedicine was worse, but it's not clear if that's due to tech issues. However, later it says "the primary barrier is still technology" and 40% found it frustrating. Wait, the study mentioned was of 200 older patients, and almost 40% said it was worse, but the question is about technical difficulties specifically. The article says "some found the technology frustrating," but not the exact percentage. Hmm, so maybe N/A because it's not explicitly stated as technical difficulties, just that 40% found it worse. The answer might be N/A here.

4. Which Indianapolis medical center referred Kent Manuel? The article says his oncologist recommended palliative care, but doesn't name the center. So N/A.

5. Total cost savings by Medicare? The article mentions a study with higher costs, but no specific savings figure. N/A.

6. Staff at Thyme Care helping with tech issues? The article says some providers send links and hire staff to help, but not the number. N/A.

7. The medication that worked for Kent after two failed attempts: The article doesn't name the medication. Just says the third worked. N/A.

8. Highest-rated state for palliative care? The article mentions Indiana had 2.5 stars but doesn't say which state had the highest. N/A.

9. Percentage of Helen's treatments via telemedicine? The article says she uses video visits but doesn't give a percentage. N/A.

10. Number of One Medical clinics in D.C. for Bruce? The article says he uses One Medical but doesn't specify the number of clinics. N/A.

11. The extension duration: The article says the resolution had a two-year extension but then a narrower three-month one. The question asks how many months it's extended for now. The answer is 3 months (March 31 from Dec 31). So 3.

12. Mobility aid for Kent Manuel: He uses a wheelchair. The answer is wheelchair.

13. Percentage by late last year: The article states 13% by late last year. So 13%.

14. Method reducing office/ER visits: The article mentions telehealth consultations, specifically virtual visits. The answer is virtual visits.

15. Barrier to telemedicine: The primary barrier is technology. So technology.

16. Institution with disbanded DEI clubs: The article mentions West Point ending clubs due to Trump's D.E.I. ban. So West Point.

17. Who predicted telehealth continuation: Kyle Zebley from the American Telemedicine Association. His role is Senior VP for public policy. The question asks his professional role, so "senior vice president for public policy".

18. Public figure with Musk who delayed the bill: The article says Musk and Trump condemned it. The question asks the public figure besides Musk, which is Trump. But the question says "mentioned alongside another tech entrepreneur"â€”Musk is the tech one, so the answer is Donald Trump.

19. State with low palliative care rating: Indiana had 2.5 stars. So Indiana.

20. Country with critical minerals: Canada, as per Trudeau's comment. So Canada.

Let me verify each again:

1. N/A (no senator named)
2. N/A (no time given)
3. The study says 40% found tele worse, but the question is about technical difficulties. The article says "some found the technology frustrating" but not the exact percentage. Since it's not directly stated, N/A.
4. N/A
5. N/A
6. N/A
7. N/A
8. N/A
9. N/A
10. N/A
11. 3 months
12. wheelchair
13. 13%
14. virtual visits (or telemedicine consultations)
15. technology
16. West Point
17. senior vice president for public policy
18. Donald Trump
19. Indiana
20. Canada

Wait for question 17: the question says "professional role at a major telemedicine organization cited as predicting..." Kyle Zebley's title is Senior Vice President for public policy at the American Telemedicine Association. So the answer is his role: senior vice president for public policy.

Question 18: the public figure mentioned alongside Musk is Trump, so answer is Donald Trump.

Alright, I think that's all. Let's put them in order.
