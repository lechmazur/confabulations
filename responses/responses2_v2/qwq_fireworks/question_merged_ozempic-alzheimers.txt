Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. I need to be careful to only use the information from the article and answer exactly what's asked without making assumptions. Let's go through each question step by step.

1. **Question 1:** The VA database study's percentage reduction for liraglutide. Wait, the article mentions a VA study by Dr. Al-Aly where semaglutide users had a 10% decrease. The question asks about liraglutide, but the study refers to semaglutide. The liraglutide trial was the one with 200 patients presented at the Alzheimer's meeting. Since the VA study specifically mentions semaglutide, the answer for liraglutide here would be N/A because the VA study didn't mention liraglutide.

2. **Question 2:** Dr. Edison's research on semaglutide and brain regions. The article states that in his trial, patients on liraglutide (Victoza) had slower brain volume decline. Wait, the question says semaglutide, but the study mentioned used liraglutide. The article doesn't mention semaglutide in that trial. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the trial with 200 patients used liraglutide, but the question is about semaglutide. So N/A here too. Unless the question is mixing up the drugs. Wait, the article says Dr. Edison led a trial with liraglutide. The question asks about semaglutide. So answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Percentage of mice with complete reversal of tau. The article mentions some mouse studies reduced tau buildup, but no specific percentage given. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Months required in Dr. Al-Aly's study for significance. The article says the VA study found a 10% decrease over three years. But the question is about when the effects became significant. The article doesn't specify the time frame needed, just the overall result over three years. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Hippocampal insulin signaling improvement with Wegovy. The article mentions improved insulin signaling in the brain in animals, but no specific numbers for human trials or Wegovy. Wegovy is semaglutide for weight loss, but the Imperial trial used liraglutide. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Neurotransmitter increase in Skibicka's rodent studies. The article doesn't mention neurotransmitter levels. It talks about inflammation and insulin signaling, but not specific neurotransmitters. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Cognitive score difference at 18 months. The trial with 200 patients (liraglutide) showed slower decline, but no specific score difference mentioned. The article doesn't give numbers here. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Mice with complete prevention. The early studies suggested prevention/reversal in mice, but no exact percentage. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Optimal semaglutide concentration for BBB. The article says some drugs have mixed data, but doesn't give a specific concentration. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Protein alongside tau reduced in mice. The article mentions tau reduction in mice studies, but another protein? It says "reduces the buildup of the protein tau" and mentions "other mechanisms", but no other protein named. So maybe N/A, unless amyloid? Wait, the text says "reduces the buildup of the protein tau", so no other protein mentioned. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** GLP-1 drug in 200-patient trial. The trial with 200 patients used liraglutide (Victoza). So answer is liraglutide.

12. **Question 12:** VA study's semaglutide Alzheimer's risk reduction. The VA study found a roughly 10% decrease. So answer is 10%.

13. **Question 13:** Metabolic condition improved via hippocampal insulin. The article says improving insulin signaling in the brain (hippocampus) could protect against neurodegeneration. The linked condition is diabetes/insulin resistance. So the condition is diabetes or insulin resistance. The question asks which metabolic condition is linked and improved. The article says "healthy insulin functioning is important for memory formation, and insulin resistance has been linked to Alzheimer's." So the answer is insulin resistance.

14. **Question 14:** Protein targeted by failed drugs besides tau. The article says "a few studies in mice have found that the medications can reduce the buildup of the protein tau... a variety of medications have tried to target tau and had mixed results." So the other protein isn't mentioned here. Wait, maybe amyloid? The article doesn't mention another protein. So N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Year of liraglutide trial presentation. The trial was presented last summer (article's publication date isn't given, but assuming it's recent). The article was written by Smith and Blum, but the exact year isn't stated. The question asks for the year, but the article only says "last summer". Without knowing the article's publication date, can't infer the year. So N/A.

16. **Question 16:** GLP-1 drug crossing BBB. The article mentions exenatide (Byetta) can access deeper brain regions like hippocampus, unlike semaglutide and liraglutide. So answer is exenatide.

17. **Question 17:** Non-Alzheimer's neurodegenerative disease reduced in GLP-1 users. The article's observational study mentions dementia, but not another specific disease. So N/A.

18. **Question 18:** Dr. Edison's primary mechanism beyond metabolism. The article says "the drug is not only working on the insulin resistance. It's clearly working on the other mechanisms." But the question asks for the primary mechanism beyond metabolic. The article doesn't specify which other mechanism. So N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Obesity medication with resolved shortage. The article says the shortage of tirzepatide (in Zepbound and Mounjaro) ended. So answer is tirzepatide.

20. **Question 20:** Brain structure targeted by exenatide but not semaglutide. The article says exenatide can reach the hippocampus, while semaglutide and liraglutide have mixed data. So hippocampus.
