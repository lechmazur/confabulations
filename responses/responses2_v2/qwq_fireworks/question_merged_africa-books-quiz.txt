Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked and avoid any external knowledge.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks which Nigerian author won a Nobel Prize and published a novel about twins in Addis Ababa. Looking at the article, Nigeria's prominent writers include Chinua Achebe, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and Wole Soyinka, who is a Nobel laureate. The novel "Cutting for Stone" by Abraham Verghese is set in Addis Ababa (Ethiopia's capital). But the question specifies a Nigerian author. Since Soyinka is Nigerian and Nobel-winning, but the novel mentioned with Addis Ababa is by Verghese, who isn't Nigerian, maybe there's a mix-up here. Wait, the article says Nigeria has authors like Soyinka. The twin novel is "Cutting for Stone" by Verghese, but he's not Nigerian. So perhaps the answer is N/A because no Nigerian author is mentioned with both the Nobel and that novel. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The article mentions Nigeria's authors including Wole Soyinka (Nobel) but the novel in Addis is by Verghese, who's Ethiopian? Wait, the article says "Abraham Verghese's 2009 novel 'Cutting for Stone'... opens in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia." So Verghese isn't Nigerian. The question is asking for a Nigerian author with both. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Years between the political events in Hisham Matar's novel (1979) and the leader's removal (2011). 2011 minus 1979 is 32 years.

3. **Question 3**: The article mentions a "new ecosystem of publishers, bookstores, literary magazines and festivals" promoting African writers. But it doesn't name a specific magazine. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: South Korean author Han Kang's novel "We Do Not Part" is mentioned alongside Scott Turow's "Presumed Guilty." The article states Turow's new book is "Presumed Guilty." Han Kang's work was published the same year? The article doesn't specify the year of "We Do Not Part" or Turow's book. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Chimamanda Adichie's novelsâ€”like "Half of a Yellow Sun" is set in Nigeria. The article mentions Nigeria's authors include her. The Gold Coast refers to Ghana, but the question is about Adichie. Since she's Nigerian, the original colonial name for Nigeria wasn't mentioned. The article says the Gold Coast became Ghana in 1957. So Adichie's novels aren't set there. So maybe N/A? Wait, the question is asking the original colonial name of the region where Adichie's novels are set. Since her novels are in Nigeria, which wasn't called the Gold Coast. The Gold Coast is Ghana. So answer N/A because the article doesn't mention Nigeria's colonial name here.

6. **Question 6**: "We Need New Names" by NoViolet Bulawayo's protagonist moves to the American Midwest. The article says "moves to the American Midwest to live with an aunt." So the state isn't specified. The Midwest includes multiple states, but the question asks for the state. Since the article doesn't specify which state, answer N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The novel's setting is 2013 (publication year), but the protagonist's move is in the story. The article says the book is about a young girl in 2013. The question is when she experienced culture shock. The story's timeline isn't given as a specific year, so N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Nigerian authors with Nobel Prize mentioned: Wole Soyinka. The article lists him as a Nobel laureate. Are there others? The list includes him and others, but only Soyinka has the Nobel. So answer 1.

9. **Question 9**: Nnedi Okorafor's autobiographical novel is mentioned as her most autobiographical, titled "Akata Witch"? Wait, the article says "her most autobiographical novel yet" but doesn't name it. The title given is "We Do Not Part" for Han Kang. Wait, the article says: "Nnedi Okorafor... explores a traumatic event in her most autobiographical novel yet." The name isn't provided here. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The article mentions festivals as part of the publishing renaissance but doesn't name any. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The novel by Hisham Matar is set in Libya (question 2's answer was Libya). The leader ousted in 2011 was Gaddafi. So the country is Libya. The question asks which North African country this parallels. So Libya.

12. **Question 12**: The country repeatedly mentioned as a cradle for authors is Nigeria, as the first paragraph lists its writers.

13. **Question 13**: Same as question 2's novel, so Libya.

14. **Question 14**: The country with borders touching South Africa and Botswana is Zimbabwe (from question 3's hint). So the answer is Zimbabwe, but the question is asking which country the setting implies when the protagonist leaves there. The first part is in Zimbabwe, so the country is Zimbabwe. Wait, the question says "after leaving Zimbabwe" so the protagonist is in the Midwest, so the country they left is Zimbabwe. The question's answer is Zimbabwe.

15. **Question 15**: The novel opening in Addis Ababa is Ethiopia.

16. **Question 16**: The Gold Coast became Ghana in 1957.

17. **Question 17**: The aging courtroom character is Rusty Sabich by Scott Turow, whose new book is "Presumed Guilty." So the author is Scott Turow.

18. **Question 18**: The country with Achebe and Adichie is Nigeria.

19. **Question 19**: The author delving into atrocities is Han Kang with "We Do Not Part."

20. **Question 20**: The debut novel set in 1979 under an oppressive regime is Hisham Matar's "In the Country of Men."

2. 2011-1979 = 32.
