Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and avoid any external knowledge. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The song by Petula Clark is mentioned in the article when describing Mady. It says he's a "Petula Clark-loving Mady." However, the specific song during the chase scene isn't named. The article doesn't mention the title of any particular song, just that he loves her. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The article mentions Brussels' settings like bodegas, brothels, and boites, but there's no specific historical monument named as the backdrop for the final confrontation. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The protest mentioned is the Black Lives Matter protests. The question asks for one unrelated, but the text only references BLM. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: No mention of a cameo from Blanchart's previous films. N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The article doesn't mention Mady's brother co-founding an organization. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The article doesn't reference a 1970s political movement. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The character noted for admiring Petula Clark is Mady. The question asks who undergoes a change amid riots. The article says Mady undergoes an action-hero transformation. So answer is Mady.

8. **Question 8**: The woman with a conflicted conscience and nervous energy is Claire, who leaves the apartment unlocked and doesn't pay. So Claire.

9. **Question 9**: The city portrayed is Brussels. The article states "Belgian capital is a gritty nocturnal playground."

10. **Question 10**: The gang leader is Romain Duris, mentioned as leading a vicious gang. The answer is Romain Duris.

11. **Question 11**: Mady becomes an action hero overnight. The article says he's forced into an action-hero transformation. So "action hero" or similar.

12. **Question 12**: The urban atmosphere with bodegas, etc., mirrors Mady's transformation. The article says the city's nooks and crannies are part of the crime-action setting. The portrayal mirrors his transformation, so the answer is the city's setting (Brussels), but the question asks for the portrayal's name. Since there's no title, maybe the description itself? Wait, the question says "which portrayal..." but the article doesn't name it. So N/A?

Wait, the question is phrased as "which portrayal of urban atmosphere...", but the article describes it as "gritty nocturnal playground of bodegas, brothels and boites." The answer might be the city's portrayal as such. But the question asks for a title or name? The article doesn't give it a specific name. So N/A.

13. **Question 13**: The movement interwoven is Black Lives Matter, even though it's not a message film. The article says realities that sparked BLM are used. So answer is Black Lives Matter.

14. **Question 14**: The order is first Claire doesn't pay, then the neo-Nazi confrontation. The article says "Claire never settles her bill, but... neo-Nazi brute... pulls another rug..." So the non-payment comes first. Answer: abandonment of payment first.

15. **Question 15**: The director is Michiel Blanchart. The article says "Michiel Blanchart" directed "Night Call."

16. **Question 16**: The performer with Y2K-era MTV pranks is Tom Green, mentioned in the last section. So Tom Green.

Now, let me check each again for accuracy based on the article text.

1. N/A (no song title)
2. N/A (no monument)
3. N/A (only BLM mentioned)
4. N/A (no cameo mentioned)
5. N/A (no org name)
6. N/A (no 70s movement)
7. Mady (he's the one who loves Petula Clark and transforms)
8. Claire
9. Brussels
10. Romain Duris
11. Action hero (the article says "action-hero transformation")
12. N/A (no named portrayal)
13. Black Lives Matter
14. Abandonment of payment first (Claire's non-payment comes first in the sequence)
15. Michiel Blanchart
16. Tom Green

Yes, that seems correct. Now format the answers accordingly.
