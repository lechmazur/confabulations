Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any external knowledge. Let's start with the first question.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which major grocery chain first reported empty egg shelves in December 2023, prompting others to implement purchase limits. Scanning the article, the earliest mention of empty shelves is from Laura Modrell's experience in early January at Walmart in Missouri. The article mentions Walmart specifically here. However, the date here is January, not December 2023. The question specifies December 2023, but the article's context is around January (the article was written in early January, as mentioned in the first paragraph). There's no mention of December 2023 events here. So maybe the answer is N/A because the timing doesn't match. Wait, the article says "in early January" but maybe the outbreak intensified in the last three months prior. Let me check again. The article says "More than 30 million chickens... have been killed in just the last three months, to prevent the spread of the disease." The article was written in January 2024, so the three months before would be October-December 2023. But the empty shelves Laura saw were in January. The question is about December 2023. The article doesn't mention any specific grocery chain reporting empty shelves in December. The first report mentioned is Walmart in January. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Tracy Ramsdell indicated the time to restore normal operations after USDA protocols. The article states that the Ramsdells had an outbreak in December leading to loss of 40k chickens, and it would take at least six months to repopulate. The question is about the time after implementing USDA's recommended biosecurity protocols. The answer here is six months. So the answer is 6.

3. **Question 3:** The average wholesale price before the increase. The article says "wholesale prices... up from $2.25 last fall, according to Expana." The question asks for the summer months before the increase. Since the price last fall (which would be around September-November 2023) was $2.25, but summer is before that. However, the article doesn't mention the summer price, only that the current price is $7, up from $2.25 last fall. So the summer price isn't specified. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Which state's agriculture department implemented a 10-mile quarantine. The article mentions Georgia's agriculture department creating a 6.2-mile quarantine around two farms in northern Georgia. The question says 10-mile, but the article says 6.2. So that's a discrepancy. Therefore, the answer is N/A because the exact figure doesn't match.

5. **Question 5:** How many turkey farms were affected before H5N1 spread to egg-laying operations. The article says turkey operations have reported cases, but there's no specific number given. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Percentage of ShopRite's egg inventory from alternative suppliers. The article mentions Wakefern (which includes ShopRite) tried to maintain prices but no specific percentage is given. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** When did Counterspace's owner first notice supply issues. The article says Sarah Joy Hays noticed prices climbing sharply after her distributor quoted $7.86, and before Thanksgiving she was paying under $2. The "before Thanksgiving" part is when she was paying less, but when did the disruption start? The article says "After her distributor quoted a price of $7.86..." but the exact timing isn't given except that it was after Thanksgiving (since she went to Sam's Club after that). The question asks when she first noticed, which would be when prices began climbing, which the article says was after Thanksgiving. So the answer is "After Thanksgiving" but the question asks for a specific time. The article doesn't specify a month or exact date, just "after Thanksgiving". Since the question is about when she first noticed, the answer is "After Thanksgiving" but the instructions say to use exact info. However, the question might be expecting a month. The article was written in early January, so maybe late 2023. But the exact answer from the text is "after Thanksgiving". The question might expect the answer as "after Thanksgiving", but the format requires a direct answer. The article says "Before Thanksgiving, Sarah Joy Hays... was paying less than $2... But then prices began to climb sharply." So the disruption started after Thanksgiving. The answer is "After Thanksgiving".

Wait, but the question is phrased as "When did the Counterspace bakery owner first notice significant disruptions..." So the answer is "after Thanksgiving". However, the instructions say to use the exact wording from the text. The article says "But then prices began to climb sharply." The "then" refers to after Thanksgiving. So the answer is "After Thanksgiving". But the question might expect a specific month? The article doesn't give a month, so the answer should be "After Thanksgiving".

8. **Question 8:** Number of vaccination trials before USDA said vaccines ineffective. The article states "the USDA said none of the vaccines available on the market matched the current virulent strain..." but doesn't mention how many trials were conducted. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Total financial compensation from federal indemnification. The article says the federal government makes indemnification payments for destroyed birds, but the total amount isn't specified. Tracy Ramsdell mentions her farm will still have losses, but the total compensation isn't given. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Which international markets suspended imports due to vaccinated birds. The article mentions that vaccines could affect exports because "different countries have different standards" and that the USDA's available vaccines don't match the strain. However, there's no specific mention of which markets actually suspended imports. So N/A.
