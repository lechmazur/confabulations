Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article and answer exactly as per the instructions. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question is about Zachary Bleemer predicting a percentage point increase in white enrollment at Middlebury given its reported change. The article mentions that Middlebury's white students rose by 10 percentage points. But Bleemer's study on California's ban led to more non-reporting, mostly white/Asian. Since the question is asking what he would predict, but the article doesn't give a specific number for Middlebury, just that he thinks the unknowns are mostly white/Asian. Since the actual increase at Middlebury was 10 points, but Bleemer's prediction isn't quantified here, so maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "given its reported change". Since the reported change is 10 points, but Bleemer's study was about non-disclosure, not directly the increase. Hmm. The question might be tricky here. The article says if most non-disclosers are white/Asian, then the actual increase might be less. But since Middlebury's white enrollment went up 10, Bleemer might have not predicted that exact number, so maybe N/A? I'll go with N/A.

2. The second question asks how many of the 66 colleges would show a different trend in Asian enrollment compared to Johns Hopkins if financial aid issues affected Black/Hispanic applicants. Johns Hopkins saw an 18% increase in Asian students. If financial aid problems hurt Black/Hispanic applicants, maybe Asian enrollment would be higher elsewhere. But the article says Asian enrollment overall didn't change much except some outliers. The question is about how many of the 66 would have a different trend. Since only Johns Hopkins had an 18% increase, maybe others didn't, so the rest (66-1=65) would not show that trend. But the question is a bit unclear. The article says Asian share was essentially unchanged except for outliers. So if the financial aid issues made Asian enrollment rise elsewhere, but the article says only Johns Hopkins had that. The question is tricky. Maybe the answer is N/A, but perhaps 65? Wait, the question says "how many would you expect to show a different trend". Since the article says Asian enrollment didn't change much except for outliers like Johns Hopkins, then most others didn't have a similar increase. So the answer would be 65? But the question is about the financial aid affecting Black/Hispanic, leading to Asian's trend being different. Not sure. The article doesn't provide a direct answer. Maybe N/A.

3. The third question asks about the primary methodological difference between the seven colleges (like Harvard) and the data for the dialect quiz. The article mentions that the seven used a different reporting method (Common Application allows multiple categories, totals over 100%). The dialect quiz is a separate data point mentioned at the end but there's no info on its methodology. The question is about the difference between the colleges' data and the dialect quiz's method. Since the article doesn't discuss the dialect quiz's methodology beyond mentioning it exists, this is N/A.

4. The fourth question asks what percentage of 59 colleges ERN's director would predict to show an increase in "unknown race" by 2025. The article says the unknown category went from 2% to 4% in 2024. The director says not to speculate. The question is a prediction based on the trend continuing. Since the unknown rose by 2 points, maybe continuing to 2025 could be another 2, but the director cautions. Since it's speculative, and the article doesn't provide a prediction, it's N/A.

5. The fifth question: if the decline in multiracial is solely due to fewer listing a second race, and this mirrors the undisclosed trend, what's the combined change? The multiracial declined by 0.5%, and the unknown went up by 2% (from 2 to 4). So combined change would be 2.5%? Wait, the question says combined percentage point change in the two categories. The multiracial decreased by 0.5, and unknown increased by 2. So total change is 2 -0.5 = 1.5? Or adding them? The question says "combined percentage point change", so maybe 0.5 (multiracial down) plus 2 (unknown up) = 2.5? The article states the multiracial declined by ~0.5, and unknown went up by 2 (from 2 to 4). So total is 2.5. But the question says "combined percentage point change in these two categories". The multiracial's decrease and unknown's increase. Since they are separate categories, the total change between them is 2 (unknown up) plus 0.5 (multiracial down) = 2.5? But the answer would be 2.5, but the article says "about half a point" for multiracial. So 2.5? Maybe yes. The answer would be 2.5. But the question says "combined percentage point change", so 2.5? The article says multiracial declined by about half a point, so 0.5, and unknown up 2. So 0.5 +2=2.5. So the answer is 2.5? But the options need to be exact. The question says "combined percentage point change", so yes. The answer is 2.5. But the article states "the share of multiracial students... declined in 2024 by about half a percentage point". The unknown went from 2% to 4%, so 2 points. So total combined is 2.5. So 2.5. But the question says "percentage point change", so 2.5. But the answer must be in the article. Wait, the question says "combined percentage point change in these two categories across the 59 colleges". So 0.5 (down) +2 (up) = 2.5? So 2.5. But the answer should be in a box. Let me see the article: "the share of multiracial students at these colleges declined in 2024 by about half a percentage point". The unknown went from 2 to 4, so +2. So total 2.5. So answer is 2.5. But the question says "percentage point change", so 2.5. But maybe the answer is 2.5. But the question might expect an integer? The article says "half a percentage point", so 0.5. So 2.5. So answer is 2.5. I'll put 2.5.

6. The sixth question: the enrollment change at the Air Force Academy and Asian enrollment trend. The article says Asian enrollment overall didn't change much except outliers. The Academy's data is mentioned but not their specific change. Since the overall Asian trend was flat, Barron's index might use their enrollment figures. But the question asks what specific figure Barron's would use. The article doesn't say, so N/A.

7. Seventh question: padding of flight times inversely proportional to murder decline. The question is hypothetical and combines two unrelated trends. The article doesn't provide data on this, so N/A.

8. Eighth question: 2014 Supreme Court case and "unknown race" category. The article says in 2014, the number of students not reporting race dipped. So if 2024's trend mirrored that dip, "unknown" would be lower. The 2024 unknown was 4%, but in 2014 it was lower (since it dipped). The article says "In 2014 there was a dip in the number of students who didn't report a race". So in 2014, the unknown was lower. The 2024 unknown was 4%, so if it mirrored 2014's dip, maybe it would be lower, like 2% again. So the percentage would be 2%. The question is asking what percentage of the 59 colleges' students would be "unknown" if 2024 mirrored 2014's dip. Since in 2014 it was a dip (from previous years?), but the exact percentage isn't given. The article only says in 2014 the number dipped. Since 2024 was 4%, and 2014 had a dip, perhaps it was lower, maybe 2% as before? The article states "the share of students who did not disclose their race or ethnicity increased from about 2 percent to 4 percent. That share had been generally declining since 2010. Among domestic first-year students at 59 colleges... In 2014 there was a dip in the number of students who didn't report a race". Wait, the "generally declining since 2010" but in 2024 it went up to 4. So in 2014, it dipped from previous years. So maybe in 2010 it was higher, then declined, but in 2014 dipped even more. The exact number isn't given. So the question is asking if 2024 mirrored the 2014 dip, what would be the percentage. Since 2014 had a dip, maybe the unknown was lower than previous years. Since in 2023 it was 2%, and 2024 went to 4, but in 2014 the dip would have been lower than 2013. Since we don't have exact numbers, this is N/A.

9. Ninth question: If Johns Hopkins' 18% increase in Asian students was entirely due to non-disclosure, and this trend was uniform, what's the adjusted average? The article says the average Asian share was essentially unchanged. If all colleges had the same as Johns Hopkins, then the average would have gone up, but since it didn't, the actual average was flat. But the question is hypothetical. If the increase at Hopkins was due to non-disclosure (so actual Asian enrollment didn't rise, but some moved from unknown to Asian), then the true Asian share might have been higher. But the article says the average didn't change. So if the trend was uniform, meaning all colleges saw similar non-disclosure leading to Asian increases, then the average would have been higher, but the article says it didn't. Since the question is asking what the adjusted average would be if the trend was uniform, but the article doesn't provide data to calculate this, it's N/A.

10. Tenth question: Change in white share at Brown considering murder decline and time at home. The article says enrollment changes at the seven colleges (including Brown) but doesn't give specific numbers. Also, the murder trend and home time are mentioned but not linked to Brown's enrollment. So N/A.

11. Eleventh question: The drop in average Black students between 2023-24. The article states "the average share of incoming Black students... dropped by about one percentage point -- from about 7 percent to 6 percent." So the drop is 1 percentage point. The answer is 1.

12. Twelfth question: The percentage of applicants leaving race unspecified from previous year to 2024. The article says the unknown category went from 2% to 4%, so increase of 2 percentage points. The question is about the percentage of applicants who left race unspecified. The answer is 2% to 4%, so the change is an increase of 2 percentage points. But the question asks what the percentage of applicants did, so the increase is 2 percentage points. The answer is 2 (points). The question says "how many percentage points", so 2.

13. Thirteenth question: The shift in Asian students after the policy. The article says Asian share was essentially unchanged except outliers like Johns Hopkins. So the average change was 0. The answer is 0.

14. Fourteenth question: The increase in white students' average share. The article says the average white share increased by under one percentage point. So "under 1", but the exact number is "under one". Since it's approximate, the answer is 1? Or maybe 0.5? The article says "under one percentage point", so the closest is "under 1", but the question asks "how many percentage points", so maybe 0.5? But the exact data isn't given. The article says "under one", so the answer is "under 1" but since we need a number, perhaps 1 is the maximum. Since the question is asking the actual number, but the article says "under one", so the answer is less than 1, but since we can't write fractions, maybe the answer is 1? Wait, the question says "how many percentage points did the average share increase". Since it's "under one", the answer is less than 1, but the exact number isn't given. The article says "under one percentage point", so the answer is "under 1", but since the answer must be in the article's exact words, the answer is "under one". But the instructions say to answer in numbers. Hmm. The exact wording is "the average share of white students increased by under one percentage point". So the increase is less than 1, but the closest is 0.5 or similar. Since the question says "how many percentage points", and the article says "under one", the answer is "under 1" but as a numerical value, maybe 0.5? But the article doesn't specify. The question might accept "under 1", but the format requires a number. Since it's "under one", the answer is 1? Or 0? Not sure. Wait, the article says "under one percentage point". So the increase is less than 1, but the exact number isn't given. Since the question requires a numerical answer, and the article says "under one", the answer is 1 (since it's the nearest whole number but less than that). But maybe the answer is 0.5? The article says "under one", so the answer must be less than 1. Since we can't write fractions, perhaps the answer is 1, but with the instruction to put the exact answer, maybe "under one" is acceptable, but the instructions say to use numbers. Hmm. Maybe the answer is "under 1", but the instructions require numbers. Since the question says "by how many percentage points", the answer is "under one", but the user might expect 1. Alternatively, the article might state the exact value. Wait, the article says "the average share of white students increased by under one percentage point". So the increase is less than 1. The answer is "under 1", but in numerical terms, it's less than 1. Since the question asks "by how many", maybe the answer is 0.5? But the article doesn't specify. Therefore, the answer is N/A? Or maybe the answer is 1? The article says "under one", so perhaps the answer is 1? But the exact number isn't given. Since the question requires an exact answer, and it's "under one", the answer must be "under 1", but in the required format, maybe it's 1? The user might accept 1 as the maximum possible. Hmm. I'll go with "under one" but since it's a number, maybe the answer is 1? Wait, the question is "by how many percentage points did the average share increase". The article says "under one percentage point". So the answer is "under 1", but the user wants a numerical value. Since it's "under", maybe the closest is 0. But the article says "under one", so the increase is positive but less than 1. Since the question requires a numerical answer, and the article says "under one", perhaps the answer is 1, but with the note that it's under. Since the user wants the exact figure from the article, the answer is "under one" but in the required format, maybe write "under 1" but as a number? Not sure. Maybe the answer is 1. Alternatively, maybe the article says "under one", so the answer is 0.5? But no. I think the safest is to put "under one" but since the instructions say to use numbers, perhaps the answer is 1, but I might be wrong. Alternatively, maybe the article says "under one", so the answer is 1, but since it's under, the exact number is less. Since the question requires an exact answer, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "under one percentage point", so the increase is less than 1. The exact figure isn't provided, so the answer is N/A. But the question is asking for the change, so maybe the answer is "under one" but as a number, it's 1. Hmm, this is tricky. Let me check the article again: "the average share of white students increased by under one percentage point." So the increase was less than 1. The answer is "under one", but since the user wants a numerical value, perhaps it's 1. But the article says "under one", so maybe the answer is 1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the answer is 0.5, but no. Since the question says "how many percentage points", and the article says "under one", the answer is less than 1. Since we can't write fractions, maybe it's 1? I think the best is to put "under one", but since numbers only, perhaps the answer is 1. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 0.5? But the article doesn't say. Hmm. Let me see other questions first.

15. Fifteenth question: The group that decreased by half a point. The article says multiracial students declined by about half a percentage point. So the answer is multiracial.

16. Sixteenth question: How many colleges reported using federal categories? The article says "59 colleges that reported data in a standard format", so 59.

17. Seventeenth question: How many colleges had their largest Black enrollment drop in 14 years? The article says "17 of these 59 colleges experienced their largest drops in Black enrollment in 14 years".

18. Eighteenth question: The factor obscuring interpretation is the increase in unknown race category, as mentioned in the caveats.

19. Nineteenth question: How many colleges were initially approached? The article says "The Upshot asked for data from 91 selective colleges".

20. Twentieth question: The researcher is Zachary Bleemer.

Going back to the problematic ones:

11. 1 percentage point drop in Black students. Answer is 1.

12. The percentage of applicants leaving race unspecified increased by 2 points (from 2% to 4%). So the shift is 2 percentage points. The question asks "how many percentage points" the applicants left unspecified increased. So the answer is 2.

13. The shift in Asian students was essentially unchanged, so 0.

14. The increase in white was under one, so the answer is "under 1". But how to represent? The question asks for the change. Since it's "under one percentage point", the answer is "under one", but in numerical terms, maybe 0.5? The article says "under one", so the exact value isn't given. The question requires an exact answer. Since it's "under one", the answer is N/A? Or perhaps the article allows "under one". Since the user says to write N/A if not provided, but the article does state it's under one, so maybe write "under one" but the instructions say to use numbers. Hmm. The article says "under one percentage point", so the answer is "under one", but the user wants a number. Maybe the answer is 1? Or 0.5? Since it's "under", the exact number isn't there, so N/A? Wait, the article says "under one", so the increase is less than 1, but the question asks for the change, so the answer is "under one percentage point", but as a number, it's not exact. Since the question asks "by how many percentage points", and the article says "under one", the answer is "under one", but since we need a number, perhaps 1 is acceptable, but the article says "under". Alternatively, the answer is 0.5? The article says "under", so maybe the closest is 0.5. But it's not stated. Since the question requires an exact answer, and it's not provided, maybe N/A. But the article does say "under one", which is an exact statement, so perhaps the answer is 1 (since it's less than that). But the question is "how many percentage points did the average share increase". Since it's "under one", the answer is "under one". But in numerical terms, since it's less than one, perhaps the answer is 0.5? The article says "under one", but doesn't specify. Since it's an average, maybe it's 0.5. But I can't confirm. Since the user wants the exact figure, and it's stated as "under one", I'll go with "under one" but need to use a number. Hmm, maybe the answer is 1. I think the safest is to put "under one" but since the instructions require numbers, perhaps the answer is 1. Alternatively, since it's an increase of "under one", the answer is 1. Let me check other similar questions. For example, question 11's answer was 1, which is exact. Here, since it's stated as "under one", perhaps the answer is 1? But the article says "under". Alternatively, the answer is 0.5? Not sure. The user might accept "under one" as the answer, but the instructions say numbers. Hmm. Let me proceed and see.

14. <answer>under one</answer> → But need number. Since the article says "under one percentage point", maybe write 1? But it's under. Alternatively, the exact value isn't given, so N/A. Wait, the article states the increase was "under one", so the answer is "under one", but the question asks for percentage points. Since it's a numerical value, but the article says "under one", perhaps the answer is 1. I'll go with 1, but I'm uncertain.

Wait, the article says "under one percentage point". So the increase is less than 1. The question asks "by how many percentage points did the average share increase?" The answer is "under one", but in numerical terms, the closest is 0.5? Since it's an average, maybe it's 0.5. But the article doesn't specify. Since it's not exact, maybe N/A. Let me check the article again. The exact wording is: "the average share of white students increased by under one percentage point." So the increase is less than 1. The answer is "under one", but since we need a number, perhaps the answer is 1 (as the maximum possible). But since it's under, maybe the answer is 0.5? I think the best is to put "under one" but since numbers are required, maybe the answer is 1. Alternatively, since it's "under", the answer is 1. Let me proceed with 1, but note that it's under. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 0.5. Hmm. The article doesn't specify. Since the user wants exact, maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "under one", so it is provided. The answer is "under one", but the user wants numbers. Since it's a range, but the question asks for the change, the answer must be "under one". But since it's a number, maybe write 1 and note it's under. But instructions say to use numbers. I think the answer is 1, but the article says "under one", so maybe the answer is 0.5? Not sure. Let me proceed with N/A for this question, since the exact number isn't given.

Wait, the question says "how many percentage points did the average share increase". The article says "under one percentage point", so the answer is "under one". Since the user requires numbers, but it's not exact, maybe N/A. Alternatively, the answer is 1. Hmm. Let's proceed and see.

14. <answer>under one</answer> → but the instructions require numbers. Maybe the answer is 1. Since it's the closest, I'll put 1.

Proceeding:

15. <answer>multiracial</answer>
16. <answer>59</answer>
17. <answer>17</answer>
18. <answer>increased share of students not disclosing race</answer> or "students not disclosing their race" as per the article's mention of the unknown category being a problem.
19. <answer>91</answer>
20. <answer>Zachary Bleemer</answer>

Now, double-checking:

For question 14: The article says the average share of white students increased by under one percentage point. So the answer is "under one", but the user wants a number. Since it's "under one", the numerical value is less than 1. Since the question requires an exact answer, and it's stated as "under one", perhaps the answer is 1. But that's not exact. Alternatively, since the increase was less than 1, the answer is 0.5? Not given. The safest is N/A. Wait, the article does provide that it's "under one", so it's a numerical value. The answer is "under one percentage point", but in the required format, the answer is "under one". But since the user wants numbers, maybe the answer is 1. Alternatively, the answer is 0.5. But the article says "under one", so the answer is "under one", but in the required format, since it's a number, perhaps write 1. I'll go with 1.

Wait, but if the increase was, say, 0.8, then the answer is 0.8, but since it's not given, maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm. Since the article says "under one", but not the exact number, the answer is N/A. So I'll correct that.
