merged_mavis-gallant-uncollected-stories.txt
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and don't bring in any outside knowledge.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which New York publishing house rejected "Virus X" before it was bought for $6,000. The article mentions that "Virus X" turned into a liberating $6,000, but it doesn't specify which publisher initially rejected it. Since there's no info on rejection, the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many months Gallant taught at a convent school before moving to Paris. The text says she was sent to a convent school at age 4, but it doesn't mention her teaching there. Wait, actually, the article states "Born in Montreal, Gallant was sent away to a convent school at the age of 4." So she was a student, not a teacher. The question is about teaching, which isn't mentioned. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The title of the essay she wrote about Sartre's conversation. The article mentions her conversation with Sartre at a news conference, but there's no title given for an essay she wrote about it. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Character who converted currencies based on hotel rooms. The article says characters were buffeted by fluctuating currencies and mentions "A Day Like Any Other" where a mother dresses her daughters in frocks "made to order wherever a favorable exchange prevailed." But the question asks for a character who used hotel rooms. I don't see that specific detail. Maybe "Virus X" has Lottie and Vera in Alsace? The story "Virus X" is mentioned, but the exact system isn't detailed. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Medical condition that led to Maxwell's letters. The article says she endured ill health alone, but doesn't specify the condition. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Canadian critic comparing her to existentialism. The article doesn't name a critic who made that comparison. The author here connects her to existentialism but doesn't cite a critic. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Boardinghouse owner's name in Montreal. The article talks about boardinghouses but doesn't name a specific owner. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** How her mother explained her father's absence. The text states "Her mother once declined to visit her in the hospital because it was raining. Her father died when she was 10; she was told he'd gone to England." Wait, the question is about the explanation before revealing the truth. The article says she was told he'd gone to England. So the answer is "he'd gone to England."

9. **Question 9:** Which story won O. Henry Award. The article mentions The New Yorker published 116 stories but doesn't mention an O. Henry winner. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Exchange rate between pawned items and meals. The article says she pawned belongings to survive, a traded clock equaled breakfast. So maybe 1 clock = 1 meal? The exact rate isn't stated beyond that example. The question might be looking for that ratio. The answer could be "1 clock for breakfast" but the question asks for exchange rate. Since it's a specific rate (like 1 item = X meals), the article says "a traded clock equaled breakfast," so perhaps 1:1? But the question wants the rate from her diary. Since it's only mentioned once, maybe the answer is "1 clock for breakfast." But the question asks for the rate, so maybe "1 item per meal" but the exact wording in the text is "a traded clock equaled breakfast." So the answer is "1 clock for breakfast." But the question might want a numerical rate. Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A because it's not specified beyond that example. Hmm. The article states "a traded clock equaled breakfast," so the exchange rate is 1 clock = 1 breakfast. So maybe "1 clock for breakfast." But the question says "exchange rate between pawned belongings and meals"â€”so maybe the answer is "1 clock for breakfast" but phrased as a rate. Since the question asks for the exchange rate, perhaps the answer is "1 clock for a meal" but I'll check the exact wording again. The text says "a traded clock equaled breakfast." So the answer is "1 clock for breakfast." But the question might be expecting a numerical value like "1:1" but the text doesn't state it as a rate beyond that example. Since the article only gives that one example, maybe it's the only info, so the answer is "1 clock for breakfast." But the question might need a numerical rate. Since it's not given beyond that, perhaps N/A. Wait, the question says "exchange rate between pawned belongings and meals that Gallant documented in her Paris diary during her first year abroad." The article only mentions that she pawned belongings to survive, and "a traded clock equaled breakfast." Since it's from her diary, maybe that's the example given. So the answer is "1 clock for breakfast." But the question might expect the rate in terms like "1 item = 1 meal," so perhaps "1 item per meal." Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A because it's not explicitly stated as an exchange rate beyond that single instance. Hmm. The article says "a traded clock equaled breakfast," which implies that one clock was exchanged for one meal (breakfast). So maybe the answer is "1 clock for breakfast" but phrased as a rate. Since the question asks for the exchange rate, maybe "1 clock equaled breakfast" but the answer needs to be in terms of rate. Since the exact rate isn't given beyond that example, perhaps the answer is N/A. I think the safest is N/A because it's an example, not a general rate.

11. **Question 11:** Existentialist philosopher's concept of "bad faith" reflected in characters reducing others to symbols. The article mentions Sartre's existentialism and how Gallant's characters reduce to symbols. Sartre is the philosopher associated with "bad faith." So the answer is "Sartre."

12. **Question 12:** Number of novels published. The article says "two novels, a play and essays," so the answer is "2."

13. **Question 13:** Title of the play. The article mentions "a play" but doesn't name it. So N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Year "A Day Like Any Other" appeared in The New Yorker. The article says The New Yorker published 116 stories over five decades but doesn't give specific years. So N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Literary award Maxwell suggested she deserved. The article says Maxwell wrote that there was no way to pay for the story under their payment system, and offered the magazine. No specific award mentioned. So N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Which historical event "Thieves and Rascals" allegorizes. The article mentions the story's protagonist has a slight headache and hunger, but the allegory isn't specified. Maybe WWII? But not stated. N/A.

17. **Question 17:** Character who mistook the Siegfried Line for Maginot. The article says Vera thought a moss-covered ruin was part of the Maginot Line. The Maginot Line was French, while Siegfried Line (Westwall) was German. The story says Vera thought it was Maginot, so the answer is "Vera."

18. **Question 18:** Age when her mother refused to visit due to rain. The article states "Her mother once declined to visit her in the hospital because it was raining." But her age at the time isn't given. She was sent to convent at 4, father died at 10. But the question is about the hospital visit refusal. Since the text doesn't specify her age then, N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Original title of her unpublished war correspondent manuscript. The article doesn't mention any unpublished manuscript. N/A.

20. **Question 20:** Story where a clock is traded for a train ticket to Alsace. The article mentions she pawned a clock for breakfast, and "Virus X" involves a trip to Alsace. The story "Virus X" might be the one. The question asks for the story title where a protagonist trades a clock for a train ticket. Since the article says "a traded clock equaled breakfast" (from her early survival), but the trip to Alsace in "Virus X" is with Vera. The clock trade isn't in that story's context as described. The article says "a traded clock equaled breakfast" in the early survival part, but the story "Virus X" is the one where they go to Alsace. Since the clock trade isn't linked to that story in the text, perhaps N/A. Alternatively, the question might be referring to that example's context. The article doesn't explicitly tie the clock trade to a story's plot. The answer might be "Virus X" but the article doesn't say she traded the clock for the trip. So N/A.
