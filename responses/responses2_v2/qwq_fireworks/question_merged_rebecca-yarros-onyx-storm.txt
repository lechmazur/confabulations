Okay, I need to go through each question and find the answers strictly from the article provided. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question asks which Taylor Swift song inspired the friendship bracelet exchange tradition at Rebecca Yarros's event. The article mentions that Annie Metcalf compared the bracelets to a Taylor Swift concert, but it doesn't mention a specific song. So the answer should be N/A because there's no song name given.

2. The central character with a debilitating condition enrolling in a dragon academy. The article says Violet is the protagonist with a chronic illness. So the answer is Violet.

3. The genetic connective tissue disorder the author has. The text mentions Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. That's the answer.

4. The publishing imprint. The article states the publisher is Entangled. So Entangled is the answer.

5. The primary purpose of the St. Paul event. The event was for the release of "Onyx Storm" and a fan gathering. The article says it's an event for Yarros's book, so the purpose is to celebrate the book release.

6. The tracking service for print sales. The article mentions BookScan with a 20-year history. So BookScan.

7. The author who overcame illness and stagnant sales. That's Rebecca Yarros herself. The article says she had 20 romance novels but shifted to the fantasy series.

8. The children's series with midnight parties. The article compares to Harry Potter and Twilight. The question specifies children's, so Harry Potter is the answer.

9. The novel that turned the Barnes & Noble employee into a fan. The employee picked up "Fourth Wing" and became an advocate. So the answer is Fourth Wing.

Wait, let me check each again to be sure.

1. The article says "handing out friendship bracelets like it was a Taylor Swift concert." No song name is given, so N/A is correct.

2. Yes, Violet is the character with the illness.

3. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is explicitly stated.

4. Publisher is Entangled.

5. The event was for the book release of "Onyx Storm," so the primary purpose is the book event.

6. BookScan is mentioned for tracking print sales over 20 years.

7. Rebecca Yarros is the author in question.

8. The article mentions "Harry Potter" and "Twilight" as having similar fervor. Since the question specifies children's, "Harry Potter" is the answer.

9. The employee picked up "Fourth Wing" and evangelized it, so that's the correct novel.

I think all answers are covered. Let me make sure none are missed and all are directly from the text. No inferences beyond what's stated. Looks good.
