Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information given and answer exactly what's asked without any extra fluff. Let me start with the first question.

1. **Question 1:** How did the Hannover State Opera's decision to stage "Echo 72" before the 50th anniversary commemorations affect the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper's coverage of the cultural impact?

The article mentions that Roman Deininger, a reporter from Suddeutsche Zeitung, coauthored a book about the attack and that the 50th anniversary started intense remembrance. However, there's no direct link stated between the opera's staging and the newspaper's coverage. So the answer here should be N/A.
