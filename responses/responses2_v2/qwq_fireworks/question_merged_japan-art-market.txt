Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly as per the instructions. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The percentage increase in the global art market between 2019-2023 according to Clare McAndrew's report. The article says Japan's market grew 11%, and the global market only 1%. So the answer here is 1%.

2. **Question 2**: Number of fruits in "Compose" and oranges in "More More (Leaky)". The article mentions "over 400 rotting oranges, watermelons, grapes and apples" for "Compose". But for "More More (Leaky)", it says the sculpture was inspired by subway repairs and included materials like plastic tubing, umbrellas, etc. There's no specific number of oranges in that sculpture. So the answer is N/A because the question asks how many oranges were used in the earlier piece, which isn't stated.

3. **Question 3**: The name of the punk band Yuko joined in the 1990s. The article says she was in an experimental punk band during college in the 2000s, not 1990s. So the time period is wrong. Answer N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Impressionist painter whose works Japanese corporations bought, similar to Van Gogh's Dr. Gachet. The article mentions Renoir, Monet, Cezanne as being bought during the bubble. Since Van Gogh's painting is an example of the peak, the answer would be one of those three. The question asks for the name of the painter whose work was regularly acquired, leading to the art market's transformation. The article lists Renoir, Monet, Cezanne. Since it's asking for a specific one, but the question says "similar to Van Gogh's...", maybe the example given here is Cezanne? Wait, the text says "Impressionist paintings by Renoir, Monet and Cezanne". So any of those three. The question is asking for one, but since it's "similar to Van Gogh's", but Van Gogh is a Post-Impressionist. The article says "those were the days when Japanese corporations regularly bought European treasures, helping transform the art market... A strong currency and a government campaign... led to jaw-dropping auction sales for Impressionist paintings by Renoir, Monet and Cezanne. The trend peaked with the 1990 sale of van Gogh's..." So the answer would be Renoir, Monet, or Cezanne. The question asks for the name of the painter whose work was regularly acquired. Since the question says "similar to Van Gogh's...", maybe it's Van Gogh himself? But Van Gogh's was the peak. The question is a bit confusing. Wait the question says "leading to the transformation of the art market into an investment vehicle, similar to Van Gogh's 'Portrait of Dr. Gachet'". So the corporations bought works by Renoir, Monet, Cezanne, which are the Impressionists. The question is asking for the name of the painter (Impressionist) whose works were regularly acquired. Since the options are Renoir, Monet, or Cezanne, the answer could be any of them, but the question asks for the specific one. Since the text lists all three, maybe the answer is Renoir, Monet, or Cezanne. But the question might expect one. Wait, the question says "similar to Van Gogh's...", but Van Gogh is Post-Impressionist. The question is phrased as "Impressionist painter's work... leading to the transformation... similar to Van Gogh's". Since Van Gogh's was the peak, but the question is about the regular acquisitions. The answer is one of the three. But since the question says "similar to Van Gogh's", perhaps it's Van Gogh? But Van Gogh isn't an Impressionist. The question might have a mistake, but according to the article, the answer is Renoir, Monet, or Cezanne. The question asks for the name of the painter, so maybe any of them. Let me check the exact wording. The question says "Impressionist painter's work, sold at the peak... leading to the transformation... similar to Van Gogh's". Wait, Van Gogh's sale was the peak. The corporations bought Renoir, Monet, Cezanne regularly. So the answer would be one of those three. Since the question is asking for a specific name, but the article lists all three, maybe the answer is N/A because it's multiple. But the question might expect one. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to Van Gogh, but that's incorrect. Since the article says "Impressionist paintings by Renoir, Monet and Cezanne", the answer is one of those. Since the question asks for "the name", perhaps the answer is Renoir, but I can't be sure. Wait, maybe the question is a trick. The answer is N/A because the question asks for the name of the painter, but the article lists three. Since the question says "the" (singular), but there are three, so N/A. Alternatively, perhaps it's referring to Van Gogh, but that's not Impressionist. Hmm, tricky. Maybe the answer is N/A because the question requires a specific name, but the article lists three, so you can't pick one. Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong. I'll go with N/A for now.

Wait, let me re-read the question: "Which Impressionist painter's work, sold at the peak of the Japanese bubble economy, did Japanese corporations regularly acquire, leading to the transformation of the art market into an investment vehicle, similar to Van Gogh's 'Portrait of Dr. Gachet'?" The peak sale was Van Gogh's, but corporations regularly bought Renoir, Monet, Cezanne. The question is asking for the Impressionist painter's work (so not Van Gogh, since he's Post-Impressionist). The answer would be one of the three, but since the question is singular, but the article lists all three, perhaps the answer is N/A because it's not specified which one. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting Van Gogh, but that's incorrect. Since the question says "similar to Van Gogh's", which was the peak, but the regular acquisitions were the others. Since the question is asking for the painter's work that corporations regularly acquired, leading to the transformation, the answer is one of Renoir, Monet, or Cezanne. Since the question requires a specific name, and the article lists all three, but the question says "the", it's ambiguous. Maybe the answer is N/A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick, and the answer is Van Gogh, but that's not an Impressionist. Hmm. I'll go with N/A here because the question requires a single painter's name, but the article lists three. Unless the answer expects one of them, but since the question says "the", maybe the answer is N/A.

Wait, the question says "similar to Van Gogh's", which was the peak, but the regular ones were Renoir, Monet, etc. Maybe the answer is Van Gogh? But that's not an Impressionist. The question is confusing. Since the article states "Japanese corporations regularly bought European treasures, helping transform the art market from a rich person's hobby into an investment vehicle. A strong currency and a government campaign... led to jaw-dropping auction sales for Impressionist paintings by Renoir, Monet and Cezanne. The trend peaked with the 1990 sale of van Gogh's..." So the regular acquisitions were Renoir, Monet, Cezanne. The question is asking for the Impressionist painter's work (so excluding Van Gogh), so the answer is one of the three. Since the question says "the", but there are three, the answer is N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Tax incentive proposed in 2021 by Hayashi's office, similar to the 2018 exemption. The article says in 2018, 80% exemption for inheritance tax if lent to museums for 5 years. In 2021, the rule was expanded to include contemporary art. So the 2021 proposal was expanding to contemporary art. The question asks for the specific tax incentive proposed in 2021. The answer is expanding the inheritance tax exemption to include contemporary art. But the question says "specific tax incentive... similar to the 2018 inheritance tax exemption". So the 2021 one was the same but including contemporary art. The answer would be the 2021 expansion. The question asks for the name of the incentive. The article says "the rule was expanded to include contemporary art". The specific name might be "expanding the inheritance tax exemption to contemporary art". But since the question asks for the name of the tax incentive, maybe it's the same as the 2018 one but extended. The answer is the 2021 expansion of the inheritance tax exemption to contemporary art. But the question says "specific tax incentive... proposed in 2021". The article says "in 2021, the rule was expanded to include contemporary art". So the answer is "expanding the inheritance tax exemption to contemporary art". But maybe the question expects the answer to be "inclusion of contemporary art in the inheritance tax exemption". Alternatively, the answer is "inclusion of contemporary art in the 2018 tax rule". Since the question asks for the name, maybe it's just "expanding to contemporary art". The article doesn't name it, so perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "specific tax incentive, similar to the 2018 inheritance tax exemption, did Yasuta Hayashi's office propose in 2021". The 2018 was an exemption for 80% if lent to museums. In 2021, they expanded it to include contemporary art. So the 2021 proposal was the expansion. The answer would be "expanding the inheritance tax exemption to include contemporary art". But since the question asks for the name of the tax incentive, perhaps it's called the 2021 inheritance tax rule expansion. Since the article doesn't give a specific name, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, the answer is "expanding the inheritance tax exemption to contemporary art" even if it's not named. The question might accept that as the answer. Let me check the article again: "in 2021, the rule was expanded to include contemporary art". So the specific tax incentive is the expansion to contemporary art. The answer would be "expanding the inheritance tax exemption to contemporary art".

6. **Question 6**: Major Japanese department store mentioned by Kyoko Hattori as similar to Pace Gallery. The article says: "Kyoko Hattori, who leads Pace Gallery's Tokyo outpost. 'The department stores would come to you... For wealthy people, it was like having your own butler.' But the department stores are a closed system..." However, the question asks for the name of the department store. The article doesn't mention a specific name. It just refers to department stores in general. So the answer is N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Title of the exhibition at MoCA Tokyo featuring Ryutaro's collection, including Side Core's works inspired by Three Mile Island? Wait the article says "Ryutaro Takahashi's collection, including works by Side Core, inspired by the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster." The question mentions Three Mile Island, which is a different disaster (1979 in the US). The article says Fukushima, so the answer is N/A because the question's premise is incorrect. The question asks about Three Mile Island, but the article mentions Fukushima. So answer N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Administrative task Takeo Obayashi primarily handled for Mohri's Venice Biennale, consuming majority time. The article says "70 percent of her time preparing for the Venice Biennale was spent on administrative tasks related to fund-raising and logistics". The question asks what task Obayashi primarily handled. Wait, the text says that Takeo Obayashi started the initiative to fund the pavilion, but the tasks were Yuko Mohri's. The article says "Mohri said that 70 percent of her time... was spent on administrative tasks related to fund-raising and logistics". The question is about Takeo Obayashi's task, but the article doesn't mention Obayashi handling the tasks, just that he funded it. So the answer is N/A because the question is about Obayashi's tasks, but the article only mentions Mohri's time spent.

Wait, the question says "Takeo Obayashi primarily handled for Yuko Mohri's Venice Biennale exhibition, consuming the majority of his preparation time?" Wait, the article says "Takeo Obayashi, a prominent Japanese collector. He saw an opportunity to use Mohri's exhibition... to make a statement... In an interview with Art Beat Tokyo, he explained that he 'realized that in order for Japan... to make a breakthrough... it will need creativity...'". The question is asking what administrative task Obayashi handled, but the article says that Mohri spent her time on fundraising and logistics. The article doesn't mention Obayashi doing those tasks, so answer N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Year Yasuta Hayashi joined the cultural affairs agency, inspired by Nissan Art Awards. The article says Hayashi joined in 1994, and the Nissan Art Awards are mentioned in 2015 when Mohri won. The question says "inspired by the success of the Nissan Art Awards". Since the Nissan Art Awards in 2015 were after Hayashi joined in 1994, the inspiration can't be from that. The article says "Hayashi joined the country's cultural affairs agency in the shadow of the crash. It was 1994". The question's premise about being inspired by Nissan Art Awards is incorrect, so answer N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Asian city besides Tokyo where Tim Blum's clients have second homes. The article says "many Chinese clients that have second homes here" (referring to Tokyo). So the answer is China's cities? Wait the question is "besides Tokyo, did Tim Blum mention as having a significant number of his clients with second homes..." The article says "many Chinese clients that have second homes here" where "here" is Tokyo. So the clients are from China and have second homes in Tokyo. The question asks for the Asian city besides Tokyo where they have second homes. The answer would be N/A because the article says the clients have second homes in Tokyo (the city mentioned is Tokyo itself). So the question's answer is N/A because the clients are from China but their second homes are in Tokyo. The question asks for another city besides Tokyo where clients have second homes, but the article doesn't mention another city. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Japanese department store chain mentioned for personalized services like a butler. The article quotes Hattori: "The department stores would come to you... For wealthy people, it was like having your own butler." The article doesn't name the department store. Answer N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Artist collective inspired by Fukushima disaster, highlighted in Takahashi's collection. The article says Takahashi turned to "Side Core -- who were inspired to create political work after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster." So the answer is Side Core.

13. **Question 13**: European artist whose painting sold for $200 million in today's dollars during the 1980s. The article says Van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" sold for $82.5M in 1990, which is $200M today. The 1980s bubble economy's peak was 1990, which is technically the early 1990s, but the question says 1980s. Since the sale was in 1990, which is the end of the decade, maybe the answer is Van Gogh. The question says "during the 1980s Japanese art-buying frenzy", and the sale was in 1990. The article says "the trend peaked with the 1990 sale". So the 1990 sale is part of the bubble economy's peak, even if technically in 1990. The question allows for the 1980s, so maybe it's acceptable. The answer is Van Gogh.

14. **Question 14**: Materials in "More More (Leaky)" inspired by subway repairs. The article says "plastic tubing, umbrellas, tarps, funnels and buckets". So the answer lists those.

15. **Question 15**: Primary reason Takeo Obayashi cited for funding the pavilion, linking to Japan's economic/tech aspirations. The article says Obayashi said "in order for Japan... to make a breakthrough and demonstrate a stronger economy and increase its national power, it will need creativity in addition to the excellent technological development capabilities". So the answer is to combine creativity with technological capabilities to boost national power.

16. **Question 16**: Percentage of time Mohri spent on administrative tasks. The article states "70 percent of her time... was spent on administrative tasks related to fund-raising and logistics". So the answer is 70%.
