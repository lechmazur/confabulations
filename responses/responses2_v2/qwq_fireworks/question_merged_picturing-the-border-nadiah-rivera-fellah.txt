Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions Graciela Iturbide and Louis Carlos Bernal revealing a new cross-border identity, and it says "Mixteco farmworkers as they travel from Oaxaca to California." So Oaxaca is the state. That should be the answer.

2. **Question 2:** The pink seesaws were installed by Ronald Rael and Virginia San Fratello. The aerial shot by Fernandez de Castro is from 2019. But when were the seesaws installed? The article doesn't mention the year they were installed. So the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The article states that the Virgin of Guadalupe is a symbol mentioned. So that's the religious symbol. The question asks which one Louis Carlos Bernal documented. The text says Bernal and Iturbide revealed a new identity defined by the Virgin of Guadalupe. So yes, Virgin of Guadalupe.

4. **Question 4:** Natalie Scenters-Zapico describes shuttling between El Paso's freeways and Ciudad Juarez's nightclubs. The question asks about a border city she visited for art galleries before drug violence. Wait, the text says nightclubs in Ciudad Juarez. The article doesn't mention art galleries. So maybe it's a trick. Since the question specifies "before the war on drugs" and mentions nightclubs, but the question says art galleries, which isn't in the text. So N/A?

5. **Question 5:** The article mentions gang members portrayed like Titian's "Venus of Urbino." So the classical painting referenced is Venus of Urbino.

6. **Question 6:** Ricardo Valverde's work with lowriders in East LA with flames, mariachi hats, and flags. The article says "dating to the 1960s" for the artists, but Valverde's specific decade? The text doesn't specify a decade for Valverde's work. The book's photos are from 1960s onward, but Valverde's exact time isn't given. So N/A?

7. **Question 7:** The young Latina mother is in Nike Air Force 1s. The article says "pristine Nike Air Force 1s" so that's the brand.

8. **Question 8:** The aerial photo by Fernandez de Castro is part of the Cleveland Museum of Art's book, as Fellah is a curator there. The question is which Texas museum? Wait, the article says the book is by the Cleveland Museum. Texas isn't mentioned here. So maybe N/A? Because the question asks for a Texas museum, but the museum mentioned is in Cleveland. So answer N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The lowriders had flames, mariachi hats, and Mexican flags. The question asks for the musical instrument. Mariachi hats are associated with mariachi music, which uses instruments like guitars, trumpets, etc. But the article specifically mentions "mariachi hats" as part of the decorations. The question asks for the instrument incorporated into vehicle designs. Since the text only mentions hats (which are part of the outfit, not the instrument), maybe N/A? Or is the hat considered part of the instrument's symbol? The question specifies the instrument, so unless the text mentions an instrument, it's N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Wendy Trevino's "cruel fiction" is referenced in the first part, and Fernandez de Castro's film is 2019. But when did Trevino make that statement? The article doesn't give a year for her quote. So the time difference can't be determined. Answer N/A.
