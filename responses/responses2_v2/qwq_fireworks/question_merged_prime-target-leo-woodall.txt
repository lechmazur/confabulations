Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one based strictly on the provided article. Let me go through each question carefully and see what the article says.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks which mathematician's work on Cold War-era cryptography is referenced as an inspiration for Edward Brooks's research. The article mentions "A Beautiful Mind," which is about John Forbes Nash Jr. So the answer should be Nash.

2. **Question 2**: The decade when Steve Thompson met Simon Singh. The article says Simon Singh gave a lecture in 1999 at Thompson's school. The decade here is the 1990s.

3. **Question 3**: What specific tool did the surveillance consultant advise Taylah to use? The article states Swindell's character didn't cover the camera, as her consultant friend said not to. So the answer is not covering the camera. Wait, the question asks for the tool the consultant advised. The article says the consultant advised against covering the camera, so the tool might be "covering the camera" but the answer is the opposite. Wait, the question is about what the consultant advised. The consultant told her not to cover the camera, so the tool she didn't use? Hmm. The question is phrased as "specific mathematical tool," but the article says the consultant advised against covering the camera. Maybe the answer is "covering the camera on the computer" but since the consultant said not to do it, the tool advised against. Wait, the question is "what specific mathematical tool did the surveillance consultant advise Taylah to use..." The article says the consultant told Swindell's character not to cover the camera. So the tool the consultant advised against, but the question is what they advised to use. Maybe the answer is N/A because the article doesn't mention a tool the consultant advised to use, only that they said not to cover the camera. Hmm, tricky. Let me check again. The article says Swindell reached out to a computer guy friend who said "no" when she asked about covering the camera. So the consultant advised against using that tool (covering the camera). The question asks what tool the consultant advised her to use. Since they advised against it, maybe there's no tool mentioned that they told her to use. So the answer would be N/A?

4. **Question 4**: The 1970s thriller by Alan Pakula cited as inspiration for the chalkboard scene. The article mentions "The Parallax View" and "The Conversation" as influences. The question is about the chalkboard scene's visual inspiration. The article says Brady Hood was inspired by Pakula's films. The specific one mentioned for the scene might be "The Parallax View" since that's one of the ones listed. The exact film for the chalkboard? The article says Hood cited Pakula's "The Parallax View" and Coppola's "The Conversation". Since the question specifies a Pakula film, the answer is "The Parallax View".

5. **Question 5**: The historical event Simon Singh discussed in 1999. The article says Simon Singh explained that modern cryptography is based on primes and if solved, we'd be in trouble. The event might be the foundation of modern crypto on primes. But the question is about a historical event. Maybe the article doesn't mention a specific historical event, just the concept. So perhaps N/A? Wait, the article says "the history of cryptography" in his lecture "The Code Book". The event could be the use of prime numbers in cryptography's history. But the question asks for a specific historical event. Since the article doesn't name a specific event, maybe N/A?

Wait, the article says Thompson was listening to a lecture where Singh explained that modern cryptography is based on primes, and solving it would cause trouble. The historical event might not be mentioned, so the answer is N/A. Hmm, but the question is about an event involving primes and crypto. Since Singh's lecture discussed the history, maybe the answer is the use of primes in cryptography itself? But that's a concept, not an event. So I'll go with N/A here.

6. **Question 6**: Which actor had their math work corrected? The article mentions Woodall had to write equations and a consultant corrected one letter. So the answer is Leo Woodall.

7. **Question 7**: The real-world vulnerability Edward's research exploits. The article says his work could unlock every digital password, based on prime number patterns. The vulnerability is probably the fact that modern crypto relies on prime factorization (like RSA), so the concept here is the potential to crack prime-based encryption. The article says "if anybody ever solved it, we'd all be in terrible trouble" referring to solving primes in crypto. So the answer is the cryptographic vulnerability tied to prime number patterns, which is the basis of modern encryption like RSA. The article mentions "solving it" refers to the prime problem, so the vulnerability is the dependence on prime factors for encryption.

8. **Question 8**: Which part of the formula did the actor miswrite? The article says Woodall got one letter wrong. The exact part isn't specified, so the answer is N/A. Wait, the question is which part (like a specific symbol or section), but the text doesn't say, so N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The influential talk on crypto that sparked the series. The article says Simon Singh's 1999 lecture at Thompson's school was where the idea started. The talk is Simon Singh's lecture on "The Code Book".

10. **Question 10**: The mathematical concept underpinning the breakthrough. The article states that Edward's work concerns prime patterns which could unlock all passwords. The concept is prime factorization used in cryptography, so the answer is prime factorization or the mathematical problem related to primes in crypto. The article says "if anybody ever solved it, we'd all be in trouble" where "it" refers to the prime number problem in crypto. The concept is the difficulty of factoring large primes, so the answer is prime factorization or the RSA problem. The article might just say "prime numbers" so the answer is prime number patterns.

11. **Question 11**: On-set method mistaken for CGI. The article mentions Woodall had to write the formula by hand on the wall, and the crew rolled cameras for 20 minutes. The method was hand-writing, which might be mistaken for CGI. So the answer is hand-writing the equation (or the method of filming it live instead of CGI).

12. **Question 12**: The role portrayed by the actor who consulted a computer expert. Swindell's character is the NSA agent Taylah. She consulted a computer expert (her friend) about covering the camera. So the answer is Taylah (the character's name is mentioned as Taylah, played by Swindell).

13. **Question 13**: The university where Edward studied. The article says he's a graduate student at Cambridge.

14. **Question 14**: The director's 70s paranoia influence. The article mentions Alan Pakula's films like "The Parallax View" as influences. The director here is Pakula, so the answer is Alan Pakula.

15. **Question 15**: Which BBC series might be confused as influencing the show. The article says Thompson worked on "Doctor Who" and "Sherlock". So those are the shows that might be confused. The question asks for the celebrated series mentioned, so "Doctor Who" or "Sherlock". Since it's plural, maybe both? The question says "which celebrated series", so perhaps "Sherlock" or "Doctor Who". The article mentions both, so either could be the answer. The question is about a series that might be thought to influence the math narrative. Since "Sherlock" is math-related? Not sure, but the answer is one of them. Let me check the exact wording: "creator Steve Thompson ... known for his work on 'Doctor Who' and 'Sherlock'". The question is which one might confuse viewers into thinking it influenced the show. Since the article doesn't say that, but the question is about a series mentioned that could be confused. The answer is "Sherlock" or "Doctor Who". Since "Sherlock" is more crime-related, maybe "Sherlock" is the answer. Alternatively, the question might want both, but since it's "which series", maybe the first one mentioned, "Doctor Who".

Wait, the question says "celebrated series is mentioned that might confuse viewers into thinking it influenced the showâ€™s math-infused narrative?" Since Thompson worked on both, but the show's math angle might be linked to "Sherlock" more (as Sherlock uses deduction), but the article doesn't say that. The answer is either, but the article lists both. The question says "which celebrated series", so the first one mentioned is "Doctor Who".

16. **Question 16**: Which character's remark overestimates math enthusiasts' prowess. The article has Taylah say "math nerds are probably the most dangerous people on the planet", implying their power is exaggerated. So the answer is Taylah.
