merged_medals-paris-olympics-lvmh.txt
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and don't assume anything beyond that. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question asks which LVMH subsidiary made the defective varnish. The article mentions that Monnaie de Paris, the French mint, produced the medals and that the varnish issue was due to a technical problem. It also states that LVMH didn't make the medals. So the subsidiary responsible for the varnish would be Monnaie de Paris, but wait, the article says LVMH's Chaumet designed the medals, but the mint made them. The varnish problem was the mint's, so the answer is Monnaie de Paris. But the question specifies LVMH subsidiary. Wait, Monnaie de Paris is a separate entity, not an LVMH subsidiary. The article says Chaumet is part of LVMH. The varnish was made by the mint, so maybe the answer is N/A because the varnish was from Monnaie de Paris, not an LVMH subsidiary. Hmm, need to check again. The article says LVMH's Chaumet designed the medals, but the mint produced them. The varnish was the mint's problem. Since the question asks for an LVMH subsidiary, and Chaumet is part of LVMH but didn't make the varnish, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "LVMH has been happy to let the other organizations do the talking." The mint is responsible. So the answer is N/A.

2. How many varnish formulations did Chaumet test? The article mentions they tweaked the designs hundreds of times but doesn't specify the number of varnish tests. The varnish was handled by the mint, so maybe this is N/A.

3. The total monetary value of LVMH's sponsorship isn't mentioned. The article talks about them being the biggest sponsor but no figure, so N/A.

4. Which committee member approved the designs? The article says a special committee of athletes and officials approved, but no names given. N/A.

5. Percentage of bronze medals deteriorating? The article says over 100 athletes asked for replacements, but total medals isn't given. Can't calculate percentage, so N/A.

6. Number of Eiffel Tower pieces. The article states "a piece of the Eiffel Tower" in each medal. Assuming each medal has one piece, but total medals? The article doesn't specify total medals made, so N/A.

7. Viewing duration of Louis Vuitton segment. The article mentions it was seen by over a billion, but not the duration. N/A.

8. The chemical substituted for chromium trioxide. The article says the mint changed the varnish to conform to EU regulations banning chromium trioxide. The replacement isn't named, so N/A.

9. Storage temperature conditions? The article doesn't mention storage guidelines, so N/A.

10. Number of meetings between Chaumet and mint. The article says they joined forces but no number of meetings, so N/A.

11. Component LVMH oversaw leading to deterioration. Since Chaumet designed the medals (part of LVMH), but the mint made them. The problem was the varnish from the mint. Wait, but LVMH's role was design. The article says the mint changed the varnish formula. Since LVMH didn't oversee the varnish, maybe N/A. Alternatively, maybe the design process included the varnish? The article says Chaumet worked with the mint, but the varnish was the mint's responsibility. So perhaps N/A.

12. Toxic chemical replaced due to LVMH's sustainability. The article says chromium trioxide was banned by EU, not LVMH's initiative. So the answer is chromium trioxide, but the question asks what was replaced. Wait, the problem was chromium trioxide was banned, so the chemical they stopped using was chromium trioxide. The question asks what toxic chemical was implicated before being replaced due to LVMH's sustainability. But the article says the EU regulations caused the change, not LVMH's initiatives. So maybe N/A, since the reason was EU, not LVMH's sustainability.

13. Days to finalize after rejection. The article says they tweaked hundreds of times until the committee agreed, but doesn't mention days after rejection. N/A.

14. Which LVMH brand provided the defective varnish. The varnish was from the mint, not an LVMH brand. So N/A.

15. Unique feature of gold medals besides Eiffel Tower. The article mentions that bronze was the trickiest because it's delicate. Maybe the gold's coating? The article says "dipping in gold, bronze and silver and then finishing with varnish." But no unique feature mentioned except the Eiffel piece. So N/A.

16. Regulatory body outside EU that criticized. The article mentions EU regulations, but no other body. N/A.

17. Primary reason LVMH refused to replace medals. The article says LVMH said they didn't make the medals and aren't responsible, so the answer is that they aren't responsible.

18. Event with highest deterioration rate. The article doesn't specify which event, so N/A.

19. Material from historic monument abandoned. The article mentions the Eiffel Tower piece was used, but no other material mentioned. N/A.

20. Executive who apologized at Elysee Palace. The article says LVMH had a spokesperson but no executive named apologizing. N/A.
