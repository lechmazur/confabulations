Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start with question 1.

1. The first question asks about what aspect of the Amorphophallus gigas's multi-sensory experience surprised Ms. Jackson. Wait, the question mentions the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, but the article says that the 2018 bloom was in the Bronx (Amorphophallus titanum). Ms. Jackson is talking about the Brooklyn bloom. The article says Andrew Orner described the odor as briny, dead fish, and mentions the heat emitted. But the question is about what surprised Ms. Jackson. The article states that Ms. Jackson was excited to see it in person, comparing the wait to becoming a grandmother. The multi-sensory aspect here is the heat and scent. Wait, the question is about what aspect of the Bronx bloom (the titanum) would have surprised Ms. Jackson, but the article says she was at the Brooklyn gigas. Maybe the question is a bit tricky here. Wait, the first part of the question says "as described by Andrew Orner" – he mentioned the odor. The aspect of the Bronx bloom's multi-sensory experience? The article says the gigas emits heat. But the titanum's bloom in the Bronx also had a foul scent. Since the question is about the Bronx's titanum, the multi-sensory aspect would be the heat, but the article only mentions the gigas emitting heat. Wait, the article says the gigas emits heat. For the titanum in the Bronx, it might have emitted heat too, but the text doesn't explicitly say. Hmm. Wait the article says: "The corpse flower has become an unlikely celebrity... the gigas emits heat." But the titanum's bloom in 2018 at the Bronx garden, the text says "the event also created excitement, with New Yorkers lining up to take a whiff of its similarly foul scent." It doesn't mention heat for the titanum. So maybe the question is wrong? Since the question is about the Bronx titanum's aspect that surprised Ms. Jackson, but Ms. Jackson was at the Brooklyn gigas. The question might have a mistake. Wait, the user's question says "what aspect of the bloom at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx most surprised Ms. Jackson?" But Ms. Jackson's comments are about the Brooklyn gigas. The article says she was at the Brooklyn one. Therefore, the question might have an incorrect premise. Since the article doesn't state that Ms. Jackson was at the Bronx's titanum bloom, the answer would be N/A. Wait, but maybe the question is asking about the Bronx's titanum's aspect that would have been surprising to Ms. Jackson. Since the titanum's bloom would have the same heat aspect? But the article says the gigas emits heat, but not the titanum. The article says about titanum: "the event also created excitement, with New Yorkers lining up to take a whiff of its similarly foul scent." So maybe the titanum also emits heat? The article says "the gigas emits heat, also to lure pollinators." The titanum is a close relative, so maybe it also emits heat, but the text doesn't explicitly say. Since the question asks about the Bronx's titanum's aspect that would have surprised Ms. Jackson, but the text doesn't mention the titanum emitting heat, then the answer is N/A? Wait, but the question says "as described by Andrew Orner" – but Andrew was talking about the gigas. Hmm. This is confusing. Maybe I need to recheck. The question is asking what aspect of the Bronx's titanum bloom (since that's where it was) most surprised Ms. Jackson. But the article doesn't mention Ms. Jackson being at the Bronx's titanum. Therefore, the answer is N/A. Wait but the user's question might be a trick. Alternatively, maybe the multi-sensory aspect (heat) was part of the titanum's experience too, even if not explicitly stated. Since the article says the gigas emits heat, and the titanum is a close relative, perhaps it does too. But the question is about the aspect that surprised Ms. Jackson. Since she was at the Brooklyn gigas, not the Bronx titanum, the answer is N/A. So I'll put N/A here.

2. The second question: If Smelliot (the gigas) had bloomed in the wild, what aspect of its inflorescence contributed to the naming process. The staff named it Smelliot via Instagram. The naming process was crowd-sourced. The article says "the members of the garden's staff named it 'Smelliot' after soliciting nominations on Instagram." The question is about the naming in the wild. But the naming was done by the garden staff, not in the wild. The aspect of the inflorescence that would influence the naming? The name Smelliot is a play on "Smell" and "Hillary" (like Smelliot?), but the article doesn't say why. Maybe the smell aspect, so the stench (rotting flesh) is the reason. Since the name references the smell, the inflorescence's smell contributed to the naming. So answer: its foul scent/rotting flesh odor.

3. The third question: What element of the titanum's 2018 bloom in Malaysia mirrored Singh and Lovejoy's experience? The article says that Singh and Lovejoy were among the first to experience the gigas bloom in person. The titanum's 2018 bloom in the Bronx (not Malaysia) had people lining up for the scent. The article says "the garden acquired the gigas from a nursery in Malaysia in 2018 when it was 1-2 years old." Wait, the titanum's 2018 bloom was in the Bronx, so the question might have a mistake. The question says "Amorphophallus titanum's 2018 bloom in Malaysia" – but the article says the titanum bloomed in the Bronx. So maybe it's a typo, but according to the question's wording, if the titanum was in Malaysia, but the article doesn't mention that. Alternatively, perhaps the titanum's bloom in the Bronx had people excited, similar to Singh and Lovejoy's experience. The answer would be the public excitement and crowds coming to see it. So the element is the public excitement and crowds. But the question says "mirrored the experience of Singh and Lovejoy," who were first to see it. The titanum's 2018 event also had people lining up. So the element would be the public excitement and crowds. But the answer must be from the article. The article says "the event also created excitement, with New Yorkers lining up to take a whiff of its similarly foul scent." So the aspect is the public excitement and crowds. So the answer is the public excitement/similar crowds.

4. The fourth question: What characteristic of the bloom aligns with Joseph Lynskey's experience? Lynskey was pushed in front of a subway train but survived. The article mentions his story as a random act of violence. The bloom's characteristic that aligns with his experience? The bloom is a rare, once-in-a-lifetime event. Jackie Jackson said she was excited to see it, comparing to a once-in-a-lifetime event. Joseph's experience was a rare, life-changing event. So the characteristic is its rarity or once-in-a-lifetime occurrence. The article says the gigas blooms every 3-5 years, first time for this plant. So the characteristic is the rarity of the bloom. So answer: rarity/once-in-a-lifetime occurrence.

5. The fifth question: What aspect of Smelliot's bloom cycle influences Chef Nduvo's culinary practices? The chef works at 10 Cubed, a luxury tower's private restaurant. The article mentions "culinary practices" and the chef toiling in obscurity. The bloom's cycle includes emitting heat and scent. Maybe the heat aspect? Or the rarity? The article says the chef is in a private dining room, so maybe the heat is not related. Alternatively, the article says the bloom's scent changed, but how does that influence culinary practices? Maybe the chef's obscurity relates to the plant's rarity. Wait, the question is about the bloom cycle's aspect. Mr. Sprindis explained the plant stores energy in a corm, blooms for 3 days, then collapses. The cycle's dormancy period? The chef's culinary practices might involve using rare ingredients, but the text doesn't connect. Alternatively, the heat emitted by the bloom? Not sure. Maybe N/A. Wait the question says "as explained by Mr. Sprindis," so the bloom cycle aspects are the energy storage, inflorescence every few years. The chef's culinary practices in a private restaurant might relate to using rare or unique ingredients, but the article doesn't say. So perhaps N/A. Wait, maybe the dormancy period leading to rarity? The article says the chef works in obscurity, so maybe the rarity of the bloom mirrors the chef's obscurity? But the question is about influencing culinary practices. Not sure. Maybe the heat emitted by the bloom? Not culinary. Hmm. Maybe N/A.

6. The sixth question: What aspect of the titanum's 2018 bloom would resonate with Dr. Carly Fox's Sunday routine? Dr. Fox's routine includes red-light therapy and pancakes with her kids. The titanum's scent was foul, like dead animals. The article mentions her Sunday routine includes "cats falling out of windows and red-light therapy." Maybe the "briny, dead fish" comparison by Orner, but Dr. Fox's routine has cats and pancakes. Maybe the smell's intensity? Or the unpredictability of the bloom's timing. Alternatively, the "dead fish" scent might not relate. The article says Dr. Fox's routine has elements of chaos (cats falling), so maybe the unpredictability of the bloom's timing (once every few years) resonates with her chaotic routine. But the question is about the titanum's aspect. The titanum's bloom also had a foul scent, so maybe the "dead rat" comparison by Ritzman. But the question says Dr. Fox's routine includes red-light therapy. Maybe N/A. Alternatively, the "once-in-a-lifetime" aspect? Not sure. Maybe N/A.

7. The seventh question: If the interim U.S. attorney visited, what bloom aspect parallels the potential impact on the office's reputation? The article mentions the prosecutor's "sovereign status" being threatened if they drop the mayor's case. The bloom's aspect could be its rarity or the attention it brings. If the attorney dropped the case (like ignoring the bloom?), the office's reputation is harmed. The bloom's attention might draw crowds, but how does that parallel? Maybe the bloom's rarity and the office's independence. If the attorney's decision (like not prosecuting) contrasts with the office's reputation, similar to the bloom's unique attraction. Maybe the bloom's fame vs the office's reputation. The answer might be the bloom's celebrity status, which draws people, similar to the office's reputation being affected. So the aspect is the plant's celebrity status. The article says it became an "unlikely celebrity." So the answer: its celebrity status.

8. The eighth question: What aspect of Smelliot's bloom is featured in a textbook, as per Ms. Singh? She mentioned being familiar with it in textbooks. The article says the gigas is an inflorescence, not a flower. So the textbook would mention its botanical classification as an inflorescence. The answer: it is an inflorescence.

9. The ninth question: What element of Indonesia's habitat influenced the garden's design? The article says the gigas is native to Sumatra and protected. The garden's design sensibilities (Anna Kode writes about design and culture). The environmental conditions in Sumatra (maybe tropical, humid) influenced the Aquatic House where it's kept. The design might replicate its native environment. The article mentions the Aquatic House's environment, so the habitat's tropical climate. The answer: tropical climate/conditions.

10. The tenth question: What aspect of the gigas's flowering process is relevant to delivery workers' affordability ideas? The article's affordability section mentions delivery workers. The gigas's flowering is rare, requiring energy storage. Maybe the energy storage (corm) is a metaphor for resource allocation? Or the rarity's economic impact? Not directly connected. Since the delivery workers' ideas are in another article, perhaps the bloom's unpredictability (needing years to bloom) could relate to planning, but the question says "as experienced by the first visitor on Friday." The first visitor Anna Kode experienced the scent. Maybe the immediate experience's value? Not sure. Maybe N/A.

11. Eleventh question: Which NY garden hosted a gigas bloom in 2018? The article says the Brooklyn Botanic Garden acquired the gigas from Malaysia in 2018 when it was 1-2 years old. The titanum bloomed in the Bronx in 2018. So the gigas wasn't in NY in 2018 yet. The question asks which NY garden had a gigas bloom in 2018. Answer: N/A, because the Brooklyn's gigas was acquired in 2018 but hadn't bloomed yet. The titanum was in the Bronx. So the answer is N/A.

12. Twelfth question: What's Andrew Orner and Matt Gorman's shared profession? The article says they are "fellow product manager." So answer: product manager.

13. Thirteenth question: Years from planting to first bloom? The article says the plant was acquired at 1-2 years old in 2018, and now at 8-9 years old, first blooming now. So from planting (when acquired at 1-2 years old?), the time from planting would be around 7-8 years. Wait, the article says "the garden acquired the gigas from a nursery in Malaysia in 2018, when it was about a year or two old. Now, at 8 or 9, this is its first inflorescence." So from planting (assuming acquired age is when planted), the time to first bloom is 8-9 minus 1-2, so 6-8 years. But the question is from initial planting to first bloom. The article says it takes nearly a decade to first bloom. "It only flowers every 3 to 5 years after its first time, which can take nearly a decade." So the first bloom can take up to a decade (nearly a decade). The exact time here for this plant was 8-9 years since acquisition (when it was 1-2 years old), so total age is 8-9, so from planting (when it was 1-2), so 7-8 years. But the article says "can take nearly a decade", so the answer is "nearly a decade" or the specific 8 years? The question says "according to the timeline provided in the text." The text says this plant is 8 or 9 years old now (since acquisition in 2018, the current year isn't given, but assuming the article is recent, maybe 2026? So 2018 + 8 years = 2026, so 8 years from acquisition. Since it was 1-2 years old when acquired, total age is 8-9, so the time from planting (when it was planted initially, not when acquired) would be 8-9 years. But the question is from initial planting. The article says "the plant stores energy for years in an underground corm... Once that is a sufficient size, it uses that stored-up energy to bloom. 'So it's not something you can do all the time.' Eventually, the bloom collapses and becomes dormant, at which point nothing will be visible above the soil." The timeline says "the plant was about a year or two old in 2018, and now (2023? Maybe) 8 or 9 years old, so total age is 8-9. From planting, it took 8-9 years to first bloom. The article says "the first time can take nearly a decade." So answer: nearly a decade.

14. Fourteenth question: What other urban odor did Jonathan compare to the corpse flower besides dead rats? The article says "the smell was not unlike rotting flesh. Jonathan Ritzman compared the scent... to a dead rat. Later in the morning, it was more akin to cheese or ginkgo." Wait, the question is about Ritzman's comparisons. Wait, the article says "Jonathan Ritzman compared the scent of the corpse flower to that of a dead rat." Then later in the text, it says "Inside the garden's Aquatic House... its stench was unavoidable. It also changed with time. At first it evoked a dead rat, but later in the morning it was more akin to cheese or ginkgo." So the first comparison was dead rat by Ritzman. The other comparisons (cheese or ginkgo) are part of the text's description, not Ritzman's. The question asks for Ritzman's other comparison besides dead rat. The article only mentions Ritzman's dead rat. So the answer is N/A, because the other comparisons (cheese, ginkgo) weren't by him. The article says "later in the morning it was more akin to cheese or ginkgo" but doesn't attribute that to Ritzman. So answer: N/A.

15. Fifteenth question: International conservation status of the gigas in Sumatra? The article says "the country considers it a protected species." The country here is Indonesia. The conservation status is protected by Indonesia, but the question is about international status. The article mentions Botanic Gardens Conservation International's PlantSearch database, but that's about cultivation prevalence. The text doesn't mention an international conservation status like IUCN. It just says Indonesia considers it protected. So the answer is "protected species" as per Indonesia, but the question asks international. Since the text doesn't mention international status, answer: N/A.

16. Sixteenth question: Horticultural structure for dormancy? The article says the plant stores energy in an underground corm. Answer: corm.

17. Seventeenth question: Yale institution that Allegra represents? The article says she works at the Center for Earth Ethics, an environmental nonprofit. Answer: Center for Earth Ethics.

18. Eighteenth question: What differentiates gigas from titanum in cultivation prevalence? The article says "the gigas can be found in only 10 gardens in the world. The titanum can be found in 94." So the aspect is the gigas's rarity (10 vs 94). Answer: fewer gardens cultivate it (or gigas is rarer).

19. Nineteenth question: What culinary comparison was made about the scent evolution? The article says "later in the morning it was more akin to cheese or ginkgo." So the answer: cheese or ginkgo.

20. Twentieth question: Social media platform used for naming? The article says "after soliciting nominations on Instagram." Answer: Instagram.
