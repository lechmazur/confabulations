Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each exactly as per the instructions. Let me start by reading through the questions again and then cross-referencing with the article.

1. **Settlement amount for merger approval:** The article mentions Paramount started settlement discussions, but it doesn't specify the exact amount. So the answer should be N/A. Wait, the question asks for the total amount discussed. The article says "for $10 billion" in the lawsuit, but the settlement discussions aren't given a figure here. So N/A.

2. **News outlet accused with Politico:** The article states "President Trump spread unfounded claims that the government had paid Politico and other news media outlets for positive coverage of Democrats." The question asks which other outlet besides Politico was accused. The article says "other news media outlets," but doesn't name a specific one. So N/A.

3. **Digital subscribers gained:** The last paragraph says "The New York Times: The company added 350,000 digital-only subscribers in the last quarter..." So the answer is 350,000.

4. **Anna Gomez's role in merger review:** The article says Anna Gomez criticized the request as retaliatory, but doesn't mention her role in the merger review. So N/A.

5. **Network's editorial policy investigated by Carr:** The article mentions Carr will examine political bias of "certain news outlets," but doesn't specify which network. N/A.

6. **Middle Eastern country named in Harris's response:** The article says Harris responded to a question about the Middle East. The preview showed her response on that topic. The specific country? The article doesn't name a country, just mentions the Middle East. So N/A.

7. **Number of commissioners aligning with Gomez:** The article only mentions Anna Gomez's criticism. No others are mentioned. So N/A.

8. **Financial product category for patriotic economy:** Trump Media is moving to position as a financial services firm offering investment products for the "patriotic economy." So the answer is investment products.

9. **Network program facing backlash after FCC inquiry:** The article doesn't mention any viewer backlash to "60 Minutes" after the FCC inquiry. The backlash from journalists is internal. So N/A.

10. **Original air date for unedited interview:** The article says the aired version was on October 7, but the unedited? It says the preview aired on Oct 7, and the longer version next night. The unedited transcript requested is from the interview that aired in October. The original scheduled air date for the full version? The prime-time next night after the preview. So the original scheduled air date for the full interview was October 7's prime-time? Wait, the preview aired on Oct 7, and the longer version next night. The article says "aired during a special election episode of '60 Minutes' on Oct. 7. (Producers had also invited Mr. Trump to sit for an interview; his campaign ultimately declined to participate, and objected to CBS's plans to fact-check his remarks.) CBS aired a preview of the Harris interview... in prime-time the next night." So the unedited version was the longer one aired the next night (Oct 8?), but the question asks the original scheduled air date for the full unedited. The article says the "longer version of the interview that aired in prime-time the next night." So the original scheduled air date for the full was the next day after the preview. The exact date? The article only says "Oct 7" for the preview, so the next night would be Oct 8? But the question is about the original scheduled air date before CBS altered? Wait, did CBS alter the broadcast? The article says "CBS said that Ms. Harris had given one lengthy answer... and its producers chose to air a different portion in prime-time because of time constraints." So the original unedited was the full version, but they edited. The original scheduled date was the next night (Oct 8?), but the article doesn't specify the exact date beyond Oct 7 for the preview. So maybe the question is about the original scheduled date for the full unedited, which would be the same as the aired prime-time next night. But since the article doesn't give a specific date beyond October, the answer would be N/A. Wait, the article says "aired on '60 Minutes' in October." The exact date isn't provided except Oct 7 for the preview. So the answer is N/A.

11. **Reason for shorter version:** CBS said they chose the shorter version due to time constraints. The answer is time constraints.

12. **Items requested by FCC:** The FCC requested "the full, unedited transcript and camera feeds." So that's the answer.

13. **Monetary figure in Trump's lawsuit:** The article states Trump sued for $10 billion. So $10 billion.

14. **Member describing inquiry as retaliatory:** Anna Gomez is mentioned as criticizing it as retaliatory. So Anna Gomez.

15. **How settlement serves merger plans:** The article says settling could help pave the way for FCC approval of the merger. So the answer is to pave the way for FCC approval of the merger.

16. **Investigative program from late 60s:** "60 Minutes" was founded in 1968. So "60 Minutes."

17. **Inquiry influencing editing:** The article says Harris's response was to a question from Bill Whitaker on Middle East. The editing was due to time constraints, so the inquiry (question) from Whitaker influenced the editing? The question asks whose inquiry influenced editing. The answer would be Bill Whitaker's, as his question led to her response, and they edited based on time. Wait, the article says "CBS said that Ms. Harris had given one lengthy answer to Mr. Whitaker, and its producers chose to air a different portion in prime-time because of time constraints." So the editing was due to time, not the inquiry's content. The question is about whose inquiry influenced editing. The inquiry (question) was from Whitaker, so his. So the answer is Bill Whitaker.

18. **Characterization of modifications:** CBS said the interview "was not doctored," so they characterized modifications as typical editing, not doctoring. The answer is typical editing in television news.

19. **Controlling shareholder supporting settlement:** Shari Redstone is mentioned as strongly supporting the settlement. So Shari Redstone.

20. **Original air date of preview:** The preview aired on Oct 7. The question is about the day when the preview with Middle East question aired. The article says "CBS aired a preview of the Harris interview in which Ms. Harris responded to a question... aired on Oct. 7." So the answer is October 7.
