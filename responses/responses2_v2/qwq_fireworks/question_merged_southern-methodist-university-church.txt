Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and strictly follow the instructions. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **How many churches joined the Global Methodist Church specifically due to SMU's separation attempt?**  
The article mentions that over a quarter of the denomination's churches left before the 2024 decision, but it doesn't specify how many joined the Global Methodist Church because of SMU's actions. So, this is N/A.

2. **Which Supreme Court justice previously served on SMU's board?**  
The article doesn't mention any justices having prior board membership. All the justices named (Blacklock, Lehrmann) are part of the current court case. N/A.

3. **Total monetary value of church assets SMU tried to retain?**  
No figures are given about assets in the article. N/A.

4. **Year SMU began discussions with Atlantic Coast Conference leading to tensions?**  
The article states SMU joined the ACC last year (presumably 2023, as the article was written in 2024), but there's no info on when discussions started. N/A.

5. **Number of votes by the board in 2019?**  
No mention of vote counts. N/A.

6. **Percentage of students identifying as Methodist?**  
No enrollment data provided. N/A.

7. **Bishop who proposed the nondiscrimination statement?**  
The article doesn't name the bishop responsible. N/A.

8. **Financial compensation requested by the church?**  
The church's lawsuit focuses on control, not financial demands. N/A.

9. **Number of other Methodist universities filing amicus briefs?**  
The article mentions the Becket Fund's brief but no others. N/A.

10. **Enrollment targets projected by 2025?**  
No specific targets mentioned. N/A.

11. **Legal precedent cited by Becket Fund?**  
The article says the church enshrined their connection after the Tennessee Supreme Court allowed Vanderbilt's separation. So the precedent is the **Vanderbilt case**.

12. **Aspect of identity enhanced if ruled in SMU's favor?**  
Rev. Belase mentions "diminishing the distinct Methodist character," so the enhanced aspect would be **Methodist character**.

13. **Legal strategy Blacklock found persuasive?**  
He criticized SMU's "clever lawyering" and mentioned "settled expectations," so the church's argument about bylaws and expectations was persuasive.

14. **Year president who got Bush library initiated separation?**  
Dr. Turner became president in 1995 and initiated separation in 2019. The question asks when he both secured the library (2008) and started legal actions (2019). Since the question links both actions to the same president, the answer is 2019.

15. **Element aligned with Global Methodist Church?**  
The Global Methodist Church opposes LGBTQ+ ordination, but the article says SMU's statement includes sexual orientation. Since the church reversed its ban, the nondiscrimination part on sexual orientation now aligns with the *Global* Church? Wait, noâ€”the Global Church opposes it, so maybe the question is a trick. Wait, the Global Methodist Church doesn't align; the article says the church overturned its ban. The SMU's statement includes sexual orientation, but the Global Church opposes it. The question might be a trick. Wait, the article says after 2024, the church (United Methodist) allowed same-sex marriage. The Global Church is the rival that doesn't. The SMU's statement includes sexual orientation, so the element that aligned with the Global Church's doctrine? No, actually the opposite. Maybe the question is wrong, but the answer would be N/A. Wait, the question says "brought into direct alignment with the Global Methodist Church's doctrine". Since the Global Church opposes LGBTQ+ issues, but SMU's statement includes it, that doesn't align. So perhaps N/A. Wait, the article states that the university's nondiscrimination policy includes sexual orientation, conflicting with the church's previous stance. After the church reversed, maybe the Global Church's stance is still opposed. The question is about after SMU's 2019 actions and the church's 2024 reversal. So the SMU's statement now aligns with the United Methodist Church's new stance, but the Global Church's doctrine is against it. Therefore, the answer is N/A because there's no alignment with Global Methodist's doctrine.

16. **Trump action prompting SMU's separation?**  
The article mentions Trump's orders affecting diversity efforts but doesn't link it to SMU's actions. N/A.

17. **Other internal conflict besides LGBTQ+?**  
The article doesn't mention other conflicts related to SMU's decision. N/A.

18. **Number of states under the regional body excluding Texas?**  
The regional body oversees Texas and seven other states, so 7.

19. **Teaching methodology mirrored by SMU's approach?**  
The article mentions Houston's "strictly structured teaching" but SMU's separation was about church ties, not teaching methods. N/A. Wait, the question says "mirrored the 'strictly structured' approach that SMU's board sought to avoid". The article's Houston example is a separate issue. SMU's actions weren't about teaching methods. So N/A.
