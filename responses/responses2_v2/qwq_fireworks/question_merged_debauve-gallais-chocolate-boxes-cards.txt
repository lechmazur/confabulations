Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any external knowledge. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks about the type of wood used in the Trama bookcase designed by Lanzavecchia for Loro Piana's new collection. The article mentions under the "Covet This" section that the Trama bookcase is made with panels of solid walnut and fabric. The Namia River Retreat's decor uses ash-wood furniture from Da Nang, but the Trama's wood is walnut. So the answer should be walnut.

2. **Question 2:** If Lindy McDonough collaborates with Debauve & Gallais using materials from Lindquist's Rhodes duffel (which is made from a single piece of leather), they might emboss a historical figure from the chromos. The chromos include Marie-Antoinette, Louis XVI, Napoleon, Marcel Proust, and Sonia Rykiel. Since the duffel uses leather, maybe Napoleon since the Croquamandes were for him. So Napoleon.

3. **Question 3:** Laroot's detox kit mentions a broth simmered over 24 hours. Debauve & Gallais historically made medicinal chocolate for royalty. The article says Sulpice Debauve introduced chocolate as a health remedy. The broth here is oxtail bone broth. But the question is about what Debauve might have recommended. Since the broth isn't mentioned in Debauve's context, maybe N/A? Wait, but the question links Laroot's broth duration (24 hours) to Debauve's historical use. Maybe the answer is bone broth, but the article doesn't specify. Hmm, maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "might have been recommended by Sulpice Debauve to Louis XVI for its medicinal properties". Since Debauve's chocolate was a health remedy, maybe the broth isn't directly related. So N/A?

4. **Question 4:** The Verse hotel's walls use light hues of sand, pink, terra-cotta to reflect the Portuguese landscape. The Fiore Di Cardo wallcoverings are part of Loro Piana's collection. The article says the Verse's walls are those colors, but Fiore Di Cardo's colors aren't specified. The question asks which color is most prominent in Fiore Di Cardo. Since the text doesn't mention colors for Fiore Di Cardo, maybe N/A. Wait, the Fiore Di Cardo has a thistle motif, but color isn't stated. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Lindquist's sustainable practices and Namia's wellness activities. The activity at Namia includes yoga, meditation, duong sinh (Indigenous tai chi), swimming, etc. McDonough might suggest an activity that appreciates craftsmanship. Maybe yoga or a mindful walk? But the question is about appreciating the Rhodes duffel's craftsmanship. The article mentions Lindquist's customer service for repairs. Maybe "swimming" isn't it. Perhaps "yoga" or "meditation", but the question asks for an activity mentioned in the resort's context. Wait, the villas have private pools, but the activity linked to craftsmanship? Maybe "exploring Hoi An on bamboo bicycles" but that's not related. Alternatively, maybe "yoga" as a mindful activity. The question says "mindful way to appreciate craftsmanship", so perhaps "yoga" isn't the answer. Alternatively, since the duffel is made from a single piece, maybe "observing the craftsmanship" through an activity like a guided tour? The article doesn't mention that. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the Namia's activities include yoga, meditation, etc. The question is what McDonough would suggest. Since Lindquist's bags are durable, maybe she suggests a mindful walk or something. But the article doesn't specify. Maybe the answer is N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The Trama bookcase's design is inspired by latticework. The question asks what 19th-century advertising technique influenced its design. Debauve & Gallais revived chromos, which are illustrated cards. The Trama's structural design (latticework) might be inspired by the chromolithography? Wait, the question says the structural design was influenced by the advertising technique. The article says the Trama is inspired by latticework, which is the design, but the chromos are the cards. Maybe the answer is chromos, but the technique is chromolithography. The question asks for the advertising technique, which was chromos. So the answer is chromos.

7. **Question 7:** Laroot's culinary director creating a dish inspired by Pistoles de Marie-Antoinette (chocolate medallions) and using an element from Merchant's menu (like cao lau carbonara). The central ingredient would be the Pistoles (chocolats a croquer). So the answer is Pistoles de Marie-Antoinette.

8. **Question 8:** Verse is in Sao Bento neighborhood. Loro Piana's wool sources are from Australia/New Zealand and China/Mongolia. The question asks which neighborhood in Lisbon is closest to the source of the wool. Since the wool sources are in other countries, the answer is N/A. Unless the question is a trick, but no, so N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The villas' private pools' hardware. Lindquist's Rhodes duffel uses Swiss brass hardware. The question asks what type of hardware, sourced from a country mentioned (Switzerland), is used in the pools. The pools' construction materials aren't specified, but the villas' decor uses ash wood. The hardware for pools might be brass, so Swiss brass. So the answer is solid brass.

10. **Question 10:** Wellness activity at Namia that incorporates Vietnamese Indigenous martial arts. The article mentions duong sinh (Indigenous tai chi) alongside yoga and meditation. The answer is duong sinh.
