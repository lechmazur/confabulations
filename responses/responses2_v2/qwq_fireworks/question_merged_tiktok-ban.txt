Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the provided article and answer each exactly as per the instructions. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question is about how many days the Biden administration would refrain from penalties. The article says Karine Jean-Pierre stated they wouldn't start fining "in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday." The exact number isn't given, so maybe "N/A"? Wait, the question specifies "transition period mentioned by the White House press secretary." The article says "in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday." Since the law took effect Sunday, and the next administration starts Monday, perhaps the period is until Monday. But the question asks how many days. The answer might be "N/A" because "few days" is vague. Hmm, maybe the exact days aren't stated, so N/A.

2. Alix Earle joined a rival platform after her heartbreak. The text mentions she appeared on Instagram. The question asks which entity she joined. The answer is Instagram.

3. Daniel Daks organized a "war room Zoom" with employees. The meeting type is a "war room Zoom."

4. The question asks for another ByteDance app besides Lemon8 that was removed. The article mentions CapCut as another app that became unavailable.

5. The reporter covering tech in Asia is Meaghan Tobin in Taipei. The question asks the city of the tech reporter who reported on Asia. Wait, the question says "considering the location of the individual who reported on business and tech stories in Asia?" That person is Meaghan Tobin, based in Taipei. The tech reporter (other than her?) The other tech reporters: Eli Tan reported from San Francisco. So the question might be asking for Eli Tan's city, since the Asia reporter is Meaghan. Wait, the question is phrased: "the location of the individual who reported on business and tech stories in Asia?" That's Meaghan in Taipei. The reporter covering tech industry is Eli Tan in San Francisco. Wait, the question is: "In what city did the reporter covering the technology industry report from, considering the location of the individual who reported on business and tech stories in Asia?" Maybe it's asking for the city where the tech reporter is, whose location is linked to the Asia reporter's location? Not sure. Wait, the question structure: "the location of the individual who reported on business and tech stories in Asia" is Meaghan in Taipei. The reporter covering the tech industry is Eli Tan in SF. So the answer is San Francisco. Because the question is about the tech reporter's city, connected via the Asia reporter's location. Maybe the question wants Eli Tan's location, since the Asia reporter is Meaghan. So the answer is San Francisco.

6. Diao Daming's comment was about testing Trump's relationship with "China hawks." The question asks what action this handling would test. The answer is his relationship with "China hawks in Washington."

7. The Chinese app mentioned as not a long-term substitute is RedNote. Alix Earle said RedNote wouldn't be a substitute.

8. The Department of Justice declined to comment, related to penalties. The question mentions the department connected to penalizing app stores and hosts. The DOJ is mentioned as declining comment.

9. Hu Xijin was a former editor of Global Times. The question asks his previous role. The answer is former editor in chief of the Global Times.

10. The video-editing app from ByteDance besides TikTok and Lemon8 is CapCut.

11. The individual who might grant a 90-day extension and posted "SAVE TIKTOK!" is Trump.

12. The app besides TikTok that showed "isn't available" is Lemon8, but the question says "alongside TikTok", so maybe Lemon8 is the answer, but the question says "besides Lemon8" in Q4. Wait, this question is asking which related app (other than TikTok) showed the message. The article says Lemon8 and CapCut were unavailable. The first mention is Lemon8 and CapCut. The question says "alongside TikTok" so Lemon8 is the answer here.

13. The penalty per user is $5,000.

14. The user count is 170 million.

15. The reporter in Taipei is Meaghan Tobin.

16. The entity that warned about harm in filings is TikTok itself.

17. The app store mentioned with that message is Apple's.

18. The city for the tech reporter besides NY and Taipei is San Francisco (Eli Tan).

19. The president who signed the law was Biden, as stated in the article: "the law was passed... signed by President Biden."
