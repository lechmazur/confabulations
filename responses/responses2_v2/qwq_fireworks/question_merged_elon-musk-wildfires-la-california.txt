Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and answer each question strictly based on that. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **What percentage increase in Santa Ana wind speed...?** The article mentions Santa Ana winds blowing as fast as 100 mph but doesn't give a percentage increase compared to average. So, N/A.

2. **Specific regulatory change proposed by Kamala Harris?** The article says she toured the area but doesn't mention any specific regulatory proposal. N/A.

3. **Title of the Pacific Institute report?** The text doesn't mention a specific report title. Peter Gleick refuted Trump's claims, but no report name is given. N/A.

4. **Financial penalty for insurance carriers?** The insurance regulator wants carriers to pay full limits without requiring itemization. No penalty mentioned for failing to list items. N/A.

5. **Alternative energy source by Musk linked to wildfires?** The article doesn't connect Musk's energy sources to wildfires. Musk blames regulation, not energy sources. N/A.

6. **Month Kamala met to discuss international strategies?** The article states her visit was after the wildfires but doesn't specify the month. N/A.

7. **Architectural flaw by Peter Gleick?** He says water systems aren't designed for wildfires. The flaw is urban systems not designed for firefighting. So answer: urban water systems not designed to fight wildfires.

8. **Legal action by residents citing overregulation?** The article mentions Musk's blame but doesn't say residents sued. N/A.

9. **Innovative water program discussed during Harris's visit?** The article mentions other communities' ideas but no specific program name. N/A.

10. **Endangered species Musk falsely claimed?** Trump mentioned delta smelt fish. The article says Musk and Trump politicized, but Musk's comments focused on regulation, not the fish. Wait, the text says Trump falsely claimed the smelt regulations caused water issues. Musk's post didn't mention the fish. So question 10: the answer is delta smelt, because Trump did, but the question asks about Musk. Wait, the question says "did Elon Musk falsely claim was responsible". The article says Trump falsely claimed about the smelt. Musk's comments were about overregulation but didn't mention the fish. So Musk didn't mention the smelt. Therefore, N/A for Musk specifically. Wait, need to check again. The article says: "President-elect Donald J. Trump, Mr. Musk and other Republicans have sought to politicize the wildfires, using it as a way to attack Democratic officeholders in California. Mr. Trump in particular has seized on environmental regulations, including federal and state protections for California's endangered delta smelt fish." So Musk and Trump both politicized, but Trump specifically mentioned the smelt. Musk's own comments didn't mention the fish. The question is about Musk's false claim. Since Musk didn't mention the smelt, the answer would be N/A. Wait, the question says "did Elon Musk falsely claim was responsible..." so since Musk didn't mention the smelt, answer is N/A. But the question might be a trick. Let me check again. The article says Musk blamed overregulation and bad governance, but Trump specifically cited the smelt. So Musk didn't mention the fish, so the answer is N/A.

11. **Wind speed threshold by Benjamin Hatchett?** The text says Santa Ana winds were as fast as 100 mph, but no specific threshold mentioned by Hatchett. N/A.

12. **Federal policy Kamala referenced?** The article says she met officials but doesn't mention any specific federal policy she referenced. N/A.

13. **Fatalities before Trump's statements?** The article states "killing at least five people" in the first paragraph. Before Trump's statements? The timeline isn't specified, but the initial count was five. So answer: 5.

14. **Record-keeping start year?** The article says since record-keeping began in 1877. So 1877.

15. **Reservoir named by Gleick as above normal?** The article says Southern California reservoir levels, including ones feeding LA, are above normal. No specific name given. N/A.

16. **Legislative measure Musk criticized as overregulation?** Musk's comments mention "nonsensical overregulation" and "bad governance", but the article doesn't specify which exact policy. So N/A.

17. **University affiliation of Michael F. Wehner?** He's at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The question asks university, but that's a national lab, not a university. Wait, the article says "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory", which is affiliated with UC Berkeley. But the question says "university affiliation", so maybe UC Berkeley? But the text doesn't explicitly state that. The article just says his affiliation is the lab. Since the question is about his university, and the lab is part of UC Berkeley, but the article doesn't say that, so answer N/A. Wait, the exact wording: "Michael F. Wehner, a senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory." The lab is associated with UC Berkeley, but the article doesn't state his university. So the answer is N/A because the article only mentions the lab, not the university. Unless the lab is considered part of the university, but the question specifically asks for university affiliation. Since the text doesn't mention a university, answer N/A.

18. **Percentage increase in wildfire frequency?** The article mentions studies found more frequent and intense wildfires but doesn't give a specific percentage. N/A.

19. **Environmental policy Trump linked to Harris?** The article says Trump falsely claimed regulations for the smelt were part of Harris' oversight? Wait, the article says Trump blamed regulations including those for the smelt, but it doesn't say Harris was overseeing them. The question asks which policy Trump incorrectly associated with Harris' oversight. The text says Trump attacked Democratic officeholders, but Harris is a former VP, so maybe not directly. The article doesn't link Harris to the smelt policy specifically. Therefore, N/A.
