Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I answer each exactly based on the text without any external knowledge.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions that West Point leaders ended a dozen student clubs due to Trump's D.E.I. ban. The exact number is given as "a dozen", which is 12. So the answer is 12.

2. **Question 2**: President Claudia Sheinbaum proposed renaming America in response to Trump's Gulf of Mexico name change. The article states her reason was related to Canada's critical minerals being a factor in Trump's comments about making Canada a U.S. state. So the prompt was Trump's comments about Canada.

3. **Question 3**: Sally Jewell, as Interior Secretary, renamed Denali because the U.S. Board on Geographic Names didn't act in a reasonable time. The action was changing the mountain's name to Denali. The answer should be "renamed Denali" or similar.

4. **Question 4**: The tent city in Guantanamo Bay can house up to 30,000 migrants. The article says "as many as 30,000 migrants".

5. **Question 5**: Trump's legal challenges against CBS News and The Des Moines Register are mentioned as lacking merit but effective harassment. These are the legal challenges referenced here.

6. **Question 6**: Senator Sullivan mentioned his wife is Athabascan and would be mad if the name changed. The answer is his wife's heritage (Athabascan) as a reason.

7. **Question 7**: Gerad Smith predicted Denali's name would persist despite official changes. The answer is "Denali would persist" or "the native name would persist".

8. **Question 8**: The U.S. Board on Geographic Names is the body with authority, chaired by Michael Tischler.

9. **Question 9**: William Dickey first used the name in the New York Sun in 1897.

10. **Question 10**: The executive order cited tariffs as the policy similarity between Trump and McKinley.

11. **Question 11**: Senator Sullivan's statement mentions the Koyukon people. The answer is Koyukon Athabascan.

12. **Question 12**: Sally Jewell said Alaska tried for about 40 years before the 2015 change.

13. **Question 13**: Ohio lawmakers filed bills to retain McKinley whenever Alaska proposed Denali, so the mechanism is "filing bills".

14. **Question 14**: The U.S. Board on Geographic Names' chairman has authority. But the question asks which agency's chairman? The Board is part of the Interior Department, but the answer might be the Board itself. Wait, the article says the Board's authority is cited by Jewell, and the chairman is Michael Tischler from Interior. The answer is the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, but the question asks for the agency. Since the Board is under the Interior Department, maybe "Interior department"? Wait, the article says the Board's authority, so the answer is the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. But the question asks for the governmental body whose chairman is Michael Tischler. The answer is the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.

15. **Question 15**: She proposed "America Mexicana" or "Mexican America".

16. **Question 16**: The article says "other Native groups in the area have their own names", but only Koyukon are named. Wait, the article states "Alaska Native groups and lawmakers spent decades trying... Koyukon people referred to the mountain... Other Native groups... have their own names". However, the question asks for an explicitly named group besides Koyukon. The text only mentions Koyukon and other groups but doesn't name another specific group. So maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "the Koyukon people and other Alaska Native groups". The other groups aren't named, so the answer is N/A.

17. **Question 17**: The article says 1897 for the New York Sun article.

18. **Question 18**: The article states 10 migrants are held there, with the tent city for up to 30,000. The question is about how many are currently held, which is 10.

19. **Question 19**: Same as question 1, which was 12. The DEI section mentions "a dozen student clubs".

Wait, checking again for each question to ensure accuracy. Let me go through each point again carefully.

For question 16, the article says "Other Native groups in the area have their own names for the peak." but doesn't name any, so answer N/A.

Question 14: The chairman is of the Board, so the governmental body is the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. The answer is that body.

Okay, that should cover all. Now format the answers properly.
