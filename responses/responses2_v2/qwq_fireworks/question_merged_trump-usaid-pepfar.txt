Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. I need to make sure I don't look anywhere else and strictly follow the instructions.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks what percentage of funding from the Infectious Diseases Institute at Makerere University was restored. The article mentions that the Uganda Key Populations Consortium lost 70% of its funding, but there's no mention of any restoration. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** It asks about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s proposed alternative funding. The article mentions his stance on aluminum in vaccines but doesn't say anything about his proposals for PEPFAR. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The survey by the Africa Center was conducted over the past week when the article was written. The article doesn't specify the exact days after the freeze. N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The senior official said they needed individual letters for each project specifying which work to start and funding. The answer is "individual letters on each project."

5. **Question 5:** The article mentions Kenya's deputy chief of communications, Mackenzie Knowles-Coursin, who left before the article. Kenya is an East African nation. So Kenya.

6. **Question 6:** The Uganda group had a $200k/year CDC grant and a $8M USAID grant. The question specifies the USAID grant amount in a country where same-sex relations with HIV is punishable by death (Uganda). So $8 million.

7. **Question 7:** The Sunday waiver covered HIV testing, treatment, and prevention/treatment of TB and "opportunistic infections." The question asks for another besides TB. The article doesn't list others, so maybe "opportunistic infections" in general, but the exact term isn't given. Wait, the article says "prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis," implying that the waiver explicitly mentioned TB. The question asks for another specific one besides TB, but the article doesn't mention another. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** PEPFAR was due for a five-year reauthorization in 2023. So the original term was five years.

9. **Question 9:** The Uganda Key Populations Consortium is the umbrella org mentioned. Correct.

10. **Question 10:** The article says USAID's global workforce was put on leave, paralyzing operations. So USAID.

11. **Question 11:** South Africa's health minister mentioned over 15k health workers affected. So South Africa.

12. **Question 12:** The final waiver explicitly covered HIV testing, treatment, and opportunistic infections like TB. The initial waiver didn't name PEPFAR and was vague. The Sunday one was more explicit. The differentiating element is mentioning HIV testing and treatment explicitly. Wait the first waiver was about lifesaving medicines, the second one explicitly included HIV testing and treatment and TB. The question is what the final one included that the earlier didn't. The answer might be "HIV testing and treatment" but the question says "specific element." Alternatively, the first didn't name PEPFAR, the second did. Wait the first waiver (Jan 28) didn't name PEPFAR, the Sunday one did. The article says the Sunday waiver "explicitly that it would cover H.I.V. testing and treatment as well as prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis." The first one was for lifesaving medicines but not specific. The answer is "HIV testing and treatment" or "prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis." Wait the question is about what differentiated it. The Sunday one included HIV testing and treatment explicitly, which the first didn't. So the answer is "HIV testing and treatment."

13. **Question 13:** The initiative started in 2003 under Bush, so PEPFAR.

14. **Question 14:** The survey was in 11 sub-Saharan countries, and all reported shutdowns. So 11.

15. **Question 15:** The article says PEPFAR has delivered treatment to 25 million people since 2003. So 25 million.

16. **Question 16:** The risk to children is mentioned as 500,000 children at risk.

17. **Question 17:** The article says two-thirds of PEPFAR grants are through USAID and CDC. So the other third is CDC.

18. **Question 18:** Uganda's law criminalizing same-sex relations and harsh penalties for HIV-positive individuals. The article mentions Uganda's 2023 law criminalizing consensual same-sex relations and making same-sex relations with HIV punishable by death. So that's the law.

Now, let me check each answer again to ensure accuracy.
