Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. The first question asks about the literary device Betancourt used in "Hello Stranger" to mirror John Rechy's encounters. The article mentions Rechy's "The Sexual Outlaw" and Betancourt's essays using case studies from film, literature, etc. The device here might be "case studies" since they're used to analyze similar themes. But wait, the question specifies a literary device. Maybe "metaphor" or "analogy"? Let me check the text again. It says Betancourt brings in case studies, so "case studies" is more of a method than a literary device. Hmm. The article says he uses "criticism" and "case studies from film, literature..." Maybe the device is "criticism" but that's not a literary device. Alternatively, "comparison" or "allusion"? The exact device isn't named, so maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "literary device" that mirrors the fleeting encounters. The text says "brief encounters can be sites of endless possibilities" and Betancourt uses examples from culture. Maybe "allusion" or "reference"? The article says he uses case studies, so perhaps "case studies" is acceptable here. I'll go with "case studies".

2. The second question is about how many watercolor portraits the sketch artist made of Betancourt. The text mentions "the fluttering sense of recognition upon seeing himself rendered in watercolor." It doesn't specify the number, just that he posed once. So "one" or N/A? Since it's singular, maybe one, but the question might be a trick. The answer is N/A because the text doesn't state the number.

3. The third question asks the year Betancourt's college class analyzed "The Sexual Outlaw". The article doesn't mention the year, only that it was a college course he took. So N/A.

4. The fourth question asks the historical event influencing the literature's tone related to homosexual oppression. The article says "centuries of homosexual oppression and, later, the AIDS crisis." So the AIDS crisis is the event. Answer: AIDS crisis.

5. The fifth question is about a physical sensation Betancourt felt during his nude modeling that mirrored emotional vulnerability. The text mentions "the pool of sweat gathering in the nape of my neck". So the answer is "sweat in the nape" or "pool of sweat in the nape of the neck".

6. The sixth question asks what type of publication *Interview* magazine is. The article says Jake Nevins is the digital editor at Interview magazine, which is known as a celebrity and fashion magazine. But the text doesn't explicitly state the type, except that it's a magazine. The question implies the type, like "fashion" or "arts"? Since the article doesn't specify, but the context is literary, maybe "arts" or "cultural"? The text just says "magazine", so perhaps the answer is "magazine". Wait, the question asks the type, so maybe "fashion and culture" but the article doesn't say. Since the article only says "magazine", the answer might be "N/A" but the question says "type of publication", so "magazine" is the type. Wait, but "publication" could include magazines, so maybe the answer is "magazine". But the question is about the type, like "fashion" or "entertainment". Since the article doesn't specify, perhaps N/A? Hmm, tricky. The article says "Interview magazine", which is known as a celebrity/interview-focused publication, but since the text doesn't state it, I have to go with N/A. Wait, the question says "what type of publication", and the article says "Interview magazine", so maybe the answer is "magazine". But that's redundant. The question probably expects the genre. Since the article doesn't specify beyond it being a magazine, answer N/A.

7. The seventh question is about the prize Han Kang received. The article says she's a Nobel laureate. So the answer is "Nobel Prize".

8. The eighth question asks which practice Betancourt portrays as utopian and equalizing. The text says cruising is described as "equalizing" or "utopian". So the answer is "cruising".

9. The ninth question is about the painter using mounded paraphernalia. The article mentions Salman Toor's work with "beatific mounds of paraphernalia". So the answer is "Salman Toor".

10. The tenth question asks which filmmaker's work shows masks hardening in familiarity. The text references Mike Nichols's "Closer" illustrating that familiarity "calcifies masks". So the answer is "Mike Nichols".

11. The eleventh question asks which film icon Betancourt's imagery calls to mind. He compared his pose to Kate Winslet in "Titanic". So the answer is "Kate Winslet".

12. The twelfth question about establishments implied as legitimate venues. The text mentions bathhouses and piers as places where connections flourish. The question is about a type of establishment in urban settings. Bathhouses are mentioned, so "bathhouses".

13. Thirteenth question: the neck-based detail. The text says "pool of sweat gathering in the nape of my neck". So "nape of the neck" or "sweat in the nape".

14. Fourteenth question: the British author's novel about cruising as egalitarian. The article mentions Alan Hollinghurst's "The Swimming-Pool Library". So the answer is "The Swimming-Pool Library".

15. Fifteenth question: age gap between Scott Turow and Rusty Sabich. The article states Turow is 75, Sabich is 77. The gap is 2 years. So answer "2".

16. Sixteenth question: chapter title about digital interactions. The article lists chapters like "On Sexting". So the answer is "On Sexting".

17. Seventeenth question: which critic Betancourt set aside. The text says he deferred not to W.H. Auden or Roland Barthes but to the personal. So the answer is "Roland Barthes" or "W.H. Auden and Roland Barthes". The question asks for the cultural critic, so both? The question says "influential cultural critic"—maybe Roland Barthes, as Auden is a poet. The text says "W.H. Auden or Roland Barthes", so both are mentioned. The question might accept either, but since it's singular, maybe "Roland Barthes" or "both". But the question says "which influential cultural critic"—so perhaps either. The answer should be "W.H. Auden and Roland Barthes", but the question might expect one. Wait, the article says "defers not to W.H. Auden or Roland Barthes", so both are set aside. Since the question says "which", maybe the answer is both. But the user wants a single answer. Alternatively, "Roland Barthes" since the question might focus on the cultural critic. Hmm, but the answer should be both. However, the question says "which" (singular), so perhaps the answer is "Roland Barthes" as the primary example. Alternatively, the user might accept both names. But according to instructions, if the answer is not directly provided, but here it's explicitly stated, so the answer is "W.H. Auden and Roland Barthes". But maybe the question expects the author to choose one. Wait, the user's example uses "salmon" as a single answer. The text says "Auden or Barthes"—so the answer is both, but since it's a single question, maybe "W.H. Auden and Roland Barthes". Alternatively, perhaps the question expects one of them, but the user might want both. I'll go with both names separated by "and".

Now I'll format each answer with the required tags, ensuring all 17 are present.
