Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful to answer only using the information given and follow the strict format.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks about the method recommended in "Final Exit" for showing consideration to hospital cleaning staff after moving Hemlock to Eugene. The article mentions that "Final Exit" suggested leaving a note apologizing and a generous tip. So the answer is leaving a note and a tip. But the exact wording? Let me check again. The text says, "it is gracious to leave a note apologizing for the shock and inconvenience to the staff. I have also heard of an individual leaving a generous tip to a motel staff." The question specifies after moving to Eugene, but the book was published before moving there. Wait, the Hemlock moved to Eugene in 1990, and "Final Exit" was 1991. The answer is about the method in the book, so the answer is leaving a note and a tip. The question combines both, so the answer is "a note apologizing and a generous tip".

2. **Question 2**: First newspaper after leaving school. The article states: "After leaving school at age 15, Derek got a job as a newspaper messenger. The next year, The Bristol Evening World hired him as a reporter." So the first newspaper was The Bristol Evening World. The second part mentions "Police Power and Black People" was written by him, but the question is about the first newspaper. So answer is The Bristol Evening World.

3. **Question 3**: What prompted Leon Kass to label Humphry "Lord High Executioner"? The article says after Humphry's resignation, Kass had already written that in Commentary magazine. Wait, the text says: "Leon R. Kass wrote in Commentary magazine, calling Mr. Humphry 'the Lord High Executioner.'" The resignation was in 1992, but the book was 1991. The Kass comment was in response to "Final Exit". The question says "after his resignation", but the article doesn't link Kass's comment to the resignation. The prompt is the book "Final Exit", but the question specifies after resignation. Since the resignation was in 1992 and the book was 1991, the Kass comment was before the resignation. Therefore, the answer would be N/A because the prompt isn't after resignation. Wait, the question says "after Humphry's resignation as executive director of the Hemlock Society?" So the answer must be linked to the resignation. But the article states that Kass's comment was in 1991, before the resignation. So the correct answer is N/A because the trigger for Kass's statement wasn't the resignation. Hmm, tricky. The question says "prompted by his resignation", but the article doesn't connect Kass's comment to the resignation. So answer is N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Title of the guide issued by Hemlock before "Final Exit" became a bestseller. The article says in 1981, the Hemlock Society issued "Let Me Die Before I Wake," a guide to medicines. Since "Final Exit" was 1991, the answer is "Let Me Die Before I Wake".

5. **Question 5**: Organization started after divorce from Ann. The article says in 1992, he resigned and started the Euthanasia Research and Guidance Organization. So the answer is Euthanasia Research and Guidance Organization.

6. **Question 6**: Father's profession before mother was a model. The article states: "His father, Royston Martin Humphry, was a traveling salesman. His mother, Bettine (Duggan) Humphry, had been a fashion model before marrying." So the father's job was a traveling salesman.

7. **Question 7**: Exit guide at Final Exit Network who helped start it and credited Humphry. The article mentions Lowrey Brown as an "exit guide" who helped patients and credited him. The question says who helped start the network. The article states "Mr. Humphry helped start the Final Exit Network". The exit guide mentioned is Lowrey Brown, so the answer is Lowrey Brown.

8. **Question 8**: Organization founded after helping Jean, chronicled in "Let Me Die..."? The article says after Jean's death, he wrote "Jean's Way" and later founded Hemlock Society with his second wife. The Hemlock Society was founded in 1980. "Let Me Die Before I Wake" was the 1981 guide. So the organization is Hemlock Society.

9. **Question 9**: Newspaper where Ann suggested "Hemlock" as name. The article says when he was working in California for The Los Angeles Times, Ann suggested the name. So the answer is The Los Angeles Times.

10. **Question 10**: Third wife's name. The article says he married Gretchen Crocker in 1991, who survived him. The first wife was Jean, second Ann, third is Gretchen.

11. **Question 11**: Organization after aiding spouse. After Jean's death, he founded Hemlock Society. The question says "based on personal tragedy and professional crusade", so Hemlock Society.

12. **Question 12**: One-volume guide on self-deliverance. The book "Final Exit" is the answer, as it's the step-by-step guide mentioned.

13. **Question 13**: Partner who recorded a video that fueled disputes. Ann Wickett Humphry made a video before her suicide, which caused issues. The answer is Ann Wickett Humphry.

14. **Question 14**: Professor who said Humphry brought the debate to America. The article quotes Ian Dowbiggin: "He was the one who really put this cause on the map in America". So the answer is Ian Dowbiggin.

15. **Question 15**: Newspaper after Daily Mail. The career path: after Daily Mail, he moved to The Sunday Times of London, then LA Times. So after Daily Mail was The Sunday Times.

16. **Question 16**: Memoir before founding the society. The memoir chronicling Jean's death was "Jean's Way" (1979), before Hemlock was founded in 1980. So "Jean's Way".

17. **Question 17**: Whose guide advises leaving a note/tip. The guide is "Final Exit", written by Humphry, so the answer is Derek Humphry.

18. **Question 18**: Family member who was a model. His mother Bettine was a model before marriage. So answer is Bettine (Duggan) Humphry or just Bettine.

19. **Question 19**: Original organization that split into groups like Final Exit Network. The Hemlock Society splintered into groups including Final Exit Network, so the answer is Hemlock Society.

20. **Question 20**: Whose narrative suggests a motel exit with a tip. The text in "Final Exit" says to leave a tip in a motel. So the answer is Derek Humphry.

Now, let me check each answer again against the article to ensure accuracy and that I didn't misread anything. Especially for question 3, the prompt is tricky because the Kass comment was about the book, not the resignation. Since the question specifies after the resignation, which happened in 1992, and Kass's comment was in 1991, the answer is N/A. Similarly, other questions need precise checking.
