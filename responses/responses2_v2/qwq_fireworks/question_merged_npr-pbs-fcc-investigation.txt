Okay, I need to go through each question one by one and find the answers strictly based on the provided article. Let me start by reading through the questions again to make sure I don't miss any.

1. **Question 1**: Which Republican FCC commissioner publicly supported Brendan Carr's investigation into NPR and PBS's funding practices?  
   The article mentions two FCC commissioners opposing Carr: Anna Gomez and Geoffrey Starks, both Democrats. Since Republicans are the other side, maybe there's no Republican mentioned as supporting. The question asks for a Republican, but the text says the two who opposed were Democrats. So the answer might be N/A because no Republican is named supporting.

2. **Question 2**: How many grant programs did the Trump administration successfully defund through their memo before it was blocked by a judge?  
   The article states the memo cited two grant programs, but it was rescinded after being blocked. It doesn't say they successfully defunded them before the block. So maybe the answer is 0 or N/A since it was blocked before defunding happened.

3. **Question 3**: What percentage of NPR's current operating budget comes from government funding according to Katherine Maher's response?  
   The article doesn't mention any specific percentage from Maher. She talks about compliance but not funding percentages. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: When did the FCC first establish the rules differentiating between commercial advertisements and sponsorship acknowledgments for public broadcasting?  
   The text says the FCC's stance has evolved over years, but no specific starting year is given. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: What financial threshold did Brendan Carr cite as problematic for determining whether sponsorship announcements qualify as commercial advertisements?  
   The article mentions Carr talking about "cross the line into prohibited commercial advertisements" but doesn't specify a financial threshold. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Which Congressional committee did Carr indicate would be receiving his investigation findings first?  
   The article says he planned to notify members of Congress but doesn't mention a specific committee. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: What criteria did Carr outline in his letter for distinguishing between permitted sponsorship acknowledgments and prohibited commercial advertisements?  
   The article states Carr's concern is about "announcements that cross the line into prohibited commercial advertisements" but doesn't detail specific criteria. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: How many local PBS stations were identified in Carr's investigation as potentially violating sponsorship rules?  
   The article doesn't give a number. It just mentions the inquiry is about member stations in general. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: What revenue percentage did Eric Nuzum cite as the typical split between underwriting and other funding sources for public radio stations?  
   The text says the FCC's stance allowed stations to become less dependent on government funding, but no percentage split is mentioned. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Which previous FCC chairman's policies did Carr reference when justifying the timing of this investigation?  
    The article doesn't mention any previous chairman's policies referenced by Carr. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: What percentage increase in federal funding did Katherine Maher request to offset the potential impact of stricter underwriting regulations, as anticipated by executives at NPR and PBS stations?  
    No mention of a specific percentage request by Maher. N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Besides acknowledging the funding source, what additional piece of information, according to Eric Nuzum, is always included in underwriting acknowledgments on NPR, distinguishing them from commercial advertisements?  
    The article says Nuzum mentioned "basic information about the underwriter." So the answer is "basic information about the underwriter."

13. **Question 13**: Which specific clause of the First Amendment did Seth Stern cite as being potentially violated by the actions threatened in the rescinded Trump administration memo, according to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting?  
    The article doesn't mention any specific clause of the First Amendment. N/A.

14. **Question 14**: How many years after the initial FCC regulations on sponsorships were implemented did the commission begin to allow for more permissive underwriting guidelines, leading to decreased reliance on government funding for public broadcasters?  
    The article states the FCC's evolving stance "gradually allowed" but doesn't give a timeframe. N/A.

15. **Question 15**: What specific type of programming, other than educational content and emergency alerts, did Katherine Maher highlight as a key service provided by noncommercial educational broadcasters, justifying continued federal support?  
    The article quotes Maher mentioning "emergency alerts" and "educational programming" but also "essential information." Wait, the exact quote is: "provide essential information, educational programming, and emergency alerts." The question asks for another type besides educational and emergency. So "essential information" is the third, so that's the answer.

16. **Question 16**: In what month and year did the Trump administration issue the memo, later rescinded, that threatened grant programs benefiting local stations, according to NPR executives?  
    The article says "Earlier this week, NPR executives told staff members that a memo issued by Mr. Trump's administration imperiled two grant programs..." but doesn't specify the month/year. Since "this week" is relative, and the article's date isn't given, N/A.

17. **Question 17**: What was the name of the judge who blocked the Trump administration memo that imperiled two grant programs benefiting local stations?  
    The article mentions the memo was blocked by a judge but doesn't name them. N/A.

18. **Question 18**: What alternative funding source, beyond individual donations, did Geoffrey Starks suggest NPR and PBS should explore to mitigate the risk of future funding cuts?  
    The article states Starks had "serious concern" but doesn't mention any alternative funding sources. N/A.

19. **Question 19**: What was the final vote tally in the House of Representatives on the legislation to defund public media?  
    The article's note says there's no pending legislation, so no vote tally. N/A.

20. **Question 20**: What specific legal precedent did Anna Gomez cite in her statement criticizing Brendan Carr's investigation as a potential weaponization of the FCC's power?  
    The article says Gomez called it an attempt to "weaponize the power of the FCC" but doesn't mention a legal precedent. N/A.

Now, compiling the answers accordingly. Make sure each question has an answer tag even if N/A.
