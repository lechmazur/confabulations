Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict instructions given. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks which major electronics retailer reported double-digit sales growth during Black Friday weekend, contributing to the overall 4% increase in holiday retail sales. Looking at the article, the 4% increase is mentioned, but the specific retailers with double-digit growth are Lululemon (11-12%), Abercrombie & Fitch (7-8%), and Target with a 3% increase. There's no mention of an electronics retailer with double-digit growth. So the answer should be N/A.

2. Next, question 2: How many consecutive quarters of sales growth did Macy's experience at their premium locations before announcing the closure of 66 stores? The article states Macy's had sales flat in Q4 but mentions their premium locations (like Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury) had increased sales. However, there's no mention of consecutive quarters of growth. The article says Kohl's had 11 consecutive quarters of decline, but that's a different company. So Macy's premium locations' growth duration isn't specified. Answer N/A.

3. Question 3: What percentage of Signet Jewelers' total revenue came from online sales during the holiday shopping period? The article mentions Signet's comparable sales declining due to lower price points, but there's no breakdown of online vs. in-store revenue. So N/A.

4. Question 4: Which department store chain reported the highest year-over-year increase in children's apparel sales during December? The article says Target saw higher clothes and toys sales, but there's no mention of children's apparel specifically by a department store. Macy's and others aren't noted here. N/A.

5. Question 5: How many Bloomingdale's locations reported increased foot traffic during the week before Christmas? The article says Macy's premium locations (including Bloomingdale's) had increased sales, but no number of locations is given. N/A.

6. Question 6: What percentage of Lululemon's holiday sales came from their new menswear collection? The article mentions Lululemon's sales growth but doesn't break down by product line. N/A.

7. Question 7: Which retail analyst first predicted the unexpected surge in consumer spending during November? The article doesn't name an analyst who predicted it beforehand. It mentions analysts were surprised, but no specific analyst is cited as predicting it. N/A.

8. Question 8: Total retail bankruptcies in December across all segments? The article lists Joann, Container Store, and Party City, but not the total number. N/A.

9. Question 9: How much did consumer spending on luxury goods increase at Bluemercury locations? The article says Bluemercury's comparable sales increased, but "luxury goods" isn't specified. N/A.

10. Question 10: The retailer making $98 leggings and known for athletic wear predicting 11-12% sales growth is Lululemon. The article explicitly states this. So answer Lululemon.

12. Question 12: The retailer with nearly 3% sales increase in Nov/Dec via clothes and toys is Target. The article says Target's sales rose nearly 3%. Answer Target.

13. Question 13: The consultant who cautioned that holiday promotions only delay challenges and growth is cautious is Isaac Krakovsky from EY. The article quotes him saying the growth isn't gangbuster, just cautious. Answer Isaac Krakovsky.
