Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and don't infer anything beyond what's written. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks how many digital-only subscribers CNN added in the last quarter. The article mentions "The New York Times: The company added 350,000 digital-only subscribers in the last quarter..." Wait, but that's talking about The New York Times, not CNN. Oh, right, the question is about CNN. Since the article doesn't mention CNN's subscriber numbers, the answer should be N/A. Wait, let me check again. The article's last paragraphs list other media companies. The part about adding subscribers is under "The New York Times", so CNN's info isn't there. So answer is N/A.

2. The second question is about what type of financial firm Mark Thompson's former employer moved to position itself as. Mark Thompson is CNN's CEO. The article says "Trump's social media company is moving to position itself as a financial services firm..." So the company is Trump's social media company, which is his former employer? Wait, Mark Thompson is at CNN, so his former employer might not be Trump's company. Wait, the question says "Mark Thompson's former employer" but the article says "Trump's social media company is moving to position itself as a financial services firm". Since the question is about Thompson's former employer, but the article doesn't mention his previous job, so N/A? Wait, maybe I misread. The article says "Mark Thompson, CNN's chief executive, informed Mr. Acosta..." So Thompson is currently at CNN. His former employer isn't mentioned here. The financial firm part refers to Trump's company. Since the question is about Thompson's former employer, which isn't stated, the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "Mark Thompson's former employer" â€” since the article only mentions his current role, the answer is N/A. Hmm, but maybe the question is a trick? Let me check again. The article says "Trump's social media company is moving to position itself as a financial services firm..." So the answer would be "financial services firm", but the question is about Thompson's former employer. Since that's not linked, I think it's N/A. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake, but according to instructions, if the question has an incorrect premise, answer N/A. Since Thompson's former employer isn't mentioned, answer is N/A. Wait, but the question might be referring to Trump's company as the employer? No, that's not. The question is about Thompson's former employer, which isn't in the text. So N/A.

3. The third question: What prompted the lawsuit between CBS and the individual who noted Acosta's departure in a social media post? The individual who noted Acosta's departure is President Trump, as per the article: "President Trump spread unfounded claims..." The lawsuit mentioned is between CBS and Trump? The article says "The Federal Communications Commission released the transcript of a '60 Minutes' interview with Vice President Kamala Harris that has been at the center of a lawsuit between CBS and Trump." So the lawsuit is between CBS and Trump over the interview's transcript. Therefore, the prompt was the lawsuit involving the 60 Minutes interview. The question asks what prompted the lawsuit between CBS and Trump (the individual who noted the departure). The answer would be the "60 Minutes" interview's transcript. The article says the FCC released the transcript which was at the center of the lawsuit. So the lawsuit was over the interview. So answer is "the '60 Minutes' interview with Vice President Kamala Harris" or just "60 Minutes interview"? The question says "what prompted the lawsuit", so the prompt was the FCC's release? Wait, the lawsuit was between CBS and Trump. The article states that the FCC released the transcript that was at the center of the lawsuit. So the lawsuit was about the interview, so the answer is "the '60 Minutes' interview with Kamala Harris".

4. The fourth question: Besides Wolf Blitzer, who else was mentioned as grateful for Acosta's dedication? The article says in CNN's statement: "Jim has had a long, distinguished nearly 20-year career at CNN, with a track record of standing up to authority..." So the statement is from CNN, so the other person besides Wolf would be CNN. But Wolf Blitzer isn't mentioned as being grateful, the network is. The question says "besides Wolf Blitzer, who else was mentioned...". The answer is CNN, as the statement is from CNN. So the answer is "CNN".

5. The fifth question: What was the name of the email newsletter that reported on the tension between Acosta and CNN? The article mentions "Status, an email newsletter, earlier reported on the tension between Mr. Acosta and CNN." So the answer is "Status".

6. Sixth question: In what city did the journalist (Acosta) have the highlight of his career during the Obama administration? The article says during a trip to Cuba, he asked Raul Castro about political prisoners. So the city would be Havana, Cuba. But the article just says "Cuba" without specifying the city. Since the question asks for the city, and the text only mentions Cuba, the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe the city isn't specified. The article says "during a trip to Cuba", so the city isn't named. So answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is tricking me because the highlight was in Cuba, but the city isn't given. So N/A.

7. Seventh question: What is the name of the new streaming service CNN is working on? The article says "CNN said last week it was working on a new streaming service" but doesn't name it. So answer N/A.

8. Eighth question: What was the total viewership ranking of Acosta's show compared to competitors? The article states "Mr. Acosta's show is third place in his time slot for total viewers, behind both MSNBC and Fox News". So third place.

9. Ninth question: Who is taking over Acosta's show? The article says "Wolf Blitzer, a well-known CNN anchor, along with a co-anchor, Pamela Brown." So Wolf Blitzer and Pamela Brown. The question says "who else", but the answer is Wolf Blitzer and Pamela Brown. Since the question is "who is taking over", the answer would be Wolf Blitzer and his co-anchor Pamela Brown. But the question might just need the names. The answer should list both? The question says "who else", but the main person is Wolf, so answer is Wolf Blitzer and Pamela Brown. But maybe the question wants the main person, Wolf Blitzer. The article says "Wolf Blitzer... along with a co-anchor, Pamela Brown." So the show is being moved to Wolf and Pamela. Since the question is "who is taking over", the answer is Wolf Blitzer and Pamela Brown. But the answer might require both names. Let me check the instructions: if the question asks for two people and only one is mentioned, it's N/A. Wait, the question is "who else", but the article mentions both. So the answer is Wolf Blitzer and Pamela Brown. But the question says "who else", but the answer is both. But the question might be expecting the names. So the answer is "Wolf Blitzer and Pamela Brown".

10. Tenth question: What role at Fox News will be taken by the family member of the person who claimed the government paid news outlets for positive coverage? The article mentions "Lara Trump, Trump's daughter-in-law, will host a new weekend show on Fox News." The person who claimed the government paid is Trump. Lara is his daughter-in-law. So the role is "host of a new weekend show".

11. Eleventh question: Amid the reorganization, what time did Acosta's final broadcast occur? The article says "he announced the decision at the end of his 10 a.m. show, which will be his last for CNN." So the time is 10 a.m.

12. Twelfth question: Which anchor replaced Acosta despite his key demographic performance? The article says Wolf Blitzer is moving into his slot. So Wolf Blitzer.

13. Thirteenth question: Reflecting on his interview in Cuba, who raised questions about political prisoners? That was Acosta himself. The article says "Mr. Acosta said that the highlight of his career... when he asked Cuban President Raul Castro..." So the answer is Jim Acosta.

14. Fourteenth question: What initiative required hiring 100 new employees? The article states "planned to hire roughly 100 people in new roles during the first half of the year" as part of the pivot to digital and the new streaming service. So the answer is "the new streaming service".

15. Fifteenth question: What remaining duration on his contract? The article says "he still has one year left on his CNN contract".

16. Sixteenth question: What was Acosta's concern about the midnight shift? He was "wary that he was being shuffled to the graveyard shift as part of a plan to sideline journalists who have been critical of President Trump." So the concern was being sidelined for being critical of Trump.

17. Seventeenth question: Who notified him about the time change? Mark Thompson, CNN's CEO.

18. Eighteenth question: Which competitor underperformed in key demographics compared to Acosta? The article says "he has outperformed his MSNBC competitor in the key demographic for advertisers." So MSNBC's show underperformed compared to Acosta's.

19. Nineteenth question: What family background element did he mention? He's the son of a Cuban refugee, which he referenced to emphasize his resolve.

20. Twentieth question: Which network is undergoing changes? CNN.
