Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article provided.

1. **Question 1:** The company co-founded by Dr. Stoddart in 2021 related to solar energy storage? The article mentions H2MOF for hydrogen storage, but the question says "solar energy." Wait, the article says H2MOF is for hydrogen storage, which is a clean fuel. The question might have a mistake, but since the article only mentions H2MOF as the 2021 company, I'll go with that. Answer: H2MOF.

2. **Question 2:** The molecular machine from 1991 with a ring and dumbbell structure. The article states rotaxanes were made in 1991. The skin-care product uses nano vessels from rotaxanes? The answer is rotaxanes.

3. **Question 3:** Childhood hobby with construction sets that inspired the molecular car. The article says he played with Meccano sets and later the molecular car. So Meccano sets are the answer.

4. **Question 4:** Childhood pastime that seeded nanomachines. The article mentions his play with construction sets and fixing engines. Since engines are part of mechanics, maybe the engine repair? But the first hobby is construction sets. The answer is Meccano sets.

5. **Question 5:** Number of daughters with doctoral degrees. The article says two daughters, Fiona and Alison, both earned doctorates. Answer: 2.

6. **Question 6:** Alphanumeric name of the hydrogen storage company. The article says H2MOF. So that's the answer.

7. **Question 7:** Distance of the molecular elevator. The article states 0.7 billionths of a meter. Answer: 0.7.

8. **Question 8:** Skin-care brand name. The article mentions Noble Panacea. Answer: Noble Panacea.

9. **Question 9:** Year at Northwestern University. The article says 2008. Answer: 2008.

10. **Question 10:** Activity influencing molecular synthesis. The article mentions dismantling and reassembling engines. Answer: dismantling and reassembling engines.

11. **Question 11:** Most recent institution before death. The article says he was recruited by the University of Hong Kong in 2023. Answer: University of Hong Kong in Hong Kong.

12. **Question 12:** Molecular structure synthesized at Birmingham. The article says he synthesized rotaxanes there. Answer: rotaxanes.

13. **Question 13:** Mentoring principle. The article states he allowed teams to work together, not top-down. The key phrase is "allow the brains of 30 people to work... new approach." The answer is collaborative teamwork or "allow the brains of the team to work together" but the exact quote is "fashion something new, make it possible for young people to express creativity" so maybe the principle is fostering creativity through collaboration. However, the article says "put a team together... not top-down" so the principle is team collaboration. The exact words he used were "I am rebelling against the hierarchical system... put a team together and allow the brains of 30 people to work on something rather than a top-down approach." So the principle is team-based collaboration. The answer is "team-based collaboration" but the question asks for the single guiding principle. The article says "put a team together and allow the brains..." so the principle is "team collaboration" or "collaborative approach." Alternatively, the exact quote he said was "I am going to fashion something that is new, and I'm going to make it possible for young people with amazing talent to express their creativity." So the principle is "allowing creativity through collaboration." But maybe the key is "team-based approach" or "collaborative research." The article's exact wording for the principle is "put a team together and you allow the brains of 30 people to work on something rather than a top-down approach." So the principle is "team collaboration" or "team-based approach." The answer is "team collaboration" but the question says "single guiding principle," so maybe "collaborative teamwork" or "teamwork." Alternatively, the article says "I've recognized that you put a team together..." so the principle is "team collaboration." But maybe the exact term is "mechanostereochemistry" but no. The answer should be the principle he adopted, which is team-based rather than top-down. The answer is "team collaboration" but the article might have a specific phrase. Alternatively, the answer is "team-based approach." The article says "I am going to fashion something that is new, and I'm going to make it possible for young people with amazing talent to express their creativity." So the principle is "fostering creativity through collaboration" but the question asks for the single guiding principle. The key is "team-based collaboration." The answer is "team collaboration" or "collaborative approach." Alternatively, the exact words he used were "put a team together and you allow the brains of 30 people to work on something rather than a top-down approach." The principle is "team-based collaboration." The answer is "team collaboration" but the question might expect a specific term from the text. Wait, the article says "I am rebelling against the hierarchical system that visited me in the early part of my career, and I said I am not going to go down that road. I am going to fashion something that is new, and I'm going to make it possible for young people with amazing talent to express their creativity." The principle is "allowing creativity through collaboration" but the article says "team together" so the principle is "team collaboration." Alternatively, maybe the answer is "collaborative research." Alternatively, the answer is "team-based approach." Since the question asks for the single guiding principle, the answer is "team-based collaboration" but perhaps the exact wording from the article is "team together." Wait, the article says "you put a team together and you allow the brains of 30 people to work on something rather than a top-down approach." The principle is "team collaboration" or "team-based approach." The answer should be "team-based collaboration." Alternatively, the answer is "team collaboration." The exact phrase might be "team collaboration" but since the user wants the exact answer from the text, maybe the principle is "allow the brains of the team to work together." However, the question says "single guiding principle," so the best answer is "team-based collaboration" or "collaborative approach." Alternatively, the article says "put a team together" so the principle is "team collaboration." The answer is "team collaboration."
