Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let me start with the first question.

1. **Question 1:** Which pharmaceutical company's CEO testified before Congress about the impact of Medicare price negotiations on their obesity drug research pipeline?

Looking through the article, I remember that Novo Nordisk is mentioned as the manufacturer of Ozempic and Wegovy. The article also mentions Stephen Ubl, CEO of the drug industry's lobbying group, criticizing the program. However, there's no mention of a specific CEO from a pharmaceutical company testifying about the research pipeline. The article says "Jamie Bennett, a spokeswoman for the company, said it is 'deeply concerned' about the program..." but no testimony before Congress. So this might be N/A.

Wait, the question is about a CEO's testimony. The article mentions Stephen Ubl as the CEO of the lobbying group, not a pharmaceutical company. The company is Novo Nordisk, but their CEO isn't named here. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many dollars per month did the Congressional Budget Office estimate Medicare beneficiaries would save on Wegovy after the 2027 price negotiations?

The article says "the C.B.O. projected that Medicare's prices for semaglutide products 'will fall substantially beginning in 2027.' That would also open the door to lower prices for competing obesity drugs like Eli Lilly's Zepbound." But it doesn't specify a dollar amount per month. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** What percentage reduction in Medicare spending did Robert F. Kennedy Jr. predict would result from the drug price negotiations?

The article mentions Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the health secretary pick, but he hasn't focused on drug prices. There's no mention of him predicting a percentage reduction. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Which Republican senators introduced legislation to modify the negotiation timeline for Ozempic while preserving the core program?

The article states "several Republicans in Congress have introduced legislation, backed by the drug industry, that would repeal or tweak the program." But it doesn't name specific senators or mention Ozempic specifically. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** How many additional Medicare recipients would gain coverage for obesity medications under the Trump administration's modified version of Biden's proposal?

The article says the Biden proposal would expand coverage to millions, but the Trump administration's stance is unclear. There's no number given for how many under their modified version. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** What was the average price reduction achieved for diabetes medications in the first round of Medicare negotiations that concluded last summer?

The article mentions "prices will go into effect in 2027. 1. Ozempic..." but in the first round, drugmakers were relieved the cuts weren't deeper. However, no specific average percentage is given. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Which state attorneys general joined Novo Nordisk's lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Medicare drug price negotiations?

The article states Novo Nordisk sued but doesn't mention state attorneys general joining. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** What alternative obesity treatment protocol did Robert F. Kennedy Jr. outline as his preferred approach instead of Ozempic?

The article says Kennedy criticized Ozempic, saying it's inferior to healthy food. So the protocol would be consuming healthy food. That's mentioned directly.

9. **Question 9:** How many months before the November deadline did the Trump administration indicate they would announce the negotiated prices?

The law requires the deadline by end of November. The article mentions "the law gives the Trump administration a deadline of the end of November to announce..." but doesn't say when they indicated they would announce it before that. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** What role did Jamie Bennett specify that pharmacy benefit managers would play in implementing the new Medicare drug prices?

The article says "Pharmacy benefit managers... would have more leverage to demand lower prices closer to what the government pays for semaglutide." So their role is to demand lower prices using the government's prices as leverage. The exact wording from Jamie Bennett isn't quoted here, but the article states their role. Wait, the question is about what Jamie Bennett specified. The article only quotes her as saying the company is concerned about the program. So maybe N/A? Wait the article says "Jamie Bennett, a spokeswoman for the company, said it is 'deeply concerned'..." but the part about pharmacy benefit managers is from the CBO's projection. So the role isn't specified by Jamie Bennett. Answer N/A.

11. **Question 11:** By the end of which month is the Trump administration mandated to announce new Medicare prices?

The article says "the law gives the Trump administration a deadline of the end of November to announce Medicare's new prices..." So November.

12. **Question 12:** Who is the nominee known for comparing Ozempic unfavorably to healthy food?

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the nominee for health secretary, and the article states he "has been vocal in his criticism of Ozempic, which he says is inferior to consuming healthy food." So his name.

13. **Question 13:** In which year are Medicareâ€™s negotiated prices for semaglutide-based drugs expected to decline substantially?

The article says "the C.B.O. projected that Medicare's prices for semaglutide products 'will fall substantially beginning in 2027.'" So 2027.

14. **Question 14:** What broader market impact is anticipated for competing drugs like Zepbound if deep cuts occur?

The article states "That would also open the door to lower prices for competing obesity drugs like Eli Lilly's Zepbound." So lower prices for competitors.

15. **Question 15:** What condition does Medicare exclude when prescribing Wegovy?

The article says "Medicare now covers... Wegovy for a much smaller number who have both heart problems and obesity, but the agency is not allowed to cover Wegovy for weight loss alone." So the excluded condition is weight loss alone.

16. **Question 16:** Which legislative act established the negotiation program?

The article mentions "the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden's signature legislation." So that's the answer.

17. **Question 17:** Which company produces the weight-loss drugs facing price cuts?

Novo Nordisk, as stated in the article.

18. **Question 18:** Which agency did Trump call for closing before staff suspensions?

The article says "Trump directly called for the closure of the U.S. Agency for International Development..." So USAID.

19. **Question 19:** Which administration proposed expanding Medicare's coverage for obesity drugs?

The Biden administration's proposal is mentioned, so answer Biden's.

20. **Question 20:** What leverage would pharmacy benefit managers gain?

The article says "Pharmacy benefit managers... would have more leverage to demand lower prices closer to what the government pays for semaglutide." So leverage to demand lower prices.
