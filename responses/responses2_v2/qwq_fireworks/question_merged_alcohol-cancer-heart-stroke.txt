Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly what's asked. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks about the percentage reduction in diabetes risk for men drinking two drinks daily, exceeding the women's guidelines. The article mentions that women with one drink a day may have lower diabetes risk. But for men at two drinks, the article doesn't specify a percentage. The answer should be N/A because the text doesn't provide that number.

2. The second question is about an organization related to Dr. Naimi's support that would view a 15-year-old drinking three drinks as alarming. The article says Dr. Naimi received support from a temperance organization. The specific one mentioned is the one that promotes temperance, which is named as the "Alcohol Policy Conference" but the exact name of the organization funding him? Wait, the text states: "Dr. Naimi received support for a meeting from an organization that promotes temperance, the statement noted, and served as co-chair of the scientific advisory board of the Alcohol Policy Conference..." So the organization that promotes temperance isn't named, but the question asks for the specific organization mentioned in relation to Dr. Naimi's support. The answer is the one that promotes temperance, but the exact name isn't given except that it's an organization promoting temperance. Wait, the question says "specific organization mentioned in relation to Dr. Naimi's support". The text says "an organization that promotes temperance" but doesn't name it. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question might be looking for the Alcohol Policy Conference? But the support was from the unnamed temperance organization. Hmm. Wait, the question says "what specific governmental body... might be seen as having a conflicting interest?" Wait, no, the second question is asking for the organization that promotes temperance. The article mentions "an organization that promotes temperance" but doesn't name it. So the answer would be N/A. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The exact quote is: "Dr. Naimi received support for a meeting from an organization that promotes temperance, the statement noted..." The organization's name isn't given, so the answer is N/A. But the question says "specific organization mentioned in relation to Dr. Naimi's support"—since it's not named, answer is N/A. But maybe I missed it? Wait, the Alcohol Policy Conference is mentioned as where he's co-chair, but the support was from another organization. Since the name isn't provided, the answer is N/A.

Wait, the question says "specific organization, mentioned in relation to Dr. Naimi's support". The article mentions an organization that promotes temperance, but doesn't name it. Therefore, the answer must be N/A. But maybe the question refers to the Alcohol Policy Conference? No, because the support was from the unnamed temperance group. So question 2's answer is N/A. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake here.

3. The third question asks which governmental body prepared the report, which the industry is criticizing for bias. The report was prepared under the auspices of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as per the article: "the report, prepared by a scientific review panel under the auspices of the Department of Health and Human Services". So the answer is Department of Health and Human Services. 

4. The fourth question asks which Canadian institute connected to an author might study the trade-off between diabetes risk reduction and cancer risk. The author mentioned is Dr. Naimi, who is the director of the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research. So the answer is Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research.

5. The fifth question: at what consumption level do the protective benefits against blood clot strokes disappear and mortality risks increase. The article states that the reduction in strokes from one drink daily disappears at two or more, and overall mortality increases. So the answer is two drinks daily.

6. The sixth question: which federal department's panel produced the report. The report was by HHS's scientific review panel. So Department of Health and Human Services.

7. The seventh question: the odds increase factor for a 15-year-old going from one weekly to three daily drinks. The article says "the odds of a death attributed to alcohol increases more than tenfold". So the answer is more than tenfold. But the question says "by what factor"—so "more than tenfold" is the exact phrase. But the answer should be "more than tenfold" or the numerical value. The text says "increases more than tenfold", so the answer is more than tenfold.

8. Eighth question: which health condition in women sees reduced risk with one drink. The article mentions diabetes: "Women who have one drink a day may have a lower risk of diabetes." So the answer is diabetes.

9. Ninth question: which organization's review linked moderate drinking to lower heart attack/stroke deaths but noted breast cancer. The National Academies' review is mentioned as saying moderate drinking linked to fewer heart attack and stroke deaths but noted breast cancer. So the answer is National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.

10. Tenth question: smallest number of drinks initiating cancer risk. The article states "the increased cancer risk comes with any amount of alcohol consumption". So the smallest number is one.

11. Eleventh question: which gender is more susceptible to liver cancer at one drink. The article says "Women face a higher risk of developing liver cancer even at this modest level of drinking." So women.

12. Twelfth question: the unchanged guideline for men. The article says the final guidelines kept two drinks for men and one for women. So two drinks.

13. Thirteenth question: which author received support from the temperance org and is co-chair of the Alcohol Policy Conference's board. Dr. Naimi is mentioned as receiving support from the temperance org and serving as co-chair of the Alcohol Policy Conference's advisory board. So the answer is Dr. Timothy Naimi.

14. Fourteenth question: the warning labels would mirror those on cigarettes. The surgeon general called for cancer warnings similar to cigarettes. So the answer is cancer warnings.
