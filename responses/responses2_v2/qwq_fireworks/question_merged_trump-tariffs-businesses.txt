Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information given in the article and answer exactly what's asked. Let me start with the first question.

1. Which specific European countries did Trump propose a 200% tariff on according to the article?
The article mentions "levies ranging from 10 to 200 percent on products from China, Canada, Mexico, the European Union and elsewhere." Wait, it says "European Union" as a whole, not specific countries. So the answer is N/A because it's the EU, not specific countries like France or Germany.

2. How many retail executives in the Conference Board survey said they were actively relocating their supply chains to India?
The article says a third of executives were seeking to diversify supply chains, but it doesn't mention India specifically. So N/A because the destination isn't specified.

3. What percentage increase in sales did Klem's report during the pandemic period mentioned in the article?
The article says Klem's faced challenges including the pandemic, but doesn't mention sales percentages. So N/A.

4. Which U.S. senator did the Chamber of Commerce president quote when discussing the impact of tariffs on American consumers?
The Chamber's president Suzanne Clark gave a speech, but there's no mention of quoting a senator. N/A.

5. What was the average price difference between domestic and imported lawn mowers at Klem's store?
The article compares work boots: domestic $350-$400 vs imported $150-$250. But the question is about lawn mowers. The article says suppliers told Bettencourt they'd pass on tariff costs for lawn mowers, but no price difference is given. N/A.

6. How many jobs did Atlas Tool Works president Zach Mottl predict would be created by Trump's universal tariff plan?
The article quotes Mottl saying the plan would "spur domestic job creation" but doesn't specify a number. N/A.

7. What percentage of Steve Madden's production will remain in China after their planned reduction in imports?
Steve Madden would slash imports from China by up to 45%, so remaining would be 55%. But the article says "imports from China by as much as 45%", so the remaining is 55%? Wait, the question is about production remaining, but the article says imports, not production. The article says "imports from China by as much as 45 percent next year", so if they reduce imports by 45%, then 55% remains. But the question is about production, but maybe it's about imports. The answer might be 55%, but need to check wording. The question says "production will remain in China", but the article says "imports from China by as much as 45 percent", so maybe it's imports, not production. The question might be a trick. Since the article doesn't mention production location, but imports, so N/A? Hmm. The article says "imports from China by as much as 45 percent next year in preparation for more tariffs." So the imports would be reduced by 45%, so remaining imports would be 55%? The question asks what percentage of their production will remain in China. If the production is in China and they are reducing imports (assuming production is in China), then 55%? But the article doesn't explicitly say that the reduction in imports is due to moving production out. Maybe the question is about imports, not production. Since the question is about production, but the article only mentions imports, so N/A.

8. Which month did Morgan Stanley's economic forecast predict Trump would implement the first wave of new tariffs?
The article mentions Sarah Wolfe from Morgan Stanley discussing tariffs as a wild card, but no specific month is given. N/A.

9. What was the total attendance from Asian countries at the retail conference in Manhattan?
The article states 40,000 attendees from over 120 countries, but doesn't break down by region. N/A.

10. How much additional revenue did the Trump administration project these new tariffs would generate for tax cut funding?
The article says Trump wanted tariffs to fund tax cuts but no specific amount is mentioned. N/A.

11. What percentage increase in tariffs on goods from Vietnam did Steve Madden, the shoe brand, announce it was preparing for?
The article doesn't mention Vietnam-specific tariffs for Steve Madden. They reduced imports from China, but no info on Vietnam. N/A.

12. How many retail stores, facing potential decimation from tariff increases, did Jessica Bettencourt inherit from her grandparents?
The article says Klem's was started by her grandparents in 1949, but doesn't say how many stores. The store is singular. So answer 1.

13. What was the geopolitical issue that concerned more than half of the corporate executives surveyed by the Conference Board in a post-election survey?
The article states that over 40% cited trade wars as the most concerning geopolitical issue. More than half would be over 50%, but the article says over 40%, so N/A.

14. Which country, other than China, did Michael Coleman say was a sole source of fireworks?
The article says fireworks can only be made in China. So no other country, so N/A.

15. What is the name of the law firm where Everett Eissenstat is a partner?
The article says Squire Patton Boggs. So that's the answer.

16. What was the highest price of the American-made work boots sold at Klem's?
The article says domestic boots are $350-$400, so highest is $400.

17. Besides funding tax cuts and persuading other countries to stem the flows of drugs and migrants, what was the third specific goal?
The article lists "cajoling companies to make their products in the United States" as one of the goals. So that's the third.

18. What was the total number of attendees, representing over 150 countries, at the retail conference?
The article says 40,000 attendees from over 120 countries. The question asks over 150, but the article says over 120. So the number is 40,000 but the countries are 120+, so the question's premise (over 150) isn't met. Therefore, N/A.

19. What specific type of product, already facing supply chain issues, did the makers inform Jessica Bettencourt would see cost increases passed on due to tariffs?
The article mentions lawn mowers and snow blowers as products where suppliers told her they would pass on tariff costs. So answer is lawn mowers and snow blowers. Wait, the question says "specific type", so maybe just one? The question says "specific type", so the answer is lawn mowers and snow blowers. But the answer should be in the exact terms. The article says "Makers of lawn mowers and snow blowers... have already told Ms. Bettencourt that they would pass on costs from tariffs". So the answer is "lawn mowers and snow blowers".

20. In what month did Steve Madden announce it would slash its imports from China?
The article says "In November, Steve Madden... said it would slash its imports..." So November.
