Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and follow the instructions strictly. Let's start with question 1.

1. The first question asks about Hammerstein's direct inspiration for "Show Boat" score, specifically mentioning Dionne McClain-Freeney's approach. The article mentions that "Show Boat" was inspired by Edna Ferber's novel, but the question is about another musical. Wait, the article says that Hammerstein and Rodgers did "Oklahoma!" and "Carousel". But the question is about an earlier musical that was an inspiration. Wait, the article states that "Show Boat" was the first of their collaborations, so maybe the question is wrong? Wait, the article says "Hammerstein would carry on and master with Richard Rodgers in shows like Oklahoma! and Carousel." So maybe the question is tricking me here. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to another musical that Hammerstein used as inspiration. Hmm, the article says "Show Boat" was inspired by Ferber's novel, but the question is about a musical that Hammerstein used as direct inspiration. Wait, the article mentions that "Show Boat" was between operetta and popular entertainment. Maybe the answer is "operetta"? But the question is asking for a specific musical. Wait, maybe the question is a trick because the article doesn't mention another specific musical Hammerstein used as inspiration. Let me check again. The article says "Hammerstein's attitude was more nuanced, and progressive." But I don't see any mention of another musical that was an inspiration. Maybe the answer is N/A here? Wait, the question says "mirroring its integration of diverse musical styles." The article mentions "Show Boat" used spirituals, parlor songs, and Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue." Maybe the inspiration is operetta? But the question wants a specific musical. Hmm. I might have to say N/A here. Wait, the first paragraph mentions that "Show Boat" was a pioneer between operetta and popular entertainment. But the question is about Hammerstein's direct inspiration for the score. The article doesn't name another specific musical, so maybe the answer is N/A.

2. The second question: Paul Robeson altered "Ol' Man River." The 1988 recording had Frederica von Stade. The question is asking what role she originally performed in the first Broadway production. Wait, the article says "Frederica von Stade, Teresa Stratas and Bruce Hubbard, as Joe." Wait, no, the 1988 recording is a recording project that included Bruce Hubbard as Joe. The first Broadway production's original cast had Paul Robeson as Joe. The question is about what role Frederica von Stade originally performed in the first production. But the article doesn't mention Frederica being in the first production. She's part of the 1988 recording. So maybe she wasn't in the original. The question might be a trick. So the answer is N/A.

3. The third question: If Hattie McDaniel had declined, who would be a likely replacement based on casting practices? The article mentions that in the 1936 film, Queenie was played by Hattie McDaniel. The casting practices at the time used Black actors in stereotypical roles. The question asks which Broadway star mentioned in connection with another musical would be a replacement. The article mentions "Idina Menzel Goes Out on a Limb: Menzel... is back on Broadway in 'Redwood'..." but that's recent. Wait, the article also mentions "Jimmy Fallon's Jitters..." but he's not an actor from that era. Wait, perhaps the article refers to someone else. Wait, looking back, the article mentions "Tess Gardella, an Italian American performer known for her blackface stage persona, Aunt Jemima." So maybe Tess Gardella? But she was in the original 1927 production. Since the 1936 film's Queenie was McDaniel, if she declined, maybe they would have used another Black actress of the time. The article doesn't name another Broadway star from that era connected to another musical. The only other Black performer mentioned is Paul Robeson, but he played Joe, not Queenie. So maybe N/A, since the article doesn't mention another Broadway star in that context. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the article mentions "Hattie McDaniel, who would go on to be the first Black woman to win an Academy Award..." so maybe no one else is mentioned. So answer N/A.

4. The fourth question: Besides "Show Boat," what other musical did Kern and Hammerstein consider adapting before Ferber's novel? The article says Kern was reading Ferber's novel when he decided to adapt it. The question is about another musical they considered. The article doesn't mention any other work they considered. The answer is N/A.

5. The fifth question: The 1988 recording controversy involved John McGlinn wanting to restore a racial epithet. The question asks what dance style McGlinn intended to incorporate to emphasize historical scope. The article mentions that the 1988 recording was operatic in scale. The "In Dahomey" scene involved a pseudo-African style. The question refers to a different context. The article says McGlinn wanted to restore the racial epithet and the Black chorus resigned. The dance style might be "pseudo-African" as in the original "In Dahomey" number. The question says "specific dance style referenced in a different context." The article mentions "pseudo-African style" in the original's "In Dahomey." So the answer is "pseudo-African."

6. Sixth question: Target Margin uses a prop that was in the original "In Dahomey" scene symbolizing objectification. The article says in the original "In Dahomey" scene was a human zoo number, and the Target Margin version uses sashes. Wait, the original scene had "In Dahomey" which was a pseudo-African number. The article says the Target Margin uses sashes to denote whiteness. The question asks what prop from the original's scene is used. The original's scene might have had a "kerchief" mentioned when Hattie McDaniel wore one. The article says "McDaniel wore a kerchief on her head and had the comedic gestures of a mammy caricature." So the kerchief is part of the original's objectification. The Target Margin's prop is sashes. But the question asks what prop from the original's scene was used in their version. Wait, the question says "specific prop... used by the actors in 'Show/Boat: A River'... also a prominent feature in the original production's 'In Dahomey' scene." The original's scene had the kerchief. But Target Margin uses sashes. Hmm, maybe the kerchief is part of the original's objectification, but the question is about the prop used in Target Margin that was in the original. The article says Target's version restored "In Dahomey" with a Zulu text. The original's scene had a "kerchief" but that's for McDaniel's character. The prop might be the "specimens" from the human zoo, but not a specific prop. Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "specific prop, used by the actors in 'Show/Boat: A River,' that was also a prominent feature in the original production's 'In Dahomey' scene." The original's "In Dahomey" had a number with pseudo-African style, perhaps a specific costume element. The article mentions "human zoo number 'In Dahomey,' which adds nothing to the plot and was written in a pseudo-African style." So perhaps the "specimens" in the human zoo, but the question asks for a prop. Alternatively, maybe the kerchief, but that was part of McDaniel's costume. The Target Margin's prop is sashes, which are different. So maybe N/A, but the article says Target's version restored "In Dahomey" with a Zulu text. The original's scene had "specimens" but not a prop. Maybe the answer is N/A.

7. Seventh question: If "Show Boat" premiered in the same year as "Oklahoma!", which lyric by Robeson would have been challenged by Rodgers and Hammerstein's later work. "Oklahoma!" was later, since "Show Boat" was 1927, and "Oklahoma!" is 1943. But the question is hypothetical. The original lyric was "I'm tired of living and scared of dying," which Robeson changed to "I must keep fighting until I'm dying." "Oklahoma!" is about optimism. So the lyric "I'm tired..." would be challenged by the themes of Oklahoma's positive outlook. The answer is "I'm tired of living and scared of dying."

8. Eighth question: Julie's role's racial identity tension relates to a legal precedent from Reconstruction. The article mentions Julie is unmasked as mixed race, leading to her being barred from performing. The legal precedent could be the "separate but equal" doctrine from Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which was overturned by Brown v. Board (1954). Since Reconstruction era (post-Civil War), but Plessy was later. Maybe the answer is the "separate but equal" doctrine from Plessy v. Ferguson, but it was established after Reconstruction. Alternatively, maybe the Civil Rights Act of 1866 or something else. The article says Julie is mixed race, so perhaps the miscegenation laws, which were overturned by Loving v. Virginia (1967). Since the question asks for a precedent established during Reconstruction but later overturned, maybe the answer is "separate but equal" from Plessy v. Ferguson, even though it was 1896, which is post-Reconstruction but the question says "during the Reconstruction era but later overturned." Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the Black Codes, but those were state laws. The article doesn't specify, so maybe N/A. But the question is about legal precedent. The closest is Plessy v. Ferguson, but it's not Reconstruction era. The answer might be N/A.

9. Ninth question: The 1940s shift to opera houses required a vocal technique from Robeson's original role. The article says Robeson had an "organ-like" voice. The technique might be "operatic belting" or "bass-baritone" technique. The article says Kern wrote "Ol' Man River" for Robeson's "organ-like" tone. So the answer is "organ-like vocal tone" or "bass-baritone vocal style." The question asks for a specific vocal technique. The article says "organ-like" so maybe that's it.

10. Tenth question: Criticism of "Show Boat's" racial representations and a theatrical device used by a comedian mentioned. The article mentions "Blue Man Group" in another context. The original used blackface with Tess Gardella as Aunt Jemima. The Blue Man Group uses face paint, but that's not related. Alternatively, the question refers to another comedian. The article mentions "Arrested Development" storyline involving Blue Man Group, but not a comedian's device. Maybe the answer is "blackface," but the question says "theatrical device... employed by a contemporary comedian mentioned in the article." The article's only other mention of a comedian is in the Blue Man Group's "Arrested Development" storyline. Not sure, so maybe N/A.

11. Eleventh question: Target's costume choice that contradicts original racial casting but keeps identity theme. The article says Target's production doesn't cast by race; actors wear sashes to denote whiteness. So the prop is sashes, which contradict the original's racial casting. The answer is "sashes."

12. Twelfth question: Robeson's alterations conflicted with Hammerstein and the 1936 film's intentions. The article says Hammerstein didn't approve of Robeson changing "Ol' Man River," and the film had "Ah Still Suits Me" with stereotypes. The answer is Robeson's changes to "I must keep fighting" instead of the original's resignation.

13. Thirteenth question: Performers from 1936 film involved in 1988 recording restoring racially charged material. The 1936 film had Hattie McDaniel and Paul Robeson. The 1988 recording had Bruce Hubbard as Joe. But the question is about those involved in a project restoring cut material. The article says the 1988 recording by John McGlinn restored material, but the performers from 1936 wouldn't be in the 1988. The answer might be N/A. Unless the question refers to Robeson and McDaniel's roles, but they weren't in the 1988. So N/A.

14. Fourteenth question: Character's departure in 1936 film parallels Magnolia's audition's theme. In the original, Julie quits to let Magnolia audition. The film's Julie (Robeson?) or someone else? The article says in the 1936 film, Robeson played Joe, and McDaniel was Queenie. Julie's role was played by Anne Jeffreys? Not sure, but the departure would be Julie leaving to let Magnolia take her place. The film's version might have the same plot point. So the character is Julie, so the answer is "Julie."

15. Fifteenth question: McClain-Freeney's reworking of "In Dahomey" subverts the original's connection to the World's Fair. The original's "In Dahomey" was a human zoo scene. Target's version uses Zulu praise text, turning it into Black joy instead of objectification. The answer is "Zulu praise text."

16. Sixteenth question: Herskovits's approach addresses Tess Gardella's casting while aligning with Queenie's progressive intent. The article says Target's production uses sashes to denote race, not actual casting. This questions Tess Gardella's Aunt Jemima role by making race a performative choice, thus aligning with Queenie's more nuanced role. The answer is using sashes to show racial identity as a performance.
