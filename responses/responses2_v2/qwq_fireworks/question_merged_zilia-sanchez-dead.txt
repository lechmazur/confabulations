Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions that her father's bedsheet inspired her signature works. But it doesn't specify a Cuban art movement in the 1940s that directly influenced this. The Cuban modernists are mentioned later in the context of critics noting influences, but not as a direct cause. So N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The Venice Biennale is mentioned in 2017 and 2024. The question asks about the exhibition focusing on female warrior mythology ("The Amazons" from 1968 is mentioned, but the Venice shows aren't specified with numbers of pieces. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The text says she designed sets for guerrilla theater troupes in the 60s, but no specific name given. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Klaus Biesenbach helped rebuild her studio after Hurricane Maria in 2017. The article states the hurricane was in 2017, so the year would be 2017.

5. **Question 5**: The article says her palette was mostly black, white, and gray, but mentions she never used red. So the color before using those might be red? Wait, the question is about what she used to represent consciousness before switching. The article says her later work was in those colors, but earlier? Not sure. The "The Amazons" is from 1968, and the article says she avoided red. So maybe she didn't use red there either. Maybe another color? The text doesn't specify colors used in "The Amazons" except that her palette was mostly B/W/gray. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The Greek figure mentioned is Antigone and Joan of Arc, but the armatures' inspiration? The article says the wooden armatures were inspired by the bedsheet's wooden construction. Not a Greek figure. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: First solo exhibition at the Prado isn't mentioned. She studied there but no solo show there. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Victor Manuel Garcia was her mentor in her teens, but the article doesn't connect his mentorship to her canvas stretching technique. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The literary journal is "Zona de Carga y Descarga". The question asks for the name where she published her writings. The article says she created designs for this journal, but not her writings. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The article mentions she studied at Pratt but doesn't name a female Cuban artist who introduced her. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Victor Manuel Garcia's influence: The article says her work in NY was influenced by Minimalism. The question asks if Garcia embraced the same movement. The text doesn't link Garcia to Minimalism, so N/A.

12. **Question 12**: She created photomontages for Zona de Carga y Descarga in the early 70s (since she moved to San Juan "roughly a decade later" after NYC in the 60s, so early 70s? The article says "later that decade" after moving to Puerto Rico in the 70s. So maybe 1970s, but exact year? The article doesn't specify. N/A.

13. **Question 13**: Material for theater sets during revolution. The article mentions she designed sets for guerrilla theater, but the material isn't specified. The bedsheet inspired her later, but the question is about the theater material. N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Structural element similar to armatures in her works in theater sets. The article says her theater sets used wooden structures? Maybe, but not explicitly stated. N/A.

15. **Question 15**: Restoration technique from Prado applied to "The Amazons". The article mentions she studied restoration at Prado but doesn't link it to that specific work. N/A.

16. **Question 16**: Color avoided despite being used by her mentor. The article says she never used red, but does it say her mentor used it? Not explicitly. So N/A.

17. **Question 17**: Printmaking from Pratt used in 2014 exhibition. The article says she studied printmaking at Pratt, but doesn't mention which type was used in Galerie Lelong. So N/A.

18. **Question 18**: Greek tragedy she redesigned sets for. The article mentions Antigone as a figure she explored, but not as a set design. So N/A.

19. **Question 19**: Award from San Alejandro. The article says she enrolled there and started exhibiting abstract work in the 50s, but no specific award mentioned. N/A.

20. **Question 20**: Architectural feature of MoMA PS1 inspiring waves. The article says her studio was rebuilt with Klaus's help after Maria, but no mention of MoMA PS1's features influencing her work. N/A.
