Okay, I need to answer these 20 questions based strictly on the provided article. Let me go through each question one by one and check the article for the answers.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about the percentage decrease in grocery spending for households with two or more people on weight-loss drugs compared to those with just one. The article mentions a study where households with at least one person on the drug spent 6% less, but there's no data on households with two or more. So, this info isn't provided, so N/A.
