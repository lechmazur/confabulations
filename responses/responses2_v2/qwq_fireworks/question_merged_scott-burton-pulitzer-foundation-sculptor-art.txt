Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly what's asked. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions a chapel-like gallery at the Pulitzer where Brancusi's work is paired with Burton's. The question asks if this gallery was designed to replicate Burton's 1970 "Furniture Landscape" performance space. The article says the chapel-like gallery is for pairing with Brancusi, not specifically replicating the 1970 space. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The settee that evokes "little children in the father's arms" is described as a wooden settee. The question asks how many types of wood were used. The article doesn't mention the number of wood types, only that it's wooden. Answer N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Burton's pharmaceutical-assisted sleep performance duration isn't specified in minutes. The article says he "slept deeply" but doesn't give a time. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The completion of Pearlstone Park's design sketches in 1985's month isn't mentioned. The article states Pearlstone Park was completed in 1985 but not the design sketch month. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The 1980 video's performer's shoes are described as wedge-heeled but color isn't mentioned. The article says "long legs exaggerated by wedge-heeled shoes" but no color. Answer N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The number of fingerprint patterns in Fernandes' curtains isn't given. The article mentions "photos of fingerprints from swipe marks" but no quantity. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The selling price of the mother-of-pearl table isn't discussed. The article only mentions it's included in the exhibition. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The specific street for Burton's midnight run isn't named. The article says a "deserted street" but doesn't name it. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The seating capacity for Burton's 1970s performances isn't provided. The article mentions seating audiences close but not the number. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Temperature of onyx when carved isn't mentioned. The article says he preferred working with heated stone but doesn't specify the temperature. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The influence of cross-dressing on Adirondack chair materials isn't stated. The article links cross-dressing to performance but not to materials. N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Fernandes used casters from Burton's child furniture in choreography. The article says the child-size table and chair are on casters. Fernandes' dance had dancers circulating fluidly. Maybe they used the casters for movement, but the article doesn't explicitly say. Wait, the article says "the work now seems historically distant... The work now seems... the child-size table and chair are set on casters." But Fernandes' dance had dancers moving among sculptures. The question is how casters were incorporated. The article doesn't state this, so N/A.

13. **Question 13:** The Two-Part Chaise Longue and Brancusi's bases. The article says Burton admired Brancusi's bases. The chaise's design reflects this? The chaise's two parts might reference bases. The article says the chaise's components are two triangles, which could be like a base and sculpture. So maybe the answer is that the lower part acts as a base like Brancusi's. But the article doesn't explicitly connect the chaise to Brancusi's bases. The critical writings mention Brancusi's bases, but the chaise's reflection isn't specified. So N/A?

Wait, the article states: "Burton admired as much for the bases he crafted as for the art he placed atop them." The Two-Part Chaise Longue has two parts; perhaps the lower part is a base. The answer might be "the lower component as a base," but the question is how it reflects Brancusi's approach. Since the article links Burton's admiration to Brancusi's bases, maybe the chaise's base is an example. But the article doesn't explicitly say this about the chaise. So maybe N/A?

14. **Question 14:** The Pearlstone Park esplanade's non-functional design critiques a 1980s urban project. The article says Burton's remark "It's not really functional for going anywhere" hints at introducing a vocabulary. The question asks which project it directly critiques. The text doesn't name a specific project, so N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Fernandes' gesture corresponding to mirrored tables. The mirrored table evokes self-awareness. Fernandes' dancers had gestures like hand to heart and wrist flips. The article mentions "repeating two gestures... tapping hand to heart, the other, bittersweet, of wrist flipping." The mirrored table's purpose was social self-awareness, so the hand-to-heart might be the symbolic gesture. The answer could be "tapping hand to heart" or "wrist flipping." The article says the mirrored tables were for self-awareness, so the gesture that matches is likely the hand-to-heart. But the question asks which corresponds, so the answer is "tapping hand to heart."

Wait, the question is about the symbolic gesture in Fernandes' choreography that corresponds to the mirrored tables' social self-awareness. The mirrored tables make people self-conscious. Fernandes' gestures might be the hand-to-heart and wrist flip. The article says "the mirrored tabletops... promote public recognition of public values" (from Burton's intent). Fernandes' gestures could be the ones that create self-awareness. The article says Fernandes' dance includes "repeating two gestures... tapping hand to heart, the other, bittersweet, of wrist flipping." The mirrored tables' purpose is to make people aware of each other, so the gesture that reflects this might be the hand-to-heart. So the answer is "tapping hand to heart."

16. **Question 16:** The combat-ready aluminum Adirondack's dimensions influenced by 1970s leather bars. The article mentions David J. Getsy's analysis that Burton's work involves coded gestures necessary for gay men. The combat-ready chair has "out-thrust limbs terminating in wicked points." Getsy says coded behaviors involved in cruising. Maybe the aggressive design reflects leather bar culture's coded signals. The article doesn't explicitly state the dimensions were influenced by that, but it's possible. However, the question is about the dimensions being influenced by the social environment of leather bars according to Getsy's analysis. The article says Getsy links coded gestures to cruising, but does he mention leather bars influencing the chair's dimensions? The article states: "David J. Getsy... argues that a through line... consideration of the ways people dissemble, and signal each other with coded gestures. For gay men (like Burton), such behavior was once a necessity." The combat chair's design might symbolize that, but the question is about the dimensions. The article says "combat-ready, its out-thrust limbs terminating in wicked points." Getsy's analysis connects coded gestures but doesn't explicitly link to dimensions of the chair. So N/A?
