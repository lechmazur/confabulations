merged_net-neutrality-rules-fcc.txt
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions the Supreme Court decision in *Loper Bright* but doesn't specify which justice authored the opinion. The text only refers to the case being cited, not the author. So, answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The article states that the 2010 proposals prompted "torrents of email comments." However, it doesn't provide a specific number. Without an exact figure, the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Tim Wu is described as a Columbia University law professor who coined "net neutrality." The article doesn't say he had a role at the FCC. So, N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The article doesn't name the specific company that filed the original lawsuit. It mentions Comcast and AT&T as opponents but not which one sued. Therefore, N/A.

5. **Question 5:** There's no mention of industry surveys about broadband providers' support for Biden's rules. The article states they drew protests from telecom giants but no percentage. Answer N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The article says the FCC voted in April to restore the rules but doesn't state how many commissioners opposed. Without specifics, N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The Biden regulations' revenue threshold isn't mentioned. The text refers to broadband providers generally, so N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The repeal under Trump is mentioned but the exact month isn't provided. The article says "in his first administration," which is too vague. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The article notes state laws in CA, WA, CO aren't affected but doesn't detail their enforcement mechanisms. So, N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Rosenworcel's tenure before becoming chair isn't stated. The article mentions she's the current chair but no years. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The overturned precedent was from 1984, so the period would be since then. The question asks how many years, so 2023 (current year) minus 1984 = 39. Wait, but the article says "overturned a 1984 legal precedent," so the precedent was in place from 1984 until 2023? But the question is how many years it gave deference. Since Loper Bright was in June (the article is from when? The article mentions the court's decision on Thursday, but the year isn't clear. But the context says "the F.C.C. had voted in April to restore net neutrality," which might be 2023. Assuming the article is current, 1984 to 2023 is 39 years. But the article says "a Supreme Court decision in June, known as Loper Bright, that overturned a 1984 legal precedent." So the precedent was from 1984 until overturned in 2023. So the answer is 39 years? Wait, but the question is asking how many years the precedent gave deference. The answer should be 39. But the article doesn't explicitly state the number of years. Hmm, maybe it's N/A? Wait, the question says "how many years did the legal precedent... originally give deference." The precedent was from 1984 until 2023 (assuming the article is current). So 2023-1984=39. But the article doesn't state the current year. However, the question is asking based on the text. The text says the precedent was overturned in June (the Loper case). The article's date isn't given, but the net neutrality ruling is on Thursday, and the Loper decision was in June. Since the article is about the recent court decision, perhaps the Loper case was recent (2023). Therefore, the precedent was from 1984 to 2023, so 39 years. So the answer is 39. But the article says "overturned a 1984 legal precedent," so the duration was 39 years. But the article doesn't explicitly state the number, so maybe it's N/A. Wait, the question is about the number of years the precedent gave deference. The text says "overturned a 1984 legal precedent that gave deference to government agencies on regulations." So the precedent was in 1984, so until it was overturned (in the Loper case in June, which is when the court decision was made in the article's context). So the duration would be from 1984 until the time of the Loper case. Since the article is about the recent decision, the Loper case must have been in 2023. Therefore, 2023-1984=39 years. Since the article mentions the precedent's year (1984), and the Loper case is recent, the answer is 39. But is this a logical inference allowed? The instructions say to infer if possible. So answer 39?

Wait, but the article says "a Supreme Court decision in June, known as Loper Bright, that overturned a 1984 legal precedent". So the precedent was from 1984 until overturned in the Loper case (June 2023?), so the duration is 2023-1984=39. Since the question asks how many years the precedent gave deference, the answer is 39. But does the article explicitly state that the precedent was from 1984? Yes, so the duration is 39. So answer 39.

12. **Question 12:** Evan Swarztrauber was a former policy adviser to Brendan Carr. The question asks what role similar to Tim Wu's (who introduced net neutrality) he played. The article says he was a policy adviser and the quote mentions ending FCC's vacillations. So perhaps he was an advocate for rolling back regulations. The answer might be "policy adviser" but the question wants a role similar to Wu's. Wu introduced the concept, Swarztrauber supported Carr's stance. The question is about the role similar to Wu's in 2003. Since Wu was the one who coined it, maybe Swarztrauber was an adviser influencing policy, but the exact role? The article says "former policy adviser to Mr. Carr" and his comment on ending FCC's vacillations. So maybe his role was similar in shaping policy discourse, so "policy adviser"? But the question asks for a role similar to Wu's, who was a professor. Maybe N/A unless the article states his role. The article doesn't specify his role beyond being a policy adviser. So answer N/A?

Wait, the question says "role similar to Tim Wu's in 2003, did Evan Swarztrauber play... as a policy advisor?" Since Wu was a law professor who introduced the concept, Swarztrauber's role as a policy adviser might be in shaping discourse but not the same. The article says he was a policy adviser and commented on the court's decision. The question is about a similar role. Since the answer isn't explicitly stated, perhaps N/A.

13. **Question 13:** The article says the court's decision doesn't affect state laws in CA, WA, CO. The question asks for another state besides those three. The text doesn't mention any others, so answer N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Jessica Rosenworcel called for Congress to create laws promoting net neutrality. The answer is "create laws promoting net neutrality" or "put open internet principles in federal law." The exact quote: "take up the charge for net neutrality and put open internet principles in federal law." So the answer is "enact federal legislation for open internet principles" or similar. The question asks what action Carr urged. Wait, the question says "Brendan Carr, mentioned as the incoming F.C.C. chair, urged Congress to take regarding net neutrality?" Wait, the article says Carr said he was pleased and that "the work to unwind the Biden administration's regulatory overreach will continue." But the question is about what legislative action he urged. The article states Rosenworcel called for Congress to act. The question might have a mistake, but according to the text, Carr didn't urge Congress to take action; he wanted to unwind regulations. So the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "Brendan Carr... urged Congress to take." The article says Carr's statement was about being pleased and continuing to unwind, but didn't mention urging Congress. The answer is N/A.

Wait, the question says "Following the court's decision, what specific legislative action did Brendan Carr... urge Congress to take?" The article says Carr's statement was "the work to unwind the Biden administration's regulatory overreach will continue." That's about FCC actions, not legislative. So no mention of Carr urging Congress. Thus, N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Google, Facebook, and Netflix used lobbying. The article says they "lobbied the F.C.C. to create rules." The question asks what mechanism similar to ACA Connects' (which had a CEO praising the ruling). The article says ACA Connects' CEO praised the decision. The question is about the mechanism used by those companies in 2010. The answer would be "lobbying" or "lobbied the FCC". The article says "lobbied the F.C.C. to create rules". So answer "lobbied the FCC" or "lobbying".

16. **Question 16:** The company is ACA Connects, as mentioned: "Grant Spellmeyer, the chief executive of a small cable trade group, ACA Connects." So the answer is "ACA Connects".

17. **Question 17:** The court's reliance on Loper Bright could lead to more lawsuits to hollow out regulations. The article says "the court's reliance on the Loper case in its ruling could also portend more lawsuits to hollow out federal regulations at the F.C.C. and other agencies." So the legal challenge is "lawsuits referencing Loper Bright to erode regulations." The question asks what Jessica Rosenworcel anticipated. Wait, the article says the court's opinion could portend lawsuits, but Rosenworcel is a Democrat who called for Congress. The question is about Jessica Rosenworcel anticipating such challenges. The article doesn't say she did, so maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "Jessica Rosenworcel anticipated might further erode..." The article states Rosenworcel's statement about Congress needing to act, but the part about lawsuits is from the court's opinion. The answer might be "lawsuits to hollow out federal regulations". The exact quote is "the court's reliance on the Loper case... could also portend more lawsuits to hollow out federal regulations". Since the question is about what Rosenworcel anticipated, but the article doesn't say she did. So N/A. Wait, the question says "Jessica Rosenworcel anticipated..." but the article only mentions the court's opinion's effect. So answer N/A.

18. **Question 18:** The opinion was written by Judge Richard Allen Griffin, who acknowledged the FCC's expertise. The article states this in the paragraph starting "Judge Richard Allen Griffin... wrote." The year isn't mentioned. The court decision was on Thursday, but the article doesn't specify the year. Since the article mentions Biden's regulations and Trump's FCC chair, likely 2023. But the question asks the year Griffin wrote the opinion. Since the article doesn't state the year, it's N/A.

19. **Question 19:** The Obama rules aimed to prevent ISPs from blocking content, which might relate to misinformation or harm to youth. The article says "the battle over the regulations continued, with each administration introducing or rolling back the rules... anger has since turned toward social media platforms for their spread of misinformation and harms to young users." The Obama rules aimed to prevent ISPs from blocking content, so maybe preventing ISPs from enabling misinformation? But the article doesn't explicitly state that. The question asks what specific harm the Obama rules aimed to prevent similar to social media's issues. Since it's not directly stated, N/A.

20. **Question 20:** Broadband providers opposed being classified as common carriers because they feared government price setting and utility-style regulation. The article says "they feared that classifying broadband providers as 'common carriers,' like phone companies, opened the door to utility-style regulation and government price setting." So the primary concern is "government price setting and utility-style regulation." The answer is "government price setting and utility-style regulation."
