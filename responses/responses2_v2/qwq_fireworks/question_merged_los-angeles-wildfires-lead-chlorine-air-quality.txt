Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. 

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks about chlorine levels in Paradise, CA during the 2018 Camp Fire. The article mentions a study linking 12,000 deaths to wildfire smoke in 2018 from the Camp Fire, but it doesn't specify chlorine measurements in Paradise. The chlorine levels mentioned are in Pico Rivera during the Eaton Fire, not Paradise. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The question is about lead exposure directly causing deaths. The article states lead levels exceeded EPA limits, but the study mentioned connects 12,000 deaths to smoke overall, not specifically lead. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The primary neurotoxin from burning plastic. Lead is mentioned as a neurotoxin from paint and pipes, while chlorine comes from plastics. Wait, the article says "lead is a neurotoxin" and chlorine is toxic. But the question asks which is the primary neurotoxin in burning plastic. Since lead is from paint, not plastic, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "lead is often present in paint and pipes... chlorine and other chemicals are generated when plastic melts." So burning plastic gives chlorine, not lead. But the neurotoxin is lead. So maybe the answer is N/A since the question asks for the neurotoxin from burning plastic. The article doesn't say chlorine is a neurotoxin, but mentions it's toxic. The neurotoxin here is lead, but it's from paint, not plastic. So the question's answer would be N/A? Hmm, tricky.

4. **Question 4:** Percentage increase in cardiovascular illness in Pico Rivera during Eaton Fire. The article mentions high levels of pollutants linked to increased risk, but no specific percentage given. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Duration of lead spike. The article says levels "briefly but dramatically topped EPA limits" but doesn't specify duration. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Main source of chlorine emissions. The article says chlorine comes from plastic melting, not building materials. Wait, the question asks which building materials in older homes are the main source. Wait, the article says "lead is often present in paint and pipes used in older homes, while chlorine and other chemicals are generated when plastic melts or combusts." So chlorine isn't from building materials but from plastic. The question is about chlorine emissions from building materials? Wait, the question might be a trick. Since chlorine comes from plastic, which isn't a building material like paint or pipes. The article says chlorine is from plastic, so the main source isn't building materials. Therefore, the answer is N/A because the question asks for building materials as the source of chlorine, but chlorine comes from plastic, not the materials like paint or pipes. Wait, the article says "chlorine and other chemicals are generated when plastic melts or combusts." So the building materials for chlorine are not the source. So the answer is N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Mortality rate for children under 5 when lead is 100x. The article says lead exposure is dangerous for children but doesn't provide a specific mortality rate. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Number of ASCENT stations detecting toxics. The article mentions a station in Pico Rivera, but not how many others. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Correlation between distance and lead decay. The article states that lead levels were 100x average even miles away. But does it mention a decay rate correlation? Not explicitly. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Respiratory illness linked to chlorine. The article says chlorine can damage lungs and respiratory tract, but doesn't mention specific illnesses. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Which chemical surged 40x? The article says chlorine reached 40x average. So answer chlorine.

12. **Question 12:** Neurotoxin at 100x far from flames. The article says lead reached 100x even miles away. Lead is the neurotoxin here. So answer lead.

13. **Question 13:** Former official visiting a neighborhood. The article mentions Kamala Harris touring fire damage in Pacific Palisades after leaving office. So answer Kamala Harris.

14. **Question 14:** Regulatory agency's standards exceeded. The article mentions EPA long-term limits. So EPA.

15. **Question 15:** City with ASCENT station during Eaton Fire. The article says measurements were taken in Pico Rivera, CA. So Pico Rivera.

16. **Question 16:** Chemical damaging respiratory tract from plastics. Chlorine is mentioned as toxic and damaging lungs. So chlorine.

17. **Question 17:** Premature deaths in 2018 study. The study says 12,000 Californians. So 12,000.

18. **Question 18:** Monitoring network name. ASCENT.

19. **Question 19:** Term for wildfires fueled by urban materials. The article says "urban wildfires... fueled by the very materials that make up our homes and cities." The exact term used is "urban wildfires."

20. **Question 20:** Caltech PhD candidate quoted. Haroula Baliaka.
