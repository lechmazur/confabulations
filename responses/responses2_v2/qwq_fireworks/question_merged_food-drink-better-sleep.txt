Okay, I need to go through each question one by one and make sure I answer them based strictly on the provided article. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks about Dr. Arab's meta-analysis and the percentage increase in melatonin production from olive oil. The article mentions that Dr. Arab's meta-analysis found links between the Mediterranean diet and lower insomnia risks, but it doesn't specify any percentage increase related to olive oil. So the answer here should be N/A.

2. The second question is about a specific brand of ultraprocessed walnut-flavored cereal linked to sleep disturbances. The article mentions ultraprocessed foods are linked to insomnia but doesn't name any brands. So N/A again.

3. Question three asks for the dosage of tryptophan supplements effective for postmenopausal women with obesity. The article says there's little research on tryptophan-rich foods and only small studies on supplements, but no specific dosage is given. N/A.

4. The fourth question is about a specific type of rice beyond white or brown with high melatonin and fiber. The article lists rice as melatonin-rich but doesn't mention any specific variety. N/A.

5. The fifth question refers to an ingredient in the "sleepy girl mocktail" other than tart cherry juice from Dr. St-Onge's book. The article mentions the mocktail trend but doesn't list specific ingredients beyond cherry juice. N/A.

6. The sixth question asks about a genetic modification of sunflower seeds increasing folate. The article doesn't mention genetic modifications at all. N/A.

7. The seventh question is about who benefited from two servings of tart cherry juice. The article says adults in trials slept longer. The answer here is "adults".

8. The eighth question is the amino acid linked to a popular poultry dish that's a melatonin precursor. Tryptophan is mentioned as in turkey. So the answer is "tryptophan".

9. The amount of walnuts suggested is one-third cup, as stated in the article. So "one-third of a cup".

10. The eating regimen linked to lower insomnia is the Mediterranean-style diet. The article clearly states that.

11. The macronutrient from ultraprocessed foods linked to poor sleep in the 2016 study: the article says saturated fats and sugars. So "saturated fats".

12. The condition to avoid with spicy/high-fat meals is heartburn. The article mentions that.

13. Seed-based melatonin-rich food: sunflower seeds are listed. So "sunflower seeds".

14. The fruit one hour before bed is kiwi. The article says two kiwis.

15. The oil part of a heart-healthy diet: olive oil is mentioned in the Mediterranean context. So "olive oil".

16. The caffeine cutoff time is before 2 p.m. as per Dr. St-Onge's advice.
