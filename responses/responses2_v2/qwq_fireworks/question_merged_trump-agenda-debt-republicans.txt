Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one using the article provided.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks for the percentage Greg Murphy believed tariffs should contribute to the U.S. economy long-term. I need to look for any mention of percentages related to tariffs and Murphy. Scanning through, I find Representative Greg Murphy saying, "I think tariffs can be short term," but there's no mention of a specific percentage. So the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The question is about the number of options in the House Ways and Means Committee's document. Wait, the article says the House Budget Committee compiled a 50-page document with "dozens of options." The exact number isn't specified, so "dozens" isn't a specific number. Therefore, N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The projected revenue from a 10% tariff is mentioned as $1.9 trillion over a decade. The question says 21%, but the article states 10%. Since the percentage in the question doesn't match the article, answer N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The legislative process allowing GOP to bypass Democrats is called reconciliation. The article mentions "reconciliation" to bypass Democrats in the Senate. So answer is reconciliation.

5. **Question 5:** Nathan Sheets said the market is more focused on U.S. fiscal policy than a decade ago. The article states "more focused and concerned... than was the case a decade ago." So answer is "more focused and concerned."

6. **Question 6:** Blake Gwinn mentions a headline with a giant deficit number could cause a panic. The exact quote is about a headline with a giant deficit number leading to a "mini panic." So the trigger is a headline with a large deficit number.

7. **Question 7:** Nick LaLota's stance on corporate tax rate? The article says the document mentions cutting corporate taxes to 15% from 21%. But LaLota is discussing SALT, not corporate rates. The question asks what he's advocating to increase. Since he's from a high-tax state, maybe he wants higher SALT deductions, but the question is about corporate tax rate. The article doesn't say LaLota is advocating to increase the corporate rate. Current rate is 21%, but the proposal is to cut to 15%. The question is incorrect, so N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The annual gap before Trump's 2017 tax cuts. The article says the last fiscal year had a gap over $1.9 trillion. But when was that? The tax cuts were in 2017, so the last fiscal year before that would be 2016. The article mentions the last fiscal year (when?) but doesn't specify the year. The question asks for the gap before 2017 tax cuts. The article states "last fiscal year" but doesn't tie it to before 2017. Since the article's context is current (2023?), "last fiscal year" might be 2022. The exact prior year before 2017 isn't given, so N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Jason Smith chairs the House Ways and Means Committee. The article says he is chairman of that committee. So answer is House Ways and Means Committee.
