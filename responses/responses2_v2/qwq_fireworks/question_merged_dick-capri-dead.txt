Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. 

Starting with question 1: Which Jewish comedian did Dick Capri credit with teaching him the Yiddish phrases? The article mentions Alison Kaplan, his life partner and agent, saying he knew more Yiddish than Freddie and Mal Z. combined. But the question asks who taught him, so maybe Freddie Roman? Wait, no. The article says he learned from being around the Borscht Belt. The question might be a trick since it's not directly stated. The article doesn't mention a specific comedian teaching him, so maybe N/A?

Question 2: How many performances at the Lotus before being discovered by Humperdinck? The article says he performed at the Lotus in 1954, but doesn't specify the number of performances. So N/A.

Question 3: DNA research institute? The article mentions a fictional DNA research in his joke about the Last Supper. Since it's fictional, there's no real institute named, so N/A.

Question 4: Which Catskills resort hired him after the Barry Fitzgerald impression at MGM Grand? The article says he started in the Catskills and Poconos in the early 60s, but the specific resort after MGM Grand isn't mentioned. N/A.

Question 5: Yiddish blessing at his bar mitzvah. The article mentions a yarmulke with the Italian flag but no specific blessing. N/A.

Question 6: Who replaced him when he left for Tom Jones? The article says he opened for Jones in the 80s, but doesn't mention replacement. N/A.

Question 7: Grocery store name. His father owned a store, but the name isn't given. N/A.

Question 8: Comedian at his final roast. The article mentions the 90th birthday roast included his final performance, but who delivered the closing tribute? It doesn't say, so N/A.

Question 9: Title of his Jewish routine. The article says he had a Jewish routine in the middle of his act, but no specific title. N/A.

Question 10: Years at Table Four before name change. The article mentions Table Four in the joke, but not how many years. His name change from Crupi is mentioned, but no duration at the club. N/A.

Question 11: Award for Yiddish mastery. The article doesn't mention any specific award presented by Roman. N/A.

Question 12: Number of times he sang "Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen". The show ended with them singing it, but total performances? The Broadway run was 453 and tour 300, so total 753? But the question is how many times he performed the song. Since it was part of every performance, it would be 453+300=753. But does the article say he sang it every time? The article says the show ended with them singing it. So yes, so answer is 753. Wait, the question says "how many times did Mr. Capri perform..." so total performances of the song would equal total performances of the show. So 453 + 300 = 753. But check the article: "the show ended with the comics telling more jokes and singing 'Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen'..." So every show included it. So the answer is 753? The article says "453 performances. Mr. Capri continued with the show when it went on the road for about 300 more performances." So total is 453+300=753. So answer is 753. But the question asks specifically for how many times he performed the song. So that would be the same as the number of shows. So yes, 753.

Question 13: Pennsylvania newspaper that quoted him as "cellophane person". The article says "The Lebanon Daily News of Pennsylvania in 1980". So answer is Lebanon Daily News.

Question 14: Specific joke about DNA and seating. The article says he told a joke about his ancestors being at Table Four at the Last Supper, based on fictional DNA research. The question asks for the joke's title or content. The article refers to it as "a funny sequence on the Last Supper," so the answer is "the Last Supper" joke. But the exact title? The question says "specific joke... deemed inappropriate for Jews to tell". The answer would be the joke about the Last Supper and DNA research.

Question 15: Drew Carey's book title. The article says "Dirty Jokes and Beer: Stories of the Unrefined". So that's the title.

Question 16: Role of Alison Kaplan in selection. The article says she was his life partner and agent. The question asks what role she played in Freddie Roman's selection. The article doesn't mention her role in casting, so N/A.

Question 17: Washington DC nightclub with impressions. The article mentions the Lotus club in Washington where he performed in 1954. So answer is Lotus.

Question 18: Prop in burial. The yarmulke with Italian flag. The article says he was buried with the yarmulke from the Friars Club event. So answer is the yarmulke.

Question 19: Combined performances of the show. The Broadway run was 453 and tour 300, so 753. The question says "combined total" which matches that. So answer is 753. But the question also says "a number that reflects the total number of times Mr. Capri opened for Tom Jones?" Wait, the second part is a parenthetical. The actual question is the first part: total performances. So 753. But the second part is just extra info, so answer is 753.

Question 20: TV show hosted by a woman featuring Capri and Humperdinck. The article mentions "Sally Jessy Raphael" talk show. So answer is "The Sally Jessy Raphael Show".
