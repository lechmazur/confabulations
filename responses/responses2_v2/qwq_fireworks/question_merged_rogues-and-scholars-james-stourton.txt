Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks about an auction event involving a German banker's Impressionist paintings sold in a seven-item sale that marked the start of auctions becoming celebrity events. The article mentions Jakob Goldschmidt's sale in 1958 at Sotheby's. It says this event was a turning point, so the answer should be that auction.

2. The second question is about the Sothebyâ€™s chairman known for being debonair, an unmoneyed aristocrat, and licensing the firm's name for cigarettes. The text clearly states Peter Wilson as the chairman under whom Sotheby's was transformed. He's described as the one who embraced commercialism, so that's him.

3. The third question contrasts a chairman who attended funerals with his rival. The article says Peter Chance went to funerals while Peter Wilson went to the house. So the answer is Peter Chance. The question is about who is contrasted with his rival (Wilson) for his personal approach.

4. The fourth question is about who started publishing art performance figures in the London Times. The text mentions Peter Wilson began publishing indexes there, like Renoir's 405% increase. So Peter Wilson again.

5. The fifth question asks for the dealer who said his favorite painting is a sold one. The article quotes Richard Green as saying exactly that. So Richard Green.

6. The sixth question is about the dealer involved in looted antiquities and a dramatic fall. The text mentions Robin Symes as disgraced for looted antiquities, with hubris leading to nemesis. So Robin Symes.

7. The seventh question is about the firm that started with books and acquired a New York firm in 1964. Sotheby's under Peter Wilson acquired Parke-Bernet. So Sotheby's.

8. The eighth question is about the 1975 fee structure colluded by two chairmen. The buyer's premium is mentioned as something Wilson and Chance conspired to invent. So "buyer's premium".

9. The ninth question refers to buyers whose dominance ended after the 1990 invasion (Kuwait), leading dealers to Hong Kong. The text says Japanese buyers dominated until their bubble popped due to the 1990 invasion. So Japanese buyers.

10. The tenth question is about the narrative approach avoiding visual descriptions, letting quotes speak. The text says Stourton's aloofness is a courtesy, and he's not a visual writer. The answer is his "aloofness" or "dispassionate, business-like account". Wait, the question says the approach is characterized by avoiding overt visual descriptions. The text mentions Stourton's approach is truthful and stripped of the art lover's gaze, using quotes. The exact term used in the text might be "aloofness" or "discretion". The last part says "Stourton's approach is nonetheless truthful. Stripped of the art lover's gaze..." So the answer is "aloofness" but the question asks for the narrative approach. The text says "Stourton's aloofness may be a practiced discretion." The question says "deliberate avoidance... dispassionate... lets industry quotes speak." The answer is "a practiced discretion" or maybe "dispassionate, business-like account". Wait, the question says the approach is highlighted as a stylistic courtesy. The text states "Stourton's aloofness may be a practiced discretion" and later "Stripped of the art lover's gaze... Stourton's approach is nonetheless truthful." The exact term might be "aloofness" but the question wants the narrative approach. Alternatively, the text says "Stourton's taut chapters and business brain probably make a clearer portrait..." So the answer is "a dispassionate, business-like account" but need to check the exact wording. The question's answer is probably "aloofness" but the text says "Stourton's approach is... stripped of the art lover's gaze". The key phrase might be "aloofness" as per the text's description. Alternatively, the question says the approach is characterized by avoiding visual descriptions. The answer is "aloofness" or "dispassionate account". Let me check the exact quote again. The text says "Stourton's aloofness may be a practiced discretion... Stourton's approach is nonetheless truthful. Stripped of the art lover's gaze..." So the answer is "aloofness" but the question asks for the narrative approach term. Alternatively, the answer might be "practiced discretion". The question says "deliberate avoidance... lets quotes speak for themselves". The text says "Stourton lets his quotes do the judging". The approach is letting quotes speak, so maybe "letting quotes do the judging". Wait, the question asks for the narrative approach's name. The text says "Stourton's aloofness may be a practiced discretion" so the answer is "a practiced discretion". Alternatively, the question's answer is "aloofness" but the exact term in the question's context is the narrative approach. Hmm, tricky. The text says "Stourton's aloofness may be a practiced discretion. 'It would have been an appalling error...'" So the answer is "a practiced discretion" but the question asks for the narrative approach. Alternatively, the answer is "aloofness". Let me see the exact question again: "Which narrative approach... characterized by a deliberate avoidance of overt visual descriptions... lets industry quotes speak for themselves...?" The text's phrase is "Stourton's aloofness may be a practiced discretion" and "lets his quotes do the judging". So the answer is "a practiced discretion" or "aloofness". The question might expect "aloofness" as the term. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "dispassionate, business-like account" based on "Stourton's taut chapters and business brain". The text says "stripped of the art lover's gaze, Stourton's taut chapters and business brain probably make a clearer portrait..." So the approach is his business-like, dispassionate style. The question's answer is likely "aloofness" but the exact wording in the text for the narrative approach is "aloofness". The question says "highlighted as a stylistic courtesy to the artists". The text ends with "Stourton creates an inconvenience... but ultimately does a courtesy to the artists." So the approach is his aloofness, so the answer is "aloofness".
