Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each question precisely. Let's start with the first one.

1. The first question asks about the percentage of the recalled product that contained live virus. The article mentions that Northwest Naturals recalled products after testing positive, but there's no specific percentage given. So the answer should be N/A.

2. The second question is about how many additional states would be impacted if Monarch did a recall. The article says California and Oregon already had cases. But Monarch's cases were in California, so if they recalled, maybe more states? However, the article doesn't mention other states with confirmed cases linked to Monarch, so maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "directly impacted by confirmed cat infections linked to commercially available raw pet food." The article only mentions Oregon and California. Since Monarch's cases are in California, which is already counted, adding Monarch's recall wouldn't add new states beyond those two. So the answer is 0?

Wait, the question says "additional states beyond Oregon and California." Since Monarch's cases are in California, which is already included, so no new states. So answer is 0? Hmm, but maybe the article doesn't specify other states. Let me check again. The article says California has cases from two brands, including Monarch. So the only states mentioned are Oregon and California. So the answer is 0.

3. The third question asks for a specific genetic marker from USDA differentiating the cat strain from poultry in Minnesota. The article says USDA's samples from cats were "closely related" to Minnesota turkey farms, but no specific marker is mentioned. So N/A.

4. The fourth question projects fatalities based on viral load. The article doesn't provide data on consumption volume or viral load per bag, so N/A.

5. The fifth question asks which federal regulation requires USDA inspectors in facilities making both human and pet food. The article states Northwest Naturals had USDA inspectors because they produce human food. The USDA regulates human food facilities, so maybe the Federal Meat Inspection Act or similar. But the article doesn't name the regulation, so N/A.

6. The sixth question about a mutation responsible for human transmission mentioned by Dr. Grube. The article doesn't mention any specific mutation by Dr. Grube, so N/A.

7. The seventh question asks for the poultry type besides turkey linked to dairy farm outbreaks. The article mentions turkeys and chickens in USDA's analysis (turkey farms in Minnesota, but the initial outbreaks on dairy farms involved birds that preyed on wild birds. Wait, the article says "there was a spike in cat cases after bird flu began circulating in dairy farms about a year ago." The initial outbreak on dairy farms might be linked to chickens? Or maybe turkeys? Wait, the article says "turkey or chicken" in the part about regulations. The question is asking for the poultry other than turkey implicated in the initial dairy farm outbreaks. The article says "bird flu began circulating in dairy farms", but the specific poultry isn't named. The answer might be chickens? The article says "turkey or chicken" in the context of USDA regulations. Wait, the initial outbreak on dairy farms: "cats that preyed on wild birds" and "spike in cat cases after bird flu began circulating in dairy farms". Maybe the poultry on dairy farms were chickens? The article doesn't specify, so N/A? Or maybe turkeys? Hmm, the article says "turkey farms in Minnesota" in the USDA's analysis, but the initial dairy farm outbreak might be different. Since the article doesn't specify the poultry type, answer N/A.

8. The eighth question about Canadian regulation mirroring FDA's new rules. The article mentions Phyllis Entis worked for Canada's agency but doesn't mention specific regulations. So N/A.

9. If the Oregon cat had Monarch and the virus traced to a chicken farm, the USDA's surveillance is in Minnesota and South Dakota for turkeys. So maybe Minnesota for chicken? But the article says the USDA's surveillance for turkeys is in those states. The question is about chicken, so maybe another state? The article doesn't mention chicken farms in other states. So N/A.

10. The temperature for pasteurization to inactivate H5N1. The article says pasteurization "rapidly heated and cooled", but the exact temperature isn't given. So N/A.

11. The days prior to slaughter for isolation. The article states 72 hours, so answer is 72.

12. Pathogens besides H5N1 with zero tolerance. The FDA's zero tolerance includes "salmonella or listeria or E. coli" per Phyllis Entis. So the answer is salmonella, listeria, or E. coli. The question asks for one specific, so any of those. The exact wording says "explicitly list", so the answer is salmonella, listeria, or E. coli. The first one listed is salmonella.

13. Processing method Northwest Naturals used. They said their facility had USDA inspectors and produced human food. The article says they process at a facility with USDA inspector and produces human food, but the specific method isn't named. The question asks for the type of processing, but maybe "processed at a facility with USDA inspector on site producing human food" isn't a method. Wait, the question is "what specific type of pet food processing method did Northwest Naturals claim to use...?" The company's statement mentions their facility produces human food, implying they use human food processing standards, but the article doesn't name the method. So N/A? Or maybe they use USDA inspected facilities, but the processing method isn't stated. So N/A.

14. Third source of H5N1 exposure ruled out. The article says "there is no evidence that infected cats have passed the virus on to people" and cases linked to raw milk and uncooked meat/poultry. So other sources like cooked food or wild birds? Wait, the article says "indoor cats with no contact with wild birds or dairy farms" had cases from pet food. So the third source ruled out might be contact with wild birds or dairy farms. The question asks for a third source ruled out. The article states that the cases were linked to raw milk and pet food, so maybe "contact with wild birds" is ruled out for some cases? Wait, the article says "many recent infections occurred in indoor cats that had no known contact with wild birds or dairy farms." So those sources were ruled out for those cases. The question is asking what third source was explicitly ruled out by officials. The article says "there is no evidence that infected cats passed it to humans" so maybe human-to-cat transmission? Or perhaps other animal sources? The question says "third source... explicitly ruled out". The article mentions that the cases were linked to raw milk and uncooked meat/poultry, so maybe cooked products? The answer might be "cooked products" but the article says "Most commercial pet foods are cooked or heat-treated." So the risk is from uncooked. The third source ruled out would be cooked food? The question is tricky. The article says "experts said there was no need to panic because the cases were linked to unpasteurized milk and uncooked meat..." So cooked products are safe, hence ruled out as a source. So the answer is cooked products? The question asks for a third source besides milk and pet food, so maybe "cooked meat/poultry products" but the exact phrasing? The article says "uncooked meat or poultry products" are the sources, so the ruled out third is cooked. But the question says "explicitly ruled out by federal officials investigating the recent outbreaks." The article states "there is no evidence that infected cats have passed the virus on to people, and the cases have been linked specifically to unpasteurized milk and uncooked meat or poultry products." So the third source ruled out is contact with wild birds (since some cases had no contact), but the question is about exposure sources. The answer might be "contact with wild birds" but that's a factor, not a source. The question is about exposure sources like raw milk, pet food, and the third? Maybe cooked food is ruled out. Since the article says cases are linked to uncooked, implying cooked is safe. So the answer would be "cooked meat or poultry products" but the exact wording? The article says "Most commercial pet foods are cooked or heat-treated. 'The heat of processing should be enough to inactivate the virus," so the third source is cooked products, which are safe. So the answer is "cooked meat or poultry products" but maybe the question wants a specific term. Alternatively, the article says "the cases have been linked specifically to unpasteurized milk and uncooked meat or poultry products" so the third source is cooked products. So the answer is "cooked meat or poultry products" but the exact wording in the article is "uncooked meat or poultry products". The third source ruled out is cooked. So the answer is "cooked meat or poultry products".

15. Which state reported a cat death before December 2023? The article says "Since early December, more than two dozen cases have been confirmed... Oregon officials announced that a pet cat had contracted bird flu and died after eating raw, frozen pet food from Northwest Naturals in December." So the first report was in Oregon in December 2023. The question asks for a state before December 2023. Since the timeline starts in early December, there's no state mentioned prior. So N/A.

16. Minimum hours for heat treatment. The article mentions pasteurization's heat but doesn't specify duration for pet food. The FDA's new rules require safety plans but no specific hours. So N/A.

17. Poultry species other than turkeys in USDA's analysis. The article mentions turkeys and chickens in USDA's statement: "samples from turkey or chicken". The USDA's analysis linked to Minnesota turkey farms. Wait, the article says "samples from infected cats were closely related... to samples from turkey farms in Minnesota." But the question asks for poultry other than turkeys. The USDA's analysis might include chickens? The article says "turkey or chicken" in the context of regulations. The question is about the genetic analysis linking to Minnesota farmed birds. The article specifically mentions turkey farms in Minnesota. So maybe chickens are not mentioned here. Thus N/A, since the analysis was on turkey farms. The answer would be N/A.

18. Percentage viral load reduction via pasteurization. The article says pasteurization inactivates the virus but no specific percentage. So N/A.
