Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any external knowledge.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks which insurance company specifically refused coverage to the architect's brother before the Woolsey Fire. The article mentions the architect's brother's insurance was discontinued but doesn't name the company. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The article says a preventive fire cleared underbrush, preventing the Palisades fire from reaching the house. However, it doesn't specify the number of square miles. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The text mentions Altadena's historic Black community but doesn't provide a percentage lost in the fires. No data here, so N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The article refers to courtyard housing as a potential solution but doesn't name a specific architectural firm. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The Eaton fire damaged Michael Maltzan's area, but the article doesn't state the monetary value. Answer N/A.

6. **Question 6:** It mentions private equity firms are "in the wings" but doesn't give the number purchased. No specific data, so N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Altadena's streetcars were serviced until the 1940s. The exact year isn't provided, so N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The Pacific Palisades fire destroyed homes, including some celebrities, but specific names aren't mentioned. The article references the 1961 Bel Air Fire had celebrity homes, but not this one. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The article talks about permits for accessory dwelling units but doesn't specify numbers for fire-affected properties. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** No info on National Guard response times in Altadena. Answer N/A.

I need to make sure each question is addressed with <question_number> and <answer> tags. All answers here are N/A except maybe checking again for any missed details. Let me scan the text again quickly.

Looking back, the architect's brother's insurance isn't named (Q1), square miles (Q2) not given, percentage (Q3) not stated, firm (Q4) not named, monetary value (Q5) missing, number of firms (Q6) not there, exact streetcar year (Q7) only decade, celebrity names (Q8) not provided, permit numbers (Q9) not specified, response time (Q10) no data. All N/A.
