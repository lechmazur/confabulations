Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions beyond that. Let me start with the first question.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions that the designer Andrea Lauer took photos of Sor Juana's signature from her "Book of Professions" during a research trip to Mexico City. This influenced the design of the nuns' costumes. The historical location here would be where the "Book of Professions" is kept. Wait, the article says "Sor Juana's signature, drawn in her blood, from her 'Book of Professions.'" But it doesn't explicitly name a specific location in Mexico City where the book is housed. Hmm, maybe the question is referring to the convent where Sor Juana lived? The text says she spent most of her time in a convent in Mexico City. But the question asks which historical location in Mexico City directly influenced the design. Since the creative team went to Mexico City and the signature was from her Book of Professions, perhaps the convent itself? But the article doesn't name the convent. Wait, maybe the "Book of Professions" is the key here. The article says Lauer took photos of the signature from the book, so the location of the book might be the convent, but the question is about the location in Mexico City they visited. The article doesn't specify a specific building or archive, so maybe the answer is N/A? Or perhaps the convent where she lived? The article says she was in a convent in Mexico City, but the question asks for a historical location mentioned in the research trip. Since the article only mentions Mexico City as the general location, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "directly influenced the design of the nuns' pleated costumes" because of the signature from her Book of Professions. The research trip to Mexico City with the creative team, so maybe the specific location is the convent? But the article doesn't name it. Hmm. The answer might be "the convent in Mexico City" but since it's not named, maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "historical location in Mexico City mentioned as part of the creative team's research". The article mentions "research trip to Mexico City with the creative team, the designer Andrea Lauer took photos of Sor Juana's signature..." So the location is Mexico City, but the question asks for a historical location. The convent is in Mexico City, but it's not named. Since the article doesn't name a specific historical site in Mexico City beyond the convent, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, maybe the "Book of Professions" is the key, but that's a document, not a location. Hmm. Maybe the answer is N/A here. Wait, the question might be looking for the convent where she lived, but since it's not named, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "the convent in Mexico City" even if it's not named, but the article doesn't specify the name. Hmm. Let me check the article again. The article says "Sor Juana spent most of her time in a convent in Mexico City" but doesn't name it. The research trip was to Mexico City, so the historical location might be the convent, but since it's not named, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the "Book of Professions" is the key, but that's a document. Hmm. I'm confused here. Let me move on and come back.

2. **Question 2:** The escudos de monjas were originally devotional objects. The article says in the opera, they are reinterpreted as speakers, amplifiers, projection sources. The question is how does this reinterpretation go beyond their original purpose. The answer would be that they serve as modern tech tools (speakers, projectors). So the answer is they became speakers, amplifiers, and projection sources. The article says: "they could become speakers, amplifiers, projection sources. Some of them have little projectors in them..." So the answer is that they are used as speakers, amplifiers, and projectors. So the answer is "speakers, amplifiers, and projection sources".

3. **Question 3:** The article mentions Sor Juana's influences include Greek and Aztec symbols. The instruments listed are harps, hand percussion, theorbo, Spanish guitar. The question asks for a musical instrument not listed that would logically complement based on her influences. Since she was influenced by Baroque and Greek, maybe a lute? Or a harpsichord? The article mentions theorbo, which is similar to a lute. Alternatively, maybe a violin? But the article doesn't mention that. The article says "Greek influence" so maybe a lyre? But that's more ancient Greek. Alternatively, since she was in a convent, maybe a pipe organ? But the article doesn't mention that. The article says "Baroque style" so maybe a harpsichord. Since the existing instruments are harps, theorbo (which is a Baroque lute), and guitar. So perhaps a harpsichord would be a logical addition. The answer would be "harpsichord".

4. **Question 4:** The opera excludes biographical details, unlike the film "I, the Worst of All" and Ballet Hispanico's "Sor Juana". The film is by Maria Luisa Bemberg. The article says that the opera does not concern itself with biographical details, so the excluded scene would be the biographical elements. The film "I, the Worst of All" (1990) is mentioned as a Sor Juana depiction. The question is which scene from her biography is central to the film but excluded from the opera. The article doesn't specify which biographical elements, but since the film is titled "I, the Worst of All", perhaps it focuses on her conflict with the church authorities, her writings, or her life's events. Since the opera focuses on her poem, not her life, the film's central scene might be her confrontation with the church or her decision to join the convent. The article doesn't specify, so maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "central to Maria Luisa Bemberg’s film portrayal of her life" but the article only says that the film and ballet are depictions that do concern biographical details, unlike the opera. Since the question is asking for the specific scene excluded, but the article doesn't mention any specific scene, perhaps N/A? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "her conflict with the church" but that's an assumption. Since the article doesn't state, maybe N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The article mentions "six nuns in white" and "a seventh dressed in black" (so total 7?), but then mentions the German vocal ensemble Sjaella. The Sjaella are the six nuns in white. The article says "the six nuns in white, performed by the German vocal ensemble Sjaella." So Sjaella is the six. Then there's the seventh in black, which is the nun representing Sor Juana. So total 7. But the question asks "total vocalists including both the nuns in white and the ensemble representing Indigenous and Black voices." Wait, but the article says the six are Sjaella, and the seventh is the one in black. The article doesn't mention any other vocalists representing Indigenous or Black voices. The article says "the opera sets to music her words... mixes Indigenous reality, Black slaves, and Spanish influence." But the performers are the seven nuns. The Indigenous and Black elements are in the themes, not necessarily vocalists. So the total vocalists are 7. So answer is 7? Or is there another group? The article doesn't mention other vocalists beyond the seven. So answer is 7.

6. **Question 6:** The material used for the projections in the escudos is Sor Juana's signature from her Book of Professions, which was used in the digital collage. The article says: "the designer Andrea Lauer took photos of Sor Juana's signature, drawn in her blood, from her 'Book of Professions.' She then created a digital collage that she printed onto the pleats." So the material is her signature from the Book of Professions. The question asks what material from her personal archives was used. The answer is "her signature from her Book of Professions" or more specifically "her signature drawn in her blood from her 'Book of Professions'". The question asks for the material, so the answer would be "her signature (drawn in her blood) from her Book of Professions".

7. **Question 7:** The architectural feature of the Cloisters that mirrors a symbolic element in the poem. The poem is about the soul's journey, and the opera moves through the Cloisters' rooms. The article says the director thought of translating the soul journey into a physical journey through the Cloisters spaces. The article mentions "the limestone walls that keep the world at bay" but not sure if that's the feature. Alternatively, the meandering from room to room mirrors the soul's journey. Maybe the labyrinthine structure of the Cloisters? The article doesn't specify a particular feature, so perhaps N/A. Wait, the article says "the Cloisters spaces" but doesn't name a specific architectural feature. So maybe N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The conflict in colonial New Spain influencing the opera's integration of Aztec and Greek iconography. Prestini mentions that Sor Juana's work mixes Indigenous reality, Black slaves, and Spanish influence. The conflict might be the colonial tension between Spanish and Indigenous cultures. The article says "the transmission of knowledge and artistry" and mentions "the Indigenous reality, the Black slaves -- and the Spanish influence, and mixes it in." The question asks for the specific conflict, which could be the cultural blending under colonial rule. But the article doesn't name a specific conflict, so maybe N/A. Alternatively, the question refers to the mixing of cultures as the influence, but the question asks for a conflict. Since the article doesn't mention a conflict, maybe N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The opera's processional format vs. Proske's prior Met production "The Mother of Us All." The article says that in "Primero Sueno," the audience moves through the Cloisters. In her previous work, Proske directed "The Mother of Us All" at the Met in 2020, and now the Met invited her to stage another piece. The article says that in "Primero Sueno," "each room has a new possibility of how the audience relates to the performers. In some rooms, people sit together on benches, while in others they are free to roam around the singers." The prior production might have had a static audience arrangement. The answer would be that the audience is mobile, moving through spaces instead of stationary. The article says "processional opera that would take over the Cloisters as it meandered from room to room, audience in tow." So the answer is that the audience moves through spaces, unlike Proske's prior which was static. So answer: "allows the audience to physically follow the performance through different spaces" or similar. But the question asks how the format alters the traditional role compared to her prior. Since the prior was at the Met, maybe it was a traditional seated audience. The answer is that the audience moves through the space instead of sitting in one place. So answer: "the audience moves through the Cloisters spaces following the performance, rather than sitting stationary."

10. **Question 10:** Philosophical text quoted in the libretto to emphasize her pursuit of knowledge. The article says "This is a poem that she wrote because she wanted to write it," and "symbolizes her pursuit of knowledge." But does it mention a specific text? The article mentions her poem "Primero Sueno" which is the basis, but the question is about a philosophical text quoted. The article doesn't mention any specific philosophical work being quoted, so N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The element from a 17th-century document reinterpreted into wearable art. The article says Lauer used Sor Juana's signature from her Book of Professions to create the digital collage on the costumes. The answer is "her signature (drawn in her blood) from her Book of Professions".

12. **Question 12:** The creative professional credited with transforming historical research into wearable art. The article says "the designer Andrea Lauer took photos... created a digital collage that she printed onto the pleats." So the answer is "Andrea Lauer".

13. **Question 13:** The historical figure's commitment to uncommissioned work is showcased. The article says "unlike much of Sor Juana's output, [Primero Sueno] was not a commission from a royal or aristocrat. 'This is a poem that she wrote because she wanted to write it.'" So the figure is Sor Juana herself. The answer is "Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz".

14. **Question 14:** The director who reimagined religious artifacts as projection devices. The article says "Louisa Proske" directed the opera and mentioned the escudos being speakers and projectors. The answer is "Louisa Proske".

15. **Question 15:** The narrative strategy converting internal quest into physical journey. The article says "the soul journey is translated into a physical journey at the Cloisters spaces" through moving from room to room. So the answer is "translating the soul's spiritual journey into a physical journey through the Cloisters' spaces".

16. **Question 16:** The contradiction of cloistered space used for female academic freedom. The article states that cloistered life allowed women like Sor Juana to study and live freely without serving men. The contradiction is that the cloister, which might seem restrictive, provided freedom for intellectual pursuits. The answer is "the contradiction between cloistered confinement and the intellectual freedom it afforded women".

17. **Question 17:** The meditative focus symbolized by the redesigned escudos. The article says the original escudos symbolized their meditative focus (e.g., Virgin Mary). The redesigned ones still symbolize that but also have technical roles. The chief symbol is the meditative focus on religious scenes. The answer is "meditation on religious themes (e.g., the Virgin Mary)".

18. **Question 18:** Collaborative pairing harmonizing indigenous and European aesthetics. The composers are Magos Herrera and Paola Prestini. The article says Herrera and Prestini worked on the opera, and Prestini mentions mixing Indigenous and Spanish influences. So the pairing is "Magos Herrera and Paola Prestini".

19. **Question 19:** Spatial arrangement for communal engagement vs. free movement. The article says "in some rooms, people sit together on benches, while in others they are free to roam". The communal arrangement is sitting together on benches. So the answer is "sitting together on benches" as the communal arrangement.

20. **Question 20:** The director's prior work with Thomson and Stein. The article mentions that Louisa Proske directed Virgil Thomson and Gertrude Stein's "The Mother of Us All" at the Met in 2020. The current staging is hers, so the answer is "Louisa Proske".
