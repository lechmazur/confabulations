Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the strict instructions. Let's start with each question:

1. The first question asks which comedian's special on Hulu had a satirical comparison between left-wing policies and "Let's go, Brandon". The article mentions Ronny Chieng's "Love to Hate It" on Netflix. Wait, the question says Hulu, but the article says Netflix. Hmm, so that would be N/A? Wait, the article says "Hannah Einbinder's special last year, 'Everything Must Go' (Max), had many eccentric jokes but the most memorable was an extreme vibe shift..." Max isn't Hulu either. The only Hulu mention is in the last paragraph about Disney entering stand-up via Hulu. But the question is about a specific special on Hulu. Since the article doesn't mention any Hulu special with that content except the last line about Disney/Hulu, but that's not a specific special. So answer is N/A? Wait, but the article says Ronny Chieng's special is on Netflix. The question might be a trick. So answer N/A.

2. Gary Gulman's show is at the Lucille Lortel Theater, not Lunt-Fontanne. The question has a venue typo. So since the venue is wrong, the answer would be N/A. The article mentions Audioslave and the references include Beowulf, Mary Shelley, grunge history. The question asks which literary work he linked to Pearl Jam's origins. The article says during the Audioslave tangent, he mentions Pearl Jam's origins? Wait, the article says the monologue covers the history of grunge, Mookie Blaylock, Mary Shelley, and Beowulf. Pearl Jam isn't mentioned. So the question's premise is incorrect, so answer N/A.

3. Hannah Einbinder's Hebrew prayer performance is compared to Schindler's List's song. The article states she sang a prayer, then realized it's from Schindler's List. The question asks which 19th-century novel she referenced. Schindler's List is a movie, not a novel. The novel would be "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" by Stieg Larsson? No. Wait, the article says she connected it to Schindler's List, which is based on a book by Thomas Keneally. But the question is about a novel she claimed to have referenced. The article says "It's the song at the end of 'Schindler's List.'" So the novel is "Schindler's Ark" (same as Schindler's List). But the question says "19th-century novel" â€” the book was published in 1982. So that's 20th century. So the answer is N/A because the time period is wrong.

4. The article compares Chieng's fast-forward pacing to Stanley Kubrick. The question asks which comedian's use was compared to Kubrick. The answer is Ronny Chieng. So answer is Ronny Chieng.

5. The question says Tig Notaro's joke was falsely associated with a grunge band. The article mentions that Gary Gulman's bit involved Audioslave and Pearl Jam/grunge. The question says Tig Notaro's repetitive joke was conflated with Audioslave. The article says Tig Notaro uses long patient jokes with repetition. The grunge band mentioned is Audioslave in Gulman's part. So the answer is Audioslave? But the question is asking which band the article falsely linked to Tig Notaro. Since the article doesn't mention Tig and grunge, it's N/A? Wait, the question says "falsely associated" so maybe the answer is Pearl Jam? No, the article says Gulman's tangent includes Pearl Jam's origins. The question is about Tig Notaro's joke being linked to a grunge band. Since the article doesn't connect Tig to grunge, the answer is N/A. Wait, maybe the question is a trick. The article says "Tig Notaro regularly does this with long patient jokes that use repetition to surprise and ramp up absurdity." The question says the article falsely associated her with a grunge band's tangent. Since the article doesn't mention Tig and grunge, the answer is N/A.

6. The question is about a Weekend Update story where someone forgot a punchline. The article says Andy Kaufman's "Great Gatsby" reading and Norm Macdonald's Weekend Update with Chris Farley. The question says it was misattributed to John Mulaney instead of Chris Farley. The correct answer is Chris Farley's story was misattributed to John Mulaney. So the answer is John Mulaney? Wait, the question asks which comedian's unfinished story was misattributed to John Mulaney instead of Chris Farley. So the correct answer is the story was actually by Chris Farley, but the question's answer is John Mulaney (the incorrect attribution). But the question is asking for the comedian whose story was misattributed. The answer would be Chris Farley's story was wrongly said to be John Mulaney's. So the answer is John Mulaney? Wait the question says "which comedian's unfinished Weekend Update story... was misattributed to John Mulaney instead of Chris Farley?" The answer is the story was Chris Farley's, but the question's answer is John Mulaney? No, the question is phrased as: the story was actually by Chris Farley, but someone thought it was John Mulaney. The question asks for the comedian (whose story it was) that was misattributed to John Mulaney. The answer is Chris Farley's story was misattributed to John Mulaney, so the answer is Chris Farley? Wait the question is "which comedian's unfinished... was misattributed to John Mulaney instead of Chris Farley?" So the answer is Chris Farley's story was the correct one, but the question is asking for the comedian (Chris Farley) whose story was misattributed to John Mulaney. So the answer is Chris Farley? Or the question is asking for the name that was wrong, which is John Mulaney? Wait the question is asking for the comedian whose story was the one that was misattributed to John. So the correct answer is the story was Chris Farley's, so the answer is Chris Farley's story was misattributed to John. So the answer is Chris Farley. Wait the question says "which comedian's unfinished..." so the answer is Chris Farley. The article says "Chris Farley tells a story about meeting a guy... then Farley sputters... forgot what he was going to say." So the correct comedian is Chris Farley, but the question is about it being misattributed to John Mulaney. Therefore, the answer to the question is John Mulaney, since the article didn't mention that, but the question states it was misattributed to him. Since the question is about what the article falsely said, but the article itself doesn't mention that, so the answer is N/A. Wait the article says "Chris Farley tells a story..." so there's no mention of John Mulaney here. The question is saying that the article incorrectly said it was John Mulaney instead of Chris Farley. Since the article actually attributes it to Chris Farley, the answer would be N/A because the article didn't misattribute it. So the answer is N/A.

7. The question asks which 1970s experimental filmmaker was cited as influencing Chieng's delivery. The article compares his tempo to Stanley Kubrick and Benny Hill. The question mentions an influence, but the article only says "recalls how everyone from Stanley Kubrick to Benny Hill has used fast forward to create comedy." So the filmmaker is Stanley Kubrick, but he's not from the 1970s? Wait, Kubrick was active in the 70s (e.g., A Clockwork Orange in 1971). The question says "1970s experimental filmmaker" so maybe Kubrick. But the question is about an inaccurate citation. The article says "recalls how everyone from Stanley Kubrick..." so it's accurate. But the question says "inaccurately cited as an influence". Since the article didn't say he was influenced by Kubrick, just that it "recalls" using similar techniques, the answer is N/A. Because the article didn't mention any 1970s filmmaker as an influence, just that his method is similar to Kubrick's editing. So the answer is N/A.

8. The question is about Andy Kaufman's "Great Gatsby" reading and an Old English epic. The article says "Andy Kaufman read 'The Great Gatsby' onstage to audiences who were expecting a joke that never came..." The question asks which Old English epic was analyzed during that stunt. The article mentions Beowulf in Gulman's bit. Since the question is about Andy Kaufman's reading, which was just Gatsby, the answer is N/A because the article doesn't mention Beowulf in that context. The article mentions Beowulf in Gulman's show. So the answer is N/A.

9. The question asks which MTV prank host was linked to Jason Zinoman's critique of social media's impact. The article's closing paragraphs mention Tom Green as a Y2K MTV prank show star and then talks about social media affecting comedians. The question says the article "incorrectly linked" Tom Green to the critique. The article doesn't say Zinoman linked Tom Green to social media; it's just two separate paragraphs. So the answer is Tom Green, as the question says it was incorrectly linked, but the article just mentions both in separate sections. So the answer is Tom Green.

10. The question is about Gary Gulman name-dropping a Pulitzer author during his Mary Shelley/grunge bit. The article says the monologue includes Mary Shelley and Beowulf, but no Pulitzer winner. The Pulitzer for literature includes authors like Toni Morrison, etc. The question might be referring to Mary Shelley, but she's not a Pulitzer winner. Since the article doesn't mention any Pulitzer winner, the answer is N/A.

11. Ronny Chieng's punchline after discussing economic issues is "Let's go, Brandon," which is the MAGA slogan. The article says "the punchline: 'But if you don't read enough, it comes out: Let's go, Brandon.'" So the answer is "Let's go, Brandon".

12. Gary Gulman's wife asks a question about a song. The article says she asks "Who sings this?" about Audioslave's song. So the answer is "Who sings this?".

13. The political movement Chieng references is MAGA. The joke starts with trying to find common ground with the MAGA movement. The answer is MAGA.

14. Gary Gulman uses "grandiloquent" to describe himself. The article says "he's always favored words like 'grandiloquent' (which means...)" and his show is titled "Grandiloquent". So the answer is grandiloquent.

15. Hannah's Hebrew prayer is compared to Schindler's List's score. The article says "It's the song at the end of 'Schindler's List.'" So the answer is Schindler's List.

16. The SNL performer who stumbled through a story is Chris Farley, as per the Weekend Update bit. The question says "SNL performer" and mentions Norm Macdonald wrote it for Chris Farley. The answer is Chris Farley.

17. The director compared to Benny Hill for fast-forward is Stanley Kubrick. The article mentions both. So the answer is Stanley Kubrick.

18. The ancient literary work highlighted in Gulman's mansplaining is Beowulf. The article lists Beowulf as part of his monologue. So the answer is Beowulf.

19. The fraction of the script taken by Gulman's lecture is "a 10th of the script" (10%). The article says "this monologue... goes on for many minutes, a 10th of the script." So the answer is one-tenth or 1/10.

20. The media company is Disney under Hulu challenging Netflix. The last paragraph says "Disney, under the banner of Hulu, has entered the stand-up comedy game in a big way. Can the company cut into Netflix's dominance?" So the answer is Disney.
