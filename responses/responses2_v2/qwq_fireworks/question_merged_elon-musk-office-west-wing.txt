Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let me start by reading through each question and cross-referencing with the article.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks about the color of the baseball caps worn by Musk's team members. The article mentions "navy blue mesh baseball caps in all-white capital letters reading 'DOGE'". So the color is navy blue.

2. **Question 2**: The article states that Musk's team aims to place "about two people at each major agency". The answer should be two.

3. **Question 3**: The person Musk supported for Air Force Secretary is Troy Meink. The article says he ran the Pentagon's National Reconnaissance Office. So the answer is National Reconnaissance Office.

4. **Question 4**: The Federal Advisory Committee Act requires public access to documents. If Musk's team avoids this act by being government employees, then documents like "all documents submitted to or produced by the panel" would be withheld. But the question asks for the type of documentation typically withheld. The act mandates public access, so the answer would be "documents submitted to or produced by the panel" but the question might be looking for "meetings" or "documents". Wait, the question says "specific type of documentation", so the article says "all documents submitted to such a panel or produced by it are also supposed to be available to the public." So the answer is "documents submitted to or produced by the panel".

5. **Question 5**: Troy Meink previously led the National Reconnaissance Office, which is part of the Pentagon. The question asks for the governmental body distinct from the Department of Government Efficiency. The answer is National Reconnaissance Office.

6. **Question 6**: The company owned by Musk (Tesla) produces electric cars influenced by government incentives. The article mentions "Tesla electric car company is affected by government policies like subsidies to encourage more production of batteries and chargers...". So the answer is electric cars.

7. **Question 7**: The article says Musk was at SpaceX on Sunday before speaking at the inauguration on Monday. So the day is Sunday.

8. **Question 8**: The initiative aims to cut "as much as $2 trillion". The answer is 2.

9. **Question 9**: If classified as government employees, they avoid the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The legal provision circumvented is the Federal Advisory Committee Act.

10. **Question 10**: Initially, Musk was expected to be in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.

11. **Question 11**: The article states "engineers from Silicon Valley... planning to be dispersed across the federal government" but doesn't specify the exact number. Since it's "about two people at each major agency" but the question asks how many engineers from SV have been dispersed, it's unclear. The answer is N/A.

12. **Question 12**: The article mentions "billions of dollars in government contracts" for SpaceX and Tesla. But it doesn't give a specific total for Tesla's contracts. So N/A.

13. **Question 13**: The article says Musk spoke at the inauguration on Monday, the day after being at SpaceX on Sunday. The exact date isn't provided. So N/A.

14. **Question 14**: The initial building was the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.

15. **Question 15**: Musk wants to avoid public financial disclosure by being a special government employee. The role is "special government employee".

16. **Question 16**: The article says Trump could issue a waiver, but doesn't mention how many he already did. So N/A.

Wait, let me check each again for accuracy.

For question 11: The article says "engineers... planning to be dispersed across the federal government, with a goal of placing about two people at each major agency." The question asks "how many engineers from Silicon Valley have been dispersed..." The answer would be "about two per agency", but the question asks for total number? The article doesn't give total, so N/A.

Question 12: "government contracts held by Tesla" â€” the article says "SpaceX has contracts... Tesla is affected by policies like subsidies..." but doesn't state the amount of Tesla's contracts. So N/A.

Question 13: The article mentions "Monday" but not the date, so N/A.

Question 16: The article says "Trump could exempt... by granting him a written waiver" but not how many have been issued. So N/A.

Alright, I think that's all.
