Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked and not infer anything beyond the text.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions that during their cross-country trip, Alonzo Davis and his brother met James Meredith during his "March Against Fear." But the question asks about a civil rights leader who influenced his mural designs at the Philadelphia airport. Wait, the article says that the Power Poles series was inspired by West African cultures. The Philadelphia International Airport piece was part of that series. However, the question is about a civil rights leader met during their journey. The only civil rights figure mentioned is James Meredith. The answer should be James Meredith. 

2. **Question 2:** The article states that the brothers created Brockman Gallery in 1967 to showcase Black artists, but it doesn't specify how many artists were featured in the first year. So the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The article mentions Brockman Productions ran education programs but doesn't give budget figures. Answer is N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The "Power Poles" series used bamboo as a symbol of authority in West African cultures. The question asks for a textile pattern, but the article mentions bamboo, not textiles. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The article doesn't mention the attendance at Davis's first solo exhibition. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The article says the Olympic freeway murals were along the Harbor Freeway, but no square footage is given. Answer N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The question asks about an art history course Davis developed while teaching. The article mentions he taught high school art but doesn't name any specific course. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The restoration was done by the Mural Conservancy, but no corporate sponsor is mentioned. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The purchase price of the Brockman Gallery building isn't stated. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The article doesn't provide graduation numbers from his tenure as dean. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Davis worked in Sacramento in a state arts program from 1987, but how long? The article says he left the gallery in 1987 to run the program, then took a residency in Hawaii a year later (1988). So maybe one year. But the question is about overseeing public art in Sacramento. The article says he was in Sacramento until 1988, so perhaps 1 year. But the exact duration isn't specified. The answer would be N/A because the time isn't stated.

12. **Question 12:** The "Power Poles" used bamboo. The question asks for a material reminiscent of Bearden's collages. Bearden is known for collages, but the article doesn't say Davis used collage materials in Power Poles. It mentions mixed-media sculptures. Maybe the answer is N/A unless there's a direct link. Since the article doesn't connect Bearden's style to the material in Power Poles, N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Davis's Olympic mural was trompe l'oeil. Charles White influenced him, but the article doesn't state what medium White used. The answer might be trompe l'oeil, but the question asks for a medium similar to White. Since the article doesn't specify White's medium, N/A.

14. **Question 14:** His wife was Rebecca Braithwaite, who is mentioned as divorced. The article doesn't say if she was involved in the art scene beyond being his wife. The question asks her name, which is given, so answer Rebecca Braithwaite.

15. **Question 15:** The cross-country trip included visiting Meredith during his March Against Fear before going to Chicago. The article says their last stop was Chicago, implying the visit to Meredith was before that. The year isn't specified, but the trip was in 1966 (since they founded the gallery in 1967 the next year). The March Against Fear was in 1966. So the answer is 1966.

16. **Question 16:** The documentary mentioned is "Leimert Park: The Story of a Village in South-Central Los Angeles" directed by Jeannette Lindsay, not his daughter. The question states the director is his daughter, but the article doesn't say that. So the answer is N/A because the documentary's director isn't his daughter as per the text.

17. **Question 17:** The partner organization was Brockman Productions, which ran festivals and education. The question asks about showcasing filmmakers, but the article says they did festivals, concerts, and education. Not specifically filmmakers, so N/A.

18. **Question 18:** The Davis brothers used a green Volkswagen Beetle on their trip. The question asks what vehicle Davis featured in his assemblages. The article says he did assemblages using a piece of fabric or bamboo, but not the Beetle. However, the article mentions "they packed up their green Volkswagen Beetle" and he later made assemblages. Maybe the answer is Volkswagen Beetle. The question says "similar to the one used..." which is the Beetle, so yes. The answer is Volkswagen Beetle.

19. **Question 19:** The gallery was named after their maternal grandmother, but her name isn't provided. The article says "named for their maternal grandmother," but her name isn't given. So N/A.

20. **Question 20:** The only mural mentioned by title is "Eye on '84." The others in the triptych aren't named. The article says "triptych" but no other titles. So N/A.
