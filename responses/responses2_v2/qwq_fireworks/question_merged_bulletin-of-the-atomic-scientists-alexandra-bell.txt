Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and follow the strict instructions.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions Bell worked in the State Department during Obama's administration and returned in 2021. Obama's term was until 2017, so the time between her two periods would be from 2017 to 2021. That's 4 years. But wait, the exact interval? The article says "starting in the Obama administration" and "returned in 2021." The exact interval isn't stated, just that she was there in Obama's time and then again in 2021. Since the question asks for the exact time interval, maybe it's 4 years? But maybe the answer is N/A because it's not explicitly stated. Hmm.

Wait, the article says "starting in the Obama administration, where she was involved in securing ratification of New START" and "returned to the department as a deputy assistant secretary in 2021." The Obama administration ended in January 2017. So from her time in Obama's administration (which could be up to 2017) until 2021, the gap is 4 years. But the question is about the exact interval between her two periods of service. Since the article doesn't specify when exactly she was in the Obama admin, but mentions she was there during his term, the time between her two periods would be from when she left the Obama admin (say, 2017) to 2021. The exact interval is 4 years. But the article might not give exact start/end dates, so maybe it's N/A? Wait, the question says "exact time interval," but the text doesn't state the exact duration between the two periods, only that she was there in Obama's time and returned in 2021. So maybe N/A.

Wait, but the answer might be "4 years" because from Obama's end (2017) to 2021 is 4 years. The article says "during the Biden administration" she led the P5 Process, so she was in the State Department during Biden's time (2021-2022?), but the exact interval between her two periods is from Obama's departure (2017) to 2021, so 4 years. Since the article says "returned to the department in 2021," implying a break between her first time (Obama) and then returning in 2021. So the time between her two periods is 2021 minus Obama's end (2017) is 4 years. So the answer would be 4 years. But the question asks for the exact interval. Since the article mentions "starting in the Obama administration" and "returned in 2021," the time between is 4 years. So I think the answer is 4 years. But I need to check the text again. The article says "during the Biden administration, she led the U.S. delegation of the P5 Process... In 2021, she returned to the department as a deputy assistant secretary..." Wait, the Biden administration started in 2021, so she returned in 2021. So the gap between her first time (Obama) and 2021 is 4 years. So the answer is 4 years. So the answer is "4 years."

2. **Question 2:** The Doomsday Clock moved to 89 seconds closer now, but the question is how much closer during Rachel Bronson's 10-year tenure. The article says "the world was 89 seconds to midnight, a metaphor... That's one second closer than we were for the past two years." So Rachel Bronson was president for 10 years. The article says the clock moved one second closer in the last two years, but during her entire tenure, how much did it move? The article doesn't specify the movement during her 10 years, only that in the past two years it moved one second. So the answer is N/A, since the article doesn't state the total during her tenure, only the last two years under her.

Wait, the article says "Rachel Bronson, who served in the role for a decade." The clock was at 89 seconds now, which is one second closer than the past two years. So the previous two years were at 90 seconds. But how much did it change during her entire 10 years? The article doesn't give data for each year of her tenure. So the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The P5 Process was led by Bell during Biden's time. The question asks which president initiated it. The article says "during the last two years of the Biden administration, she led the U.S. delegation of the P5 Process, currently the only forum where the United States, China and Russia discuss nuclear risk reduction." The P5 Process is a forum that exists now, but who started it? The article doesn't mention the origin of the P5 Process. So the answer is N/A.

Wait, the P5 refers to the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (US, Russia, China, UK, France). The process might have been initiated by one of them, but the article doesn't say which president started it. The question asks "which former U.S. president initiated the P5 Process." Since the article doesn't state who started it, answer is N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The article says "China has embarked on an unprecedented expansion of their nuclear forces." But it doesn't give a percentage. So answer N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The article says "When I entered the field, the Doomsday Clock was at five minutes to midnight." So the answer is five minutes.

6. **Question 6:** Bell led the delegation during the last two years of the Biden administration. The Biden administration started in 2021, so if she led it during the last two years, that would be 2021-2022? But the article says "during the last two years of the Biden administration," so the duration is two years. The answer is two years.

7. **Question 7:** Her work on New START was to secure its ratification. The article states "involved in securing ratification of New START." So primary focus was ratification.

8. **Question 8:** The question asks how many treaties she negotiated as deputy. The article mentions New START but doesn't say she negotiated it as deputy. She was involved in securing New START during Obama's time, but as deputy in 2021, the article says she promoted dialogue. No mention of treaties negotiated there. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The article says climate change can increase nuclear war likelihood. But does it state the measured impact? The article mentions "the potential conflicts that could arise from it... increase tension. More nuclear-armed states with climate-related conflicts means the likelihood of nuclear war increases." But "measured impact" implies data, which isn't provided. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The Doomsday Clock is the emblematic item created by the Bulletin, founded after the atomic bombings. The answer is Doomsday Clock.

11. **Question 11:** The New START treaty, which she helped secure during Obama's admin. So answer is New START.

12. **Question 12:** The clock moved one second closer. The article says "one second closer than we were for the past two years."

13. **Question 13:** The example is Hurricane Helene causing 40 inches of rain in her hometown. The extreme weather is Hurricane Helene.

14. **Question 14:** The Paris Agreement was withdrawn from by Trump, so that's the answer.

15. **Question 15:** Younger generations are less attentive to nuclear threats. The article says "younger generations don't think about nuclear threat as much."

16. **Question 16:** Sisu is from her Finnish mother's background. The article mentions her mother is Finnish.

17. **Question 17:** The article mentions AI, quantum, biotechnology as needing integration. The question asks which is singled out. The first is AI: "experts in A.I., quantum, biotechnology..." So AI is the first listed, but the question asks which is "singled out" — maybe AI is the answer since it's mentioned first, but the article says "A.I., quantum, biotechnology and climate change." The question says "emerging technological field" — AI is emerging, so the answer is artificial intelligence (AI).

18. **Question 18:** The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is noted as under duress. The article says "The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty... is under duress."

19. **Question 19:** The P5 Process is mentioned as the forum where she led discussions. The answer is P5 Process.
