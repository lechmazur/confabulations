Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each question strictly based on that. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about the Scottish village where Grady found the red triangle map marker. The article mentions Amberly, a tiny island in the Scottish Highlands. The map with the red triangle is there. So the answer is Amberly.

2. **Question 2**: Nicole's forged Mary Shelley letters. The article says Nicole is manufacturing a cache of fake letters from Mary Shelley to her mother. But how many did she successfully forge before being revealed? The text doesn't mention a specific number, so N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The Instagram follower who commented about Morgan's wife's death. The article states someone wrote "His wife's death wasn't an accident" in the comments. But no name is given. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The rare book Henry used to identify his location. After escaping being buried, Henry uses the library's books. The article doesn't specify which one, so N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Rosie's medical condition from stalking Morgan's social media. The article says she's in precarious health after a heart transplant and an emotional wreck. But the medical condition from stalking isn't stated. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Days Grady spent before finding bones. The text doesn't mention the number of days. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The title of the last investigation Abby was doing. The article doesn't mention the title of her case. She was helping a woman in the road, but the investigation's title isn't given. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Forgery technique Nicole learned from Mary Wollstonecraft's letters. The article says she studied to get into the mind of another person. Maybe "psychological immersion"? But the exact technique isn't named. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The website admin who connected Rosie and Morgan. The article mentions a website that matches organ recipients with donor families but doesn't name the admin. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: How many boyfriends before Morgan? The article says "yet another boyfriend she hoped to marry," implying multiple but not the exact number. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The map feature Rosie would find amusing. The Amberly map says "YOU ARE NOT HERE." Since Rosie is obsessed, the irony of that message might amuse her. So "YOU ARE NOT HERE."

12. **Question 12**: Document to discredit Grady's sanity. The article mentions "Happily Married" as a clue to unreliable narration. Maybe a fake diary entry like Rosie's obsession? The answer could be "diary entries" but needs to mirror "Cross My Heart's" plot. The article says Rosie uses social media, so maybe forged social media posts? The question says mirroring a plot device from Cross My Heart. Since Rosie uses social media stalking, Henry might forge social media posts. So "social media posts."

13. **Question 13**: Nicole's forgery that's a grander deception. Nicole's letters to Mary Wollstonecraft are historical. The article says forgery can tell "fresh truths." So her forgeries exemplify deception on a historical scale. Answer: "Mary Shelley's letters to Mary Wollstonecraft."

14. **Question 14**: Unsettling detail Will Gardener would add. Amberly's map says "YOU ARE NOT HERE." Maybe a similar confusing detail. So "a map with 'YOU ARE NOT HERE.'"

15. **Question 15**: Object in Grady's cottage that would trigger Rosie. The bones under floorboards. If she found them, she might link it to Morgan's wife. So "human remains under floorboards."

16. **Question 16**: Oxymoron for Grady's comment. The chapter titles include "Happily Married," which fits the irony. So "Happily Married."

17. **Question 17**: Object in cottage fueling conspiracy. The bones or the map. The article says Grady finds bones, so "human remains under floorboards."

18. **Question 18**: Most precarious mental state. Combining Rosie's obsession and Grady's isolation. The article says Rosie is an emotional wreck and Grady is distraught. So Rosie Lachlan.

19. **Question 19**: Grady's appealing aspect of forgery subculture. The forgery subculture has blackmail and murder, but Grady is struggling financially. The "perversely vague" island's offer of free rent? Or the financial gain despite dangers. The article says "the chance to live rent-free" but the subculture's aspect is "blackmail, murder... forgery... compelling, even addictive." So "the potential financial gain through forgery despite dangers."

20. **Question 20**: Event aspect causing misunderstandings. The setting of Beautiful Ugly has the isolated island without cell service. At a festival, maybe an isolated area without internet, causing mistrust. So "an isolated area without cell service or internet."

Wait, let me check again each question:

1. Amberly is the island, so that's correct.

2. No number given, so N/A.

3. No name given for the commenter, so N/A.

4. The book's name isn't mentioned, so N/A.

5. Medical condition from stalking isn't stated, so N/A.

6. Days not mentioned, N/A.

7. Abby's case title not given, N/A.

8. Technique not specified, N/A.

9. Admin not named, N/A.

10. Number of exes not stated, N/A.

11. The map's "YOU ARE NOT HERE" is correct.

12. The question says mirroring a plot device from Cross My Heart. Since Rosie uses social media stalking, the forged document could be social media posts, so answer is "social media posts."

13. Nicole's forgeries are the Mary Shelley letters, so that's the answer.

14. The map detail from Amberly's island, so "a map with 'YOU ARE NOT HERE'."

15. The human remains under floorboards would trigger her.

16. The oxymoron "Happily Married" is correct.

17. Same as 15, so same answer.

18. The combination of obsession and isolation would be Rosie's state, so her name.

19. Grady's financial struggles might find forgery's financial gain appealing despite dangers. The article says "forgery turns out to be the most exciting kind of crime" and Henry's subculture has financial aspects. So "the potential financial gain from forgery."

20. The isolated setting without internet, so that's the answer.

I think that's all. Let me format the answers now.
