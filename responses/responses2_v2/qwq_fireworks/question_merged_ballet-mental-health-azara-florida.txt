Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict instructions. Let me start by reading each question carefully and cross-referencing the article for answers.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks about the number of students with autism in Azara's preschool program who showed improved focus. The article mentions that the students "normally struggle to focus in school during the day, but when it comes to dance, they always pay attention and engage." However, there's no specific number given. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Dr. Eccles' research is mentioned, but the article doesn't cite a specific paper. It talks about her studies on hypermobility and creativity. Since no paper title is provided, N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The article states the lighting was tempered and the music wasn't overwhelming, but there's no mention of decibel levels. N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Flowers mentions she was drawn to dance because of its structure, but there's no specific year mentioned when she first discovered this. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The article mentions theaters implementing the program but doesn't provide ticket sales data. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Dr. Eccles is quoted saying a high proportion of dancers may be neurodivergent but not diagnosed. The article doesn't specify a percentage. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Julia Basso used brain wave measurements. The article says she measured intra- and interbrain synchrony using brain waves, so the tool would be "brain wave measurements" or "EEG" (though EEG isn't explicitly mentioned, the text says "measuring brain waves").

8. **Question 8:** New York City Ballet's sensory-friendly performances adjusted lighting and sound. The article says house lights aren't fully dimmed, so "tempered lighting" or "not fully dimmed."

9. **Question 9:** The article allows breaks but doesn't specify minutes per hour. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The USC course's results aren't quantified in the article. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Flowers found traditional ballet's harsh stage lights challenging. The article says Azara allows breaks from harsh lights, so "harsh stage lights."

12. **Question 12:** NYC Ballet's first sensory-friendly performance was "The Nutcracker." The article mentions that as their first example.

13. **Question 13:** Eccles' research links hypermobility and creativity. The sensory kit item isn't specified, so N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Kimsey noted that in sensory-friendly shows, some elements like lighting weren't fully dimmed, but the question asks what was unchanged. The article says audience members barely noticed a difference, so maybe the "visual content of the performance" stayed the same.

15. **Question 15:** Roosaare uses choreography for expression, similar to Lumberyard's goals. The answer is "choreography."

16. **Question 16:** The students experienced improved focus, which is a struggle in school. The answer is "focus" or "attention."

17. **Question 17:** Kimsey mentioned overstimulation from fast-moving rehearsals. The adjustment beyond volume could be "avoiding shouted corrections" or "moderated volume," but the article says corrections weren't shouted, so "no shouted corrections."

18. **Question 18:** Azara controls lighting and sound. Meghan Gentile mentioned house lights not dimmed, so "tempered lighting."

19. **Question 19:** Azara avoids shouted corrections. Traditional ballet might use shouted corrections, so "shouted corrections."

20. **Question 20:** The black box theater had tempered lighting and cool air. The structured environment mirrors the beneficial aspect, so "structured environment" or "clear directions."

Wait, let me check each again for accuracy.

1. No number given → N/A.

2. No paper name → N/A.

3. Decibel level not mentioned → N/A.

4. No year → N/A.

5. No ticket sales data → N/A.

6. Percentage not specified → N/A.

7. Julia Basso used "brain waves" measurement → answer "brain wave measurements."

8. NYC Ballet adjusted lighting by not dimming fully → "tempered lighting" or "house lights not fully dimmed." The question asks for the modification, so "tempered lighting."

9. No time specified → N/A.

10. No % increase → N/A.

11. Flowers found harsh lights challenging → "harsh stage lights."

12. NYC Ballet first did "Nutcracker" → "The Nutcracker."

13. Eccles' research on hypermobility and creativity → the sensory kit item isn't specified. Since the article mentions sensory kits include fidget toys, etc., but Eccles' research might prioritize something else. Since her focus is on hypermobility, maybe not directly. So N/A.

14. Kimsey said they barely noticed a difference, implying elements like the main performance were unchanged. The question asks what was most unchanged. The article says "the visual and text-based description of what to expect" is provided, but the unchanged element might be the actual performance content. The answer could be "the performance itself" or "visual elements like the show's content." The question specifies "visual element present in both," so maybe "lighting design" since they tempered it but maybe the main elements were the same. Alternatively, the "story or choreography" remained unchanged. The article says "they barely notice a difference," so maybe the main visual elements like the performance weren't altered. Answer: "the performance content" or "visual elements of the show" remained unchanged. The article says "I didn't know it was a sensory-friendly day" implying the main show elements were similar. So answer: "the performance's visual content."

15. Roosaare uses choreography → "choreographing."

16. The students' benefit is focus, which is a school struggle → "focus/attention."

17. Kimsey mentioned not shouting corrections, so the adjustment is avoiding shouted corrections. The question asks about auditory adjustments beyond volume control. The answer is "no shouted corrections."

18. Azara controls lighting; Gentile mentioned house lights not dimmed → "tempered lighting."

19. Traditional ballet uses shouted corrections, which Azara avoids → "shouted corrections."

20. The black box had tempered lighting and structure. The structured environment (clear directions) mirrors the beneficial aspect. The article says "structure" helped Flowers, so the element is "structured environment" or "clear instructions." The black box's environment had "tempered lighting and pleasantly cool air" and clear directions. The question asks what mirrored the beneficial structure. The "clear directions about hair and makeup" are mentioned, but the black box's environment's structured aspect is the "tempered lighting and cool air." Wait, the question says "element of the black box theater's environment... mirrored this beneficial aspect for autistic individuals." The beneficial aspect was structure. The black box's environment provided structure through clear instructions and controlled factors. The answer might be "controlled environmental factors" or "clear instructions." The article says "priority at Azara is dancers' health" and they receive clear directions. The black box's environment included "tempered lighting, pleasantly cool air" and clear schedule. The structured aspect is "clear schedule and instructions," so maybe "clear directions/schedule." The question asks for an environmental factor. The environmental factor would be "tempered lighting and cool air" but the beneficial aspect was structure. Hmm, maybe "structured environment" is the answer since it's mirrored by the controlled setting.

Alternatively, the question might refer to something like the "structured environment" being mirrored by the black box's controlled conditions. Since the article says "priority is dancers' health" and the environment's structure (like clear instructions), the element could be "clear directions about schedule and steps," but the question asks for an environmental factor. Maybe "tempered lighting and cool air" as part of the structured environment. But the question's last part says "mirrored this beneficial aspect for autistic individuals." The beneficial aspect was structure, so the environmental factor that provided structure is "clear directions about hair and makeup well in advance," but that's part of Azara's policies, not the theater's environment. The black box's environment had "tempered lighting and cool air" which provided a structured and calming environment. So the answer could be "controlled lighting and temperature."

But the question specifically asks what mirrored the beneficial aspect (structure). The article mentions "structure" helps with autism, so the theater's structured environment's element is "clear schedule provided by Roosaare" but that's part of the rehearsal process. Alternatively, the "structured environment" itself is the answer. Since the question is about the black box's environment, maybe "tempered lighting and cool air" as part of the structured environment. But the article states that the priority is health, and the environment's structure is part of that. The answer might be "controlled environmental conditions" but I'll check the exact text again.

The article says: "the black box theater where the show would soon take place. The atmosphere in the theater felt both active [...] and calm: There was tempered lighting, pleasantly cool air and [...] a seemingly innate awareness of the volume of their voices." The structured aspect here is the controlled environment (lighting, temperature, volume). The beneficial aspect for Flowers was structure, so the mirrored element is "controlled environmental factors like tempered lighting and cool air."

But the question asks for a specific type. Since the question is about what mirrored the structure, maybe "structured environment" or "clear instructions" but the environmental factor is the lighting and temperature. The answer might be "structured environment with tempered lighting and cool air." However, the question asks for "specific type of instruction" but wait, no. Wait question 20 is asking for an environmental factor in the black box that mirrored the beneficial structure. The answer is "tempered lighting and pleasantly cool air."

Wait, the question says: "what element of the black box theater's environment... mirrored this beneficial aspect for autistic individuals?" The beneficial aspect is structure. The environment's element that provided structure is the controlled conditions (lighting, temperature). So the answer is "tempered lighting and cool air."

Alternatively, maybe the "clear directions about schedule" are part of the environment's structure. But the question specifies environmental factors. So the answer is "tempered lighting and cool air."
