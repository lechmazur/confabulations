Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks how hormonal fluctuations in men contribute to their increased risk of chronic pain compared to women. The article mentions that women are more likely to develop chronic pain, with hormonal fluctuations and autoimmune disorders as reasons. Since the question is about men's hormonal contributions, but the text doesn't discuss men's hormones in this context, the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The article states there's no easy way to "see" pain like measuring a tumor. It says doctors ask for a 1-10 scale. No biomarker for tumor-like monitoring is mentioned, so N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The text says women are more at risk due to hormones and autoimmune issues. The question asks why men are more susceptible to autoimmune disorders, but the article doesn't say men are; it's the opposite. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The article mentions animal models (mice) but says drugs failed in humans. No successful drug from these models is named, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The article doesn't link chronic pain cases to cerebral cortex shrinkage in Alzheimer's. It compares monitoring pain to tumor size and Alzheimer's shrinkage, but no percentage is given. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The article says chronic pain gets a fraction of funding compared to cancer and diabetes but doesn't provide exact numbers. Without specific numerical comparison, N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The multidisciplinary clinics include physical therapy, counseling, pharmacists, neurologists. No surgical specialty mentioned for repairing nerves. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The text doesn't mention gene-editing tech like CRISPR. It talks about imaging and tissue samples but not gene editing. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The article doesn't state when chronic pain became a leading cause of death. It says we used to think people die in pain not of it, but no date for classification. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The article says hormonal fluctuations in women (like estrogen?) contribute, but doesn't name a specific steroid hormone. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The article mentions imaging tech and computing to capture pain signatures. The method isn't named (like MRI or PET), so N/A.

12. **Question 12:** The author's pain started in summer 2023 and realized it was chronic after weeks turned to months. The exact months? The text says "as weeks turned into months" but not how many. N/A unless "months" is vague. Wait, the question asks how many months. Since it's unspecified, N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Same as question 6. No numerical funding difference stated. N/A.

14. **Question 14:** The text mentions immunologic processes but doesn't specify a particular marker. N/A.

15. **Question 15:** The article says cellular changes trigger hyperactivation, but doesn't name a singular alteration. It refers to a "complex set," so N/A.

16. **Question 16:** The only tool mentioned is the 1-10 pain scale. The question asks for a clinical tool similar to tumor monitoring. Since that's not available, the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "all doctors can do is ask someone to rate their pain on a scale from 1 to 10." So the tool is the 1-10 scale. But the question asks for a tool similar to tumor size monitoring. Since there's none, the answer is N/A. Wait, maybe the answer is the 1-10 scale? The question says "solely available clinical tool for assessing chronic pain in a manner similar to monitoring tumor size" â€” but the article says there's no such tool except the scale. But the scale isn't similar to tumor measurement. So the answer is N/A.

17. **Question 17:** The clinics have neurologists, pharmacists, etc., but the question asks for an additional qualification beyond neurological expertise. The article says "multidisciplinary approach" but doesn't specify a qualification. N/A.

18. **Question 18:** The article states "once a person has one kind of chronic pain, they're more likely to develop another." But no fraction or percentage is given. N/A.

19. **Question 19:** The article says "there is no national center for the study of chronic pain." So the answer is N/A.
