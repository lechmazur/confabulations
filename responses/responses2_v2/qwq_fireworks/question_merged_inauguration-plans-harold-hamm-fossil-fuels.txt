Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful to answer strictly based on the text and not use any outside knowledge.

1. **Question 1**: How many millions of dollars did Harold Hamm personally invest in Summit Carbon Solutions' pipeline project? The article mentions that Summit Carbon Solutions' project is $9 billion, but it only says Hamm is an investor. There's no specific amount stated for his personal investment. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Which former oil executive did Trump appoint to lead his government-wide energy council who hosted celebrations? The article says Doug Burgum was Trump's pick to run the Interior Department and the energy council. But the host is Harold Hamm. Wait, the question asks who Trump appointed to lead the energy council that "later hosted celebrations"? The host was Hamm, but the appointment is Burgum. The question might be mixing, but according to the text, Burgum is the appointee, and Hamm hosted. The question's wording is tricky, but the answer is Doug Burgum. Wait, the question says "former oil executive" and "hosted celebrations at the Hay-Adams Hotel"? The host was Hamm, but the appointee to the energy council is Burgum. The question might be a bit confused, but the answer is Doug Burgum because the energy council role is his, even if he didn't host. Wait, the question says "who later hosted celebrations"—no, the host was Hamm. Hmm, maybe the question is wrong. Wait, the article says Doug Burgum is Trump's pick to run the energy council. The event was hosted by Harold Hamm. The question says "the former oil executive Trump appointed to lead his government-wide energy council during his first term that later hosted celebrations..." But the host was Hamm, not Burgum. But the question might be incorrect, so according to the article, the answer would be N/A because Burgum didn't host. Wait, the question is phrased as "who did Trump appoint... that later hosted..." So the appointee must be the one who hosted. Since Burgum is the appointee and the host is Hamm, the answer is N/A. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The article says "Doug Burgum, Mr. Trump's pick to run the Interior Department... and a government-wide energy council." The event was hosted by Harold Hamm. So the answer is N/A because the person appointed (Burgum) didn't host. So answer N/A. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The question says "the former oil executive did Trump appoint... that later hosted..." So the host must be the appointee. Since the host is Hamm, who isn't mentioned as the appointee, the answer is N/A. Hmm, tricky. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me see again. The question is asking for the person appointed to lead the energy council (Burgum) who hosted the event. Since he didn't, the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Total amount raised by Hamm from oil donors at Mar-a-Lago dinner. The article says Trump asked for $1B but doesn't state how much was raised at the dinner. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Minimum donation to attend Hamm's event. The article mentions "high-dollar event for folks seeking access" but no specific amount. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Number of ethanol plants in ND connected? The project collects emissions from ethanol plants in five states and sends to ND. The article doesn't specify how many in ND. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Percentage of Trump's promises at Mar-a-Lago about Arctic drilling. The article mentions Arctic drilling as one of his pledges but doesn't state a percentage. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Environmental regs overturned by Burgum aligned with Continental. The article says Burgum supported Summit's project opposed by landowners, but not specific regulations overturned. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Combined contributions from Liberty Energy and Devon to Trump's 2024. The article says Continental and others, but specific amounts for these companies aren't given. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Number of execs who declined due to ethics. The article mentions Rob Lockwood said Burgum wouldn't attend due to formal proceedings, but not others for ethics. N/A (only Burgum declined, but reason is formal events, not ethics).

10. **Question 10**: Role of Bruce Rastetter in Trump's energy policy during transition. Rastetter runs Summit Agriculture, which is a sponsor, but the article doesn't mention his role in policy proposals. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Lobbying group founded by the person stepping down from Liberty Energy (Chris Wright). The article says Hamm founded Domestic Producers Energy Alliance. Wait, the question says the person stepping down is Chris Wright (from Liberty Energy to lead Energy Dept). The group founded by that person would be? The article says "Domestic Producers Energy Alliance, a lobbying group that Mr. Hamm founded". Wait, the question is asking for the group founded by the person stepping down from Liberty Energy (Wright). But the article says Hamm founded that group. So the answer is Domestic Producers Energy Alliance, but the founder is Hamm, not Wright. The question is incorrect, so answer N/A? Wait, the person stepping down is Chris Wright (founder of Liberty Energy). The question asks for the lobbying group founded by that person (Wright) to fight climate policies. The article says Hamm founded that group. So answer N/A because the founder is Hamm, not Wright. Therefore, N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Total donations from Hamm and Rastetter to PACs. The article says Hamm donated $4.3M, but Rastetter's donation isn't mentioned. So N/A.

13. **Question 13**: Company advised by Rob Lockwood whose parent sponsored the event. Rob Lockwood is adviser to Doug Burgum. The sponsors include Summit Agriculture Group, parent of Summit Carbon Solutions. The article says "Summit Agriculture Group, the parent company of Summit Carbon Solutions LLC, is also an event sponsor." So the company advised by Lockwood (Burgum's adviser) is Summit Agriculture Group? Or the question is about the company Rob Lockwood advises? The question says "which company... did Rob Lockwood advise?" The article says Lockwood is an adviser to Burgum, not to a company. So N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Other proceeding Burgum planned to attend. The article states Rob Lockwood said Burgum would instead participate in "formal inauguration proceedings" on Jan 20. The question asks besides Hamm's event, what other formal proceeding? The answer is "formal inauguration proceedings".

15. **Question 15**: Specific environmental reg opposed by Burgum related to Hamm's investments. The project is Summit's carbon pipeline. The article says Burgum supported the project opposed by landowners, but doesn't mention a specific regulation. N/A.

16. **Question 16**: Combined cost of projects Hamm is involved in. The Summit project is $9B, but any others? The article mentions Continental's Bakken production but not costs. So only $9B. Answer 9.

17. **Question 17**: Percentage of oil industry's $75M contributed by Hamm. The industry spent $75M, Hamm gave $4.3M through PACs. So (4.3/75)*100 = ~5.7%. But the question asks "through political action committees supporting Mr. Trump". The article says "Hamm poured more than $4.3M into PACs supporting Trump". The industry's total for electing Trump was over $75M. So 4.3/75 ≈5.7%, but the question asks for the percentage. The exact number isn't given, but the article says "more than $4.3M" and "over $75M". So approximate, but since the question requires exact, N/A because it's not stated. Wait, the question says "percentage of the total amount spent by the oil and gas industry to elect Mr. Trump was contributed by the founder..." So total industry: over $75M, Hamm's contribution: $4.3M. The exact percentage isn't stated, so N/A.

18. **Question 18**: Organization headed by Thomas Pyle that sponsored the event. The article mentions American Energy Alliance, which Pyle leads, but the sponsors listed are Domestic Producers Energy Alliance, API, etc. The question asks which was a top sponsor. The article doesn't say American Energy Alliance was a sponsor. The sponsor is Domestic Producers (founded by Hamm) and API. So answer N/A.

19. **Question 19**: Research group that obtained docs via FOIA. The article says Fieldnotes obtained via public records request. Public records request is similar to FOIA. So Fieldnotes.

20. **Question 20**: Company run by Rastetter who donated to Trump. The article says Summit Agriculture Group is run by Bruce Rastetter, who donated to Trump and GOP. So Summit Agriculture Group.
