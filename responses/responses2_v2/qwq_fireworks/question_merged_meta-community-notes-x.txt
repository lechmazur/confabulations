Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer strictly based on that. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question asks for the percentage of Community Notes on climate change that became public according to MediaWise. Scanning the article, I remember it mentions posts about immigration and abortion. Wait, the article says "posts about immigration" had 6% and "abortion" had 4%. There's no mention of climate change. So the answer here should be N/A.

2. The second question is about the role at X of the person who talked about users distrusting fact-checking due to bias. The article states Keith Coleman is a VP of Product overseeing Community Notes. So his role is Vice President of Product.

3. The hurricane season example: the incorrect flag was on storm forecasts. The article says they labeled storm forecasts as inaccurate. So the answer is storm forecasts.

4. When did Zuckerberg announce the shift? The article says after Musk's influence. Musk acquired X in 2022, and the article mentions Zuckerberg's announcement but doesn't specify the year. The article was written in the present, but since Musk's move was post-2022, maybe Zuckerberg's announcement was in 2023? Wait, the article says "Mr. Zuckerberg said, 'We're going to get rid of fact checkers and replace them with Community Notes similar to X, starting in the U.S.'" But the article doesn't give a specific year. So the exact year isn't provided. So N/A.

5. The medical condition in Antigua: the article mentions treating cancer patients using an unproven blood filter. So the answer is cancer.

6. The Poynter Institute's MediaWise is part of the Poynter Institute itself. The article says "MediaWise, a media literacy program at the Poynter Institute," so the organization is the Poynter Institute.

7. The program Musk accelerated was Community Notes, which led to removing fact-checking labels. The article says X's Community Notes began before Musk, but he accelerated it. So the program's name is Community Notes.

8. The regulatory body avoided by the companies in Antigua: the article mentions they were out of reach of American regulators. So the answer is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or another, but the article doesn't specify. Wait, the article says "out of reach of American regulators," but the exact name isn't given. Since it's about medical treatments, maybe the FDA? But since the article doesn't name it, answer N/A.

9. The protest in Silicon Valley: employees did "subtle acts of defiance" as per the article. So the answer is subtle acts of defiance.

10. Question 10 is the same as question 1, but about climate change again. Still N/A.

11. The number of YouTube's content moderators before transitioning: the article says YouTube uses third-party evaluators but doesn't mention numbers. So N/A.

12. The political party's criticism leading Meta to change: the article says Republicans' complaints. So the answer is Republicans.

13. Health crisis referenced by Zuckerberg? The article mentions Musk's removal of fact-checking on elections and Covid-19. Zuckerberg's announcement might reference those, but the question asks for the specific crisis he mentioned. The article doesn't quote his exact words beyond the statement about replacing fact-checkers. So maybe N/A unless inferred. Since he referenced X's approach, which removed labels on elections and Covid, perhaps he mentioned the pandemic? The article doesn't explicitly state, so N/A.

14. Country for the hurricane mislabeling: the article doesn't specify a country for the hurricane example. Just mentions hurricane season generally. So N/A.

15. Numerical threshold for abortion notes: the 4% publication rate is mentioned, but the question asks for the threshold (like percentage agreement needed). The article states that users with differing viewpoints must agree before it's published. But the exact number isn't given. Since it's 4% published, maybe the threshold isn't stated. So N/A.

16. Number of fact-checking labels during 2022 midterms: the article says X did away with labels post-Musk, but the exact number isn't provided. So N/A.
