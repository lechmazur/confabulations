Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked and not infer beyond the text.

1. The first question asks about the percentage improvement in skin elasticity from the combination of red and near-infrared compared to the sham. The article mentions the 2007 trial where each form of light treatment (including the combination) improved wrinkles and elasticity vs. sham. However, it doesn't provide specific percentages. So the answer is N/A.

2. The 2007 trial's funding: The article doesn't mention any pharmaceutical company funding it. So N/A.

3. Dr. Shirazi recommended a green light wavelength for hyperpigmentation? The article only discusses red, blue, and near-infrared. Green isn't mentioned. N/A.

4. Dr. Sanan's measurements on penetration depth between red and blue. The article says red penetrates deeply, blue less so. But no exact nanometer difference given. N/A.

5. Duration of improvements after stopping? The text says to be patient for results but doesn't mention how long effects last post-treatment. N/A.

6. Highest protein increase from near-infrared. The article says red boosts collagen and elastin. Near-infrared promotes healing but doesn't specify which protein increased most. N/A.

7. 2019 acne study participants with complete clearance. The 2019 review had mixed results and didn't mention complete clearance numbers. The 2011 study had less acne but not 100%. N/A.

8. Temperature threshold triggering melanin? Dr. Bowe says if skin warms, might darken. But no specific temp given. N/A.

9. Number of bacteria eliminated by blue light. The article states blue kills some types but doesn't specify count. N/A.

10. Dr. Tripathi's minimum bulb number? He says more bulbs are better but no exact number. N/A.

11. Percentage reduction in wrinkles from 2019 review vs 2007's sham? The 2019 study was on acne, not wrinkles. The 2007 study's results aren't compared here. N/A.

12. Red light range to avoid with retinoid cream. The user is mixing retinoid (light-sensitizing) with red light (630-700nm). Dr. Tripathi didn't specify a range here. The article mentions avoiding if on light-sensitive meds, but exact nm? N/A.

13. Autoimmune condition worsened by collagen from 700nm. The article says those with certain autoimmune conditions should avoid unless advised. No specific condition named. N/A.

14. Doubling wrinkle reduction via more bulbs? The article says more bulbs are better but no linear relation stated. N/A.

15. Facial feature getting suboptimal treatment from bad design. Even spacing and bulb count affect coverage. Maybe areas like the nose or corners that might be missed if bulbs aren't spaced well. But the text doesn't name a feature. N/A.

16. Synergistic antibiotic with blue light. The article mentions antibiotics as light-sensitive meds. But which type? N/A.

17. Wavelength causing darkening with heat. The article says skin darkening from heat, likely red (since blue's shorter, red/near-IR might cause more heat). But the article says "ideally, it shouldn't" so if it warms, it's probably the red/near-IR. But the question specifies red and blue. The answer might be red (630-700nm), but the article says if it warms, stop. The question asks which wavelength is the contributor. Since blue is shorter, maybe red's longer wavelengths heat more. So answer 630-700, but the article doesn't specify. Wait, the article says "if the treatment warms your skin -- ideally, it shouldn't, Dr. Bowe said. But if it does, you may want to stop using it." So the warming is from the device. The article says blue light is shorter (400-490). Red is deeper. Maybe the red/near-IR causes more heat. But the question specifies red and blue light used. The darkening is from heat, so whichever wavelength caused the heat. Since the article doesn't specify which, but the device's heat is a problem, so maybe the red light (since it's deeper and possibly more heating?), but the exact nm? The answer would be red's range (630-700). The question asks for the wavelength most likely. So answer: 630-700. Wait, but the question is phrased as "specific wavelength", but the answer is a range. The article mentions red light between 630-700, so that's the range. So answer 630-700nm.

Wait, but the article says "if the treatment warms your skin -- ideally, it shouldn't, Dr. Bowe said. But if it does, you may want to stop using it." So the heat is from the device. The red light is deeper, but the blue might not heat as much. So the red/near-infrared might be the cause. So the answer would be red light's range (630-700). The question asks for the wavelength, so the range given in the article is 630-700 for red. So answer is 630-700 nm. But the question says "specific wavelength", but the answer is a range. However, the article says red light is 630-700, so that's the range. So answer: 630-700.

18. Total minutes over six weeks at max frequency. The 2007 study used 20 mins twice a week for four weeks. Dr. Shirazi says 10-20 mins, 3-5x/week. Max would be 20 mins, 5x/week. Six weeks: 20*5*6 = 600 mins.

19. Skin infection worsened by near-infrared. The article says contraindicated for those with active infections. Near-infrared promotes healing, so maybe infections that need to be treated, not accelerated. The article doesn't specify the type. N/A.

20. Safety feature for hand-held near eyes beyond eye holes. The article mentions protective goggles or closing eyes. FDA-cleared devices might have an automatic shut-off if eyes are open? Or a sensor? The article doesn't say. But the instructions say to use goggles or close eyes. The safety feature beyond holes/shields would be something else. The article says "wear protective goggles or to close your eyes when using hand-held devices". So maybe the device has a sensor to detect open eyes and turn off? But the text doesn't mention that. The only other thing is maybe an automatic timer? Not sure. The article says "always use it as directed -- typically 10 to 20 minutes per session, three to five times per week." So maybe a timer. But the question is about a safety feature beyond eye holes/shields. The answer might be "protective goggles" but that's already mentioned. The article says "use masks with eye holes or eye shields" for masks, but for hand-held, you need to close eyes or use goggles. So the safety feature for hand-held would be requiring goggles, but the question asks for a feature in the device itself. Since the text doesn't mention another feature, answer N/A. Wait, the article says "it's important to wear protective goggles or to close your eyes when using hand-held devices, or to use masks with eye holes or eye shields". So the device itself might have a shield, but the question is for hand-held. The safety feature beyond eye holes/shields would be something else. The article doesn't mention any other feature. So N/A.
