Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. 

1. **Question 1**: The question asks which Trump appointee at the Fed voted in favor of Barr's Basel III proposal, showing a break from party alignment. The article mentions that two of the Fed's seven governors, both Trump appointees, voted against the rules. Since they voted against, there's no mention of a Trump appointee voting in favor. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: It asks how many months Barr spent developing the initial Basel III proposal before its first presentation. The article doesn't provide specific dates or durations for the development phase. N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The percentage increase in capital requirements for regional banks under $100B. The article states Barr's proposal required larger banks to increase their capital but doesn't specify percentages for regional banks. N/A.

4. **Question 4**: A Democratic senator defending Barr during hearings about the Silicon Valley Bank crisis. The article quotes Senator Tim Scott (Republican) criticizing Barr. No mention of a Democratic senator defending him. N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Total monetary value affected by the original proposal. The text doesn't give specific figures on asset values. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Trump's preferred candidate to replace Barr. The article says Trump hasn't announced plans, so N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Number of Fed Board members supporting the moratorium. The article states the Fed announced the moratorium but doesn't specify how many members supported it. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Legal precedent cited by Barr's lawyers. The article says Barr believed he'd prevail but doesn't mention a specific precedent. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Wall Street CEO criticizing the proposal at a September conference. The article mentions blowback from banks and lawmakers but doesn't name a specific CEO. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Projected timeline for revised Basel III rules. The article says the proposal was watered down in September but doesn't state the timeline. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Relation between West Point club closures and Barr's resignation. The article links D.E.I. actions to West Point but doesn't connect it to Barr's decision. N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Critical mineral tied to financial regulations. Trudeau mentions critical minerals but the article doesn't specify which ones relate to Barr's oversight. N/A.

13. **Question 13**: Number of lawsuits before CBS and Des Moines cases. The article says Trump's cases are new but doesn't state prior counts. N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Quarles' legal argument for loosening rules. The article says Quarles worked to loosen supervision but doesn't mention the specific legal argument. N/A.

15. **Question 15**: Al Qaeda group mentioned with migrants in Guantanamo. The article states migrants are held in the same prison as Al Qaeda but doesn't name a specific group. N/A.

All answers are N/A except where explicitly stated, but I need to check each detail again in the text.
