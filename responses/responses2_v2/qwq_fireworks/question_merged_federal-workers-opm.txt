Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked without assuming anything beyond the text.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions that up to 17 inspectors general were removed, but it doesn't specify the reason as refusing to approve payments. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The Treasury Department's email confirmed legality but advised consulting ethics officials. The first validation came from the Office of Personnel Management, but the question asks which department's ethics official first validated. Wait, the article says the Treasury's email urged consulting their bureau's ethics official. But the first validation was from OPM. The question is about which department's ethics official first validated. The unsigned HHS email said OPM verified, then the Treasury's email confirmed. Maybe the first validation was by OPM, but the question is about the department's ethics official. The answer might be N/A since it's the OPM, not a cabinet department's ethics office first.

Wait, the article says: "The department notifying them that the OPM verified that its own emails were 'valid, lawful and will be honored even in the lapse of appropriations.'" So HHS got an unsigned email from their department that OPM verified. The first validation was OPM's, but the question is which department's ethics official first validated. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A because the first validation was OPM's, not a specific department's ethics office.

3. **Question 3:** Elon Musk suggested at least $2 trillion could be slashed from the $6.7 trillion budget. The question asks the total Trump claimed for his Manhattan Project-scale initiative. The article says Musk's figure, but Trump's claim isn't specified. Wait, the article says "he had said... would match the ambition of the Manhattan Project." The exact amount isn't stated for Trump's target, but Musk's $2 trillion is mentioned. The question is about Trump's claimed amount. Since the article doesn't specify Trump's number, but Musk's is $2 trillion, maybe that's the answer? Wait, the question says "Trump claimed could be saved through his Manhattan Project-scale..." The article says Musk originally suggested $2T, but Trump's target isn't given. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The union president said it's "not yet clear" how the program would affect them, so no percentage is given. Answer N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The article doesn't mention Elon Musk presenting a revised target after the crash. The crash happened the day before the email. No info on timing of Musk's presentation. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The email from OPM, not a specific Cabinet head, mentioned the "dream destination." The article doesn't name a Cabinet member who approved it. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The article states employees must quit by Feb 6 to get pay through Sept. But it doesn't mention minimum service length. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The article says thousands could be affected, but no number is given for how many had already accepted. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The Treasury email mentioned consulting ethics officials but didn't cite a specific statute. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The frozen grants total trillions, but exact amount isn't given. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Musk said at least $2T from $6.7T budget. The $271B is 2022 spending. The percentage would be ($2T/$271B)*100, but the article doesn't state this as a percentage of the $271B. The question asks what percentage of the $271B did Musk propose. Since he mentioned $2T from the total budget ($6.7T), not the $271B salaries. So N/A.

12. **Question 12:** The article says up to 17 inspectors general were removed. The Partnership for Public Service is quoted, but they didn't specify numbers. So answer is 17, but the question asks how many were slated for elimination by the admin, which the article says "as many as 17" so answer 17.

13. **Question 13:** The Department of Health and Human Services sent the unsigned email. So answer HHS.

14. **Question 14:** The email says employees could start the program by Feb 6. The month is February.

15. **Question 15:** The article states 10 migrants in Guantanamo. The crash's cause isn't linked to those migrants. The answer is 10.

16. **Question 16:** The sarcastic comment mentions "Trumpcoin" and "Trump Bible." So answer Trumpcoin and Trump Bible.

17. **Question 17:** The National Air Traffic Controllers Association's president, Nick Daniels. So answer National Air Traffic Controllers Association.

18. **Question 18:** The other media outlet is The Des Moines Register.

19. **Question 19:** The DEI section says West Point ended a dozen clubs. "dozen" is 12.

20. **Question 20:** The infrastructure is a "tent city" to house migrants. So answer tent city.
