Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start by going through each question and cross-referencing with the text.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks about the percentage increase in the economy projected over a decade by Eric Zwick's team if individual tax cuts are continued. The article mentions that Zwick's team estimated a 1% larger economy over 10 years. But the question specifies "assuming continuation of the individual tax cuts slated for expiration." Wait, the article's part about Zwick talks about the corporate tax cuts. The individual tax cuts expiring might be a different part. Hmm. Wait, the 1% is from the corporate cuts, not the individual ones. The question is about individual tax cuts, but the answer in the article for Zwick's research is about corporate. Since the question mentions individual tax cuts, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, but the question might have a mistake. The article's Zwick part is about corporate tax cuts. So maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "assuming the continuation of the individual tax cuts slated for expiration." The article says that the Zwick study was on corporate tax cuts. The individual tax cuts expiring are part of the 2017 law, but the 1% is from corporate. So since the question is about individual tax cuts, the answer is N/A? Or maybe I misread. Let me check again. The question says "individual tax cuts," but the Zwick research was on corporate. So answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe the question is a trick. Let me see. The article says "the law would help the economy become 1 percent larger over 10 years." The law includes both corporate and individual cuts. But the question specifically asks about individual tax cuts. Since the answer isn't separated, maybe it's N/A. Alternatively, maybe the 1% is from the entire law, but the question is about individual. Hmm, tricky. Maybe N/A.

Wait, the question says "assuming the continuation of the individual tax cuts slated for expiration." The article mentions that the corporate tax cuts were part of the law, but the individual ones are expiring. The Zwick study's 1% is about the law as a whole, but the question is only about individual. Since the article doesn't separate the effects, the answer is N/A. I'll go with N/A here.

2. **Question 2:** The second question asks how many student clubs West Point closed due to Trump's DEI ban. The article says DEI section mentions West Point leaders complied by ending a dozen student clubs. "Dozen" means 12. So the answer is 12.

3. **Question 3:** The wage increase per worker according to the model that refuted the revenue-neutral claim. The Zwick team estimated $750 more in wages per worker over 10 years. The question refers to the researchers who refuted the revenue-neutral claim, which Zwick did. So the answer is $750.

4. **Question 4:** The year the economists (Joint Committee on Taxation and Fed) published their findings on top earners. The article says "one study by economists at the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation and the Federal Reserve looked at the near-term corporate response..." The article doesn't specify the year, so it's N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The specific amount the CBO attributed to inflation's impact on tax revenue. The article states the CBO said "much of the higher tax revenue was a result of higher inflation's pushing up prices and earnings." But it doesn't give a specific figure, so N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Original corporate tax rate before the Trump administration's law. The article says the corporate rate was cut to 21% from 35%, so the original was 35%.

7. **Question 7:** Projected deficit increase over ten years according to estimates at the time. The article mentions estimates found it would add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. The law prompted a study by Joint Committee on Taxation and the Fed (which is the Federal Reserve, but the study was by the Joint Committee and Fed economists). The answer is $1.5 trillion.

8. **Question 8:** The economic indicator cited by Tax Policy Center co-director Bill Gale. He said the law increased the deficit and redistributed resources to the wealthy. The question asks for the evidence against the administration's claims. The economic indicator would be the deficit increase and wealth redistribution. The question asks for the specific indicator. The answer is "increased the deficit" or "redistribution to the wealthy," but the question asks for the economic indicator. The article says "the things that are harder to pin down are whether and how much it raised investment and whether and how much it affected wages." But the evidence he cites is the deficit and redistribution. The question asks for the evidence against the claims, so the answer is the increased deficit.

9. **Question 9:** Which corporate tax rate cut is described as generating the 1% boost. The article says the corporate rate was cut from 35% to 21%, and the 1% growth came from that. So the cut is 35% to 21%, so the percentage cut is 14% (35-21=14). Wait, but percentage-wise it's a reduction of (14/35)*100 â‰ˆ 40%. But the question asks for the percentage cut, so maybe 14 percentage points. The article says "cut the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent". The percentage cut in terms of points is 14. The question says "implicitly described as generating the estimated economic boost" which was the 1%. Since the cut was from 35 to 21, the percentage cut is 14 points. The answer is 14 percentage points, but the question might just want the numbers 35% to 21%, so the cut is 21% (the new rate)? Wait, the question is asking for the percentage cut, so the reduction from 35% to 21% is a 14% point decrease. The answer is 14 percentage points, but the question might want the figure as 21% (the new rate) but the cut is from 35 to 21. The question says "which percentage cut" so the answer is 21%? Or the cut is 14 points. The article says "cut the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent" so the cut was 14 percentage points. The answer is 14 percentage points, but the question might just want the number 21? Wait the question says "implicitly described as generating the estimated economic boost?" The boost was from the corporate tax cut. The cut was 14 points (from 35 to 21). So the answer is 14 percentage points. But the question asks for the percentage cut. The percentage cut in terms of the rate is (35-21)/35 = ~40%, but the article refers to the rate change as a point difference. Since the question says "percentage cut", maybe 14% (but that's not correct). Alternatively, the article says "cut the corporate rate to 21%", so the cut was 21%? No, the cut was from 35 to 21. The answer is the cut was 14 percentage points. The question might just want the new rate, but the article says the cut was from 35 to 21. The question is about the percentage cut (the reduction), so 14 percentage points. The answer is 14.

10. **Question 10:** The monetary figure cited as the projected deficit increase over a decade. The article says estimates found it would add $1.5 trillion. So the answer is $1.5 trillion.

11. **Question 11:** Which professor (Auerbach) who mentored an adviser said post-2020 data is unsuitable. The article says Alan Auerbach, who had Kevin Hassett (Trump's adviser) as a student, said "from 2020 the data is kind of useless". So the answer is Alan Auerbach.

12. **Question 12:** The article implies a relationship between USAID closure and tax reforms? The article mentions USAID closure was done by Trump, and the Treasury confirmation was about extending tax cuts. The article doesn't link USAID to tax reforms directly. The question is about any relationship. The answer might be N/A, but maybe it's implied that both are part of Trump's policies. But the question asks if the article implies a relationship. Since the article just lists them as separate points under different sections, there's no direct link stated. So N/A.

13. **Question 13:** The calculation measure used to correlate 1% economy boost to $750 per worker. The article says "they estimated that the law would help the economy become 1 percent larger over 10 years, growth that in turn pointed toward roughly $750 more in wages for each American worker." The measure is "point toward" or "extrapolate", but the question asks for the calculation measure. The article says "back of the envelope" modeling. The answer is "back of the envelope modeling".

14. **Question 14:** The inference about inflation's role in tax collections. The CBO said higher tax revenue was due to inflation. The answer is that inflation pushed up prices and earnings, leading to higher tax revenue.

15. **Question 15:** Which element had least influence on growth compared to capital reforms. The article says individual tax cuts (lower rates and standard deduction) are least important. The answer is "lower individual tax rates and larger standard deduction".

16. **Question 16:** The rationale from Tax Policy Center co-director (Bill Gale) on the law's effect. He said it increased the deficit and redistributed to the wealthy. The answer combines both points: "increased the deficit and redistributed resources toward the wealthy".
