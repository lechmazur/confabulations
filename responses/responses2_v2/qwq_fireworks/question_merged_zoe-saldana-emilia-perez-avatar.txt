Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful and make sure I'm only using the information from the text. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks how many Golden Globe nominations "Avatar: The Way of Water" received, which solidified Saldana's status. Looking through the article, I see that "Emilia Perez" scored 10 Golden Globe nominations, including a supporting-actress nod for Saldana. But the question is about "Avatar: The Way of Water". The article mentions that "Avatar: The Way of Water" is one of her highest-grossing movies, but there's no mention of its Golden Globe nominations. So the answer here is N/A.

2. The second question is about Saldana's husband's role in her declining "Lioness" and leading to her breakthrough in "Center Stage". The article states that when Taylor Sheridan offered her "Lioness", she turned it down until she asked for more time. Her husband urged her not to back out of the meeting with Audiard, but that's for "Emilia Perez", not "Lioness". The breakthrough in "Center Stage" is mentioned as part of her early career, but the question links her husband's role in declining "Lioness" to "Center Stage", which isn't connected in the text. So N/A here.

3. The third question asks about the ballet technique she mastered at 13 during a phone call that became the cornerstone of "El Mal". The article mentions she channeled her frustration into ballet classes, but doesn't name a specific technique. The "El Mal" number is described as a song-and-dance, but the technique isn't specified. So N/A.

4. The fourth question is about the cuisine shared at Beverly Hills Hotel. The text says they had a bottle of Brunello and talked about her career. Brunello is an Italian wine, but the cuisine isn't specified. The article doesn't mention the type of cuisine, so N/A.

5. The fifth question asks for the title of the first "Avatar" sequel that got her closest Oscar nod. The first Avatar is mentioned as her closest, not the sequel. "Avatar: The Way of Water" is the sequel, but her closest was the first Avatar. The answer should be "Avatar".

6. The sixth question is the primary reason her Dominican classmates bullied her. The text says they bullied her for being too poor, too gawky, and too dark-skinned. The primary reason is being poor, but the question might want all, but the answer is "being too poor, too gawky, and too dark-skinned" but since it's asking for the primary, maybe "too poor" but the article lists all three as reasons. Since the question asks for the primary, but the text doesn't prioritize, perhaps it's all three. But the exact wording is needed. The answer is "too poor, too gawky and too dark-skinned".

7. The seventh question is the French director who offered her Rita. The article says Jacques Audiard directed "Emilia Perez", so that's him. Answer: Jacques Audiard.

8. The eighth question is the object she was bashful about displaying. The Cannes trophy, as mentioned when her husband told her to display it. Answer: Cannes trophy.

9. The ninth question is her "Avengers: Endgame" character. The article says Gamora. Answer: Gamora.

10. The tenth question is the showrunner who offered her a role in his series, leading her to confront dyslexia. The article mentions Taylor Sheridan of "Yellowstone" offering "Lioness". So answer: Taylor Sheridan.

11. The eleventh question is the director who initially refused to delay but then agreed. The article says Audiard waited a year despite her scheduling. Initially, he was willing to rewrite but needed to shoot in 2022, so he pushed it. The answer is Jacques Audiard.

12. The twelfth question is the childhood trauma. Her father's death at age 9. Answer: Her father's death in a car crash.

13. The thirteenth question is the franchise she abandoned mid-contract. The article says she juggled "Avatar", "Star Trek", and "Guardians" but wanted to do other films. She took on "Emilia Perez" after finishing the third "Guardians". So maybe "Guardians of the Galaxy"? The question says "mid-contract", but she finished the third, so perhaps not. The article says she feared cutting herself off from other films while doing those franchises. The answer might be "Guardians of the Galaxy".

14. The fourteenth question compares the "Avatar" filming to Audiard's process. She mentions working with Cameron on the first Avatar felt like an experiment where they found things as they went. So the technical aspect is "motion-capture work" or "experimenting as they shot". The answer is "motion-capture work".

15. The fifteenth question is which film has the confrontation via flamenco at a charity event. "Emilia Perez" has "El Mal", a song-and-dance number at a charity gala. Flamenco is a style mentioned in the description. Answer: Emilia Perez.

16. The sixteenth question is the Hollywood landmark she found haunting. The Hollywood sign is described as a ghost with no spiritual energy. Answer: Hollywood sign.
