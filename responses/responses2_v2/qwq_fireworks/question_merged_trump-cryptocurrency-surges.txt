Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each question exactly as asked. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** "Which foreign cryptocurrency exchange did Eric Trump specifically promote during his speech at the Crypto Ball?"  
The article mentions Eric Trump posting a video on Truth Social about the $Melania token launch, but there's no mention of Eric Trump promoting a specific foreign exchange. The only foreign exchange mentioned is Bybit, but that's in the context of transfers, not promotion by Eric Trump. So answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** "How many millions in profits did World Liberty Financial generate for the Trump family in the first week after its September launch?"  
The article states that World Liberty Financial was started in September and that Trump receives a cut of profits from token sales. However, there's no specific figure given for the first week's profits. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** "What was the peak trading value reached by the $Melania token before the market correction?"  
The article doesn't provide any specific numbers or peak values for the $Melania token. It mentions it was launched and caused a dip in $Trump's value but no figures. N/A.

4. **Question 4:** "Who was the crypto industry executive that purchased $58 million worth of $Trump tokens within the first hour of trading?"  
The article says a crypto trader made a $1 million position in a minute, then sold $20 million. The $58 million figure refers to fees collected by the Trump team, not an executive's purchase. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** "What percentage of the Trump family's 800 million reserve tokens were transferred to Bybit according to Coinbase's analysis?"  
The article mentions transfers to Bybit but doesn't specify a percentage. Answer N/A.

6. **Question 6:** "Which member of Trump's transition team first proposed the idea for the $Trump memecoin during the campaign?"  
No information on who proposed the idea. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** "What was the minimum investment amount required to participate in the initial $Trump token offering at the inauguration ball?"  
No mention of minimum investment. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** "How many institutional investors were granted early access to purchase $Trump tokens before the public launch?"  
The article doesn't state the number. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** "What regulatory framework did David Sacks outline for cryptocurrency oversight under the new administration?"  
The article quotes Sacks saying the "reign of terror against crypto is over," implying less strict regulation, but no specific framework name. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** "Which major Wall Street bank agreed to serve as the primary market maker for the $Trump token?"  
No mention of a Wall Street bank involved. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** "What percentage of the initial $13 billion trading value did the $Trump token retain immediately before its price started to recover?"  
The initial value was $13B. After $Melania's launch, it dropped to $41 from $64. Assuming 200M tokens: 41/64 â‰ˆ 64%. But the question is about retained value before recovery. The article says it dropped to $41 then started rising. So 41/64 is approx 64%, but the article doesn't state this percentage. Need exact figure? Since it's not given, N/A.

12. **Question 12:** "What specific regulatory action did David Sacks announce would be reversed, mirroring the SEC's previous stance under the Biden administration?"  
The article says Sacks announced the "reign of terror against crypto is over," implying ending SEC's crackdown. The SEC's actions were lawsuits against exchanges like Coinbase. So reversing those lawsuits? The answer might be "SEC lawsuits" but the question asks for the action. The article says "reign of terror against crypto is over" which mirrors ending enforcement actions. So answer: "SEC lawsuits" but the exact wording? The article says "reign of terror against crypto is over" so the action reversed is the "crackdown" or "enforcement actions". The question asks for the type similar to what Coinbase/Kraken faced (SEC lawsuits). So answer: "SEC lawsuits".

13. **Question 13:** "What specific type of legal action, similar to what Coinbase and Kraken are facing, is Bybit likely undergoing?"  
Coinbase and Kraken are in SEC lawsuits. Bybit is facing "enforcement actions" as per the article. So answer: "SEC enforcement actions".

14. **Question 14:** "What was the name of the social media platform associated with Trump Media and Technology Group that contributed to the majority of his initial net worth?"  
The article mentions "Truth Social" as the platform. Answer: "Truth Social".

15. **Question 15:** "What specific action did Trump initiate against The Des Moines Register, based on the precedent set regarding First Amendment rights?"  
The article says Trump sued CBS and The Des Moines Register, similar to First Amendment cases. The action is lawsuits. Answer: "lawsuits".

16. **Question 16:** "What specific financial instrument did Trump reference at his rally to justify the investment potential of his new tokens?"  
He mentioned Bitcoin. Answer: "Bitcoin".

17. **Question 17:** "What specific number of migrant clubs were established at Guantanamo Bay?"  
The article mentions 10 migrants held but no clubs. The West Point clubs were 12. The question asks for number of clubs established for migrants, but there's no info. N/A.

18. **Question 18:** "What specific ranking did the $Melania token achieve immediately after its launch?"  
No ranking mentioned for $Melania. N/A.

19. **Question 19:** "What specific government agency did Trump propose to reform to benefit cryptocurrency companies?"  
The article mentions USAID closure but no other agency for crypto. The answer is N/A. Wait, the question says similar to USAID in global reach. The article says Trump wanted to make US crypto capital, but the only agency mentioned related to reform is SEC (by appointing a leader). Or maybe USAID itself? But the question asks for another one. The article doesn't mention another. So N/A.

20. **Question 20:** "What specific amount did the early trader accumulate before selling?"  
The article says "a crypto trader had accumulated a $1 million position... soon sold off holdings worth $20 million". So total holdings before selling were $20M. The question asks for the amount exceeding the initial $1M. The total was $20M. So answer: "20 million".
