Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and follow the strict instructions.

1. **Question 1:** The first question is about the Beijing Kunlun Tech Company's action regarding a medical robotics joint venture. The article mentions that in 2020, CFIUS blocked a Chinese company from forming a joint venture with an American medical robotics company. The question asks what similar action Kunlun took. Wait, Kunlun was involved with Grindr, not the medical one. The article says the medical joint venture was blocked, so maybe the Kunlun case involved a divestiture. The Grindr case required Kunlun to divest. But the question is about the medical venture. The answer might be "divest" but the medical one was blocked, not divested. Hmm, the question is phrased as "what similar action did Beijing Kunlun... take regarding its medical..." but Kunlun wasn't involved in the medical case. Wait, the medical joint venture was blocked, but the company involved there isn't named. The question might be a trick because Kunlun's case was Grindr, so the similar action would be divest, but the medical one was blocked. Maybe the answer is N/A because the medical case involved a different company?

Wait, the question says "similar action" to the Wyoming company's divestiture. The Wyoming case was a divestiture ordered by Biden. The Grindr case had Kunlun ordered to divest. The medical joint venture was blocked. So the action for the medical one was a block, but the question is what did Kunlun do for the medical venture? But Kunlun wasn't involved in the medical case. The question might be wrong, so the answer is N/A. Or maybe the medical case's company was ordered to divest? Let me check the text again. The article says "CFIUS blocked a Chinese company from forming a joint venture with an American medical robotics company." So the action here was a block, not a divestiture. Since Kunlun's case was divest, but the medical case was a block, the answer might be N/A because they didn't take a similar action. So the first question's answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Zeekr's IPO was on the NYSE in May. The article says that a few days later, the White House quadrupled tariffs. The question asks what percentage increase. The answer is "quadrupling" which is 400% increase. But the question says "percentage tariff increase", so quadrupling means from X to 4X, so the increase is 300% (since 4X is 300% more than original). Wait, but maybe the question just wants "quadrupled" as the answer. The article says "quadrupling tariffs on electric vehicles made in China". The exact percentage increase would be quadrupled, which is 4 times the original. The question asks "what percentage tariff increase", so the answer is "quadrupled" but phrased as a percentage. The article says "quadrupling", so the answer is "quadrupled", but the question wants the percentage. Alternatively, maybe it's 400% of the original, but that's ambiguous. Wait, the exact wording is "quadrupling tariffs", so the answer is "quadrupled". Since the question asks for the percentage, maybe it's 400%? Wait, if the original was 10%, quadrupling would make it 40%, which is a 300% increase. Hmm, but the article just says "quadrupling", so perhaps the answer is "quadrupled" as the action, but the question specifies percentage. The question might expect "quadrupled" as the answer. Alternatively, maybe the exact percentage isn't given, so the answer is "quadrupled". The article says "quadrupling", so the answer should be "quadrupled".

3. **Question 3:** The Grindr case precedent led CFIUS to mandate divestment. The medical robotics joint venture blocked in 2020 would have followed similar action. The question asks what action CFIUS mandated for the medical case. The article says CFIUS blocked the joint venture, so the action was blocking, not divest. But the question says "following the precedent set by Grindr", which was divest. The answer here would be "blocked" as the action taken for the medical case. The question is about the action mandated for the medical venture, which was blocked. So answer is "blocked".

4. **Question 4:** Shein's IPO opposition involved Senator Rubio urging the SEC head. The regulatory body responsible for approving the listing would be the SEC. So the answer is "Securities and Exchange Commission" or SEC.

5. **Question 5:** WeRide and Pony.ai faced a ban on using their tech. The article says the Trump admin was preparing a rule to ban Chinese self-driving companies from using their tech. So the regulatory action was a ban.

6. **Question 6:** The Wyoming case involved a cryptocurrency mining company near a military base. The specific asset was land. The question asks what type of asset near a military base Biden was concerned about. The answer is "land".

7. **Question 7:** Mr. Kaniecki mentioned CFIUS's original focus was on oil exporting nations. So the primary concern was investments from oil exporting nations.

8. **Question 8:** Panda Politics mentions influencing policy on Taiwan and softening China's image. The question asks another area besides cultivating relationships. The answer is "policy on Taiwan".

9. **Question 9:** Shein shifted to London. The question asks the European city's stock exchange, so "London". Windrose is incorporated in Belgium but that's separate. The answer is London.

10. **Question 10:** Zeekr is owned by Geely. The question asks which automaker owns Zeekr, which is Geely. The options given in the punitive measures include Boeing, Lockheed, etc., but the question says "not directly mentioned among those targeted". The answer is Geely. But the question specifies "American automaker"? Wait, Geely is Chinese. Wait, the question says "which specific American automaker, not directly mentioned among those targeted, owns the luxury electric vehicle brand..." Wait, Zeekr is owned by Geely, which is a Chinese automaker. The question might be tricky. The article says Zeekr is owned by Geely, so the American automaker would be none, so N/A? Wait, the question says "American automaker", so since Geely is Chinese, the answer is N/A. But maybe I misread. Let me check the article again. The article says "Zeekr, a luxury electric vehicle brand owned by the Chinese automaker Geely". So the owner is Geely, which is not an American automaker. Therefore, the answer is N/A. But the question says "which specific American automaker... owns...". Since none, it's N/A. Alternatively, maybe there's another automaker mentioned? The punitive measures mention Boeing, which is an airline, not automaker. The question might be a trick. The answer is N/A.
