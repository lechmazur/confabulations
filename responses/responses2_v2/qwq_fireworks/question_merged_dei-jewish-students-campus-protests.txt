Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which Republican governor signed legislation requiring antisemitism training in 2023. The article mentions Gov. Gavin Newsom of California signed a bill in September requiring California State University and community colleges to include training on recognizing discrimination against Jews. Wait, but Newsom is a Democrat. The question specifies a Republican governor. Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The article says: "In September, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California signed a bill..." So the answer would be Gavin Newsom, but since he's a Democrat, the question might be a trick. Wait, the question is about a Republican? The answer must be N/A because the article doesn't mention a Republican governor for that bill. Wait, no, maybe there's another part. Wait the article says "the same month, the University of Pennsylvania became the first university to create an office..." but the question is about a governor. Let me confirm again. The article states that Newsom (Democrat) signed the bill. Since the question specifies a Republican, the answer would be N/A. Wait, but maybe I missed another part? Let me check again. The article also mentions "14 states have passed legislation banning or restricting D.E.I." but doesn't name them. So the answer here is N/A because the only named governor is Newsom, a Democrat, so the question's premise (Republican) isn't met. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many Jewish students reported physical attacks at Pitt? The article mentions Asher Goodwin's experience with slurs but doesn't give numbers. The survey isn't mentioned here. The task force reports found that Jewish students felt excluded but no specific numbers on physical attacks. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Percentage of D.E.I. offices with inadequate expertise. The article says many lack expertise but no percentage. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Jewish professor at Stanford proposing pluralism. The article mentions Paul Brest, a professor emeritus at Stanford, who said D.E.I. should include everyone. So Paul Brest?

5. **Question 5:** Michigan diversity admin who sued. The article says the administrator (name not given) was fired. Through a lawyer, she denied the comments. The name isn't provided. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** States with pending legislation for 2024. The article mentions 14 states have passed laws, but pending ones for 2024 aren't mentioned. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** University with successful model program. The article mentions University of Pennsylvania created an office for civil rights, but it's not clear if it's a successful model. Also, the article doesn't state any other school adopting it. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Trump's budget for investigating D.E.I. The article mentions executive orders but not a specific budget. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Jewish orgs endorsing elimination of D.E.I. The article says some Jewish leaders want to eliminate D.E.I., but no number of organizations. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Percentage increase in antisemitism at Columbia. The article mentions task forces found antisemitism was rising, but no specific percentage between 2022-2023. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Which state governor signed the bill about training? The article says Gov. Gavin Newsom of California. Even though the question might be expecting a Republican, the article clearly states Newsom, so answer is Gavin Newsom.

12. **Question 12:** Which university's task force advocated pluralism? The Stanford report is mentioned as wanting pluralism. The article says "Stanford University's antisemitism committee report recently concluded that schools should... move toward more 'pluralistic' efforts." So Stanford.

13. **Question 13:** University with diversity admin fired for "wealthy Jews" remark. The article mentions the University of Michigan's diversity administrator who was fired. So University of Michigan.

14. **Question 14:** Number of individuals handing out flyers at Pitt. The article says "no more than five people silently handing out fliers." So maximum 5.

15. **Question 15:** Group alleged to control Midwestern university. The article mentions the Michigan admin's comment about the university being controlled by wealthy Jews. Michigan is in the Midwest, so the group is "wealthy Jews."

16. **Question 16:** Journalist's name. The article starts with "By Vimal Patel." So Vimal Patel.

17. **Question 17:** President who dismantled D.E.I. The article says "President Trump signed an executive order..." So Donald Trump.

18. **Question 18:** Publication tracking diversity cuts. The article mentions "The Chronicle of Higher Education, which tracks the backlash." So The Chronicle of Higher Education.

19. **Question 19:** Number of states with D.E.I. restrictions. The article says "14 states have passed legislation banning or restricting D.E.I." So 14.

20. **Question 20:** Institution where Asher Goodwin had issues. The article says Asher Goodwin is at the University of Pittsburgh. So University of Pittsburgh.
