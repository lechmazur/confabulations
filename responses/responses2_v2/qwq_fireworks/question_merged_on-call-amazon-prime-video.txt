Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and not any outside knowledge. Let's start with question 1.

1. The first question asks which Chicago police precinct Harmon transferred from before joining Long Beach. The article mentions Harmon is a training officer on the Long Beach police force, but there's no mention of her previous precinct in Chicago. The text doesn't talk about her background beyond being a by-the-book officer. So the answer should be N/A.

2. The second question is about how many episodes feature Maniac as the primary antagonist. The article refers to Maniac as one of the big bads but doesn't specify the number of episodes. It just says "eight serialized episodes" and mentions his role, but no exact count. So N/A.

3. Diaz's childhood trauma leading to his mother's distrust isn't detailed. The article only states that his mom hates cops for good reason, but the specific incident isn't mentioned. So N/A.

4. The question about which night shift Harmon starts questioning her approach. The article doesn't specify a particular shift or episode when this happens. It talks about her general approach but not a specific night. N/A.

5. The percentage of bodycam footage versus traditional filming isn't provided. The article mentions bodycam use adds realism but no exact percentage. N/A.

6. Sergeant La Salle's former partner referenced when talking about handling business "a million years ago." The article doesn't mention any specific former partner. The quote is about the past approach, but no name given. N/A.

7. Civilian casualties from Diaz and Maniac's gang confrontation. The article doesn't mention any specific number here. Just that there's grimy violence. N/A.

8. Internal affairs investigation prompting Lieutenant Loughlin's reevaluation. The article says Lori Loughlin plays a lieutenant but doesn't mention an investigation she's part of. N/A.

9. Training protocol Harmon modifies after the overeager rookie incident. The article mentions Diaz's comment about defining "bad guys," but no specific protocol change is named. N/A.

10. Crime stats the sergeant cites against the new approach. The article says he criticizes the approach as naive but doesn't list specific stats. N/A.

11. The narrative device similar to Black cinema's temporal shifts. The article mentions Black directors like RaMell Ross are chronicling life at a different speed. The show's bodycam use might be the device, but the question asks for a similar device. The article says "On Call" uses bodycam for realism, which is different from temporal shifts. Maybe "serialized episodes" but not sure. Wait, the question refers to the narrative device like Black cinema's temporal shifts. The article says "Black Cinema's Time Revolution" uses different speeds. The show's "serialized" format is mentioned. But the answer might be "serialized episodes" but the question asks for a device similar to the temporal shifts. Maybe "bodycam footage"? The article says "use of bodycam adds realism". Hmm. The question is tricky. The article doesn't explicitly link the two, so N/A.

12. Aspect contributing to "tense velocity" like "Challengers." The review mentions "tense velocity" from the serialized episodes and bodycam chaos. "Challengers" uses sex scenes for power dynamics. The article says "tense velocity" is the show's raison d'etre. Maybe the serialized, non-formulaic approach? The article says "serialized and have the tense velocity". So the answer could be "serialized storytelling". But the question mentions "thematic exploration in Challengers". Maybe the "ethical dilemmas" or "holistic approach"? The article says Diaz's approach and the conflict with veterans. So maybe the "ethical vs. traditional policing conflict"? The exact phrasing is needed. The question says "aspect reminiscent of...Challengers' thematic exploration". The article says "explored complex power dynamics" in the sex scenes of "Anora" etc. Maybe the power dynamics in policing. But the answer isn't clear. The article says "tense velocity" comes from the serialized episodes. So maybe "serialized format". The answer might be "serialized storytelling" but not sure. Since the article doesn't explicitly link to the mentioned shows, N/A.

13. Lori Loughlin's rank mirroring La Salle's character. The article says La Salle is a sergeant and Loughlin plays a lieutenant. So the answer is "lieutenant".

14. Crime Maniac is involved in, similar to Chicago series. The article says Maniac is a gang member, so likely gang-related crimes. The Chicago shows have drug busts, murders. The article mentions "criminals whose clunky villainy could be ripped from a comic book. One of the big bads here is a gang member named 'Maniac.'" So the specific type could be "gang-related crimes" or "murder". The article says "grimy violence" but not exact crime type. Maybe "gang violence" is the answer.

15. Streaming platform with similar blend. The article's streaming guides mention Netflix, Max, Disney+, Amazon, Hulu. The question asks which other than Amazon. The article says "similar blend of gritty realism and moral complexity". The article mentions "Babygirl" and "Challengers" as examples with complex power dynamics. Maybe Hulu or Netflix? But the article doesn't explicitly say. So N/A.

16. If "On Call" used title sequences like the extravagant ones, influenced by Tom Green's surreal style, what element would be emphasized? The article mentions Tom Green's return to Amazon but doesn't link his style to the show's production. So N/A.

17. Training technique from "F.B.I." that Diaz/Harmon would criticize. The article says "F.B.I." is part of Dick Wolf's less noble shows. The article mentions Diaz's holistic approach vs. veterans who want traditional methods. The "F.B.I." might use "chasing bad guys" approach, which the overeager rookie liked. So the technique could be "aggressive pursuit" or "zero tolerance". The article says the rookie wants to "chase bad guys" and Diaz is restrained. So the criticized technique might be "aggressive policing" or "zero-tolerance policies".

18. Narrative element minimized in "On Call" due to serialized/short format. The article says "abbreviated running time... helps feel less formulaic than it truly is, its rhythms less predictable". Formulaic Dick Wolf shows have "procedural" elements. The article mentions "flat procedural" is avoided. So the minimized element is "procedural elements".

19. Director's style for Diaz's internal conflict. The article mentions directors like RaMell Ross, A.V. Rockwell, etc., chronicling Black life at a different speed. Diaz's conflict is about his mother's distrust. So a director like RaMell Ross might capture internal conflict through slow, contemplative scenes. The answer would be one of their names, but the question asks which director's style. Since the article lists four names, but the user probably expects one, maybe "RaMell Ross" as the first mentioned.

20. Alternative California city with complex law enforcement issues. The article mentions Long Beach. An alternative could be Los Angeles, Oakland, or Ferguson (though not in CA). The article doesn't specify, so N/A.

21. Bodycam footage and real-life controversy in Long Beach PD. The article doesn't mention a real-life controversy, only that the show has a subplot about evidence tampering. No real-life link given. N/A.

22. Historical event from 1990s that Sergeant references. The article doesn't mention any specific event. N/A.

23. Episode where Loughlin's character overrides Harmon's decision. The article doesn't specify episodes or such events. N/A.

24. Crossover episode with "Chicago P.D." The article doesn't mention any crossovers. N/A.

25. Actor from "Law & Order: SVU" in a guest role. The article doesn't mention guest actors from that show. N/A.

26. Number of seasons produced based on Tom Green's return. The article says Tom Green is back with new projects on Amazon, but doesn't link to "On Call" seasons. N/A.

27. Policy change Harmon proposes in finale. The article doesn't mention the finale's content. N/A.

28. Real-life documentary influencing Diaz's portrayal. No mention of documentaries. N/A.

29. Cinematographer for bodycam sequences who worked on "F.B.I." The article mentions the bodycam adds realism but doesn't name any cinematographer. N/A.
