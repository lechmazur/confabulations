Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the provided article and answer strictly based on that. Let me start by skimming through the questions again and then refer back to the article to find the answers.

1. The first question asks which subsidiary of Clayton Homes was accused alongside Vanderbilt Mortgage. The article mentions that Clayton owns 21st Mortgage, but the lawsuit didn't include them. So the answer here should be N/A because the suit was only against Vanderbilt, not another subsidiary.

2. The second question is about the percentage of Clayton's loans with issues. The article says Vanderbilt's loans were examined, and less than 0.8% had issues. But the question is about Clayton's total, which isn't mentioned. So N/A.

3. The state where the lawsuit was filed is in Tennessee, specifically the Eastern District. The article states that the CFPB filed in federal court in the Eastern District of Tennessee. So the state is Tennessee.

4. The penalty amount isn't specified. The lawsuit mentions an unspecified civil penalty. So the answer is N/A because there's no exact figure.

5. The administration in power when the investigation started isn't stated. The article mentions the Biden administration's waning days, so the investigation might have been under Biden, but the exact timing isn't clear. Wait, the lawsuit was filed on Monday (the article's present), and the CFPB's actions were in the waning days of Biden's administration. So the investigation's initiation isn't specified, so N/A.

6. The fees besides late penalties: The article says "charged late fees and penalties." So maybe penalties are the same as late fees? Wait, the question asks for another type. The article only mentions late fees and penalties, which might be the same. Hmm, maybe N/A?

Wait, the text says "charged late fees and penalties." So perhaps "penalties" are separate. But the question asks for another type besides late penalties. Wait, the question says "besides late penalties," so maybe penalties are included, so there's no other fee mentioned. So N/A?

Wait, the article says "charged late fees and penalties." So maybe "penalties" are in addition to late fees. But the question is phrased as "besides late penalties," so perhaps the answer is penalties. Wait, maybe the question is trying to get another fee type. Let me check again. The article only mentions late fees and penalties. So the answer is penalties? Or maybe N/A. Wait, the question is "besides late penalties" so if "penalties" are separate, then the answer is penalties. But the wording is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A because there's no other fee type listed beyond late fees and penalties. Hmm, maybe I should go with N/A here.

7. The question asks which other company owned by Berkshire Hathaway was mentioned as having similar scrutiny. The article mentions 21st Mortgage as another subsidiary, but the lawsuit didn't include them. However, the article says Clayton also owns 21st Mortgage, but the suit didn't include it. The question is about another company with similar scrutiny. The article also mentions Rocket Homes in another lawsuit. Rocket Homes is owned by Quicken Loans, not Berkshire. Wait, the article says "Rocket Homes, claiming the firm paid kickbacks..." So Rocket Homes is a separate company that was sued. But the question is about a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary. Since 21st Mortgage is a Berkshire subsidiary (as part of Clayton, which is owned by Berkshire), but the suit didn't include them, but the question is asking if another Berkshire subsidiary was mentioned in the article as having similar scrutiny. The article only mentions Vanderbilt was sued, and 21st wasn't. The other mention is Rocket Homes, which isn't part of Berkshire. So the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "referenced in the article as having similar regulatory scrutiny." The article says "Their main customers..." referring to Clayton and its mortgage firms, but the suit only against Vanderbilt. Maybe 21st isn't mentioned as being scrutinized, so the answer is N/A.

8. The number of complaints filed through the CFPB's portal isn't given. The article provides a link to complaints but doesn't state the number. So N/A.

9. The alternative lending option isn't mentioned. The article says the CFPB found these loans have high rates and are hard to refinance when rates drop, but they don't recommend an alternative. So N/A.

10. The article mentions the Republican-controlled Congress and the Trump administration wanting to rein in the CFPB, but it doesn't say a law was passed. It says they "are likely to try to rein in." So the question asks which congressional body passed legislation. Since there's no mention of passed legislation, N/A.

11. The federal district is the Eastern District of Tennessee, as stated in the first paragraph.

12. The question asks if someone confuses Vanderbilt with another subsidiary (since Clayton has 21st Mortgage), which company is the one sued. The answer is Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance, as per the article.

13. The official's statement is Rohit Chopra, the bureau's director, who said "Vanderbilt knowingly traps..." So his name is the answer.

14. The percentage is less than 0.8%, as per Vanderbilt's statement.

15. The other company mentioned in the same context is Rocket Homes, which was sued for kickbacks.

16. The prominent builder is Clayton Homes, the parent of Vanderbilt.

17. The affiliated company not included is 21st Mortgage.

18. The money-transfer service is Zelle, mentioned in the lawsuit against three banks.

19. The fee type is late fees, as mentioned in the text. The question asks for the recurring charge on overdue payments, which is late fees.

20. The enforcement actions were in the waning days of the Biden administration, so the answer is Biden.

Wait, let me check each again:

1. The question says "which subsidiary of Clayton Homes was accused in the lawsuit alongside Vanderbilt Mortgage..." The lawsuit only includes Vanderbilt, so the answer is N/A.

2. The percentage is about Clayton's total loans? The article says "tens of thousands of Vanderbilt loans... less than 0.8%... may have had issues." But Clayton's total isn't mentioned. So N/A.

3. Tennessee.

4. N/A (unspecified).

5. The article says the lawsuit was filed in the waning days of Biden's admin, but the initiation of the investigation's timing isn't stated. So N/A.

6. The article says "charged late fees and penalties." The question asks for another fee besides late penalties. Maybe penalties are the same as late fees? Or penalties are a separate thing. Since the question specifies "besides late penalties," perhaps the answer is penalties? Wait, maybe it's a trick. The fees are late fees and penalties. The question is about another type besides late penalties. Wait, maybe "penalties" are the same as late fees, so there's no other. Alternatively, maybe "penalties" are a separate charge. But the article doesn't name another type. So N/A.

Wait, the article says "charged late fees and penalties." So penalties are in addition to late fees. The question is asking for another type besides late penalties. Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as "besides late penalties," so maybe penalties are the same as late fees? Not sure. Since the article lists both, but the question is asking for another fee besides late penalties, perhaps the answer is penalties? But that's conflicting. Maybe the answer is N/A because there's no other type mentioned besides those two.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is penalties, but the question is asking for another type. Hmm, tricky. Let me think again. The article says "charged late fees and penalties." So the fees include both. The question is asking for a type besides late penalties. If "penalties" are considered separate, then perhaps the answer is penalties. Wait, maybe the question is a trick and the answer is N/A because the only other is penalties. But the question is asking for another type besides late penalties. Maybe the answer is N/A.

Wait, perhaps the question is a mistake. Let me check the exact wording again: "What type of fees, besides late penalties, did the CFPB allege Vanderbilt Mortgage charged borrowers who fell behind on payments..." The article says they were "charged late fees and penalties." So "penalties" are in addition to late fees. But the question is asking for another type besides late penalties. Wait, maybe "late penalties" is the term, but the article says "late fees and penalties." So perhaps the answer is penalties. But the question is "besides late penalties," so if "penalties" are separate, then there's no other. So maybe the answer is N/A because there's no other type mentioned. Alternatively, the answer is penalties, but the question is phrased as "besides late penalties," so penalties would be included in that? Not sure. Maybe the answer is N/A.

7. The other company under Berkshire is 21st Mortgage, but the question says "referenced in the article as having similar regulatory scrutiny." The article only mentions that Clayton owns 21st, but the suit didn't include them. The other mention is Rocket Homes, which isn't part of Berkshire. So the answer is N/A.

8. N/A.

9. N/A.

10. N/A.

11. Eastern District of Tennessee.

12. Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance.

13. Rohit Chopra.

14. less than 0.8%.

15. Rocket Homes.

16. Clayton Homes.

17. 21st Mortgage.

18. Zelle.

19. late fees.

20. Biden.
