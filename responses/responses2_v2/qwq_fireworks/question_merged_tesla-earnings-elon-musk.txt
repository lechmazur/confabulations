Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article provided and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start with question 1.

1. The first question asks for the percentage increase in car sales Tesla experienced in the year it sold 1.8 million vehicles. The article mentions that in 2024, Tesla sold 1.8 million vehicles, which was slightly less than in 2023. It also says that in 2023, sales increased by 38% and 40% in previous years. Wait, the question is about the year when they sold 1.8 million, which is 2024. The article states that in 2024 sales were slightly less than 2023. But the exact percentage increase for 2024 isn't given. The 38% and 40% were for 2023 and 2022. Since the article doesn't provide the 2024 sales growth percentage, the answer is N/A.

2. Next, operating profit margin for Q4 2024. The article says operating profit fell 23% compared to the previous year, but we need the margin. The operating profit figure isn't directly given, only that it fell 23% from the previous year's operating profit (which included a tax benefit). The sales in Q4 were $25.7B, up 2% from $25.2B in 2023. Without the actual profit numbers for both years, calculating the margin isn't possible. So N/A.

3. The third question asks about a specific feature in new mail trucks that's also a key selling point of the new Model Y. The article mentions new electric mail trucks have a side cargo door and air-conditioning. The new Model Y's key points are the starting price around $60k and "more affordable models." The feature shared would be the side cargo door? Wait, the Model Y is a car, not a truck. The article says the new mail trucks have a side cargo door and AC, but Tesla's Model Y's features aren't listed beyond price. The article doesn't mention any overlapping features here, so maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "key selling point of Tesla's more advanced Model Y." The article says the new Model Y has a starting price of $60k, which is higher than current. Maybe the feature is "autonomous operation" since the Cybercab is mentioned, but the Model Y's new features aren't specified beyond price. Hmm. The article says the new Model Y is more advanced, but no specific feature mentioned besides price. The mail trucks have side doors and AC. Since the question links them, but the article doesn't say the Model Y has those features, so N/A.

4. When did Musk say the Cybercab would begin generating revenue? The article states that Cybercab production starts in 2026. He mentioned that existing models will operate autonomously in Austin in June. The question is about when the Cybercab (the taxi itself) starts generating revenue. The article says the taxi business will "begin launching later this year" (2024?), but the Cybercab production is 2026. Wait, the exact quote: "Cybercab would go into production in 2026" and "taxi business would begin launching later this year" (the year of the report, which is 2024 as per the article's context). So the answer is 2024? But the question is about when Musk said it would start generating revenue. The article says "begin launching later this year", so the answer is "later this year" (2024). But the question asks for the month/year based on his statement about 2025 being pivotal. The exact quote from Musk is that "2025 is going to be a pivotal year for Tesla." The Cybercab production is 2026, so maybe the revenue generation is in 2026. Wait the article says "Cybercab would go into production in 2026" and the taxi business launches later this year (2024). Maybe the taxi business uses existing models? The question specifically asks about the Cybercab (driverless taxi), which is the Cybercab model. So production is 2026, so revenue would start then. But the question is about when Musk said it would begin generating revenue. The article says "the company said its taxi business would begin launching later this year" (2024) but that might be using existing cars. The Cybercab production is 2026, so the answer is 2026. However, the question says "when did Elon Musk say that the Cybercab... will begin generating revenue, considering his statement about 2025 being pivotal?" Since production is 2026, maybe revenue starts then. The article doesn't explicitly state when revenue starts, only that production is 2026. So N/A? Or is it 2026? The question is about Musk's statement linking to 2025 being pivotal. Since production is 2026, perhaps the answer is N/A as the exact timing isn't given beyond production start. Hmm. The question might be tricky. The article says "Cybercab would go into production in 2026" so the revenue would start then, so the answer is 2026. But the question says "when did he say it will begin generating revenue"? The article doesn't state the exact time he mentioned revenue generation beyond production. So N/A.

5. How many autonomous Cybercabs were deployed in Austin in June? The article says existing models will begin operating autonomously in Austin in June. But the Cybercab is a separate model (the taxi). The question is about Cybercabs, but the article says existing models (like Model Y?) will operate there. So the number isn't mentioned, so N/A.

6. Percentage of revenue from regulatory credits in Europe. The article says total regulatory credit sales were $692M in Q4, but doesn't break down by region. The question asks specifically for Europe's portion. Since it's not specified, N/A.

7. Which BMW model caused Tesla's luxury decline? The article says Tesla lost ground to BMW in luxury, but no specific model is mentioned. So N/A.

8. Number of Rivian EVs sold in 2024 to justify the loan. The article mentions the loan for Rivian's factory but doesn't state sales numbers. N/A.

9. Starting price of Cybercab in 2026. The article mentions the Model Y's price but not the Cybercab's. N/A.

10. Which state passed legislation for rebates? The article says California's governor Newsom said they'll provide rebates if federal credits end. So California. Answer is California.

11. BYD discontinued how many plug-in hybrids? The article says BYD sells over a dozen electric and plug-in hybrids, but doesn't mention discontinuing any. N/A.

12. Ford's EV sales percentage to recoup investments. The article states Ford doesn't sell enough EVs to recoup investments, but doesn't give a percentage. N/A.

13. Month Musk canceled Cybertruck. The article says Cybertruck sales dropped but no cancellation mentioned. N/A.

14. Regulatory credit sales to Chinese automakers. The article mentions sales to "other automakers" but doesn't specify Chinese. N/A.
