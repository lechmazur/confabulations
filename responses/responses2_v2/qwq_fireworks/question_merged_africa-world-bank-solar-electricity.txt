Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and answer exactly what's asked without any extra info. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks which African country's president mentioned job creation and quality of life during the Dar es Salaam summit. The article mentions John Magufuli, Tanzania's president, who was called "The Bulldozer". The World Bank president, Ajay Banga, talked to African leaders and mentioned jobs and quality of life. But the specific president who cited these points was Magufuli? Wait, the text says Banga told them they need to promise jobs and quality of life. But the president who was in office when Husk came to Tanzania was Magufuli. The question is about the president cited at the summit. The summit is in Tanzania. The article says "the leaders of more than half of Africa's nations gathered this week in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania". The president of Tanzania at the time of the summit would be the current one, but the article mentions Magufuli as the president when Husk arrived in 2015. The summit is current, so maybe the current president isn't named. Wait, the question is about the president who specifically cited those points during the summit. The article states: "I said to them, 'Hey guys, you want to be in your jobs for another few years? You have to promise jobs and quality of life. I can help you, but you need to step up to the plate.'" That's from Banga addressing the leaders. The question is which president cited this, but maybe the answer is N/A because it's the World Bank president's statement, not a specific country's president. Wait, the question says "president specifically cited job creation... during the summit". The text says the World Bank president made that statement to the leaders. The actual presidents of countries at the summit aren't named as making that specific statement. So maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, but maybe the question refers to the Tanzanian president hosting the summit? The article mentions that Tanzania's energy minister was involved, but the president isn't named as making that statement. So perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "Tanzania had seemed like an ideal market... when the new president at the time, John Magufuli..." but that's from 2015. The current summit's host country is Tanzania, but the current president isn't named here. So I think the answer is N/A.

2. How many minigrids did Husk complete in Tanzania before leaving? The article says Husk closed up shop in Tanzania and mentions they had built minigrids there. But the exact number isn't given. It says in Nigeria they built 70, but for Tanzania, it's not specified. So answer is N/A.

3. The question is about percentage increase in electricity access in Matipwili after switching to Tanesco. The article states that Tanesco's grid serves only a quarter as many people as Husk's minigrid. Originally, Husk served around 200 houses. Tanesco serves a quarter, so maybe 50. But the question is about the first three months. The article doesn't mention a time frame for the switch or the percentage change. So N/A.

4. Which bank committed largest portion to hydropower? The $35B is split with half to solar minigrids and the rest to traditional grids (hydropower and fossil fuels). The World Bank and African Development Bank are involved. The question asks which bank committed the largest portion to hydropower. The article says "a roughly equal amount of money will go toward extending traditional, existing power grids". So half to solar, half to traditional. Since hydropower is part of traditional grids, but the article doesn't specify which bank allocated more to hydropower. The $35B is from both banks. Since the question is about the largest portion, but the article doesn't break down by bank, so N/A.

5. Average monthly cost difference between Husk and Tanesco for small businesses. The article says Gesenda Mwise uses Tanesco and pays three times as much for the same power. So the difference is 200% more? But the question asks for the average monthly cost difference. The exact amount isn't given, just the ratio. So answer would be "three times as much" but the question asks for the average monthly cost difference in numerical terms. Since the article doesn't give numbers, N/A.

6. Number of African heads of state at preliminary meetings. The main summit had over half of Africa's 55 countries (so over 28). The question is about preliminary planning meetings before the main summit. The article doesn't mention the number at the preliminary meetings, so N/A.

7. Rate of return for solar vs traditional grids. The article says solar is cheaper and faster, but no specific rate of return numbers are given. N/A.

8. Chinese solar panel manufacturer. The article mentions China's production but doesn't name a specific company. N/A.

9. Percentage allocated to training technicians. The article doesn't mention training budgets. N/A.

10. Additional study hours for students. The article mentions Mashavu's daughter's grades dropped but no study time data. N/A.

11. Rockefeller's allocation to hydropower. The question is about the $35B package's allocation to hydropower in 12 countries. The article says half the $35B is for traditional grids (including hydropower), but the Rockefeller Foundation's tens of millions are separate. The question asks specifically how much of the $35B is for hydropower in the 12 countries. Since the $35B is split 50/50 between solar and traditional, hydropower is part of the traditional half. But the exact amount isn't specified, so N/A.

12. Percentage of African leaders present. The article says "leaders of more than half of Africa's nations" attended. Africa has 55 countries. Half of 55 is 27.5, so more than that, maybe 30 or so. The percentage would be over 50%, but exact? The article doesn't give the exact number. So N/A.

13. Number in Matipwili connected by project's end. The article says Tanesco serves a quarter as many as Husk's 200 houses. So 50. But the project's goal is to connect 5M/month over 6 years. But the question is about Matipwili's population served by Tanesco by the end. The article doesn't say if Tanesco expands further, so maybe remains at 50. But the question is tricky. The answer would be 50, but the article says "serve only a quarter as many people", so 50. But the question is about the total by the six-year goal. Since the project might not expand Tanesco further, it's still 50. But the article doesn't specify, so N/A.

14. President nicknamed for reining in corruption during Husk's entry. The article says John Magufuli was president when Husk came in 2015, and he was called "The Bulldozer". So answer is John Magufuli.

15. Number of minigrids in DRC. The article says Husk is entering DRC this year (after leaving Tanzania) and built 70 in Nigeria. But current number in DRC is not stated. The question is how many they've built there, so N/A.

16. Company whose assets were sold at a loss. The article says Husk closed in Tanzania and sold assets at a steep loss. So answer is Husk Power Systems.

17. Percentage connected to Tanesco in Matipwili. Originally 200 served by Husk, now Tanesco serves a quarter: 200/4=50. So 25% (50 out of 200). The question asks for the percentage now connected to Tanesco. So 25%.

18. Energy minister who mentioned inflation from high prices. The article quotes Tanzania's energy minister Doto Biteko saying some minigrids charged artificially high prices. So his name is Doto Biteko.

19. Average number connected to Husk's Matipwili minigrid. The article says around 200 houses and businesses were served. So answer is 200.

20. Village chairman using Tanesco despite higher cost. The chairman is Gesenda Mwise Gesenda.
