Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the given article and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question is asking how many minutes of screen time Mark Wahlberg has before his baldness is revealed. The article mentions that Wahlberg's character being bald under his hat is treated as a major shocker, but it doesn't specify the exact time. So I have to put N/A here because there's no time mentioned.

2. The poster lists Mel Gibson as the director of "Braveheart," "Apocalypto," and "Hacksaw Ridge." The question is which award he received for directing those. The article doesn't mention any specific awards he won for these films, just that he's an "award-winning director." So N/A again.

3. The author's "bad movie night" involves beer, but the brand isn't specified. The text just says "a couple of beers," so N/A.

4. The altitude where the confrontation takes place isn't mentioned. The article talks about being high above Alaska but doesn't give a specific altitude. N/A.

5. The sunglasses are part of Chekhov's items, but their color isn't mentioned. The question asks for the color of the crucial plot device sunglasses. Since it's not stated, N/A.

6. The question about the number of euphemisms for violence used by Wahlberg's character. The article says he uses "creative euphemisms for rape and grisly murder," but it doesn't specify a count. N/A.

7. The temperature in the cockpit during the close shave isn't provided. The text mentions snowy Alaskan landscape but no specific temperature. N/A.

8. The streaming platform after theatrical release isn't mentioned. The article ends with "In theaters" and talks about affiliate commissions, but no specific platform. N/A.

9. Michelle Dockery's character's previous rank isn't stated. She's a U.S. marshal, but prior role isn't mentioned. N/A.

10. The original number of passengers before Winston was added isn't given. The article just says the marshal needed to bring Winston, but no original count. N/A.

11. The question is about how the character with the bald spot combines elements. Wahlberg's character is the villainous pilot. The article says he's playing a villain after good-guy roles, but the exact method of combining isn't detailed. N/A.

12. The total running time is stated as 1 hour 31 minutes. The question links it to old-fashioned suspense, so the answer should be 91 minutes (since 1h31 is 91). Wait, the article says "Running time: 1 hour 31 minutes" so converting that to minutes, 91. But the question mentions "total running time that reflects this old-fashioned suspense." So the answer is 91.

13. The director referenced through past films is Mel Gibson. The poster mentions his acclaimed films without naming him, so the answer is Mel Gibson.

14. The law enforcement member with counterintuitive tactics is Marshal Harris (Madolyn). The article says the marshal makes questionable tactical decisions. So Michelle Dockery's character, Madolyn Harris.

15. The character embracing a darker persona is Wahlberg's, since he's the villain with threatening language. The article mentions he's a better actor as a villain here.

16. The concept invoked with items like flare gun, Taser, etc., is Chekhov's gun. The article explicitly mentions "Chekhov's gun" and lists other items, so the concept is Chekhov's gun.

17. The actor who abandoned the good-guy image is Mark Wahlberg, as noted in the article.

18. The film being reviewed is "Flight Risk," which is the title of the article.

19. The central location is the small plane, as the plot unfolds there. The article says the three stars are trapped in a small plane.

20. The rating given is R for disturbing threats, violence, and language. The article states "Rated R for some really disturbing threats, icky violence and a lot of bad language."
