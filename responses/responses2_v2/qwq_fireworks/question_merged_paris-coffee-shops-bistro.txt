Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict answer format. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question asks which French government minister signed the decree recognizing coffee shops as part of France's cultural heritage in early 2024. The article mentions that in September, the French minister of culture, Rachida Dati, recognized bistros and cafes by inscribing them into the National Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage. Wait, but the question specifies "coffee shops" and the article says the minister recognized bistros and cafes, not coffee shops. The petition was by Alain Fontaine, and the decree was about bistros and cafes, not the specialty coffee shops. So the answer might be N/A because the decree was for cafes and bistros, not the coffee shops. Wait, but the question is about the minister who signed that decree. The answer is Rachida Dati, but the question mentions "coffee shops" but the decree was for traditional cafes/bistros. However, the question might have a mistake, but according to the text, the minister is Rachida Dati. But the question says "coffee shops" were recognized, but the article says bistros and cafes were. Since the question's premise might be wrong, the answer would be N/A? Hmm, need to check again. The petition was for bistros and cafes, and the minister did that. The question asks about coffee shops, which might be a misstatement, so answer N/A. Wait, but the article says the decree was for bistros and cafes, not coffee shops. So the answer is N/A because the question's subject (coffee shops) isn't what was recognized. But maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me note that and check others first.

2. How many Coutume Cafe locations did Tom Clark operate? The article says Tom Clark opened his first Coutume Cafe in 2011 on the Left Bank. But it doesn't state the total number by the article's writing. The article mentions "his first" but doesn't give current count. So answer N/A.

3. Percentage of Paris cafe patrons switching to specialty shops post-COVID? The article mentions post-pandemic growth of specialty coffee shops but no specific percentage of patrons switching. So N/A.

4. Which philosopher's writings were cited by Alain Fontaine in his petition? The article states Fontaine's petition emphasized personalized service and interaction, but it doesn't mention a specific philosopher. However, the article later refers to Honore de Balzac describing the cafe counter as "the people's parliament." But was that part of the petition? The petition's quote is about service and atmosphere, but Balzac's term is mentioned in the article's context. The question asks if a philosopher's writings were cited. The article says Balzac's quote is used in the text, but not necessarily in the petition. Fontaine's petition's quote doesn't mention Balzac. So maybe N/A.

5. Average price difference in the 10th arrondissement? The article mentions prices in general: traditional espresso is 1.40 euros, specialty around 5 euros. But it's not specific to the 10th arrondissement. The question asks for that specific arrondissement's average, which isn't provided. So N/A.

6. Number of Korean-owned specialty shops when heritage was granted? The article mentions Cafe Jirisan as an example of an Asian coffee shop, but doesn't state how many Korean-owned there are. So N/A.

7. Which traditional cafe introduced latte art competition in the 90s? The article doesn't mention any specific traditional cafe doing that. The first wave of specialty shops started in the 2010s. So N/A.

8. Annual revenue loss reported by traditional cafes between 2020-2023? The article discusses decline but no specific figures. N/A.

9. How many traditional cafes converted to specialty shops? The article doesn't give numbers on conversions. N/A.

10. Which international chain partnered with French bistros? The article mentions Starbucks as a competitor but no partnership. N/A.

11. The entrepreneur who believes loss of "patina" undermines community is Alain Fontaine, as he's the one who submitted the petition and made that statement. The question asks who is implied to believe this. The answer is Alain Fontaine.

12. The establishment with rustic cottage vibe, Korean/French books, and fireplace is Cafe Jirisan, as described in the text.

13. The Australian entrepreneur who launched a coffee shop on the Left Bank highlighting terroir is Tom Clark (Coutume Cafe).

14. The researcher Eve Bantman orders a Perrier at her local cafe instead of espresso, then gets a cortado elsewhere. The answer is Perrier.

15. The lively establishment with repartee between staff is Cafe Ventura, described in the scene with the graying man and young barman.

16. The government figure who included cafes in heritage is Rachida Dati, the culture minister.

17. The term used for community spaces is "third place," mentioned in the article's sociological context.

18. The trend heralded by babyccinos is latte art, as Tom Clark mentioned giving babyccinos to kids who are now 18, and the article talks about latte art as part of the aesthetic.

19. The percentage increase in specialty coffee shops: the article states that since the early 2010s, their number rose 74% to 3,500. So the percentage is 74%.

20. The price of espresso at traditional cafes is 1.40 euros (about $1.45), contrasted with specialty's higher prices.
