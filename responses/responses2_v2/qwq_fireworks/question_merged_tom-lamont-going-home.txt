Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article and follow the strict instructions. Let me start by going through each question and checking the article for answers.

1. **Question 1:** "In which London neighborhood did Lia's parents originally live before moving abroad and leaving her their house?"  
Looking at the article, it mentions Ben Mossam's parents moved abroad, leaving him with a house and money. But Lia is Joel's mother, and Teo's unrequited love. The article says Ben's parents moved away, leaving him the house. The question is about Lia's parents. Wait, the article says: "Joel's mother, Lia — Teo's unrequited love — dies by suicide. This all-ages group of lads, plus Sibyl the rabbi, earnestly try to watch over Joel in the wake of baffling tragedy." But there's no mention of Lia's parents moving abroad. The part about parents moving is Ben's. So maybe the question has a mistake. Since the article says Ben's parents moved, not Lia's, the answer would be N/A because the question refers to Lia's parents, but the text doesn't mention them moving. Wait, the question says "Lia's parents originally lived before moving abroad", but the article says Ben's parents moved. So this is a trick question. Answer: N/A.

2. **Question 2:** "How many months did the group collectively care for Joel before social services began their search for his biological father?"  
The article says: "Can they make room in their lives for a toddler until social services can find Joel's biological father or caring foster parents?" But there's no mention of a time period in months. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** "What medical condition did Rabbi Sibyl discover during her efforts to modernize the congregation?"  
The article states Rabbi Sibyl is dealing with a board of traditional congregants while grappling with her own questions around faith. There's no mention of her discovering a medical condition. N/A.

4. **Question 4:** "Which character first introduced Joel to football matches, leading to their shared bonding experience at the stadium?"  
The article mentions "a football match" as one of the events, but it doesn't specify who introduced Joel to it. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** "During which season of the year did Teo's monthly visits to his father typically occur, according to his established routine?"  
The article says Teo returns once a month to visit his elderly father. But no specific season is mentioned. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** "What was the name of the pub where Ben experienced his pill-induced illness after a poker game?"  
The article mentions "a bit of pill-popping and subsequent street-puking" but doesn't name the pub. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** "How many years had passed between Teo's departure from Enfield and Lia's death?"  
Teo left Enfield for the city, but the article doesn't specify when he left or the timeframe until Lia's death. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** "What traditional Jewish practice did Rabbi Sibyl modify that caused tension with the board of congregants?"  
The article says she's trying to win over a board of more traditional congregants, implying changes, but doesn't specify which practice. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** "Which character suggested the trip to Scotland as a way to help Joel cope with his mother's absence?"  
The article lists "a trip to Scotland" as one of the events but doesn't say who suggested it. N/A.

12. **Question 12:** "What substance does Ben Mossam develop an addiction to, culminating in the street-puking incident described in the novel?"
