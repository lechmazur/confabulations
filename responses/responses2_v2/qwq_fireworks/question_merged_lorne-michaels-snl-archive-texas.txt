Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and not any outside knowledge. Let me start by reading through the article again to get the details right.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks which former SNL cast member collaborated on the unreleased George Orwell adaptation "1985". The article mentions that "1985" was written by Al Franken and Tom Davis, both of whom were SNL veterans. So the answer should be Al Franken and Tom Davis. But since the question specifies a "former SNL cast member", both are valid. However, the question might be looking for one, but the article lists both. Let me check again. The article says "written by the 'S.N.L.' veterans Al Franken and Tom Davis." So the answer is both, but the question says "cast member", so maybe either is acceptable. Wait, but the question says "collaborated with Lorne Michaels"â€”so Michaels worked with them on it. The answer is Al Franken and Tom Davis. But maybe the question expects both names. Let me see if the answer requires both. The article says "written by...", so both are correct. But the question says "cast member", and they were part of the cast. So I should list both. But the instructions say if the question asks for two and the article only lists one, answer N/A. Wait, the question is asking for a former SNL cast member (singular), so maybe either one? Hmm, but the article says both. Since the question says "collaborated", maybe both are needed. But the answer format prefers sentence fragments. Maybe list both separated by comma? Let me check the article again: "written by the 'S.N.L.' veterans Al Franken and Tom Davis." So the answer should include both. But the question says "cast member", so they were cast members. So the answer is Al Franken and Tom Davis.

2. **Question 2**: How many index cards did Michaels use? The article says "many examples of the index cards" but doesn't specify a number. So the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Original proposed name for Coneheads? The article doesn't mention any other name before "Coneheads". So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Toronto comedy club where Michaels started. The article says "his early days as a writer and performer in the comedy scene in Toronto", but doesn't name a specific club. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Percentage of digital vs analog from 1980s when Michaels was absent. The article mentions the bulk is paper (analog), but doesn't give percentages for that specific period. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Backup host for first episode. The article says the first episode was hosted by George Carlin, but doesn't mention a backup. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Technological innovation Michaels resisted. The article says he refused teleprompters and required paper scripts. So teleprompters. The question is about a technological innovation he resisted before implementing. Wait, he refused to use them, so he resisted teleprompters. So the answer is teleprompters.

8. **Question 8**: Criteria for digitizing episodes. The article says NBC provided digital copies for research, but doesn't state the criteria. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Number of episodes of "The Beautiful Phyllis Diller Show" Michaels wrote. The article mentions pre-SNL work on that show but no number. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Original runtime of 50th anniversary special. The article says it's set at three hours, but doesn't mention an original planned runtime. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Literary award Michaels won. The article doesn't mention any award he won. It mentions Gabriel Garcia Marquez had papers there, but not Michaels. N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Film stock used for taping. The article doesn't mention the type of film stock. N/A.

13. **Question 13**: Other NBC show's series finale in the archive. The article mentions "30 Rock" and "Portlandia" but doesn't say anything about their finales being included. Wait, "the archive contains material from his work on other projects, which have included TV hits like '30 Rock' and 'Portlandia'..." But the question asks for a long-running NBC show with its series finale. The article doesn't mention a series finale in the donated materials. N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Release year of "1985". The article doesn't state the release year, only that it was a feature-length spoof. N/A.

15. **Question 15**: Original working title of "Wayne's World". The article mentions storyboards for "Wayne's World" but doesn't give the original title. N/A.

16. **Question 16**: Model of teleprompter Michaels refused. The article says he refused teleprompters in general, but doesn't specify a model. N/A.

17. **Question 17**: University Michaels attended before Toronto. The article doesn't mention where he studied. N/A.

18. **Question 18**: Carlin's opening monologue joke. The article doesn't include specific jokes from the first episode's script. N/A.

19. **Question 19**: Name of the five-season replacement in 1980s. The article says Michaels left for five seasons but doesn't name the replacement producer. N/A.

20. **Question 20**: Date Michaels first inquired about donation. The article says he approached over a year ago, but no specific date. N/A.
