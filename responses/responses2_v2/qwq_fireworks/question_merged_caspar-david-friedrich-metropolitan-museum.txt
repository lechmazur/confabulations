Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by going through each question carefully and cross-referencing with the text.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks about the artistic medium Friedrich abandoned after moving to Dresden, related to his later works like "Winterreise". The article mentions that in his later sepia drawings, he abandoned some techniques. Wait, the article says that Friedrich abandoned painting later in life, as seen in the late sepia drawings. The answer might be "painting", but I need to check where exactly. The last part says "after Friedrich abandoned painting and lost his fame, this most German of artists..." So he abandoned painting. But the question specifies "as mentioned in relation to his move to Dresden". Wait, when he moved to Dresden, he left Copenhagen's academy. The article says he dropped out of Copenhagen to move to Dresden. The medium he abandoned after moving? The article says he started landscape painting after moving. Maybe he abandoned the academic training in Copenhagen, which involved drawing from casts and nude studies. The question is about the medium he abandoned after moving. Wait, the question says "abandoned after his move to Dresden". The answer might be "academic training" but the question is about medium. Alternatively, maybe "classical sculpture studies" but the exact wording is needed. Alternatively, the question might refer to the medium he stopped using later, like painting. Wait the question is about the medium he abandoned after moving to Dresden? Or after his later works? The question says "as mentioned in relation to his later works like 'Winterreise'". Wait, the article says "after Friedrich abandoned painting and lost his fame..." so the medium he abandoned was painting. So answer is "painting".

2. **Question 2:** The political figure influencing the critical reception of "Monk by the Sea" during its initial exhibition. The article mentions Adolf Hitler's influence on Friedrich's 20th-century reception, but the question is about the initial exhibition. Wait, the question is about the initial exhibition of "Monk by the Sea". The article says in the 1810 review, a young woman mentions it. But the question is about a political figure. Wait, the article states "only two Friedrich shows have ever taken place here before; one of his biggest fans, Adolf Hitler, cast a long shadow on the artist's 20th-century reception". So the initial exhibition in 1810 didn't involve Hitler. The question might be a trick. Since the question is about the initial exhibition, the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "during its initial exhibition?" No, the initial exhibition was in 1808-10. The article doesn't mention any political figure there. The answer would be N/A, but the question mentions Angela Merkel and Hitler in the text. Wait, the question is about which political figure influenced the critical reception during the initial exhibition. Since the article doesn't mention any political figure from that time, the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe the question is asking which political figure's influence affected the critical reception in the 20th century. The question says "during its initial exhibition" but the article mentions Hitler's influence on 20th-century reception. So the answer would be Adolf Hitler. Wait, the question is about the initial exhibition of "Monk by the Sea", which was in 1810. The article says Hitler influenced the 20th-century reception, so not the initial. So the correct answer is N/A? Hmm, but the question might be a bit ambiguous. Let me check again. The question says "given the mention of Angela Merkel and Adolf Hitler in relation to Friedrich's work, which political figure... influenced the critical reception of 'Monk by the Sea' during its initial exhibition?" Since the initial exhibition was in 1810, and Hitler wasn't around then, the answer is N/A. But the question might be a trick, maybe referring to someone else. Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The Brooklyn Academy of Music's Techne installations used an element present in both "Monk by the Sea" and "Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog". The article mentions fog in both paintings. The question is about what element they used. The Techne installations are digital, so maybe "fog" or "digital installations" but the question is about the element from Friedrich's works. The common element between the two paintings is fog/clouds. The article says "the obscuring device of fog" in both. The Techne installations are digital, so maybe they used fog? The question says "element... used in their Techne installations". The article states "Techne, four digital installations in a black box theater." But the element from Friedrich would be fog. So answer is "fog".

4. **Question 4:** The earlier artistic style Friedrich used in Copenhagen before landscape. The article says in Copenhagen, the academy taught drawing from classical sculptures. So the style was "classical sculpture studies" or "academic training". The question asks for the artistic style similar to sepia landscapes. Wait, the article says he abandoned the Danish education. The style before was classical (academic), so the answer is "classical" or "academic". The question says "artistic style similar to sepia landscapes"—no, the sepia landscapes were his later works. Before that, he did classical studies. The answer is "academic" or "classical". The exact term might be "academic training" but the question asks for style. The article says "the academy in Copenhagen trained students to draw the human body, first after plaster casts of classical sculpture, then from nude life studies." So the style was "academic" or "classical". The answer is "academic".

5. **Question 5:** The emotion expressed by Thomas Schutte in his MoMA retrospective. The article mentions Thomas Schutte's exhibition with "humorous angst" and the prompt to "Don't run from failure". The question links to Erlebniskunst and Schubert's "Winterreise". The emotion here might be "humorous angst". But the question specifies the emotion experienced by the Wanderer. The Wanderer's emotion is melancholy or longing. However, the question is about Thomas Schutte's work. The article says "humorous angst". So the answer is "humorous angst".

6. **Question 6:** Aspect of Friedrich's technique influencing Rothko. The article states that "Monk by the Sea" points forward to Mark Rothko's desolate beauty. The technique mentioned is "lavished attention on the hatching of stones and the ribbing of leaves, turning one lifeless boulder into a reflection of the soul" and "almost no visible brushwork". Rothko's color field paintings have smooth, blended colors. The technique might be "minimal brushwork" or "emphasis on color fields". The article says "almost no visible brushwork in Friedrich, quite unlike the active composition of his English contemporaries Turner and Constable". So the aspect is "minimal brushwork" or "smooth, untextured surfaces". The answer is "minimal brushwork".

7. **Question 7:** Location related to Friedrich's birthplace and Heinrich von Kleist's works. Friedrich was born in Greifswald. The question asks where Kleist's works were set. The article doesn't mention Kleist's locations. Wait, the article says "Heinrich von Kleist could write stories and plays where passion overtakes principle..." but doesn't specify location. So answer N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Architectural element from Friedrich's landscapes in Anne Frank's exhibition. The article mentions the Center for Jewish History reconstructing the Frank family's hiding place. The element in Friedrich's landscapes might be "dolmens" or "crucifixes in evergreen forests". The hiding place is a room, so maybe "hidden rooms" but the article doesn't specify. Alternatively, maybe "caves" as in the late sepia drawings? The question says "architectural element common in Friedrich's landscapes" like rocks, forests. The exhibition about Anne Frank's Annex would reconstruct the annex's architecture. The article doesn't link Friedrich's elements to that. Answer N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Natural element symbolizing time in "Winterreise" and in Simpson's show. The article mentions "Lorna Simpson's show... a constellation of galactic and human history" and "the passage of time". The element in Friedrich's sepia might be "caves" or "cemeteries" (from late drawings). "Winterreise" has "caves and cemeteries". The natural element could be "caves" or "cemeteries", but the question specifies "symbolizes the passage of time". Alternatively, "fog" or "sun/moon". The article says "the sun sets over the Baltic" in sepia works. In "Winterreise", the journey through winter might use "snow" or "seasonal elements". But the article doesn't explicitly state the symbol. Maybe "fog" as it obscures. Alternatively, the answer is "fog" but need to check. Alternatively, "caves" or "cemeteries" from the late drawings. The question says "natural element" so "caves" are natural. The article says "late sepia drawings of caves and cemeteries made after Friedrich abandoned painting". So "caves" and "cemeteries" are elements. But the question asks for the element that symbolizes passage of time in "Winterreise". The song "Winterreise" is about a journey in winter, so maybe "snow" or "winter". But the article doesn't mention that. Alternatively, "moon" as in the crescent moon mentioned in the text. The article says "the two friends leaning on each other as they contemplate the crescent moon over a half-uprooted oak tree". Maybe "moon" but not sure. Since the question is about what symbolizes passage of time, maybe "time" isn't directly stated. Answer N/A? Or maybe "fog" as it's about obscurity and time's passage. Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe the answer is "fog".

10. **Question 10:** Geographical feature focus of Hauser & Wirth exhibition. The article mentions Lorna Simpson's show at Hauser & Wirth as "a constellation of galactic and human history". The question asks about the focus related to Friedrich's philosophy. Friedrich's central feature is "the infinite" in nature like seas, forests. The exhibition's focus is "galactic and human history", so maybe "cosmos" or "galaxy". The question says "specific geographical feature central to Friedrich's philosophy"—he uses seas, mountains, forests. But the Hauser & Wirth show's focus is "galactic", so the answer is "cosmos" or "galaxy". The article says "A Turn to the Cosmos: The artist Lorna Simpson's show at Hauser & Wirth in Chelsea is a constellation of galactic and human history." So the focus is "cosmos". The answer is "cosmos".

11. **Question 11:** Feature Friedrich originally included in 'Monk by the Sea' but removed. The article says "An infrared reflectogram... reveals that Friedrich originally placed two boats on the horizon, then wiped them out." So answer is "boats".

12. **Question 12:** Hue of the solitary figure's attire in the emblematic painting. The emblem is "Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog", described as "head-to-toe crushed green velvet". So the hue is "green".

13. **Question 13:** Weather phenomenon used as a metaphor for veiling emotion. The article mentions fog repeatedly as obscuring and evoking emotion. So "fog".

14. **Question 14:** Nation ruling Greifswald when Friedrich was born. The article says "part of Germany today, but then a holding of the Swedish crown." So answer "Sweden".

15. **Question 15:** Drawing practice from Copenhagen studies he abandoned. The article says he dropped out of Copenhagen's academy where they drew from classical casts and nudes. So the practice was "drawing from classical casts" or "academic training". The exact term is "plaster casts of classical sculpture".

16. **Question 16:** Era heralded by Friedrich's rejection of academic traditions. The article states he rejected academic pretensions, heralding the Romantic era. Answer "Romantic era".

17. **Question 17:** Art historian framing individual's post-Enlightenment self-creation. The article mentions Joseph Leo Koerner's observation. Answer "Joseph Leo Koerner".

18. **Question 18:** Number of works in the 250th birthday show. The article says the Met's show has 88 works, "barely half as many in a related show last year commemorating Friedrich's 250th birthday". So 88 * 2 = 176. Answer "176".

19. **Question 19:** Natural element as obscurant and symbol of perception limits. The article mentions fog in both "Monk" and "Wanderer", used to veil and symbolize limits. Answer "fog".

20. **Question 20:** Infamous figure influencing Friedrich's 20th-century reception. The article says Adolf Hitler was a fan, affecting his legacy. Answer "Adolf Hitler".
