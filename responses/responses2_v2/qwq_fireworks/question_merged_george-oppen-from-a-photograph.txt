Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then find the corresponding information in the text.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about a literary device Mary Oppen used in her memoir "Meaning a Life" to symbolize the collaborative nature of the Oppens' relationship, specifically referencing Linda's arms in the photograph. The article mentions that Mary's memoir is about their collaborative work. It also says the poem reflects their collaboration, and there's a part about binoculars cut in half so they could look at the same thing. That's a metaphor for their shared vision. The literary device here might be metaphor or symbolism. The article says "the poem, like the child, is something the two of them made together." But the question is about Mary's memoir. Wait, the article states, "Mary, an artist who worked in many different media, is the one who took this picture. She enters the poem explicitly in the second stanza, as 'I' becomes 'we'..." The binoculars part is mentioned as an example of their collaboration. The memoir's title is "Meaning a Life," which talks about their collaborative work. The question is about the device Mary used in her memoir. Since the binoculars symbolize their shared vision, maybe the answer is metaphor? Or perhaps the binoculars themselves are the symbol. The question says "literary device exemplified by the placement of Linda's arms..." Hmm, the article says "the placement of their limbs and faces in the frame reveals the nuances of their bond." The arms are a visual metaphor. But the question is about Mary's memoir's device. The binoculars story is an example of their collaboration. The memoir's focus on collaboration might use the metaphor of the binoculars. But the question specifies the placement of Linda's arms in the photograph as the example. Wait, the first part of the question says "exemplified by the placement of Linda's arms in the photograph"—so the literary device in the memoir that symbolizes their collaboration is the same as how the arms are placed. The arms are part of the photo, but the memoir uses a device like metaphor or symbolism. The article mentions "the poem is an artifact of that collaboration and a tribute to its power." Maybe the memoir uses the metaphor of the binoculars? The article says "they had a pair of binoculars that they cut in half... an ideal of creativity: The poem, like the child, is something the two of them made together." So the binoculars are a metaphor in the memoir. But the question is about the literary device Mary used. So the answer might be metaphor. But the question says "exemplified by the placement of Linda's arms"—maybe not. Wait, the article says "the poem... the reversal is even more striking. Grammar wants that interrupting 'child' to refer back to 'me,' who seems to be cradled in the daughter's maternal arms." So the arms' placement is part of the poem's structure. The memoir's device is the binoculars story. The question might be looking for "metaphor" as the device. Alternatively, the binoculars are a symbol. The question says "literary device", so metaphor or symbolism. But the article doesn't explicitly name the device. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the memoir is called "Meaning a Life," which is about their collaboration. The binoculars are a symbol of their shared vision. The question is asking what literary device Mary used in her memoir to symbolize collaboration, exemplified by the arms in the photo. Since the binoculars are an example of their collaboration, perhaps the memoir uses the metaphor of the binoculars. But the question mentions Linda's arms as the example. Alternatively, the article says the poem uses "the reversal" of the metaphor (child as tree, parent as fruit). The memoir's device might be metaphor. I'm a bit confused here. Let me check again. The article says Mary's memoir is "about the collaborative work of their couplehood." The binoculars are an example of their desire for shared vision, which is part of the memoir. The literary device here would be symbolism (the binoculars symbolizing collaboration). So maybe the answer is "symbolism"? Or is it metaphor? Alternatively, the question might be referring to the way the poem uses the photo's elements to symbolize collaboration. But the question is about Mary's memoir. Since the article doesn't explicitly name the literary device used in the memoir, but mentions the binoculars as an example, maybe the answer is "symbolism" as the device, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A because the article doesn't specify the literary device used in the memoir. Wait, the question says "exemplified by the placement of Linda's arms in the photograph"—so the memoir uses that placement as a symbol. But the memoir is written by Mary, and the photo was taken by her. The memoir might use the photo's imagery as a symbol. But without explicit mention of the literary device, maybe it's N/A. Hmm, this is tricky. Let me hold off and see other questions first.

2. **Question 2**: How many years after their expulsion from Oregon State University did George Oppen publish "Discrete Series"? The article says George and Mary were expelled in 1926 (their first date was in 1926, and they stayed out all night which got them kicked out). "Discrete Series" was published in the early 1930s as part of the Objectivists. So from 1926 to early 1930s, maybe around 1931? The exact year isn't given, but "early 1930s" minus 1926. Let's see: if it was published in 1931, that's 5 years. The article says "in the early 1930s, as part of a cluster of poets... published a formally ambitious book ('Discrete Series')." Since their expulsion was in 1926, the answer would be 5 years (1926 +5 =1931). So the answer is 5?

3. **Question 3**: What business did Oppen abstain from during his hiatus, focusing instead on furniture design? The article says during his hiatus, he worked as a tool-and-die maker, furniture designer, labor organizer, and fought in WWII. The question asks what business he abstained from, implying he didn't do something else. The Objectivist principles focus on material reality, so perhaps he avoided publishing? The article mentions he tried to run a small publishing house in the early 1930s before stopping. So during his hiatus (the 25 years), he stopped writing and didn't run the publishing house anymore. So the business is "publishing house".

4. **Question 4**: The event that led to their expulsion is their first date where they stayed out all night. The question asks in what year did this occur. They met in 1926, first date got them expelled, so 1926.

5. **Question 5**: The tactile detail definitively confirmed by Scott as present in the photo. The article says "Is that an apple in Linda's hand? It's hard to tell. Maybe the fruit was a metaphor all along." So Scott says it's hard to tell if the apple was actually there, implying it might not be. But the question asks what was definitively confirmed. The article mentions "the child's coat, the man's nose, the apple in her hand." But the article ends with "It's hard to tell. Maybe the fruit was a metaphor all along." So the apple might not be there. The other details: coat and nose are mentioned as part of the poem's imagery, but the article doesn't confirm if they're in the actual photo. The article says "the poem concentrates on tactile, concrete details: the child's coat, the man's nose, the apple in her hand." But the photo's actual details: "In the early 1930s... the fruit was a metaphor all along." So the apple is not confirmed to be present. The coat and nose aren't confirmed either. The only thing confirmed as present might be Linda's hand holding something, but the article doesn't specify. Wait, the article says "the poem... the child's coat, the man's nose, the apple in her hand." But the photo might not have the apple. The question asks what was definitively confirmed by Scott to be present in the original photo. Since Scott says it's hard to tell about the apple, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the coat and nose are there? The article doesn't say. The only confirmed detail might be the presence of Linda and George in the photo, but that's not a tactile detail. Hmm, maybe N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Political ideology unrelated to Objectivism mentioned in relation to a contemporary novelist's work. The article mentions Ayn Rand's political philosophy in the parenthetical "(which had nothing to do with Ayn Rand's political philosophy)". So the answer is "Ayn Rand's Objectivism" but the question asks what is unrelated to Oppen's Objectivism. The article says Oppen's Objectivism had nothing to do with Ayn Rand's. So the political ideology is "Ayn Rand's Objectivism" (but since the question asks what is unrelated to Oppen's, the answer is Ayn Rand's). The question says "A.O. Scott mentions in relation to a contemporary novelist's work featured in the same publication." The article's end mentions "The Book Review Podcast: Each week, top authors and critics talk about the latest news in the literary world. Listen here." Also, there's a mention of "Han Kang's latest novel" and "Nnedi Okorafor's autobiographical novel". The question refers to a contemporary novelist's work in the same publication. The article says "another example: if the question is about a name of somebody's son, yet the article states that this person only had daughters, you should answer N/A". Here, the mention of Ayn Rand's political philosophy is in the context of Oppen's Objectivism. The other novels mentioned don't relate to a political ideology. Wait, the article says "Objectivism (which had nothing to do with Ayn Rand's political philosophy)". So the answer is "Ayn Rand's political philosophy".

7. **Question 7**: The emotion intensified by the reversed metaphor (child as tree, parent as fruit). The article says "the bittersweet miracle of parenthood comes into focus. Parents create their children, and vice versa... Children see their parents as solid and permanent... Or at least parents need to think their children see them that way, even as they are aware of their own fragility and the swift passage of time." The emotion here is "bittersweet". The question asks what emotion is intensified by the reversed metaphor. The article says "the bittersweet miracle of parenthood comes into focus" in the second stanza. The metaphor's reversal leads to this bittersweet feeling. So the answer is "bittersweet".

8. **Question 8**: Material used in pre-digital photography contributing to the "less tangible substances" like memory. The article says "the old, predigital kind, anyway -- of paper and silver emulsion, and also of less tangible substances: light; time; memory; love." So the material is "silver emulsion".

9. **Question 9**: Profession Oppen undertook during hiatus that contradicts the political stance he aimed to avoid. The article says he stopped writing to keep politics out of it. During his hiatus, he worked as a tool-and-die maker, furniture designer, labor organizer, and fought in WWII. The political stance he wanted to avoid was politics in his poetry. The labor organizer role is political, so that's the one contradicting. The question is about a profession that contradicts his avoidance of political involvement. So the answer is "labor organizer".

10. **Question 10**: Object shared by George and Mary to achieve symmetrical vision, influencing "Discrete Series". The article mentions they had binoculars cut in half to look at the same thing. The question asks what influenced the structure of "Discrete Series", published before Linda's birth (Linda was born in 1940, and "Discrete Series" was early 1930s). The binoculars are the object. So the answer is "binoculars".

11. **Question 11**: The single item embodying the transformed role (child as tree, parent as fruit). The metaphor reversal uses "apple" as the fruit. The article says "the child is the tree, and the parent is the fruit. When you stop to think about it... the parent is the fruit." The fruit is an apple (since the apple is mentioned earlier in the poem). So the answer is "apple".

12. **Question 12**: Year Linda was born. The article states "Linda was their only surviving child, born in 1940".

13. **Question 13**: Tactile detail highlighted as key to the snapshot's realism. The article mentions "the child's coat, the man's nose, the apple in her hand" as concrete details. But the article also says "the poem concentrates on tactile, concrete details... the intensity of the moment pulls it toward metaphor". The specific detail confirmed in the photo might be the coat or nose, but the article doesn't say which is highlighted. However, the first line of the poem is mentioned as "the first line again... the interrupting 'child' to refer back to 'me,' who seems to be cradled in the daughter's maternal arms." The coat is part of the tactile details. The article says "the child's coat" is part of the concrete details. Since the question is about what's highlighted as key, maybe "coat" or "nose" or "apple". But the apple's presence is uncertain. The article says "the poem... the apple in her hand. But the intensity... pulls it toward metaphor". So the apple is part of the poem's imagery but maybe not confirmed in the photo. The article says "the photograph takes shape... you imagine something motherly in the girl's posture; something childlike in the father's upturned face." The tactile details are coat, nose, apple. Since the question asks which is highlighted as key, perhaps "coat" is mentioned first. The article says "the child's coat, the man's nose, the apple in her hand. But the intensity of the moment pulls it toward metaphor -- the surprising and touching idea that a father can be... a feature of the landscape, unmoving and familiar." The apple is part of the metaphor. The tactile details are the coat, nose, and apple. Since the question asks for the key aspect of the snapshot's realism, perhaps "coat" or "nose". The article says "the poem concentrates on tactile, concrete details: the child's coat, the man's nose..." So maybe "coat" is the first mentioned, so answer "coat".

14. **Question 14**: Body part used as metaphor through textual representation. The article says "Then he folds them, in the form of words, around a line break, kind of like how they are wrapped around his head." The "them" refers to the daughter's arms. The body part is "arms" (since the arms are wrapped around the father's head, represented by line breaks). The question asks what part's body is used as a metaphor through its textual representation. So "arms".

15. **Question 15**: Occupation Oppen undertook during his hiatus. The article lists tool-and-die maker, furniture designer, labor organizer, and fought in WWII. The question asks for one mentioned. So any of these, but the answer should be one. The first is "tool-and-die maker".

16. **Question 16**: Major historical event he participated in. The article says he fought in WWII.

17. **Question 17**: Number of years Mary and George were together. They met in 1926 and he died in 1984. 1984 - 1926 = 58 years, which the article states: "they would be together for the next 58 years, until George's death in 1984."

18. **Question 18**: Title of Mary's 1978 memoir. The article says "Mary published 'Meaning a Life,' a memoir about the collaborative work of their couplehood."

19. **Question 19**: Medium with light-sensitive properties mentioned. The article says "paper and silver emulsion" for pre-digital photos. The light-sensitive part refers to silver emulsion, but the medium is "silver emulsion" or "photographic paper". The question asks for the medium, so "silver emulsion".

20. **Question 20**: Individual represented both as observer and subject in the poem. The poem is about a photo taken by Mary (the observer) of George and Linda (the subjects). So the answer would be Mary, but the question might be trickier. The poem mentions "I" becomes "we" in the second stanza, which includes Mary. The subject in the photo is George and Linda, but the observer is Mary. However, the question asks who is represented both as observer and subject. Maybe George is the subject in the photo (being held by his daughter), and he's also the poet observing the photo. So George is both subject (in the photo) and observer (writing the poem). The article says "the father, who is also the poet, looking and feeling are as entangled as parent and child." So George is both the subject (the man in the photo) and the observer (the poet looking at it). Therefore, the answer is "George Oppen".

Now let me go back to the first question to see if I can figure it out again. 

**Question 1**: The literary device in Mary's memoir that symbolizes their collaboration, exemplified by the placement of Linda's arms. The article mentions the binoculars as an example of their desire for shared vision. The memoir's title is "Meaning a Life," which discusses their collaboration. The device used here could be metaphor, using the binoculars as a symbol. The question says the device is exemplified by the arms in the photo. Since the poem uses the photo's elements to symbolize their relationship, and the memoir's focus is on collaboration, perhaps the memoir uses the metaphor of the binoculars. However, the question specifies "exemplified by the placement of Linda's arms". The arms in the poem's structure (line breaks) mirror the photo's arms around the father. The memoir might use the metaphor of their intertwined limbs as a symbol. But the article doesn't explicitly name the literary device. Since it's asking about Mary's memoir's device, and the binoculars are an example of their collaboration, the answer might be "symbolism" or "metaphor". Alternatively, since the memoir's title is about meaning and collaboration, perhaps the answer is "metaphor". But without explicit mention, maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "the poem is an artifact of that collaboration and a tribute to its power." The memoir's content is about their collaboration, so the literary device used there would be metaphor or symbolism. Since the question says "exemplified by the placement of Linda's arms in the photograph", the memoir might use the photo's imagery as a metaphor. The article says "the photograph takes shape in your mind's eye as you read. You imagine something motherly in the girl's posture; something childlike in the father's upturned face." The memoir might use the photo's elements as symbols. The question asks what device Mary used in her memoir. Since the binoculars are part of their story but not directly related to the photo's arms, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the memoir uses the metaphor of the binoculars. But the question is about the placement of arms. Since the article doesn't specify the literary device, maybe N/A. Alternatively, the device is "symbolism" because the arms symbolize their bond. The article says "the placement of their limbs and faces in the frame reveals the nuances of their bond." So the memoir uses symbolism through the photo's imagery. But the question is about the memoir's literary device, so the answer is "symbolism".

Wait, the question specifies Mary's memoir. The memoir's title is "Meaning a Life" about their collaboration. The binoculars are an example of their shared vision, so the memoir uses the metaphor of the binoculars. The question says the device is exemplified by the placement of Linda's arms in the photo. The arms' placement in the photo is part of the poem's structure, which mirrors the memoir's theme. But the memoir itself might not use that exact metaphor. Since the article doesn't explicitly state the literary device used in the memoir, perhaps it's N/A. Hmm, I'm torn here. The article says "the poem, like the child, is something the two of them made together." The memoir discusses their collaboration, so the device might be "collaboration as metaphor" but that's not a standard term. Alternatively, the answer is "metaphor" as the device. Let me check the article again: "the poem... the reversal is even more striking. Grammar wants that interrupting 'child' to refer back to 'me,' who seems to be cradled in the daughter's maternal arms." This suggests the poem uses metaphor, but the question is about the memoir. Since the memoir's example is the binoculars, which symbolize their shared vision, the answer is "symbolism". I'll go with "symbolism".
