Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks about the genre of music Kantorow performed at the Paris Olympics opening ceremony. The article mentions he performed Ravel's "Jeux d'Eau" during the ceremony. Since Ravel is a classical composer, the genre here is classical. But wait, the question specifies the genre he performed with the Olympics. The article says "Jeux d'Eau" which is a classical piece, so the answer is classical music. But the question might just want the specific piece's genre, but the question says "genre of music" so maybe classical.

Wait, the question says "genre of music did he perform with the Paris Olympics opening ceremony?" The article says he performed Ravel's "Jeux d'Eau" which is a classical piece. So the answer is classical music. But maybe they want the specific piece? Wait no, the question is about genre, so "classical" is correct.

2. The second question is about the award Shereshevskaya helped him win, which reinforced his preference for established practices. The article says that Shereshevskaya coached him to win the Tchaikovsky Competition. So the answer is Tchaikovsky Competition Gold Medal.

3. Third question: How many times did he perform Ravel's Piano Concerto in G with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe? The article says that Bertrand Chamayou performed in the same hall and his program was presented eight times in nine days across four countries. But the question is about Kantorow's performances. Wait, the article says that Chamayou performed Ravel's Piano Concerto in G, not Kantorow. The article mentions Kantorow's current focus on Brahms, but there's no mention of him performing Ravel's concerto. So the answer here would be N/A because the article doesn't say Kantorow performed that piece with that orchestra. The question might be a trap since it's about Chamayou, not Kantorow.

4. Fourth question: The instrument Kantorow's father played on the French violin sonatas album. The article says Kantorow's father is a violinist and conductor. So the answer is violin.

5. Fifth question: The physical characteristic noted during Paris Olympics that aligns with the brashness in Brahms's First. The article mentions during the Olympics, he had a crystal-embellished shirt and fuzzy beard, and was described as "heroic and unflappable." The brashness in Brahms's First is about risk and youth. The article says his performance in the rain was "heroic and unflappable," which might relate to brashness. But the question is about a physical characteristic. The article mentions his "single left sleeve rolled up" and "sliver of calf" in the Carnegie photo. Wait, the question refers to the Carnegie Hall photo by Fadi Kheir. The article's description of the photo includes rolled-up sleeve, which might symbolize the brashness. Alternatively, the "roars, with depth and clarity" sound. But the question is about a physical characteristic in the Carnegie photo that resembles the brashness. The article says the image shows him as "unusually relaxed performer in flow" but the second character is "bohemian, slightly unkempt." The brashness in Brahms is described as "youth in the bravura." Maybe the rolled-up sleeve symbolizes that. The answer might be "rolled-up left sleeve" but the question says "during his performance at the Paris Olympics." Wait, the Paris Olympics part mentions the fuzzy beard and crystal shirt. Wait, the question says "as captured by Fadi Kheir" which is the Carnegie Hall photo. So the physical characteristic in that photo. The article says "single left sleeve rolled up" in the Carnegie photo. The brashness in Brahms's first is linked to youth and risk. So the rolled-up sleeve might be the answer here. The answer would be "rolled-up left sleeve."

6. Sixth question: The ballet score by Milhaud that Kantorow performed with the Chamber Orchestra. The article mentions that Chamayou performed Milhaud's "La Creation du Monde" and Bernstein's "Fancy Free." The question asks what ballet score by Milhaud Kantorow performed. Wait, but the article says that Chamayou performed those pieces, not Kantorow. The article says "Kantorow's current focus on Brahms's early period." Since the question is about Kantorow's performance, but the article only mentions Chamayou's, so this would be N/A. The article doesn't say Kantorow performed that. So answer is N/A.

7. Seventh question: Physical characteristic during Paris Olympics aligning with "unflappable" demeanor. The article says during the Olympics, he was seen with a crystal-embellished shirt and fuzzy beard, performing in the rain. The France3 channel called him "heroic and unflappable." The physical characteristic noted here is "fuzzy beard" or "crystal-embellished shirt." The question asks which physical characteristic aligns with the "unflappable" description. The article mentions the fuzzy beard and shirt, but the unflappable refers to his performance in the rain. So maybe the "fuzzy beard" is part of his appearance, but the physical trait that shows unflappability might be his calmness, but the question asks for a physical characteristic. The article says "fuzzy beard" is part of his look, so maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, the fact he performed in the rain is an action, not a physical trait. The article says "in the pouring rain during the Paris Olympics opening ceremony. (After the performance, the France3 channel declared him 'heroic and unflappable.') So the physical characteristic would be his appearance elements: "crystal-embellished shirt" or "fuzzy beard." The question asks which aligns with the unflappable demeanor. The unflappable is about his performance under rain, so maybe the physical trait that shows that is his calmness, but the question wants a physical aspect. Since the article mentions his appearance, perhaps the fuzzy beard is part of his relaxed, unflappable look. The answer is "fuzzy beard."

8. Eighth question: Specific Bach work mentioned by Andras Schiff that Kantorow feels unready to perform. The article says Schiff spoke of playing Bach's "The Art of Fugue" at age 70, and Kantorow is uncomfortable performing Bach in public. So the answer is "The Art of Fugue."

9. Ninth question: Amount from Gilmore prize for commissioning new works. The article states the Gilmore award includes $300k total, with $250k set aside for career-enhancing projects. The question asks how much is for commissioning new works. The article says aside from a concerto by Connesson, Kantorow hasn't done much contemporary music but is committed. The prize's $250k is for career projects, which could include commissions. The question specifies the amount designated for commissioning. Since the article says $250k is set aside for career-enhancing projects, but it doesn't specify exactly for commissions. However, the question's wording might take that as the answer. The answer is $250,000.

10. Tenth question: University Kantorow attended related to his astrophysics interest. The article says he stayed in nonspecialist schooling as long as possible and might have pursued science. But it doesn't mention any university name. So answer N/A.

11. Eleventh question: Scientific discipline influencing his Brahms interpretation. The article says his astrophysics interest influenced his approach, combining logic and mysticism. The answer is astrophysics.

12. Twelfth question: Clothing article from Carnegie debut that reappeared in Chamayou collaboration. The Carnegie photo mentions a rolled-up left sleeve and "single left sleeve rolled up." The article about Chamayou's performance says nothing about clothing, but the question might refer to something. Alternatively, the crystal-embellished shirt from Olympics? But the question refers to Chamber Orchestra of Europe collaboration with Chamayou. Since the article doesn't mention Kantorow's clothing in that context, perhaps the rolled-up sleeve is the answer if it's mentioned elsewhere. The article only mentions the Carnegie photo's sleeve. Since the question says "reappeared symbolically in his Chamber Orchestra of Europe collaboration with Bertrand Chamayou," but the article doesn't mention his clothing there. So answer N/A.
