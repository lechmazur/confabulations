Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **First question**: The article says that undocumented workers paid $96.7 billion in total taxes, with a third going to payroll taxes for Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment. But the question is specifically about unemployment insurance. The article groups these together but doesn't break down the exact percentage for unemployment. Since it's a third for payroll taxes overall, but unemployment is part of that, but the exact percentage isn't given. So I think this is N/A because the article doesn't specify the portion for unemployment.

2. **Second question**: The IRS created ITINs in 1996. The article mentions that Congress would need to act to change sharing of ITIN info, but it doesn't say which committee proposed it. The article only states the IRS created them, not a specific Congressional committee. So N/A.

3. **Third question**: The article says for every 100k net immigrants, the funding gap changes by 0.09% of taxable payroll. To get 0.27%, that's 3 times 0.09%, so 300k more immigrants. But the question is about deportation reducing funding. Wait, the question is how many unauthorized workers need to be deported to reduce the funding by 0.27%. Wait, the article says if immigration falls, the shortfall worsens. But the question is about reducing the funding gap (which is a deficit), so maybe the direction is confusing. Wait, the article says a lower immigration (829k) makes the shortfall worse. To reduce the gap (i.e., improve the shortfall), you need more immigrants. But the question is phrased as reducing the funding gap by 0.27%. Wait, the article says if net immigration falls to 829k, the shortfall becomes 3.9% from 3.5%. So that's a 0.4% increase in the shortfall. To reduce the gap by 0.27%, you need to increase immigration. But the question is asking how many unauthorized workers would need to be deported to achieve a 0.27% reduction in the funding gap. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The article states that for every 100k net immigrants, the funding gap improves by 0.09%. So to get a 0.27% improvement, you need 300k more immigrants. But the question is phrased as "deported to reduce Social Security's funding gap by 0.27%". Wait, deportation would reduce the number of immigrants contributing. Wait, the funding gap is the shortfall. If you deport workers, that reduces the number of contributors, making the shortfall worse, not better. So the question might be mixing up. The user might have a mistake here, but according to the article's math, to reduce the funding gap (i.e., improve it) by 0.27%, you need 300k more immigrants. But the question is about deportation causing a reduction in the funding gap, which would actually make it worse. Since the question is based on the article's math, perhaps the answer is that you can't do that via deportation, so N/A? Wait, but the question might be phrased as "reduce the funding gap" meaning making the gap smaller (improving), but deportation would make the gap larger. So maybe the question is wrong, so answer N/A. Alternatively, maybe I need to see the exact wording. The question says: "How many unauthorized workers would need to be deported to reduce Social Security's funding gap by 0.27 percent..." But deportation reduces the number of contributors, so that would worsen the funding gap (increase the shortfall), not reduce it. Since the question's premise is incorrect (deportation would not reduce the gap), then the answer is N/A.

Wait, but the user's instructions say if the question has an incorrect premise, answer N/A. Since deporting would make the gap worse, not better, the question's premise is wrong. So answer N/A.

4. **Fourth question**: The article says Social Security paid $1.5 trillion last year (2022?) to 68 million Americans each month. Wait, the article says "totaling $1.5 trillion last year". The question is asking for average monthly benefit in 2023. Wait, the article mentions "totaling $1.5 trillion last year", which would be 2022 since the analysis is from 2022. The question is about 2023, but the article doesn't mention 2023 data. So N/A because the article doesn't have 2023 figures.

5. **Fifth question**: The article states that if net immigration increases to 1.7 million (highest in the report), the shortfall improves by 10% from 3.5% to 3.1%. The question is asking for the year when the trust fund becomes fully solvent. The article says the trust fund is projected to run dry in 2033. But the question is about solvency if immigration increases to 2.1 million. Wait, the highest in the report was 1.7 million, which gives a 3.1% shortfall. The article says the program needs an additional 3.5% at 1.24 million. So to be fully solvent (0% shortfall?), but the article doesn't mention the exact year. The question is about the year when it becomes solvent with 2.1 million. The article doesn't provide that; it only mentions the 75-year projection. So N/A.

6. **Sixth question**: The article mentions ITINs were introduced in 1996 but doesn't give the number issued in the first year. So N/A.

7. **Seventh question**: The article says undocumented workers file taxes to show good moral character for immigration cases, but there's no data on how many obtained citizenship. So N/A.

8. **Eighth question**: The article says if immigration falls to 829k, the shortfall becomes 3.9% of taxable payroll. But the question is asking how much additional funding Social Security would need. The shortfall is the difference between needed and actual. The article says the program needs an additional 3.5% at 1.24 million. If immigration drops to 829k, the shortfall is 3.9%, so the required additional would be 3.9%? Not sure. The article says "the program needs an additional 3.5%... if annual net immigration fell to 829k (its low estimate), the program's long-term financing shortfall would worsen by about 10 percent (to 3.9% from 3.5%)." So the additional needed is 3.9% of taxable payroll. But the question is how much additional funding would be required. The article doesn't give the total taxable payroll figure, so can't compute the exact dollar amount. So N/A.

9. **Ninth question**: The article states that undocumented workers can't get the earned-income tax credit. But the question is about the total denied. The article doesn't give the amount denied, only that they can't claim it. So N/A.

10. **Tenth question**: The article mentions using fake SSNs but doesn't give the number of cases detected. N/A.

11. **Eleventh question**: The highest immigration level in the report was 1.7 million, which reduces the shortfall to 3.1%. The original shortfall was 3.5%, so the offset is 0.4% of taxable payroll. The total projected shortfall in 2033 is the 79% of benefits, but the question is about the percentage offset. The article says the 3.1% is the new shortfall. The original was 3.5%, so 0.4% reduction. The question asks what percentage of the 2033 shortfall would be offset. The 2033 shortfall is measured as a percentage of payroll? The article says the trust fund would run dry in 2033, allowing only 79% of benefits. Maybe the 0.4% is the reduction in the financing shortfall. The question might be asking how much of the original shortfall (3.5%) is offset by the higher immigration. 0.4/3.5 = ~11.4%. But the question says "directly offset if net immigration reached the highest level (1.7 million)". The article states that at 1.7 million, the shortfall is 3.1%, which is a 10% improvement from 3.5%. So 10% of the original shortfall is offset. The question asks what percentage of the 2033 shortfall would be offset. The 2033 shortfall's percentage isn't directly tied to the 3.5% figure. The 3.5% is the financing shortfall as a % of payroll. So if the original is 3.5% and it improves to 3.1%, that's a 10% reduction in the shortfall (since 0.4 is 10% of 3.5). So the answer is 10%.

12. **Twelfth question**: The article says if Trump's deportation plan is enacted, Social Security would lose ~$20 billion annually. The undocumented contributed $25.7 billion to SS in 2022. So the difference is 25.7 - 20? Wait, the deportation would remove their contributions, so the loss is 25.7, but the article says the loss would be ~$20 billion. Wait, the article says "could cost Social Security roughly $20 billion in cash flow annually". So the question asks how much more undocumented contributed than the projected loss. The answer would be 25.7 - 20 = 5.7 billion? Wait, no. The $25.7B is what they paid. If they are deported, SS loses that $25.7B, but the article says the cost would be ~$20B. Maybe there's a discrepancy. The article says "the billions they pour into the program effectively act as a subsidy... if the White House does follow through... it could cost Social Security roughly $20 billion in cash flow annually." So the answer would be 25.7 - 20 = 5.7? Or is it that the $20B is the annual loss, so the difference between their contribution and the loss is zero? Wait, the question is phrased as "how much more did undocumented contribute than the program is projected to lose". If deportation causes loss of $20B, then the answer would be $25.7B - $20B = $5.7B. But the article says "pour into the program effectively act as a subsidy" implying their contributions are a net gain. But the question is about the loss if they are deported. So the answer is $25.7B (their contribution) minus the $20B loss? Wait, no. The $20B is the loss from deporting them. So the question is asking how much more did they contribute than the loss, which would be $25.7B - $20B = $5.7B. But maybe the $20B is the exact amount they contribute, so the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says "the billions they pour... effectively act as a subsidy... if deported, it could cost Social Security roughly $20 billion annually". So the $20B is the loss, which is their contribution. So the difference would be zero. But the question says "how much more did undocumented contribute than the program is projected to lose". If the loss is exactly their contribution, then the answer is 0. But the article says "pour into the program effectively act as a subsidy for American beneficiaries", implying their contributions don't come back to them. The $20B is the loss from losing their contributions. So the answer would be $25.7B (their contribution) minus $20B (the loss) equals $5.7B more? Or is the $20B the loss, which is exactly their contribution, so the difference is 25.7-20=5.7? The article says "pour into the program effectively act as a subsidy" so their contributions are a net gain. If deported, the loss is $20B, but their total contribution was $25.7B. Maybe the $20B is an estimate, so the answer would be $25.7B - $20B = $5.7B. But I need to check the article's exact wording. The article says "Social Security roughly $20 billion in cash flow annually". So the answer is $25.7B - $20B = $5.7B? Or maybe the $20B is the same as their contribution, so the difference is zero? Hmm. The article says "the billions they pour into the program effectively act as a subsidy... if deported, it could cost... $20 billion". So the $20B is the loss from their contributions, meaning their contribution is $20B. But the article earlier says they paid $25.7B. There's a discrepancy here. The first part says $25.7B from ITAX analysis, but the actuaries say $20B. So maybe the question is using the $25.7B as their contribution, and the loss would be that, so the difference is zero. But the question says "how much more did undocumented contribute than the program is projected to lose if Trump's deportation plan is fully enacted?" If the loss is $20B, but they contributed $25.7B, then the answer is $5.7B more. But the article says "could cost Social Security roughly $20 billion", so maybe that's the exact loss, which is their contribution. So maybe the $25.7B is the total taxes they paid, but the Social Security part is $20B? The article says "the Social Security Administration receives billions in free money... undocumented immigrants paid an estimated $25.7 billion in Social Security taxes in 2022". So that $25.7B is specifically Social Security taxes. The actuaries say deportation would cost $20B annually. So the difference is $25.7B - $20B = $5.7B. So the answer is $5.7 billion.

13. **Thirteenth question**: If the IRS could share ITIN info, would that make undocumented workers stop paying taxes? The article says they fear deportation but have protections. If Congress changes the law, maybe they stop filing. The Institute's research says they contribute $96.7B. But the question is what percentage of that would be at risk. The article says they file to show good moral character, so maybe they would stop, but the article doesn't state the percentage. N/A.

14. **Fourteenth question**: The article says if the trust fund runs dry in 2033, benefits would be reduced to 79%, which is a 21% reduction. If net immigration falls to the lowest (829k), the shortfall becomes 3.9%. But the question is how that affects the 2033 benefit reduction. The 79% figure is based on current projections. If immigration is lower, would the reduction be worse? The article doesn't say. It only states the 79% is the projected without changes. So N/A.

15. **Fifteenth question**: The total benefits paid out in the year before the Institute's analysis (2022 analysis, so prior year is 2021?), the article says "totaling $1.5 trillion last year". Assuming last year is 2022, so prior would be 2021, but the article doesn't specify. N/A.

16. **Sixteenth question**: If they could get the EITC, how much more would they pay? The article says they can't claim it, so their taxes aren't reduced. But the question is about their contribution increasing, which might not be the case. The EITC is a credit, so allowing it would reduce their tax liability, not increase contributions. So the question is flawed. N/A.

17. **Seventeenth question**: To eliminate the funding gap (3.5% at 1.24 million). Each 100k immigrants improve by 0.09%. To reach 0%, need (3.5 / 0.09) * 100k = ~3888889 more immigrants? Wait, the current net is 1.24 million. The required additional immigrants would be (3.5 / 0.09) * 100,000 = 3.5 /0.0009? Wait, let's compute. The shortfall is 3.5% at 1.24 million. To get to 0%, need to reduce by 3.5%. Each 100k reduces by 0.09%. So 3.5 /0.09 ≈38.888... so 38.888 * 100,000 ≈3,888,889 more immigrants. But the question is how many more undocumented workers beyond 11 million would need to be employed. Wait, the net immigration is annual, not total. The question is confusing. The article's math is about net immigrants annually. The question is about total number of undocumented workers. Not sure. The article says "for every 100,000 net immigrants each year, the funding gap is improved by 0.09%". So to eliminate the 3.5% gap, need 3.5 /0.09 = ~38.888 million additional net immigrants annually? But that doesn't make sense. The question is phrased as "how many more undocumented workers, beyond the current estimated 11 million, would need to be employed..." but net immigration is annual. This is unclear. The article doesn't provide the current number of undocumented workers contributing, so N/A.

18. **Eighteenth question**: The question refers to Lewis & Clark Law School's estimate, but the article says the 3.5% figure is from the trustees report. The law school is mentioned in a different context. So N/A.

19. **Nineteenth question**: The article says "they will not claim benefits for years into the future, if ever". But no specific number. N/A.
