Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the given article and answer each question exactly as per the instructions. Let's go step by step.

1. The first question asks about a prop symbolizing a key theme of "Show Boat" near the sash that represents minstrelsy. The article mentions a water cooler, electric guitar, and a sash with "WHITE". The article says the sash's presence makes you think of the original's context where Queenie was played in blackface. But the question is about a prop near the sash that symbolizes minstrelsy. The water cooler might be the Mississippi River, but the electric guitar is about modernizing. Wait, maybe the sash itself isn't the prop in question. The question specifies the prop that's near the sash and symbolizes minstrelsy. The article says the sash is about race, and Queenie was in blackface. The water cooler might be the Mississippi, but the key theme related to minstrelsy would be the sash's "WHITE" indicating the original's racial context. Wait, the question says the prop symbolizes a key theme of the original "Show Boat" and is placed near the sash. The three items are water cooler, electric guitar, sash. The key theme related to minstrelsy is the racial aspect. The sash itself is part of the symbol, but the question asks for the prop near the sash that represents minstrelsy. Maybe the water cooler? Or is there another? Hmm, maybe the sash is the answer, but the question says "prop symbolizing a key theme of the original" and placed near the sash. Wait, maybe the answer is the sash itself, but the question specifies "prop" and the sash is the prop. Wait, the first paragraph says the three items are water cooler, electric guitar, sash. The sash's "WHITE" relates to the original's whiteness. The key theme related to minstrelsy would be the blackface, so maybe the sash symbolizes that? Or perhaps the water cooler represents the river, which is a key theme. But the question specifically about minstrelsy. The article says the original had Queenie in blackface. The sash's "WHITE" indicates the original's whiteness. Maybe the sash is the answer here. Wait, the question is asking for a prop that symbolizes a key theme of the original, and placed near the sash. Since the sash is part of the three props, maybe the answer is the water cooler? Or perhaps the electric guitar? Wait, the article says the sash's presence makes you think of the original's whiteness. The key theme of minstrelsy would be the blackface. The sash itself is part of the symbol, but the question wants a prop near the sash that represents minstrelsy. Hmm, maybe the answer is the sash, but the question says "prop, symbolizing a key theme... placed on stage near the sash". Wait, maybe the sash is one of the three items, so the other two (water cooler and electric guitar) are placed near it. But which one symbolizes minstrelsy? The water cooler might be the Mississippi, which is a key theme. The electric guitar is for modernizing. The sash's "WHITE" relates to the original's racial context. The minstrelsy is about blackface, so the sash's "WHITE" might symbolize the original's whiteness, which is part of the minstrelsy context. But the question is asking for a prop that's placed near the sash (so one of the other two items) that symbolizes the theme of minstrelsy. Maybe the answer is the water cooler, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the sash itself. Wait, the question says "symbolizing a key theme of the original 'Show Boat' and placed on stage near the sash". Wait, the sash is already one of the three props. The other two are near it. The key theme related to minstrelsy would be the racial aspect, so the sash's "WHITE" symbolizes that. But the question is about another prop near it. Maybe the answer is N/A? Or maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-read the first paragraph.

The first paragraph says: "A water cooler. An electric guitar. A sash. Even if you know beforehand that the Target Margin production you're attending will be an experimental reboot of 'Show Boat,' the great-grandfather of American musicals, you may find the three items that greet you on an otherwise blank stage disorienting. Perhaps, you think, as you take your seat at NYU Skirball in Manhattan, the water cooler alludes to the Mississippi River -- or to aesthetic thirst. The electric guitar, you imagine, marks the intention of the director and adapter David Herskovits to bring the 97-year-old musical into the present. (The title has been modishly restyled 'Show/Boat: A River.') But the sash, draped on a mic stand, remains mysterious. In block capital letters it says WHITE."

So the water cooler is thought to allude to the Mississippi River, which is a key theme (the river is central in the original). The electric guitar is for modernizing. The sash says "WHITE", which relates to the original's whiteness. The question is asking which prop (among the three) symbolizes a key theme (the original's racial context/minstrelsy) and is placed near the sash. The sash itself is the one symbolizing the racial aspect. But the question says "prop symbolizing a key theme... placed on stage near the sash", so perhaps the water cooler? Or is the sash itself the answer? Wait, the sash is one of the three props. The question might be a bit tricky. The key theme related to minstrelsy is the racial aspect, so the sash (with "WHITE") is the symbol. But the question says "prop symbolizing a key theme of the original 'Show Boat' and placed on stage near the sash". Wait, that wording is confusing. Maybe the answer is the sash itself? But the question says "placed near the sash", implying another prop. Alternatively, maybe the water cooler is a key theme (the river), so that's a key theme, but not directly about minstrelsy. Since the question mentions minstrelsy, the answer is the sash. But the wording is tricky. Let me check again. The question says the prop symbolizes a key theme of the original "Show Boat" and is placed near the sash. The key themes include the river, the racial dynamics. The sash is part of the racial aspect. The water cooler is the river. Since the question is about the racial/minstrelsy aspect, the sash is the answer, but the question says "placed near the sash", so maybe there's another item. Wait, maybe the question is a trick, and the answer is the sash. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the water cooler as the key theme (river) but that's not about minstrelsy. Hmm. Maybe the answer is N/A, but I think the sash is the correct answer. Wait, the question says "symbolizing a key theme of the original 'Show Boat' and placed on stage near the sash". Since the sash is one of the three items, perhaps the answer is the sash itself, but the phrasing is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the question is looking for the sash. Let me proceed and see other questions first.

2. The second question asks how many performances were originally scheduled at the Under the Radar festival. The article says "Show/Boat" is part of the 2025 Under the Radar festival, and the schedule mentioned by Jesse Green is through Jan. 26. But the article doesn't state the number of performances, only the dates. So the answer is N/A.

3. The third question: Which character was originally portrayed by a white actor in blackface in the 1927 premiere? The article says Queenie, a riverboat cook, was originally played by a white actor in blackface. The songs re-orchestrated by Dan Schlosberg for a six-piece band... The article mentions that the "Black" songs like "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man" and "Bill" are highlights for Julie (Stephanie Weeks), the mixed-race character passing as white. Julie's songs might be the ones. But the question is about the character originally played in blackface, which is Queenie. But the re-orchestrated songs are for whom? The article says Dan Schlosberg orchestrated the score, so maybe the answer is Julie. Wait, the question says "whose songs were re-orchestrated for a six-piece band by Dan Schlosberg, was originally portrayed by a white actor in blackface in the 1927 premiere?" Wait, the character originally in blackface is Queenie, but her songs might not be mentioned. Julie is the one passing as white, and her songs like "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man" are highlighted. The article says "the 'Black' songs fare much better. 'Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man' and 'Bill' are highlights for Julie...". So Julie's songs were re-orchestrated. The question is asking which character was originally portrayed in blackface, so Queenie. But the songs re-orchestrated are for Julie. Therefore, the answer might be Julie, but the original portrayal in blackface was Queenie. The question links the two: the character whose songs were re-orchestrated by Dan Schlosberg (as part of the production) was originally played in blackface. Since Julie's songs were highlighted, but she's the one passing as white, perhaps the answer is Queenie. Wait, but Queenie's songs aren't mentioned here. The article says "the 'Black' songs... are highlights for Julie". So Julie's songs were re-orchestrated, and Julie was originally played by a white actor in blackface? No, the article says Queenie was the one in blackface. Julie is passing as white in the original, but the article says "Julie (Stephanie Weeks), the mixed-race star of the showboat who has been passing as white". So Julie was originally played by a white actor? Or maybe not. The original 1927 premiere's Julie would have been played by a white actor in blackface if she was supposed to be mixed race passing as white. The article states that Queenie was originally played in blackface, but Julie's role might also have been played by a white actor in blackface. The question is asking which character was originally played in blackface and whose songs were re-orchestrated. The article says Queenie was in blackface. Julie's songs are highlighted, but the question is about the original portrayal. Since the answer must be Queenie, but the question links to the re-orchestrated songs, perhaps Julie is the answer. Wait, the article says Dan Schlosberg orchestrated the score, so maybe all songs are his work, but the question specifies the character's songs. Since Julie's songs are highlighted, perhaps the answer is Julie. But the original portrayal in blackface was Queenie. Hmm, conflicting info. The article says "the character of Queenie, a riverboat cook, was originally played by a white actor in blackface". So the answer is Queenie, but the question also requires that their songs were re-orchestrated. The article mentions Julie's songs being highlighted, so maybe the answer is Julie. But the question says "originally portrayed by a white actor in blackface". Since Queenie was the one in blackface, but her songs aren't highlighted, maybe the answer is Queenie, but the question links to the re-orchestrated songs. The question might have a mistake, but according to the text, Queenie was in blackface, but the songs re-orchestrated for Julie are the ones mentioned. So perhaps the answer is Julie, even though she wasn't necessarily played in blackface. Alternatively, maybe the article says Julie was passing as white, implying that in the original she was played by a white actor, so that counts as blackface? Not sure. The article says "the mixed-race star of the showboat who has been passing as white". So in the original, Julie would have been played by a white actor in blackface, since she's passing as white. Wait, no—if she's passing as white, then in the original production, she would be played by a white actor (not in blackface), but that contradicts her being mixed race. Alternatively, maybe she was played in blackface to appear as mixed race. This is confusing. The article clearly states that Queenie was in blackface. Julie's role might have been played by a white actor passing as white, but that's not blackface. Hmm. I think the answer is Queenie, but the question also requires that the songs were re-orchestrated. Since Julie's songs are mentioned, maybe the answer is Julie. I'm a bit stuck here, but I'll go with Queenie for the original blackface, but maybe the question wants Julie because her songs are highlighted. Wait the question says "originally portrayed by a white actor in blackface in the 1927 premiere?" so Queenie is correct. But the songs re-orchestrated are Julie's. So maybe the answer is N/A? Or perhaps the question is mixing up, but based on the text, the character in blackface is Queenie, so answer is Queenie.

4. The fourth question: Theatrical element used by Caroline Fermin to critique the original, also used by Blue Man Group in their farewell. The article mentions Caroline Fermin's choreography "feels fresh without needing to build an argument against the original". The Blue Man Group's farewell is mentioned in a separate section, noting they had a drumming gig in "Arrested Development". The article says Fermin's choreography doesn't build an argument against the original, implying it critiques without being direct. The Blue Man Group's performance might have used something like drumming or multimedia. The question is about a theatrical element used by both. The article says Fermin's choreography is fresh without argument, so maybe the element is choreography. But the Blue Man Group's farewell isn't detailed beyond drumming. Alternatively, maybe multimedia or something else. Since the article doesn't explicitly state the element used by both, this might be N/A. Alternatively, the question might refer to "choreography" but the Blue Man Group's part mentions drumming. Hmm, not sure. The answer might be N/A.

5. Fifth question: What genre, mentioned as being part of Kern's score, was central in Idina Menzel's "Redwood". The article says Kern's score appropriates "Mitteleuropean operetta, symphonic doom, folk song, jazz, vaudeville". The article mentions Idina Menzel in "Redwood" climbing conifers. The genre in common is folk song. So the answer is folk song.

6. Sixth question: Besides "Ol' Man River", what song did Alvin Crawford sing? The article says "the dockworker Joe (Alvin Crawford) gets to rumble the anthemic 'Ol' Man River'." There's no mention of another song he sang. So N/A? Wait, the article says "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man" and "Bill" are for Julie. Maybe Alvin's character Joe sings another song? The article doesn't mention another song. So answer N/A.

7. Seventh question: What object used by actors to signify race was designed by Dina El-Aziz, who also did the set? The article says Dina El-Aziz's costumes do more to identify types than individuals. The sashes are used to signify race. The set was by Kaye Voyce. Wait, the question says Dina El-Aziz designed the object. The sashes are part of the costumes, so Dina designed them. The object is the sash. So answer is sash.

8. Eighth question: What year did Jesse Green attend the Under the Radar festival where he saw Jimmy Fallon's Broadway debut? The article mentions the 2025 Under the Radar festival for "Show/Boat". Another section mentions Jimmy Fallon's debut in the new play "All In". The article doesn't link the festival year to Fallon's performance. So N/A.

9. Ninth question: What aspect of the original's incoherence was a challenge for Marek Janowski? The article says the original "Show Boat" had incoherence in its story. The section about Marek Janowski says he gave up hope to conduct the NY Philharmonic but they came knocking. The challenge for him isn't linked to "Show Boat's" incoherence. So N/A.

10. Tenth question: What song rewritten to include "Dumisa" was originally intended for Magnolia in Ferber's novel? The article says the rewrite of "In Dahomey" at the Chicago World's Fair included "Dumisa". The original song was part of the 1893 fair scene. The article says "the song 'In Dahomey,' sung by faux-African performers at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, queasy minstrelsy with a real African folk song 'Dumisa'". The original song was "In Dahomey", which was rewritten. The question asks what song was originally intended for Magnolia. The article doesn't say Magnolia sang "In Dahomey". Magnolia's songs include "colored" songs for white audiences, like "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man" (but that's Julie's). Maybe the answer is "In Dahomey", but it's the one rewritten. The question says "originally intended to be sung by Magnolia according to Ferber's novel". The article doesn't mention Magnolia singing that, so N/A.

11. Eleventh question: Which item signifies reversal of racial roles despite original connotation? The sash with "WHITE" was used to signify that the character is white, making white the exception. The original used blackface for Queenie, so the sash reverses the racial lens. The answer is the sash.

12. Twelfth question: Which central character is hard to identify due to design choices? The article mentions Magnolia's costume makes her hard to identify because "Dina El-Aziz's partly deconstructed costumes do more to identify types than individuals, I kept losing Magnolia... in the mix." So answer is Magnolia.

13. Thirteenth question: What opening word replaced an originally problematic term? The article says "the first word you hear in 'Show/Boat' is 'Listen' instead of the N-word." So answer is Listen.

14. Fourteenth question: Whose work is celebrated for blending operetta, folk, jazz? The article says Kern's score "appropriates Mitteleuropean operetta, symphonic doom, folk song, jazz, vaudeville". So answer is Kern.

15. Fifteenth question: Which part led by Captain Andy is criticized for poor acting? The article says "the riverboat shows hosted by Captain Andy are so deliberately poorly acted". So answer is the riverboat shows.

16. Sixteenth question: Which performer noted for a drumming role over 34 years is highlighted? The article mentions Blue Man Group's farewell, noting Fred Armisen had a drumming gig in "Arrested Development". So the answer is Blue Man Group.

17. Seventeenth question: Which garment causes disorientation? The sashes are mentioned as slipping off, and the costumes contribute to confusion. The sash is the garment. Answer is sash.

18. Eighteenth question: Who is the lead theater critic? The article says Jesse Green is the chief theater critic for The Times. So answer is Jesse Green.

19. Nineteenth question: Which African folk song replaced a troubling piece? The article mentions "Dumisa" replacing the minstrelsy of "In Dahomey". So answer is Dumisa.

20. Twentieth question: Which actress's role becomes hard to follow? Magnolia, as mentioned in question 12. The article says "I kept losing Magnolia... in the mix". So answer is Rebbekah Vega-Romero.
