Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions beyond that. Let me start by reading through each question and then scanning the article for the answer.

1. **Question 1:** Which Russian oil producer did the Biden administration specifically target with sanctions due to its involvement in funding military equipment purchases through Gazprombank?

Looking at the article, there's a part that says: "In late November, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Russia's Gazprombank, a major financial institution that is a conduit for Russian energy payments and the purchase of military equipment that Moscow uses in Ukraine." But the question is about an oil producer. Wait, the sanctions also target Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas. The article says: "They also blacklist two leading Russian oil producers, Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, and their subsidiaries." The question specifies involvement with Gazprombank's military funding. Since Gazprombank is the financial institution, maybe the oil producers are separate. The question links the oil producer to Gazprombank's role in military purchases. Since the article mentions Gazprombank is used for military equipment purchases, but the oil producers are targeted in the sanctions, but the question is which one is linked to that specific reason. The article doesn't explicitly connect Gazprom Neft or Surgutneftegas directly to the Gazprombank's military funding. The answer might be N/A here because the oil producers are targeted for other reasons, and Gazprombank itself is the conduit. Wait, the question is asking for an oil producer targeted "due to its involvement in funding..." through Gazprombank. Since the oil producers are sanctioned but the article doesn't explicitly state they used Gazprombank for that, maybe N/A. But maybe the answer is Gazprom Neft? Let me check again. The sanctions target Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas as oil producers, but the reason for their sanction isn't directly tied to the military equipment part. The Gazprombank part is separate. So perhaps the answer is N/A here. Wait, the question might be a trick because the oil producers are targeted in the sanctions package, but the specific reason about Gazprombank's role in military purchases is about Gazprombank itself, not the oil companies. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many billions of dollars per month did Treasury Secretary Yellen state the new sanctions package would cost Russia's economy?

The article states: "The Biden administration said this will substantially undermine Russia's oil revenues and cost the Russian economy billions of dollars per month." But it doesn't specify an exact number. So the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** What was the primary reason cited by Daleep Singh for the administration's delay in implementing these energy sector sanctions until after Trump's election victory?

The article says: "Daleep Singh... said it was a 'fair question' to ask why Mr. Biden waited until the end of the administration to impose such sanctions. 'For sanctions to be successful, they must be sustainable,' Mr. Singh said in a statement. 'That doesn't mean they should be costless -- sanctions never are -- but to succeed they must impact the target more than they damage the U.S. and global economy.'" The primary reason given is that sanctions must be sustainable and not damage the US/global economy more than Russia. So the answer is "sanctions must be sustainable" or similar. The exact wording? The primary reason is that sanctions must be sustainable and impact the target more than the US and global economy. The answer is "to ensure sanctions impact the target more than the U.S. and global economy" but the question asks for the primary reason cited. The first part of Singh's statement is about sustainability, so maybe the answer is "to ensure sanctions are sustainable" but the exact quote is "For sanctions to be successful, they must be sustainable..." So the primary reason is "sanctions must be sustainable" or "sustainability of sanctions". The answer should be "sanctions must be sustainable".

4. **Question 4:** According to the IMF projections mentioned in the article, what percentage decline in Russia's GDP growth rate occurred between 2024 and 2025?

The article states: "The Russian economy is expected to grow 1.3 percent next year, according to the International Monetary Fund, down from 3.6 percent in 2024." So from 3.6% in 2024 to 1.3% in 2025. The decline is 3.6 - 1.3 = 2.3 percentage points. But the question asks for the percentage decline in the growth rate. The growth rate decreased from 3.6% to 1.3%, so the decline is 3.6 - 1.3 = 2.3 percentage points. However, the question asks for the percentage decline, which might mean the relative decrease. (2.3 / 3.6)*100 ≈ 63.9%, but that's not the way growth rates are usually presented. The article says "down from 3.6 percent in 2024" to 1.3% next year (assuming next year is 2025). The question is the percentage decline between 2024 and 2025. The answer should be the difference in the growth rates: 3.6% (2024) vs. 1.3% (2025). The decline is 2.3 percentage points. But the question is phrased as "percentage decline", which could be ambiguous. Since the article says "down from 3.6 percent", the answer is the difference: 2.3 percentage points. But the question asks for percentage decline in terms of the rate's decrease. The article doesn't state it as a percentage of the previous rate, just the absolute numbers. Since the question specifies "percentage decline", maybe the answer is N/A because it's a point difference. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the growth rate in 2025 compared to 2024, so the answer is 1.3% (the 2025 growth rate). Wait, no. The question is about the decline between the two years. The answer is the difference between 3.6% and 1.3%, which is 2.3 percentage points. But percentage points are different from percentage. Since the question says "percentage decline", perhaps the correct answer is N/A, but the article states the figures as 3.6 in 2024 and 1.3 in 2025. The percentage decline in growth rate would be (3.6 -1.3)/3.6 *100 ≈ 63.9%, but the article doesn't present it that way. The question might be looking for the absolute difference (2.3 percentage points), but the question says "percentage decline", which is ambiguous. Since the article doesn't state it as a percentage, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "percentage decline in Russia's GDP growth rate occurred between 2024 and 2025". The growth rate in 2024 was 3.6%, and in 2025 it's 1.3%, so the decline is 2.3 percentage points. But the question is about percentage decline, which would be (3.6 - 1.3)/3.6 *100 = 63.89%. But the article doesn't compute that, so maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, the question might be a trick because it's asking for the percentage decline (the new rate is 1.3, which is a decline from 3.6). But the article just gives the numbers; the percentage decline isn't calculated there. So the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "percentage decline in Russia's GDP growth rate occurred between 2024 and 2025?" The growth rate in 2024 was 3.6% and 2025 is 1.3%. The decline in the growth rate is 2.3 percentage points. But percentage decline in terms of the rate's value would be (2.3 /3.6)*100 ≈63.89%, but the article doesn't state that. Since the article only provides the two numbers, the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased as "percentage decline in GDP growth rate", which is the difference in growth rates, so 2.3 percentage points. But the question uses "percentage decline", so maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the actual GDP growth rate for 2025 being 1.3%, which is a decline from 3.6%. But the question is about the percentage decline between the two years' growth rates. Since the article doesn't state it as a percentage of the previous, the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "percentage decline", so maybe they want the percentage points difference, but that's not a percentage. Alternatively, perhaps the question is wrong, so the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "down from 3.6 percent in 2024". So the answer is the 2025 growth rate is 1.3%, which is a decrease of 2.3 percentage points from 3.6%. Since the question asks for the percentage decline in the growth rate, perhaps it's expecting the 1.3% as the 2025 rate, but the question is about the decline between the two years. Maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The question is asking for the percentage decline in the GDP growth rate between 2024 and 2025. The growth rate in 2024 was 3.6%, and in 2025 it's projected to be 1.3%. The decline in the growth rate is 2.3 percentage points. Since the question asks for the percentage decline, perhaps the answer is 2.3 percentage points, but that's not a percentage. The question might be phrased incorrectly, so the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is looking for the 1.3% as the 2025 rate, but that's not a decline. Hmm. Maybe I need to check the exact wording again. The article states: "The Russian economy is expected to grow 1.3 percent next year, according to the International Monetary Fund, down from 3.6 percent in 2024." So the 2025 growth rate is 1.3%, down from 3.6% in 2024. The percentage decline in the growth rate would be the difference in the growth rates, but as a percentage of the original? The question says "percentage decline", which is ambiguous. Since the article doesn't provide a percentage calculation, the answer might be N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 2.3 percentage points, but the question says percentage. Hmm, tricky. I'll note this and come back.

5. **Question 5:** Which U.S. state's natural disasters were cited as contributing to the oil price increase on the day of the sanctions announcement?

The article mentions: "Oil prices jumped on Friday ahead of the announcement of the sanctions amid concerns that new restrictions, along with severe weather in the United States and wildfires in California, could constrain global energy supplies." So the state is California, due to wildfires. The answer is California.

6. **Question 6:** What interest rate did Russia's central bank establish to combat the effects of the shadow fleet sanctions?

The article says: "High inflation has prompted the country's central bank to raise benchmark interest rates to 21 percent." The rate is 21%.

7. **Question 7:** How many vessels from Russia's shadow tanker fleet were identified as being involved in circumventing the G7 price cap mechanism?

The article states: "The new sanctions target more than 180 vessels from Russia's fleet of shadow tankers that Moscow has used to evade existing oil sanctions." So the number is over 180, but the question says "identified as being involved". The exact number is "more than 180", so maybe the answer is 180+ but the question might expect the exact figure. Since it's "more than 180", perhaps the answer is N/A because it's not exact. Wait, the question asks how many were identified. The article says "more than 180", so the exact number isn't given. The answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "identified as being involved in circumventing the G7 price cap mechanism". The article says the sanctions target over 180 vessels used to evade existing oil sanctions (which include the G7 price cap). So the answer is "more than 180", but the question asks for a number. Since it's "more than 180", maybe the answer is N/A because it's not an exact number. Alternatively, the question might accept "over 180" but since the answer must be exact, perhaps N/A. Hmm. The article says "more than 180 vessels", so the answer is "more than 180" but the question wants the number. Since it's not exact, maybe N/A. Alternatively, if the question allows approximate, maybe 180, but the article says "more than". So the answer is N/A.

8. **Question 8:** What was the dollar amount of revenue loss predicted by administration officials that would result from closing the banking sector exceptions for Russian energy transactions?

The article mentions: "They limit some of the exceptions that have been in place to allow banks to continue facilitating Russian energy transactions." But there's no specific dollar amount mentioned for the revenue loss from closing these exceptions. So the answer is N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Which month did the ruble reach its lowest value since the start of the Ukraine conflict?

The article states: "The ruble fell in November to its weakest level since the start of the war." So the month is November.

10. **Question 10:** What percentage of Russia's basic foodstuff price increases exceeded the country's overall inflation rate by a factor of three?

The article says: "Russia's annual inflation rate was nearly 10 percent in 2024, with the prices of many basic foodstuffs growing at double or triple that overall figure." The question asks for the percentage of foodstuffs where the increase was triple the overall rate. However, the article says "many basic foodstuffs growing at double or triple that overall figure." It doesn't specify the percentage of such items, just that some were double or triple. The question asks "what percentage of Russia's basic foodstuff price increases exceeded... by a factor of three?" Since it's not stated how many, the answer is N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Which Russian financial institution sanctioned in late November 2024 was described as facilitating both energy payments for military equipment purchases and transactions related to liquefied natural gas projects?

The article mentions: "In late November, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Russia's Gazprombank, a major financial institution that is a conduit for Russian energy payments and the purchase of military equipment that Moscow uses in Ukraine." Additionally, the new sanctions target Russian LNG projects. The question asks which institution was described as facilitating both energy payments for military purchases and LNG transactions. Since Gazprombank is involved in energy payments (which includes LNG projects?) and military equipment purchases, the answer is Gazprombank.

12. **Question 12:** Which two natural disasters in the United States were cited as contributing factors to oil price increases alongside the new sanctions on Russia's shadow fleet?

The article says: "Oil prices jumped on Friday ahead of the announcement of the sanctions amid concerns that new restrictions, along with severe weather in the United States and wildfires in California, could constrain global energy supplies." The two factors are severe weather (in the US) and wildfires in California. But the question asks for two natural disasters. The severe weather is a general term, but maybe it's considered one (severe weather) and wildfires (in California). So the two are "severe weather" and "wildfires in California". But the question asks for the states. The severe weather is in the US, but which state? The article doesn't specify the state for the severe weather. The wildfires are in California. So perhaps the two are severe weather (maybe in Texas or another state?) but the article just says "severe weather in the United States". The question might want the two disasters: severe weather and wildfires. The states would be the US (for severe weather) and California. But the question asks for the states where the disasters occurred. Since severe weather is in the US generally, but not a specific state, maybe the two are "severe weather in the United States" and "wildfires in California". But the question says "which two natural disasters in the U.S. state", so perhaps the two are "severe weather" (but not a state) and "wildfires in California". Since the question asks for the states, the answer is California for wildfires and the other disaster's state isn't specified. Therefore, only California is mentioned as a state. The other is just "severe weather in the U.S.", so maybe the answer is "severe weather" and "wildfires in California", but the question wants the states. Since severe weather's state isn't given, maybe the answer is California for one, and the other is N/A. Wait, the question is "which two natural disasters in the U.S. state(s)", so perhaps the two are severe weather (in the U.S. but unspecified state) and wildfires (in California). Since the question requires two U.S. states, but the severe weather's state isn't specified, the answer might be only California for one, and the other is unknown. Thus, N/A. Alternatively, the question might consider "severe weather" as a disaster in the U.S. (as a country, not a state), so the only state mentioned is California. So the answer would be N/A for the two. Wait, the question says "two natural disasters in the United States", so the two disasters are severe weather (in the U.S. as a whole) and wildfires in California. The states would be the U.S. (for severe weather) and California. But the question asks for the states where the disasters occurred. Since severe weather is a general term for the U.S., maybe the answer is California and another state isn't specified. Therefore, the answer is N/A because only California is specified for wildfires; the other disaster's state isn't given. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the two disasters, not their states. Wait, the question says "which U.S. state's natural disasters" but that might be a typo. Wait, looking at the question again: "Which two natural disasters in the United States were cited as contributing factors..." So the question wants the names of the two disasters, not the states. But the states are part of the question's phrasing. Wait, the exact wording: "Which two natural disasters in the U.S. state's natural disasters..." Hmm, maybe the question is phrased as "Which two natural disasters in the United States..." so the answer is "severe weather" and "wildfires in California". The states for these would be the U.S. (for severe weather) and California (for wildfires). But the question is asking for the disasters, so the answer is "severe weather" and "wildfires in California". But the question might want the states where they occurred. Since severe weather's state isn't specified, perhaps the answer is California (for wildfires) and the other is not a state, so N/A. Alternatively, maybe the severe weather was in Texas or another state, but the article doesn't say. Therefore, the answer is N/A for the second disaster's state. Thus, the answer is only one state (California) and the other is unknown, so N/A. Wait, the question is asking for the two natural disasters, not their locations. The two disasters are severe weather and wildfires. The states are U.S. (general) and California. But the question's wording might be looking for the two disasters by name, so "severe weather" and "wildfires in California". The question might expect those two as the answers. Since the question asks for the disasters, not the states, but the question's phrasing mentions "in the U.S. state's natural disasters", maybe it's a typo and should be "in the United States". The correct answer would then be "severe weather" and "wildfires in California". But the answer needs to be in the format of the question's requirement. Since the question asks "which two natural disasters in the United States...", the answer is the two disasters: severe weather and wildfires in California. The states involved would be the U.S. (for severe weather) and California for the wildfires. But the question might just want the disasters' names. Since the answer must be exact as per the text, the two are "severe weather" and "wildfires in California". However, the answer needs to be in the format of the question's requirement. The question is asking for the two natural disasters, so the answer is "severe weather" and "wildfires in California". But the user wants the answer in a sentence fragment or words. The question is asking for the two disasters, so the answer would list both. Since the user's instruction says to answer with the exact terms from the text, the answer is "severe weather in the United States" and "wildfires in California". But the question says "two natural disasters in the United States", so the two are those. The answer would be both. But the answer needs to be in the format of the user's example, which for question 5 was "California". So for this question, since it's two disasters, but the answer must be in one answer tag, perhaps it's "severe weather and wildfires in California". The article says "severe weather in the United States and wildfires in California". So the two are "severe weather in the United States" and "wildfires in California". The question asks for the two natural disasters, so the answer is both. So the answer is "severe weather and wildfires in California".

13. **Question 13:** What was the exact monthly financial loss projected by the Biden administration for the Russian economy due to the combined impact of sanctions targeting Gazprom Neft, Surgutneftegas, and the shadow fleet's vessels?

The article states: "The Biden administration said this will substantially undermine Russia's oil revenues and cost the Russian economy billions of dollars per month." But no exact figure is given. So the answer is N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Which specific Russian military facility housing migrants with suspected gang affiliations was mentioned in parallel to discussions about enforcing energy sanctions under the Trump administration?

The article says: "The Trump administration is holding 10 migrants with suspected gang affiliations in the same prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba that has housed men accused of being members of Al Qaeda, U.S. defense officials said." So the facility is Guantanamo Bay prison.
