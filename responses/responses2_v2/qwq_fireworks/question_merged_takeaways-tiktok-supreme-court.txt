Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let me start by going through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The user asks which Supreme Court Justice questioned the use of warning labels instead of a ban. Looking back, the article mentions Justice Kagan and Gorsuch were interested in labels. The exact wording says Kagan and Gorsuch stressed that everyone knows China is behind TikTok and suggested labels as a less heavy-handed approach. So the answer should be Kagan and Gorsuch? Wait, but the question specifies "which" singular. Hmm, maybe I need to check again. The text says "Both Justice Kagan and Justice Neil M. Gorsuch... appeared interested in whether the government's interest... could be achieved in a less heavy-handed manner, like appending a label..." So the question is asking for the specific justice. Since it's two, but the question says "which", perhaps the answer includes both? Wait the question says "which Supreme Court Justice specifically questioned..." but the article mentions two. Since the question is singular, maybe it's one of them. Wait, the first part of the sentence says "Justice Elena Kagan, a liberal, asked why TikTok could not just create or buy another algorithm..." but that's a different point. The part about labels is in the next paragraph: "Both Justice Kagan and Justice Neil M. Gorsuch... They appeared interested in whether the government's interest... could be achieved in a less heavy-handed manner, like appending a label..." So the question is asking for the justice who specifically questioned the need for a ban over a label. Since both are mentioned, but the question is singular. Maybe the answer is both, but the instructions say to answer with the exact info. Wait the question is phrased as "which Supreme Court Justice specifically questioned...", so maybe the answer is Kagan and Gorsuch? But the user might expect one. Wait the exact quote says "Justice Elena Kagan, a liberal, asked why TikTok could not just create or buy another algorithm rather than using ByteDance's." Hmm, that's about the algorithm. The labels part comes from the next paragraph where it's both Kagan and Gorsuch. The question is about the labels, so the answer includes both, but since the question is singular, maybe it's both. Wait the question says "specifically questioned whether requiring TikTok to display warning labels...", so the correct answer would be both. But the user wants the answer in a sentence fragment. Let me check the exact wording again. The article states: "Both Justice Kagan and Justice Neil M. Gorsuch... stressed that everybody now knows that China is behind TikTok. They appeared interested in whether the government's interest... could be achieved in a less heavy-handed manner, like appending a label warning users of that risk." So the answer is both Kagan and Gorsuch. But the question is singular. Maybe the user expects both, so the answer would be "Kagan and Gorsuch". I'll go with that.

2. **Question 2:** How many members of ByteDance's board need to be replaced with Americans? The article doesn't mention anything about the board composition. The divestiture requirement is about selling the company, but specifics on board members aren't provided. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The vote count when Congress passed the law. The article doesn't mention the vote count. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Percentage of content moderation team to be replaced. The article says the law doesn't regulate the algorithm or content, so the solicitor general's argument might not mention this. The article says Prelogar stated the law doesn't regulate the content or algorithm, so maybe this is N/A. The question is about her argument's percentage, but there's no info on percentages of the team. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Which Republican senator sponsored the legislation. The article doesn't name the sponsor. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Days requested for extension beyond Jan 19. Francisco asked for a delay to push back the deadline, but the article doesn't specify the number of days. The Trump request was to delay until after Jan 20, so maybe 1 day? But the question is about ByteDance's request. Francisco mentioned pushing back to "simply buy everybody a little breathing space" but no exact days. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Monetary fine per day for missing the deadline. The article doesn't mention fines. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Major American tech company as a buyer for the algorithm. The article says Kagan asked why they couldn't buy another algorithm, but doesn't name a company. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Previous attempts by the government to force the sale. The article mentions Trump's prior stance but no count of attempts. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Minimum percentage of shares to sell to Americans. The law's requirement isn't detailed here. The article says the law requires divestiture, but not the percentage. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Conservative justice concerned about spies via data. The article mentions Brett Kavanaugh focused on data collection leading to spies and blackmail. Yes, so answer is Kavanaugh.

12. **Question 12:** Liberal justice suggesting replacing the algorithm. Kagan asked why they can't buy another algorithm. So Kagan.

13. **Question 13:** Argued against government interest in foreign propaganda. The lawyers were Francisco and Fisher. Francisco said the government has no valid interest in preventing foreign propaganda. So Francisco.

14. **Question 14:** Judge comparing to foreign terrorist groups. The article says Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson compared it to barring association with foreign terrorist groups. So Jackson.

15. **Question 15:** Solicitor General's central aim. Prelogar said the law's aim is to remove foreign control over data and control, not regulate content. So the central aim is to surgically remove foreign control to prevent data access and control. The exact quote: "trying to surgically remove the ability of a foreign adversary nation to get our data and to be able to exercise control over the platform." So answer is to remove foreign control over data and platform.

16. **Question 16:** President-elect asking for delay. The article says Trump asked the Supreme Court to delay until after his inauguration. Answer: Trump.

17. **Question 17:** Deadline mentioned by Francisco. The law's deadline is Jan 19. Francisco said if upheld, TikTok would be banned on that date. So Jan 19.

18. **Question 18:** Signature on the brief for postponement. The brief was signed by Trump's pick, D. John Sauer. So Sauer.

19. **Question 19:** Risk involving espionage networks from data on youth. The article mentions Kavanaugh's point about collecting data on youth to develop spies. So the risk is developing spies/blackmail via data on youth.

20. **Question 20:** Functionality unchanged after divestiture. Prelogar said content could remain the same, the algorithm isn't regulated. So the content displayed by the same algorithm persists. The exact quote: "All of the same speech that's happening on TikTok could happen post-divestiture. The act doesn't regulate that at all. So it's not saying you can't have pro-China speech... It's not regulating the algorithm." So the answer is content moderation or algorithm remains unchanged. The question asks what aspect remains unchanged: the content displayed by the same algorithm. So "the content displayed by the same algorithm persists" or "content moderation team" but the article says the algorithm isn't regulated. The answer is "content displayed by the same algorithm persists".
