Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and answer exactly what's asked. Let's start with the first question.

1. The first question asks which queen's preferences made a lady-in-waiting swap her French hood for an English gable hood. The article mentions Lady Lisle's daughter Anne was sent to serve Jane Seymour, and the text says Jane Seymour preferred English gowns and the gable hood. So the answer is Jane Seymour.

2. The second question is about Lady Lisle's daughter sent with Jane Seymour who later navigated King Henry's favor. The article states Anne was sent with Jane Seymour and later served three more queens, shifting loyalties. So the answer is Anne.

3. The third question asks which sense was compromised by the three-tier headpieces. The text says the headpieces made it hard to see and hear. The first sense mentioned is "see", so the answer is sight.

4. The fourth question refers to Maria de Salinas and the noxious substances in London. The article mentions rotting meat, sewage, and things dumped into ditches. The first one listed is rotting meat, so that's the answer.

5. The fifth question is about the judicial proceeding interrupted during embroidery. The cardinals came to brief Catherine of Aragon on her divorce trial. So the answer is divorce trial.

6. The sixth question asks for the neologism Clark uses regarding reimagining Tudor women. The text says "girlbossification" so that's the term.

7. The seventh question is which daughter served Anne of Cleves during her retirement. The article says Katharine ended up serving Anne of Cleves during her enforced retirement. So Katharine.

8. The eighth question is the lady-in-waiting who lost her head. The text mentions Jane Parker lost her head, so Jane Parker.

9. The ninth question is about the queen with the bad leg needing perfumes. The article states Catherine Parr's husband (Henry VIII) had a leg ulcer, so the answer is Catherine Parr.

10. The tenth question is the handicraft linked to resistance and Catherine of Aragon. The article says embroidery was resistance, and the Duchess's pomegranate (Catherine's symbol) was part of that. So embroidery.
