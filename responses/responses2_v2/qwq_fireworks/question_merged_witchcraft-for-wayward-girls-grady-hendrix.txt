Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked and avoid any assumptions beyond the text. Let me start with the first question.

1. How many botanical names were assigned to the girls at Wellwood House before Holly arrived? The article mentions Fern, Rose, Holly, and Zinnia as the four flowers. But the question is about how many were there before Holly arrived. Wait, the text says "Fern, Rose, Holly and Zinnia are four of the 'flowers' of Wellwood House." Since Holly is one of the four, that means before she arrived, there were three? But maybe Holly was already there when others came. The article doesn't specify the order of arrival. Hmm, the question might be tricky here. The article lists four girls, but unless it specifies Holly's arrival after others, I can't know. So the answer might be N/A.

2. What type of institution similar to Wellwood House did Hendrix write about before? The article mentions "The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires" which deals with routine dismissal of women's experiences. So that's the one. The question is about an institution similar in function. Wellwood House is a place for pregnant girls. The Southern Book Club's book might have a similar institution? The article says "explored the routine dismissal of women's experiences as well (in 'The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires')." So maybe the Southern Book Club's institution is a book club but dealing with vampires. Wait, the question asks for an institution similar to Wellwood House. Wellwood is a home for wayward girls. The other book's institution? The article doesn't specify, but maybe the Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires might involve a book club that's part of a secret society? The question is about institution function similar to Wellwood. Since the article says "explored the routine dismissal of women's experiences as well (in 'The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires')", maybe the institution is a book club that dismisses women's experiences. But the question is about similar function (like Wellwood's function of housing girls). Not sure. Alternatively, maybe "My Best Friend's Exorcism" had a similar setting? The article mentions that Hendrix explored girls' friendships before in that book. But the question asks for an institution similar in function. The answer might be "The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires" because it's mentioned as dealing with dismissal of women's experiences, but the exact institution's type isn't clear. Wait the question is about an institution similar in function to Wellwood House. Wellwood is a private home for pregnant girls. The Southern Book Club's book might involve a different institution. Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A because the article doesn't specify the institution type in the previous books. Hmm.

3. What affliction did the girls fear? The societal warnings mentioned by the author (Hugh Ryan, author of Becoming History) say that continuing their wayward paths would lead to syphilis, sex work, and bastard children. The question asks for the affliction they feared, so syphilis is one. The answer is syphilis.

4. The book given by the librarian is "How to Be a Groovy Witch". The question asks what title of the book details how to harness the power described by Rusty Sabich in "Presumed Guilty". Wait, Rusty Sabich is mentioned in the context of Scott Turow's new book "Presumed Guilty". The article doesn't link Rusty Sabich to the book's content. The book given is "How to Be a Groovy Witch", so the answer is that title. The mention of Rusty Sabich here might be a red herring. So the answer is "How to Be a Groovy Witch".

5. Besides Witchcraft..., what other Hendrix novel explores dismissal of women's experiences? The article says "He's explored the routine dismissal of women's experiences as well (in 'The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires')". So that's the answer.

6. The year of "When Brooklyn Was Queer"? The article only mentions the title and that the author is Hugh Ryan, who wrote that book. There's no year given for that book's setting. The question asks in what year the book "When Brooklyn Was Queer" took place. Wait, the book's title suggests it's about a time when Brooklyn was queer, but the article doesn't specify the time period. So N/A.

7. The weapon metaphorically carved from their own bones? The review says "they must carve their weapons out of their own bones". The question asks what weapon, and it's metaphorical. The answer is "weapons carved from their own bones". But the question also mentions mirroring the traumatic event in Nnedi Okorafor's novel. Since Okorafor's novel is autobiographical about a traumatic event, but the article doesn't specify what that event was, so the answer is the metaphor from the review: "weapons carved from their own bones".

8. What award did the author of the book that inspired the girls' magical inheritance win? The book that inspired them is "How to Be a Groovy Witch" given by the librarian. The article mentions Han Kang's "We Do Not Part" and that she is a Nobel laureate. Wait, the question is about the author of the book that inspired the girls. The book given by the librarian is "How to Be a Groovy Witch", but the article doesn't mention its author. Alternatively, maybe the author of "Witchcraft..." is Hendrix, but the question is about the book that inspired the girls, so the author of that book (the Groovy Witch) would be... not mentioned. Alternatively, the question might refer to Han Kang? Since the review mentions Han Kang as a Nobel laureate. Wait the question says "the author of the book that inspired the girls' magical inheritance". The book that inspired them is "How to Be a Groovy Witch", but its author isn't mentioned. The author of "Witchcraft..." is Hendrix. Alternatively, maybe the librarian's book's author is not mentioned, so N/A. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is "Nobel laureate" because Han Kang is mentioned as a Nobel laureate, but the connection is unclear. Hmm, tricky. Since the question links to Han Kang's "We Do Not Part", which is by a Nobel laureate, but the book that inspired the girls is "How to Be a Groovy Witch". Since the article doesn't say who wrote that book, the answer is N/A.

9. Fern's father's profession? The article mentions Fern's mother's quote but not her father's job. The question refers to "as discussed in the context of the African publishing renaissance". The African publishing section doesn't mention Fern's father. So N/A.

10. Consequence more severe than syphilis upon returning? The societal warnings mentioned syphilis, sex work, and bastard children. The question asks for a consequence more severe than syphilis. The article says "if she was good... it would be like this never happened" but upon returning, maybe the consequence is forced marriage or loss of rights? The article doesn't specify a consequence more severe than syphilis, so N/A.

11. Which character's background is herbal medicine due to their botanical name? The girls have botanical names: Fern, Rose, Holly, Zinnia. Fern's name might relate to herbal uses? Maybe Fern? Or Holly? Not sure, but the article doesn't explicitly state any of them had herbal background, so N/A.

12. Historical event that inspired Wellwood House? The article says Wellwood was created in pre-Roe v. Wade America, so Roe v. Wade was 1973, and the novel is set in 1970. The historical event might be the lead-up to Roe v. Wade, but the article doesn't name a specific event, so N/A.

13. Fifth flower name? The article lists four: Fern, Rose, Holly, Zinnia. The question asks if there's a fifth given later. The article doesn't mention another, so N/A.

14. Librarian's history influencing her decision? The article doesn't mention the librarian's background, so N/A.

15. Which previous Hendrix novel has a cameo from Witchcraft? The article doesn't mention any cameos, so N/A.

16. Ritual to communicate with spirits? The article doesn't describe specific rituals, so N/A.

17. Florida landmark inspiration? The article says Wellwood is in Florida woods but doesn't name a landmark, so N/A.

18. Sequel to "How to Be a Groovy Witch"? The article only mentions that book, no sequel, so N/A.

19. Which character's child has magical abilities? The article mentions the girls have a magical inheritance but doesn't specify which child, so N/A.

20. Timeline parallel with Roe v. Wade and escape? The novel is set in 1970, pre-Roe (1973). The escape might coincide with the Roe decision's timing. The article says "the debate around abortion boils down to..." but doesn't explicitly link their escape to the decision's timeline. So N/A.
