Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I'm only using the article provided and not any outside knowledge. Let me start by going through each question and see what the article says.

1. **Question 1**: Which guitar tech suffered a heart attack while working at the Sphere in Las Vegas but continued performing their duties after recovery?  
   The article mentions Ingo Marte had a heart attack eight years ago and thought about retiring but kept working. Wait, but the question specifies the Sphere in Las Vegas. Wait, Dallas Schoo mentions working at the Sphere in Vegas and the 17 steps. Wait, Ingo Marte's heart attack was before the Sphere mention. Let me check again. Dallas Schoo's work with the Edge includes the Sphere in Vegas. Wait, the article says Schoo worked on the Sphere residency and mentions his heart attack? No, Ingo Marte had the heart attack. The question is about someone who had a heart attack while at the Sphere? The article says Schoo worked at the Sphere and mentions his 17 steps. But the heart attack was Ingo's. So maybe the answer is Ingo Marte? Wait, the question says "while working at the Sphere in Las Vegas" but Ingo's heart attack was before. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says Ingo had a heart attack 8 years ago, but his current job is with hard rock bands. The question links the heart attack to the Sphere work. Since the article doesn't say he had it there, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question might be a trick. Let me check again. Dallas Schoo worked at the Sphere, but the heart attack was Ingo's. So the answer is Ingo Marte? Or N/A? Wait the question says "suffered a heart attack while working at the Sphere in Las Vegas" but Ingo's heart attack was 8 years ago, before that. So maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question might have a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Dallas Schoo? No, the article says Schoo had the 17 steps but not a heart attack. So the answer must be N/A. Wait, but the article says Ingo had a heart attack, but not at the Sphere. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: How many guitars did Betty Cantor-Jackson maintain per show during her tenure with the Grateful Dead?  
   The article mentions Betty worked with the Grateful Dead since 1968 but doesn't specify the number of guitars. It does say Dallas Schoo handles 27 guitars for the Edge. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: What was the primary reason Kevin Dugan cited for transitioning from Van Halen to working with Sammy Hagar?  
   The article says Dugan worked with Michael Anthony (ex-Van Halen) and now Sammy Hagar and Joe Satriani. The reason given was when he wanted to slow down, Michael said he wasn't retiring. But Dugan's transition might be part of Anthony's post-Van Halen work. The article doesn't mention a reason for the transition, just that he's been with Anthony since Carter's presidency. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: During which presidential administration did Dallas Schoo begin his career as the Edge's guitar technician?  
   Dallas Schoo started in the business 52 years ago. Let's see current year is 2023, so 2023 minus 52 is 1971. The Edge joined U2 in 1976? The article says he worked with U2 when they were in clubs. U2 formed in 1976. So Dallas started in 1971, so when was that president? Nixon (1969-1974), so Nixon's administration. The article says he's been with the Edge since U2 was in clubs, so during Nixon or Ford? Let me check: 1976 would be Ford (until 1977). Since he started in 1971, his work with the Edge began when U2 started, so maybe Ford's? But the question is about when he began his career as Edge's tech. The Edge joined U2 in late 70s. The article says Dallas has been with Edge since U2 played clubs and ballrooms. U2 formed in 1976, so that's under Ford. So the answer is Ford's administration? The article says Dallas started 52 years ago, so 1971, but his work with Edge started when U2 was formed in 1976. So the answer is Ford's (1974-1977). So the primary administration would be Gerald Ford. So answer is Gerald Ford's.

5. **Question 5**: What medical condition forced Nitebob to temporarily stop working with Lez Zeppelin before his knee replacements?  
   The article mentions Nitebob had two knee replacements and was recovering. So knee issues. The answer is knee joint replacements or knee problems. The question asks what condition forced him to stop before replacements. The article says he had knee replacements and was recovering, so the condition was knee joint issues. So answer: knee joint replacements? Or the condition was needing replacements, so the answer is knee joint issues. The exact wording: "after two knee joint replacements. He would be doing the same things he has been doing..." So before the replacements, he had knee issues. The article says "knee joint replacements" as the procedure, but the condition is knee problems. The question is what condition forced him to stop before the surgery. The article says "temporarily" but doesn't specify. The answer is knee issues, but the exact term in the article is "knee joint replacements" as the treatment. Hmm. The question asks for the medical condition. The article says he had two knee joint replacements, implying that he had knee problems (like arthritis or injury) that required surgery. The answer should be "knee joint replacements" is the surgery, but the condition is "knee joint issues" or "knee problems". Since the article says he was recovering after the replacements, the condition that forced him to stop would be the need for the replacements, but the article doesn't explicitly state the condition. So maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "after two knee joint replacements. He had been feeling nearly 100 percent." So before the replacements, he had knee issues, but the article doesn't specify the exact condition. So answer is N/A?

Wait, the question is phrased as "medical condition forced Nitebob to temporarily stop working... before his knee replacements". The answer is likely "knee issues" but the article doesn't name the condition. The article says he had knee replacements, but the condition causing him to stop would be the need for surgery, which is due to a medical condition like arthritis, but since it's not stated, perhaps the answer is N/A.

6. **Question 6**: How many steps did Frank Gallagher have to climb each night during the B-52's Las Vegas residency?  
   The article mentions Dallas Schoo had to climb 17 steps at the Sphere in Vegas. Frank Gallagher's work with the B-52's is mentioned but no steps. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: What percentage of Medicare-eligible sound technicians reported experiencing knee or hip issues according to the industry survey mentioned?  
   The article states "knee and hip issues seem especially endemic in the tech industry" but no percentage is given. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: What medical protocol did Ingo Marte follow to continue touring after his heart attack?  
   The article says he had a heart attack and then "picked myself up and I'm still at it." No specific medication or protocol mentioned. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: What was the average length of time these veteran technicians spent setting up equipment before each show?  
   The article doesn't provide specific setup times. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: How many consecutive nights did Lorne Wheaton work during his final tour with Kiss before announcing his retirement?  
    The article mentions his last big gig was the long Kiss farewell tour but doesn't specify the number of nights. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Which live sound engineer's early work included mixing for both the New York Dolls and Steely Dan, later transitioning to an all-female tribute band?  
    Bob Czaykowski (Nitebob) did front of house for New York Dolls, Stooges, Aerosmith, and later worked with Steely Dan's Walter Becker as a guitar tech. Then he moved to Lez Zeppelin, an all-women Led Zeppelin cover band. So the answer is Bob Czaykowski.

12. **Question 12**: Which veteran guitar tech expressed concerns about falling during a Las Vegas residency while managing effects for a guitarist known for using numerous pedals?  
    Dallas Schoo worked with the Edge at the Sphere in Vegas, managing 27 guitars and effects. He mentions the 17 steps and fearing falling. So Dallas Schoo.

13. **Question 13**: Which retired drum tech's final major tour involved a farewell concert series with a band known for elaborate makeup, before focusing on local theater in Toronto?  
    Lorne Wheaton's last gig was the Kiss farewell tour, then retired to do local theater in Toronto. Kiss is known for elaborate makeup. So Lorne Wheaton.

14. **Question 14**: Which female sound engineer's recordings of an iconic band's performances became officially released under a nickname referencing her contributions?  
    Betty Cantor-Jackson recorded Grateful Dead performances known as "The Betty Boards." So Betty Cantor-Jackson.

15. **Question 15**: Which roadie contrasted their 14-hour workdays involving equipment setup with an artist's use of private jets and five-star hotels during the same tour?  
    Kevin Dugan compared his long days to Michael Anthony's easier schedule. The quote: "You come out and do the show... You leave in a limo, go back to the five-star hotel..." So Kevin Dugan.

16. **Question 16**: Which audio technician continued touring despite a serious health incident eight years prior, working primarily with hard rock and heavy metal bands?  
    Ingo Marte had a heart attack 8 years ago but continued working with bands like Danzig. So Ingo Marte.

17. **Question 17**: Which live sound mixer began their career during the Johnson administration, later handling front-of-house for proto-punk bands before joining a jazz-rock group?  
    Bob Czaykowski started 50 years ago. Let's see: current year is 2023, so 1973. Lyndon B. Johnson was president until 1969. So 1973 would be Nixon's term. Wait, the article says he's been in the business for half a century (50 years). If now is 2023, that would start in 1973. Johnson was until 1969, so his career started under Nixon. The question says "during the Johnson administration" which ended in 1969. So maybe N/A? Wait the question might refer to another person. Wait Frank Gallagher started in 1966 (since he'd been in the business 11 years by 1977). Frank started in 1966, so under LBJ (Johnson was president until 1969). He mixed Talking Heads in 1977 (proto-punk?), and later worked with Steely Dan? Wait the article says Frank Gallagher mixed Talking Heads in 1977 and had been in the business 11 years, so started in 1966. Steely Dan's co-leader was Walter Becker, but Czaykowski was his tech. Wait Frank's later work? The article says he did B-52's in Vegas. The question mentions "jazz-rock group" (Steely Dan is jazz-rock). Wait Czaykowski worked with Steely Dan's Walter Becker. So Frank's career started in 1966 (Johnson's term), then later handled proto-punk (Talking Heads) and then jazz-rock? Wait Frank's timeline: started in 1966 (Johnson), then in 1977 (Carter) he was mixing Talking Heads (proto-punk), and later? The B-52's are more new wave. So maybe Frank Gallagher is the answer. The question says "began during Johnson's admin" (1963-69), so Frank started in 1966. Later handled proto-punk (Talking Heads) and then jazz-rock (maybe not). Alternatively, Bob Czaykowski started 50 years ago (to 2023 is 1973, so Nixon), so not Johnson. So Frank is the answer. So the answer is Frank Gallagher.

18. **Question 18**: Which veteran crew member highlighted the lack of senior women in road tech roles due to industry barriers before the 1990s, while still actively working Bay Area gigs?  
    The article mentions that there are fewer senior women because it was rare before late 80s. Betty Cantor-Jackson is noted as a notable exception, working in the Bay Area. So Betty Cantor-Jackson.

19. **Question 19**: Which guitar technician's responsibilities included real-time adjustments to a complex effects chain during performances at a cutting-edge spherical venue?  
    Dallas Schoo worked at the Sphere in Vegas with the Edge, managing 27 guitars and effects in real-time. So Dallas Schoo.
