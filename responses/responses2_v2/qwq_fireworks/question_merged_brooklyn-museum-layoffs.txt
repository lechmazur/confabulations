Okay, I need to answer all 17 questions based solely on the provided article. Let me go through each question one by one and check the article for the answers.

1. **Question 1**: The percentage of the operating budget for employee compensation. The article mentions, "Wages comprise our largest operational line item -- approximately 70% of our operating budget." So the answer is 70%.

2. **Question 2**: The exhibition with a Grammy-winning musician and hip-hop producer. The text says the museum had a show featuring Alicia Keys (Grammy winner) and Swizz Beatz (hip-hop producer). The answer is Alicia Keys and Swizz Beatz's exhibition.

3. **Question 3**: Number laid off in 2020. The article states, "laid off nearly 30 workers at the start of the pandemic." So 30.

4. **Question 4**: The 2026 renovation project unaffected. The article says the museum is on track to begin the 2026 renovation of its Arts of Africa collection. So Arts of Africa collection renovation.

5. **Question 5**: Charges against protesters targeting homes. The text mentions protesters were arrested on hate crime charges. Answer: hate crime charges.

6. **Question 6**: Employee compensation increase over 10 years. The staff meeting mentioned a $17 million increase. So $17 million.

7. **Question 7**: Exhibition reconstructing a Holocaust hiding place. The Anne Frank Secret Annex exhibit at the Center for Jewish History is mentioned. Answer: Anne Frank's Secret Annex.

8. **Question 8**: Recommended adult contribution. The article states a suggested $20. So $20.

9. **Question 9**: Number of employees being laid off (10-13% of workforce). The article says over 40 employees. The exact number given is "more than 40", so the answer is over 40, but the question asks for the number if it's between 10-13%. Since they say "more than 40" which is the exact number, so 40+ but the question might want the number given. Wait the question says "if the reduction was said to represent between 10 and 13 percent of its workforce?" So the answer is over 40, but the exact number given is "more than 40 employees". The question is asking the number reported, so the answer is over 40, but the exact figure is "more than 40", but the question might expect the number as per the article. The article says "cut more than 40 employees", so the answer is over 40, but the question is phrased as "how many total employees were laid off... if the reduction was..." so the answer is over 40. But the question might want the exact number given, which is more than 40. But the question is phrased as "how many total employees were laid off..." so the answer is "more than 40", but since the question requires a number, perhaps the exact figure is "over 40" but the article says "more than 40" so the answer is over 40, but the question might need the number. Wait the question says "how many total employees were laid off during the museum's previous workforce reduction in 2020..." but the current announcement is over 40. Wait the question is about the previous reduction in 2020. Wait, question 3 is about the previous layoffs in 2020 (30 workers). So question 9 is about the current layoffs (over 40). Wait the question 9 says "if the reduction was said to represent between 10 and 13 percent..." which refers to the current announcement. The article states "cut more than 40 employees -- between 10 and 13 percent of its work force". So the number is "more than 40", but the question asks "how many total employees were laid off if the reduction was..." so the answer is over 40. But the exact number given is "more than 40", so the answer is over 40. But the question wants the number reported. The article says "more than 40", so maybe the answer is "more than 40", but the instructions say to use sentence fragments. The question is asking for the number, so "over 40" or "more than 40" but the exact figure isn't specified beyond that. Since the article says "more than 40 employees" as the number being laid off now, but the question is about the current announcement (since it's the same as the first question's info), so the answer is over 40. But the question is phrased as "how many total employees were laid off if the reduction was..." so the answer is "more than 40".

10. **Question 10**: Projected deficit is $10 million.

11. **Question 11**: Minimum percentage salary cuts for leadership. The article says "senior leadership will take salary cuts of 10 to 20 percent". The minimum is 10%.

12. **Question 12**: Fraction of operating budget for wages. The article says "approximately 70%", so 70%.

13. **Question 13**: The component that nearly doubled. The letter mentions "almost doubled its board, increased its endowment". So the board.

14. **Question 14**: Number arrested at the rally. The article states "34 people were arrested" at the pro-Palestinian rally. So 34.

15. **Question 15**: The anniversary celebrated before the cuts. The union mentions 200th anniversary events. So 200th anniversary.

16. **Question 16**: Economic challenge causing increased costs. The article says "inflation has dramatically impacted our operating budget". So inflation.

17. **Question 17**: The 2026 project proceeding. Same as question 4: Arts of Africa collection renovation.

Wait, let me check each again:

1. 70% (from the quote about wages being 70% of the budget)
2. Alicia Keys and Swizz Beatz's exhibition (the text says "show featuring the art collection of Alicia Keys and Swizz Beatz")
3. 30 (the 2020 layoffs were nearly 30)
4. Arts of Africa collection renovation
5. hate crime charges (the protesters who vandalized homes were charged with hate crimes)
6. $17 million (over 10 years)
7. Anne Frank's Secret Annex
8. $20
9. more than 40 (the current layoffs are over 40, so the answer is over 40, but the question says "how many total employees were laid off if the reduction was..." which refers to the current announcement. The article says "more than 40 employees" so the answer is "more than 40" but the question wants a number. Since it's "more than 40", maybe just 40+ but the exact number isn't given beyond that. The question might require the exact figure given, which is "more than 40", so answer "over 40" but the instructions say to prefer sentence fragments. So "over 40" is acceptable. But the question asks "how many total employees were laid off if the reduction was..." so the answer is "more than 40", but the article states "more than 40 employees" so the answer is over 40. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the current announcement (the answer is over 40), but the question's wording might be tricky. Since the question is asking for the number laid off in the current announcement (since it refers to the reduction between 10-13%), the answer is "over 40" but the exact number is "more than 40" which can be written as "over 40".

10. $10 million (the deficit)
11. 10% (minimum of 10-20% cuts)
12. 70% (same as question 1)
13. board (the board nearly doubled)
14. 34
15. 200th anniversary
16. inflation
17. Arts of Africa collection renovation

I think that covers all. Let me check each question again to ensure none are missed and answers are correct.
