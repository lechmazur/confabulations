Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one, making sure to use only the information from the provided article. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then look back at the article for the answers. I have to be precise and avoid any assumptions beyond what's written.

1. **Question 1:** The title of the Fields Institute director's presentation using a theorem-proving program. The article mentions Deirdre Haskell, the director, plans to use a theorem-proving program to create a textbook-like collection. But the question asks for the title of her presentation. Looking through the text, I see she was part of the session on mathematics and the arts, but the specific title isn't given. The closest is Susan Goldstine's "Poincare Blues" project, but that's not hers. So maybe N/A?

Wait, actually, the article says Dr. Haskell plans to use the program but doesn't mention the title of her presentation. The answer might be N/A here.

2. **Question 2:** Number of ways to draw seven circles. The article states Jon Wild discussed arrangements of circles. The numbers given are for 1-5 circles: 1, 3, 14, 173, 16,951. For five circles, it's 16,951. The question asks for seven circles. The article says the enumeration for six is "yet to be computed." So seven isn't mentioned either. Answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Material of "Hyperbolic Helicoid" sculpture at Booth 337. The article says Robert Fathauer contributed two ceramic sculptures: "Hyperbolic Helicoid" and "Cubic Squeeze". So the material is ceramic.

4. **Question 4:** Year Elbert Frank Cox received his Ph.D. The documentary mentions Dr. Houston noted the 2025 premiere coincides with the 100th anniversary of Cox's Ph.D. in 1925. So 1925.

5. **Question 5:** Name of the Microsoft engineering manager. The mini math festival had a participant named Aleksandra Upton, and her mother is Karolina Sarnowska-Upton, who works at Microsoft. So her name is Karolina Sarnowska-Upton.

6. **Question 6:** Triangle type in "Cauchy Conundrum" skirt. Wait, the article says Susan Goldstine's project was "Poincare Blues" using 30-45-90 triangles. The question mentions "Cauchy Conundrum" which isn't in the text. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Sum in Max Bill's 4x4 magic square. The article says Barry Cipra analyzed a 3x3 magic square where the sum is 15. The question asks for 4x4. The text only mentions 3x3 and 5x5 as examples, but doesn't give the 4x4 sum. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Keynote lecture title by Google's AI chief. The article says Yann LeCun, Meta's chief, gave the lecture titled "Mathematical Obstacles on the Way to Human-Level A.I." The question mentions Google, but he's at Meta. So the answer would be N/A because the question has an incorrect premise (Google instead of Meta).

9. **Question 9:** Undergraduate from UNC Greensboro. The article mentions Kenny Banks from UNC Greensboro who regretted not attending AI talks. So his name is Kenny Banks.

10. **Question 10:** Award-winning artwork with vector graphics on Android. The article lists "Twisted" and "Untwisted" by Rashmi Sunder-Raj using iPad (not Android). Since Android isn't mentioned, the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "vector graphics app on an iPad," so Android isn't there. Thus N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Artwork inspired by same pattern as Goldstine's skirt. Goldstine used Poincare disk model with 30-45-90 triangles. The article mentions Shiying Dong's "Saddle Monster" as an award winner, which might use hyperbolic geometry. Since the question asks which artwork shares the same pattern, it would be "Saddle Monster".

12. **Question 12:** Sides of "Cubic Squeeze" sculpture. Fathauer's sculptures are ceramic. The dice he sold include 60-sided, but the sculpture's sides aren't specified. The name "Cubic Squeeze" might imply a cube (6 sides), but the article doesn't state. So N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Theorem-proving program referenced in Barry Cipra's talk. The talk was about Max Bill's painting and magic squares. The article doesn't mention any specific theorem-proving program here. So N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Centennial anniversary figure in the documentary. The documentary mentions Elbert Frank Cox's 1925 Ph.D., and 2025 is the 100th anniversary. So the answer is Elbert Frank Cox.

15. **Question 15:** Exhibitor's product with tiling like "Saddle Monster". "Saddle Monster" uses hyperbolic tiling. The article mentions Fathauer's ceramic sculptures and his booth had dice, but no other product's tiling is mentioned. N/A unless another artwork's pattern is referenced elsewhere. Since the question asks for an exhibitor's product, maybe not. So N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Total pips in 5x5 magic square. The 3x3 had each row/column/diagonal with 5 pips. The question asks for 5x5. The article says it's "far from clear what the answer is" so no number is given. Thus N/A.

17. **Question 17:** Combined attendance for LeCun's lecture and the festival. The article states 5,444 mathematicians and 3,272 talks. But attendance for specific events isn't given. So N/A.
