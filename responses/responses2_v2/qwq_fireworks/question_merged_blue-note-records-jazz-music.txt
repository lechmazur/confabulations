Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to make sure I answer each exactly as per the instructions, only using the article as my source.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions a blizzard in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where a 19-year-old heard Wayne Shorter's "Speak No Evil." The track was part of Wayne Shorter's album, so the artist is Wayne Shorter.

2. **Question 2:** The text doesn't mention Rudy Van Gelder spending consecutive days recording the catalog. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The article says Alfred Lion first recorded Meade Lux Lewis and Albert Ammons after visiting Cafe Society, so that's the club.

4. **Question 4:** The Lee Morgan track "Party Time" features Herbie Hancock and Bobby Hutcherson. But was it a hit single on Billboard's R&B charts? The article says it's a "loose, grooving song," but no mention of R&B charts. Maybe N/A?

Wait, the question says "hit single on Billboard's R&B charts." The article mentions "The Sidewinder" as a pop hit, so maybe that's the track. But the question asks for an album with both Herbie and Bobby. "The Procrastinator" is the album, but the hit single would be "The Sidewinder." The question is about the album with both, so maybe "The Procrastinator"? But the answer might be "The Sidewinder" is the track, but the album is "The Procrastinator." The question asks for the album. Hmm. The article says "The Procrastinator" had the session with those sidemen, but the hit single is "The Sidewinder" from another album. So maybe N/A here?

5. **Question 5:** The article mentions Van Gelder's engineering, but no specific technique for Art Blakey's drums. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The article doesn't mention Reid Miles designing a cover after a coffee shop encounter. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The acoustic treatment's secret ingredient isn't mentioned. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** No mention of a "Ghost" musician. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The original title of "Speak No Evil" isn't stated. The article says it's a Blue Note masterpiece but no original title. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The article doesn't mention an album recorded in reverse order. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The track by Art Blakey arranged by Freddie Hubbard with a comment like "Blow your horn!" is "Pensativa." The article says that's the track with Wayne Shorter's melodic solo and Blakey's comment.

12. **Question 12:** The live album with Sonny Rollins, Wilbur Ware, and Elvin Jones is "A Night at the Village Vanguard."

13. **Question 13:** The track with vibraphone and harp intro by Madlib is "Please Set Me at Ease" from the article's Madlib section.

14. **Question 14:** Lee Morgan's "Party Time" is described as loose, grooving with opaque solos, so that's the track.

15. **Question 15:** Rachelle Ferrell's "Autumn Leaves" is the track redefining songs.

16. **Question 16:** The composition that restored the dropout's sense is "Speak No Evil" by Wayne Shorter.

17. **Question 17:** Robert Glasper's "Afro Blue" is the track with the black box metaphor and Afro-Blue rhythms.

18. **Question 18:** Bobby Hutcherson's "Medina" was unreleased until 1980 after 1969.

19. **Question 19:** Clifford's version of "Brown Skinned Girl" from the film "Easy Living."

20. **Question 20:** Grant Green's "Maybe Tomorrow" arranged and later sampled by Kendrick Lamar.

Now, verifying each against the article:

- For question 4, the album "The Procrastinator" includes Herbie and Bobby, but the hit single might not be on Billboard R&B. The article mentions "The Sidewinder" as a pop hit, but that's Lee Morgan's other album. So answer N/A here?

Wait, the question asks for the album that has both Herbie and Bobby and became a hit on R&B charts. Since "The Procrastinator" wasn't released until a decade later, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe "The Sidewinder" is the track, but the album with both artists is "The Procrastinator." Since the question specifies the album, and the hit single isn't on that album, it's N/A.

Proceeding with that in mind.
