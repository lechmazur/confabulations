Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer strictly based on that.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions an averted strike at East and Gulf Coast ports. The specific ports aren't named, just the regions. So the answer is N/A because no East Coast ports are specifically mentioned.

2. **Question 2**: Trump's tariffs on Mexico/Canada are 25%, and the China tariffs are 10%. The difference is 15 percentage points. That's straightforward.

3. **Question 3**: Howard Lutnick suggested tariffs might reduce if Canada and Mexico do more to address Trump's complaints. The primary reason is their addressing complaints.

4. **Question 4**: The article says "auto operations that straddle the U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada" but doesn't name specific manufacturers. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Jason Miller talked about costs of inventory storage deterring companies, but there's no percentage given for warehouse costs. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Adam Lewis didn't mention needing more staff. He said they could handle it manually. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The article says container volumes through ports have been strong but doesn't give exact percentages for 2024. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The text says brokers might need to update software but doesn't specify which. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Larry Gross mentioned regulatory data on trains not running due to crews or locomotives, but no percentage given. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The article mentions shipping costs skyrocketed in 2021-2022 but doesn't provide exact numbers. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Larry Gross said the network is better positioned than post-pandemic. Wait, no, the quote is from Scott Shannon: "The industry's probably never been in a better spot..." So the answer is Scott Shannon.

12. **Question 12**: The president who imposed the 25% tariff is Trump. The question asks which official, so Trump.

13. **Question 13**: The trade pact is the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) mentioned in 2020. The article says "U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement", so that's the answer.

14. **Question 14**: Jason Miller is the academic who noted inventory storage costs. Correct.

15. **Question 15**: The 10% tariff is on China's imports. The article says "impose 10 percent tariffs on Chinese goods".

16. **Question 16**: The countries are Mexico and Canada. The question asks which, alongside Canada, so Mexico.

17. **Question 17**: Scott Shannon from C.H. Robinson made the comment about handling changes. Correct.

18. **Question 18**: Howard Lutnick, the Commerce nominee, suggested tariffs might be reduced. Correct.

19. **Question 19**: Adam Lewis from Clearit said it's business as usual. Correct.

Wait, let me double-check each:

For question 11, the exact quote: "the network is far better positioned today than it was at the beginning of the post-pandemic surge" was from Larry Gross? Wait, no. Let me check the text again.

Looking back: Larry Gross said, "But the network is far better positioned today than it was at the beginning of the post-pandemic surge." Wait, no, actually the quote is from Larry Gross? Wait, the article says:

Larry Gross... said the transportation of shipping containers by rail was up 10 percent... But while efforts to bring in goods before tariffs very likely contributed to the increase, he said, other factors also played a role... "Every system has its limitations," Mr. Gross said, "But the network is far better positioned today than it was at the beginning of the post-pandemic surge." 

Wait, so the answer to question 11 is Larry Gross. Wait, but earlier I thought Scott Shannon said the industry was in a better spot. Let me check:

Scott Shannon's quote: "The industry's probably never been in a better spot to deal with significant changes in the marketplace," said Scott Shannon...

Ah, so Scott Shannon's quote is about the industry's position. Larry Gross's quote is about the network. The question 11 asks which expert said the network is better positioned. The exact wording in the question is: "which expert asserted that the network is now far better positioned than during the post-pandemic surge?" That's Larry Gross's quote. So I made a mistake earlier. So answer for 11 is Larry Gross.

Similarly, question 17 asks who from a freight forwarder noted the industry is well-equipped. That was Scott Shannon, as his quote mentions being in a better spot. The question says "handling marketplace changes" so Scott Shannon is correct for 17.

So correcting:

11. Larry Gross

17. Scott Shannon

That's an important correction. Let me adjust those answers accordingly.
