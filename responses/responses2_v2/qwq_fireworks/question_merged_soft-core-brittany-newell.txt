merged_soft-core-brittany-newell.txt
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and not any outside knowledge. Let's go step by step.

1. **Question 1:** The perfume Ruth stole from the new girl. The article mentions Ruth's signature scent is called "Soft Core," but the new girl stole her scent. Wait, actually, the text says, "A new girl at the club became mysteriously attached to her, even stealing her signature scent: 'It was called Soft Core...'" So Ruth's scent was stolen by the new girl. The question asks what perfume Ruth stole, but the article says the new girl stole Ruth's perfume. Hmm, maybe I misread. Wait, the wording is "stealing her signature scent," so the new girl took Ruth's scent. Therefore, the answer should be "Soft Core." But the question says Ruth stole from the new girl. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me check again. The text: "A new girl at the club became mysteriously attached to her, even stealing her signature scent: 'It was called Soft Core...'" So the new girl stole Ruth's scent. The question is asking what Ruth stole from the new girl. But according to the text, it's the other way around. So this would be N/A? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The question says "mirroring the novel's exploration of fragmented identities"â€”maybe it's a trick, but the article states the new girl stole Ruth's scent. So the answer is N/A because Ruth didn't steal from the new girl. Wait, the question is phrased as "What was the name of the perfume Ruth stole from the new girl..." but according to the text, it's the new girl who stole Ruth's perfume. Therefore, the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many novels has Brittany Newell written, including "Soft Core"? The article says she has one other novel, "Oola." So including "Soft Core," that's two novels. The answer is 2.

3. **Question 3:** The city where Ruth's ex-boyfriend (Dino) resides. The article states Ruth lives in San Francisco in a Victorian house with her ex, who is a ketamine dealer. So the city is San Francisco.

4. **Question 4:** The scent from Dino's last meal. The text says, "The scent of her ex-boyfriend's last meal, 'mashed plantains, garlic rice, some sort of stewed beef,' lingered after he disappears." Wait, the question is about the lingering presence of the past. The scent left behind is from Dino's last meal: mashed plantains, etc. But the question asks for the specific scent, like "mashed plantains..." but the answer needs to be exact. The article lists "mashed plantains, garlic rice, some sort of stewed beef." The exact wording is "mashed plantains, garlic rice, some sort of stewed beef." So the answer is that scent.

5. **Question 5:** The email address used by the mysterious correspondent. The article mentions "Anonymous emails arrive from the address nobody.is.home@protonmail.com." So the email address is nobody.is.home@protonmail.com.

6. **Question 6:** Vehicle Dino uses for ketamine deliveries. The article doesn't mention any vehicle. It just says Dino is a ketamine dealer but doesn't specify the vehicle. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** TV show Ruth watches. The article says, "in bed watching 'Sex and the City' while eating beans and leftover tiramisu." So the answer is Sex and the City.

8. **Question 8:** Flavor of Fruit Roll-Ups. The article says, "Her house smelled like Fruit Roll-Ups," but doesn't specify the flavor. So the answer is Fruit Roll-Ups, but the question asks for the flavor. Since it's not specified, N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Title of Brittany Newell's first novel. The article says she has another novel besides "Soft Core," which is "Oola." So the first one is "Oola."

10. **Question 10:** Tangible object symbolizing Ruth's metamorphosis. The article mentions Ruth's perfume "Soft Core" as a symbol. Alternatively, maybe the Victorian house, but the perfume is tied to her identity. The article says "the scent of her ex's last meal lingered," but that's more about the past. The perfume she uses as her identity (Baby/Sunday) might be the symbol. The answer would be "Soft Core" perfume.

11. **Question 11:** Building characteristic mirroring order/disarray. The article mentions "the specific draftiness of tall Victorian houses" and "oppressive silence of richer neighborhoods." The tension between order and disarray might be the draftiness versus the silence. But the question asks for a characteristic of buildings. The Victorian houses' draftiness could symbolize disarray, while their structure represents order? The text says "San Francisco in three dimensions... what lies behind the pink neon strip club signs... the specific draftiness of tall Victorian houses and the oppressive silence..." The draftiness might be part of the disarray. The answer is "draftiness of tall Victorian houses."

12. **Question 12:** Numerical age for self-reckoning. The text says "the differences between being 24 and 27 are stark... 'It was crazy how much could happen to a girl in three years,' she thinks." The pivot age mentioned is 24 and 27, but the question asks for a single numerical age. Maybe 27? Or the span is 24-27, but the question says "pivot of self-reckoning" could be 27. The question says "when Ruth contemplates the whirlwind of her twenties, which single numerical age is highlighted..." The text says "at 27... being 24 and 27 are stark... 'It was crazy how much could happen to a girl in three years.'" The age that's the current point is 27, so maybe 27 is the answer.

13. **Question 13:** Person whose disappearance leaves aromatic memories. The ex-boyfriend Dino disappears, and his last meal's scent lingers. So Dino's disappearance leaves the scent. The answer is Dino.

14. **Question 14:** Literary technique for the undergarment simile. The article uses simile when comparing life to "favorite panties with the elastic stretched out." The technique is simile.

15. **Question 15:** Email domain in the enigmatic address. The email is nobody.is.home@protonmail.com, so the domain is protonmail.com.

16. **Question 16:** Nighttime atmosphere's darker undertones. The article mentions "oppressive silence of richer neighborhoods at night" as part of San Francisco's atmosphere. So "oppressive silence in richer neighborhoods at night."

17. **Question 17:** Page count of the novel. The article states "352 pp." So the answer is 352.

18. **Question 18:** Span in years for profound changes. The text says "the differences between being 24 and 27 are stark... 'It was crazy how much could happen to a girl in three years.'" The span is 3 years.

19. **Question 19:** Online handle fragment. The email address is nobody.is.home@protonmail.com, so the handle fragment is "nobody.is.home".

Wait, let me verify each again quickly.

1. The perfume stolen by the new girl from Ruth is Soft Core. The question says Ruth stole it, but according to the text, the new girl stole Ruth's scent. So the answer should be N/A because the question's premise is reversed. The user instructions say if the question's premise is incorrect, answer N/A. So question 1: N/A.

2. Two novels: Soft Core and Oola. So 2.

3. San Francisco.

4. The scent left by Dino's last meal: "mashed plantains, garlic rice, some sort of stewed beef." The exact wording is the answer. The question asks for the scent, so that's it.

5. nobody.is.home@protonmail.com.

6. N/A (no vehicle mentioned).

7. Sex and the City.

8. N/A (flavor not specified).

9. Oola.

10. The perfume "Soft Core" as the object, since it's tied to identity shifts.

11. "draftiness of tall Victorian houses" as the building characteristic.

12. The span is 24 to 27, but the question asks for a single age. Wait, the question says "pivot of self-reckoning". The text says "at 27... being 24 and 27 are stark... 'It was crazy how much could happen to a girl in three years.'" So the pivotal age might be 27? Or the span is three years. The question asks for a single numerical age. The answer is 27? Or is it 24? Hmm. The question states "when Ruth contemplates the whirlwind of her twenties, which single numerical age is highlighted..." The exact quote is "I felt my old slut-self returning," but the key is the three years between 24 and 27. The question might want the age where she's reflecting, which is 27. So 27 is the answer.

13. Dino's disappearance leaves the lingering scent. So Dino.

14. The simile comparing life to elastic-stretched panties is the technique: simile.

15. protonmail.com.

16. "oppressive silence in richer neighborhoods at night".

17. 352.

18. The span is three years (from 24 to 27). The question asks for the span in years, so 3.

19. The online handle fragment from the email address is "nobody.is.home".

Wait, question 19 asks for the online handle fragment presented. The email address is "nobody.is.home@protonmail.com", so the handle part (before @) is "nobody.is.home".

Now, let's make sure all answers are correctly inferred from the text without adding anything else.
