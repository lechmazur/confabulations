Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each question exactly as asked.

1. The first question asks about the Roman mining site in northern Spain that produced the highest lead in Greenland ice. The article mentions Rio Tinto in southwestern Spain, not northern. So that's probably the answer, but wait, the question says northern Spain. Since the article specifies Rio Tinto is in southwestern Spain, the answer should be N/A because there's no mention of a northern Spain site. Hmm, but maybe I misread. Let me check again. The article says "southwestern Spain known as Rio Tinto." So northern Spain isn't mentioned. Answer is N/A.

2. The second question is about the percentage of silver production at Rio Tinto. The article says the researchers assumed either all silver came from Rio Tinto or spread across many sites. But there's no specific percentage given. The text mentions the range of lead emissions but not the percentage from Rio Tinto. So N/A.

3. Third question asks the month when lead emissions peaked during Pax Romana. The article doesn't mention any specific month, just the period starting 27 B.C. over two centuries. No month info, so N/A.

4. Fourth question: tons of lead from Middle Eastern territories. The article talks about total emissions but not breakdown by region. Since the territories are part of the empire but no numbers given, N/A.

5. Fifth question: average reduction in cognitive function for elderly Romans in high lead areas. The article mentions lead linked to reduced cognitive functioning in old age but doesn't give a specific number. The IQ decline for children was 2-3 points, but for elderly it's not quantified. So N/A.

6. Sixth question: the formula used to calculate blood lead and IQ. The article says they used modern data correlations but doesn't name a formula. So N/A.

7. Seventh: latitude traveled by lead particles. The ice samples were from Russia and Greenland, but the article doesn't mention how many degrees latitude that is. So N/A.

8. Eighth: ratio of lead emissions between largest and smallest operations. The article doesn't provide this ratio, just that they considered different scenarios (all from Rio Tinto vs spread out). No ratio given, so N/A.

9. Ninth: percentage from Rio Tinto according to Dr. Cory-Slechta. The article says Dr. Cory-Slechta was a neurotoxicologist not involved, and the percentage from Rio Tinto was part of the model assumptions. But the question attributes it to her calculations. Since she didn't do that, N/A.

10. Tenth: Dr. Delile's method. The article mentions his confirmation of lead pollution extent but doesn't say his specific method. The 2014 study was different (water pipes). So N/A.

11. Eleventh: volume of lead in liters. The article gives tons (3,300-4,600 tons/year), but converting to liters isn't possible without density, which isn't provided. So N/A.

12. Twelfth: geoarchaeological technique similar to 2014 study. The 2014 study was on water pipes, but Dr. Lanphear's method isn't mentioned. The article doesn't say, so N/A.

13. Thirteenth: IQ decline correlating with US coal's 16%. The article links coal to 16% of US grid, but that's unrelated to the IQ numbers. The question mixes unrelated data points, so N/A.

14. Fourteenth: the journal's name. The article says the study was in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Yes, that's the answer.

15. Fifteenth: annual lead in kg contributing to US coal units. The article mentions 3,300-4,600 tons annually, which is 3,300,000 to 4,600,000 kg. The US coal part is a distractor. The question says "contributed to the 401 coal units" but that's unrelated. The answer should be 3,300-4,600 tons converted to kg, so 3,300,000 to 4,600,000 kg. But the question asks for the estimated annual lead emission in kg according to Dr. McConnell. The article states 3,300 to 4,600 tons per year. So the answer is 3,300,000 to 4,600,000 kg. Wait, but the question says "what was the estimated annual lead emission, in kilograms" so the answer is 3,300-4,600 tons converted to kg. But the options are either/or? The question says "what was the estimated annual lead emission... according to Dr. McConnell". The article says "anywhere from 3,300 to 4,600 tons of lead were being emitted". So the answer is 3,300 to 4,600 tons, but in kg, so multiply by 1000. The question asks in kilograms, so the answer is 3,300,000 to 4,600,000 kg. But the question might expect the range in tons as given, but converted. However, the user might just take the tons as the answer. Wait, the question specifies "in kilograms", so must convert. But the article's numbers are in tons. Since the user wants the exact answer from the text, and the text says tons, but the question asks for kg, then maybe N/A? Wait, no. The question says "according to the research of Dr. McConnell", so the answer is 3,300-4,600 tons. But the question wants it in kg. Since the article gives tons, but the user wants kg, can I answer the numerical value in kg? The article's exact numbers are in tons, so converting is necessary but allowed as a logical inference. So 3,300,000 to 4,600,000 kg. But the question says "what was the estimated annual lead emission... according to Dr. McConnell". The article says "anywhere from 3,300 to 4,600 tons of lead were being emitted into the atmosphere each year". So the answer in kg is those numbers multiplied by 1000. Since the user wants the answer based on the article, and the article uses tons, but the question asks for kg, I should convert. So answer is 3,300,000 to 4,600,000 kg. But the question might expect just the ton numbers, but the user specified kg. Hmm, but maybe the question is a trick because it's combining with the US coal part. Wait, the question says "contributed to the 401 coal units supplying the U.S. grid?" but the coal part is unrelated. The question is about the lead emission from Roman mining. So the answer is the tonnage converted to kg. But since the article gives the exact numbers in tons, I can write the range in kg. So the answer is 3,300,000 to 4,600,000 kg. But the question might accept the ton numbers as the answer even though it asks for kg? Maybe the user made a mistake, but I have to follow the article. Alternatively, since the article doesn't mention kg, maybe it's N/A. Wait, no, the question is asking for the emission in kg, so the article's ton figures can be converted. Since it's a direct conversion, it's allowed. So answer is 3,300-4,600 tons converted to kg: 3,300,000 to 4,600,000. But the question might just want the ton numbers, but the user specified kg. I'll go with the converted value.

16. Sixteenth: type of coinage causing reduced cognitive function in elderly. The article says the economy relied on silver coinage, so silver coinage is the answer.

17. Seventeenth: increase in lead in infants' blood, mirroring green energy setbacks. The article states children had 2-5 µg/dL more lead. The question mentions "milligrams per liter", which is a different unit. µg/dL is micrograms per deciliter. To convert to mg/L, since 1 dL = 0.1 L, and 1 mg = 1000 µg. So 2 µg/dL = 20 mg/L? Wait, no. Let me calculate: 1 µg/dL = 10 µg/L (since 1 dL is 0.1 L, so per liter it's 10 times higher). So 2 µg/dL is 20 µg/L, which is 0.02 mg/L. The question asks for milligrams per liter, so 0.02 to 0.05 mg/L. But the article says 2-5 µg/dL. The question says "what was the estimated increase in lead, in milligrams per liter...", so converting. The answer would be 0.02 to 0.05 mg/L. But the article doesn't specify the unit conversion, so maybe the question is expecting the µg/dL numbers, but the user wants mg/L. Since the article doesn't provide that conversion, maybe it's N/A. Wait, the question says "according to the atmospheric models used by Dr. McConnell...", and the article states "around 2 to 5 additional micrograms of lead, per deciliter of blood". Since the question asks for milligrams per liter, which is a different unit, but the article doesn't do the conversion, so maybe N/A. Alternatively, since the user wants the answer based on the article, and the article gives µg/dL, but the question asks for mg/L, which is a direct conversion. Since the article's numbers can be converted, perhaps the answer is 0.02 to 0.05 mg/L. But since the article doesn't mention mg/L, maybe it's N/A. Hmm, tricky. The question might be a distractor with the green energy part, but the lead level is given as 2-5 µg/dL. The units are different, so the answer can't be directly taken. Therefore, N/A.

18. Eighteenth: Arctic location mentioned by Dr. Cory-Slechta for ice samples. The article says ice samples were from Russia and Greenland. The question mentions Dr. Deborah Cory-Slechta, but the article states she was a neurotoxicologist not involved in the ice sample part. The location provided by the team (McConnell) is Russia and Greenland, but the question attributes the mention to Dr. Cory-Slechta, who didn't do that. So N/A.
