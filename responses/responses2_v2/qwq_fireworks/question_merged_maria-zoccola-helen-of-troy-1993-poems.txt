Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let's start with the first question.

1. The first question asks which Tennessee city Helen first met Paris in. The article mentions that Sparta, Tenn. is where the story is set. Since in the original myth Paris takes Helen from Sparta, in this reimagining, it's logical that their meeting would be in Sparta, Tenn. So the answer should be Sparta.

2. The second question is about how many episodes of "The Golden Girls" Helen watched. The article says she watches reruns of "Cheers," "The Golden Girls," and "All in the Family" to get a sense of the curse. But it doesn't specify the number of episodes. So N/A.

3. The third question asks for the name of the ballet instructor described as the "dance-class kill squad" leader. The article mentions "the dance-class kill squad" and "plie overlord," but doesn't give a name. So N/A.

4. The fourth question is about which Greek goddess Helen invokes while shopping. The text doesn't mention any specific goddess here, only that she's in Piggly Wiggly with cursive lists. So N/A.

5. The fifth question asks the color of the swan watching Helen. The article refers to "a god who may be the inseminating swan observing his own daughter," but no color is mentioned. N/A.

6. The sixth question is about how many miles to the dry cleaners. The article says she drove "the dress shirts to the dry cleaner" but doesn't specify the distance. The return trip is mentioned as a mile out of town when coming back, but that's different. So N/A.

7. The seventh question: The dandelions are by the roadside with "tins of chaw." The brand is mentioned as "bellsouth's web of silver wires" earlier, but the chewing tobacco brand isn't named. So N/A.

8. Eighth question: Clytemnestra's phone company. The article says Helen talks to Cly via "bellsouth's web of silver wires," so the company is BellSouth.

9. Ninth question: Number of "Cheers" reruns watched. The article mentions she watches reruns but doesn't specify how many times. So N/A.

10. Tenth question: The element juxtaposed with "booze-dark sea." The quote says "one single calendar page of sunshine and bright sand, booze-dark sea..." So the answer is sunshine and bright sand.

11. Eleventh question: The musician named as inspiration for the swan's motif. The article doesn't mention any Nashville musician here. It talks about the swan as a god, not a musician. So N/A.
