Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions F.B.I. agents were involved in the investigation but doesn't name any specific agent who led it. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The text says the Bernsteins bought and resold properties, but there's no specific number mentioned. Answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Julia Parker's friend who witnessed her murder isn't named in the text. The article only mentions her murder wasn't solved. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The article states that Brooklyn prosecutors pursued the cases, but doesn't mention a DA who initially declined. It says Nixon tried to slow the investigation, but no DA's name. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The percentage of homeowners losing properties isn't provided. The article mentions defaults but not exact percentages. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** No specific FHA official is named who noticed irregularities. The text mentions corrupt officials but not an individual. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The article says properties were sold at "five times as much as they'd just paid," which is a 400% markup. So 400%?

Wait, the question is average markup percentage. The example given is five times, which is 400% profit, but markup is the increase over cost. So if they bought for X and sold for 5X, the markup is 400%. But the question asks for average. The article says "sometimes five times," but maybe the average is mentioned? Let me check again. The text says "sometimes five times as much as they'd just paid." Since it's "sometimes," the average isn't specified. So the answer is N/A. The example is given, but the average isn't stated. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The article doesn't mention any civil rights organization filing a lawsuit. It talks about prosecutors and FBI, but not a specific group. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The Nixon administration tried to slow the investigation, but how many officials were convicted? The article doesn't give a number. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The total dollar amount from 1970-1975 isn't provided. The text mentions payouts but no figure. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The year when the federal housing officials were convicted isn't stated. The book is about the 1990s crime spree, but the Nixon obstruction part's conviction date isn't given. N/A.

12. **Question 12:** The high school that became a shooting gallery is mentioned, but the name isn't given. The article just says "local high school." N/A.

13. **Question 13:** The number of homes seized due to the Bernsteins' schemes isn't specified. The text refers to "waves of borrowers" but no exact number. N/A.

14. **Question 14:** The article contrasts the 1970s FHA with the Obama administration's response, but doesn't name a specific program. It mentions "tepidness" but no program name. N/A.

15. **Question 15:** The question refers to Enrich's latest book. The article says his book is about the weaponization of libel law and the campaign against New York Times v. Sullivan. But the question asks which provision was exploited by lenders in 2008. The article doesn't link a specific provision. N/A.

16. **Question 16:** The article states that in 1991, 116 East New Yorkers were murdered, but doesn't mention 1990's numbers. So N/A.

17. **Question 17:** The FHA colluded, but another federal agency? The text doesn't mention another agency. It says "federal housing officials" but not another agency. N/A.

18. **Question 18:** The primary method was persuading families to sell by stoking fears of minorities moving in, and buying decrepit properties. The question asks for the method before 1991. The article states "they persuaded... by stoking fears about the imminent arrival of minorities." So the answer is stoking fears about minorities moving in.

19. **Question 19:** No documentary or film is mentioned in the text related to arson and FHA defaults. N/A.

20. **Question 20:** The total reimbursement amount isn't cited. The article mentions lenders were reimbursed but no figure. N/A.

Wait, let me check each again carefully:

For question 18: The article says "they persuaded middle-class families to sell their homes at cut-rate prices by stoking fears about the imminent arrival of minorities." So the method was stoking fears about minorities moving in. That's the exact method mentioned. So answer is "stoking fears about the imminent arrival of minorities."

Other questions remain N/A as before.
