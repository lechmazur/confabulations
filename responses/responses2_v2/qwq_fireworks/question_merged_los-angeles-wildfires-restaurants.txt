Wait, the question is about Emily Wilson's newsletter. The article says she tracked via her newsletter. The article says "Emily Wilson tracked the various resources they provided, along with their fund-raisers and calls for volunteers and donations." But it doesn't specify the technology. However, the LA Times used a map, but the question is about Emily's newsletter. Hmm. Wait, maybe the answer is "spreadsheets" but the LA Times used a map. The question is about Emily's method. The article says she "tracked" using her newsletter, but the technology isn't specified. So N/A.
