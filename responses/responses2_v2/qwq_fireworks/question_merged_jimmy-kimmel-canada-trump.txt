Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and answer each exactly as per the instructions. Let me start by reading through the questions again and then go through the article to find the answers.

1. **Question 1:** Which late night host suggested that Trump's deal with Trudeau would lead to France being forced to give up ownership rights to the Statue of Liberty?

Looking at the article, there's a quote from Jimmy Kimmel: "Next, his plan is he's going to force France to give us the Statue of Liberty. Won't that be nice? The art of the deal." So the answer is Jimmy Kimmel.

2. **Question 2:** How many electoral votes did Kimmel claim would make the difference between a MAGA president and a moose president?

The article says, "If Canada also had 54 electoral votes, forget MAGA -- our next president will be a kindhearted lesbian moose." So 54 electoral votes.

3. **Question 3:** What did Senator Kennedy claim was his preferred breakfast dish that caused him to be banned from a national restaurant chain?

The article mentions Senator John Kennedy's remark: "I've been eating at the wrong diner." Stephen Colbert comments on this. The senator preferred omelets over sex. The dish is omelets.

4. **Question 4:** Which Broadway playwright's new production about making it in show business follows their successful Thanksgiving-themed satire?

The article states Larissa FastHorse, the first Native American playwright on Broadway, followed "The Thanksgiving Play" with "Fake It Until You Make It." So her name is Larissa FastHorse.

5. **Question 5:** What did Trump announce as the primary condition for suspending Canadian tariffs according to Trudeau's original statement?

The article says Trump agreed to suspend tariffs after Trudeau reiterated a border commitment he'd already announced. The condition was reiterating the border commitment, but the exact term might be "border commitment." Wait, the question is about the primary condition according to Trudeau's original statement. The article says Trudeau had reiterated a border commitment he'd already announced, implying the original was the same. So the condition was Canada's border commitment.

6. **Question 6:** Which late night host compared the current egg shortage crisis to hunting for Swedish furniture at Swedish meatballs at Easter?

The quote is from Jimmy Kimmel: "Get ready to start hunting Swedish meatballs." The host is Jimmy Kimmel.

7. **Question 7:** What was the name of Julia Stiles' Broadway directorial debut that she discussed on The Daily Show?

The article says Julia Stiles discussed her feature debut "Wish You Were Here" on The Daily Show. So the name is "Wish You Were Here."

8. **Question 8:** How many millions more people live in Canada compared to California according to Kimmel's population statistics?

The article states Canada has about the same number as California, both around 41 million. So the difference is 0. But the question asks "how many millions more," so maybe N/A because they are the same. Wait, the exact quote: "They're about the same number we have in California." So the answer would be 0, but since the question is phrased as "how many millions more," maybe N/A because it's not more. Alternatively, the question might be a trick, but the answer should be 0. Wait, but the instructions say to answer as per the article. Since they are the same, the answer would be N/A because there's no difference. Hmm, maybe the article says "about the same number," so the answer is 0, but since the question is "how many millions more," maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, perhaps the question is a trick because the article says they're about the same, so the answer would be 0. But the instructions say if it's not provided, answer N/A. The article doesn't state a numerical difference beyond being the same. So maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "how many millions more people live in Canada compared to California according to Kimmel's population statistics?" Since the article says Canada has about the same as California, the difference is 0. But the question is "how many millions more," so maybe the answer is 0. But the instructions require to answer as per the article. Since it says "about the same number," maybe the answer is N/A because there's no exact figure given. Hmm, tricky. Let me check again. The article says "they're about the same number we have in California." So the answer is 0, but since the question is about "how many millions more," maybe the answer is 0. But since the article says "about the same," perhaps the answer is 0, but maybe the question expects N/A because it's not explicitly stated as a difference. Wait, the question is "how many millions more people live in Canada compared to California..." Since the article states they are the same, the answer is 0. So I'll put 0.

9. **Question 9:** Which musical performer's appearance on The Tonight Show coincided with Drake's difficult week?

The article mentions Japanese Breakfast performed on Tuesday's "Tonight Show," and there's a line: "as if Drake hasn't been through enough this week." So the performer is Japanese Breakfast.

Desi Lydic's joke: "she's the woman in the grocery store yelling at the eggs: 'You stay away from my husband, you cage-free sluts!'" So the answer is she yells at eggs, but the question is about shopping habits. The answer is she tells eggs to stay away from her husband.

11. **Question 11:** Based on the article’s intertwining of Canadian population figures with a discussion of US state electoral votes, which American state’s vote count is humorously invoked to compare with Canada’s potential electoral impact?

14. **Question 14:** Which late-night personality is credited with commenting on a future of soaring egg prices and a challenging Easter, as described in the humorous narrative?

The quote is from Jimmy Kimmel: "I'm trying to say, I'm for it. Save us, Canada -- you're our only hope."

So the host is Jimmy Kimmel.
