Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to make sure each answer is directly from the text or logically inferred. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The 12-step program slogan about self-worth. The article mentions Hank's sponsor Roger and Al-Anon. The slogan "It works if you work it. So work it, you're worth it" is part of Al-Anon. Hank might have misattributed it to his play, but the program is Al-Anon.

2. **Question 2**: The metaphor for emotional baggage. Hank refers to the "messy room" as his own emotional baggage. The question asks for a specific childhood object he used with Kate. The text doesn't mention a specific object, so maybe N/A?

Wait, the question says "childhood object from his past used as a metaphor". The article says "the messy room is all the junk you don't want to deal with in yourself". No specific object mentioned. So N/A?

3. **Question 3**: Simpsons character during couples therapy. The article mentions Hank's characters like Moe, Frink, Snake. But in couples therapy with Helen Hunt, he might have used one of these. The text says when discussing therapy, he mentioned "Chief Wiggum" in a different context. Wait, in the part where he talks about acting, he says "even as Chief Wiggum, it was funnier...". But the question is about couples therapy. The article doesn't specify which character he used in therapy. So N/A?

4. **Question 4**: Years after emu tattoo experience until moving in. The essay says the author got the tattoo on his 26th birthday, and two years later was in the home with her. The emu experience was when? He was 21 in Australia, then three years later the breakup. The tattoo was at 26, so two years after that would be 28. The emu moment was when he was 21, so from 21 to 28, that's 7 years? Wait, the question says "finally move into a shared home with the person who approved his design choice". The essay says two years later they were in the home. The emu experience was during his time in Australia, which was 8 years before the essay? Wait, the timeline is a bit confusing. Let me check the text again.

The essay says: "On my 26th birthday, I found myself alone..." and later "two years later, I was staring at the emu on my arm and talking to her about that night as she sat next to me on the couch in the home we share." So from the birthday (26) to moving in was two years, but the emu moment was earlier. The emu moment was when he was in Australia (21). The tattoo was at 26, so from the emu moment (21) to moving in at 28 (2 years after 26) would be 7 years. But the question asks how many years after the emu experience until moving in. The emu moment was when? The essay mentions the emu was during his time in Sydney, which was when he was 21. The move was two years after the tattoo (age 28), so 7 years. But the exact wording in the essay says "two years later, I was staring..." so the answer is 2 years after the tattoo, but the emu was before that. The question is about the time between the emu experience and moving in. The emu was when he was 21, moving in was at 28, so 7 years. But the article says the author was 26 when getting the tattoo, then two years later in the home. So the emu moment was at 21, so 26-21=5 years, plus the two years after the tattoo, total 7. The question says "how many years after his emu tattoo experience"—wait, the emu tattoo wasn't the experience; the emu moment was earlier. The tattoo was at 26, so the emu experience was at 21. The move was two years after the tattoo (28). So from the emu experience (21) to moving in (28) is 7 years. But the question says "after his emu tattoo experience"—but the tattoo wasn't the experience. The experience was the emu in Australia. The tattoo was later. So the answer is 7? But the text says "two years later, I was staring..." so the answer is 2 years after the tattoo, but the question is about the emu experience, which was 5 years before the tattoo. Therefore total is 7, but maybe the question is phrased as "after the emu tattoo experience"—but the tattoo wasn't the experience. The emu experience was before the tattoo. So the question might be wrong, so answer N/A? Or maybe the question is referring to the time between the emu moment (the experience) and moving in. Since the emu was at 21, moving in at 28, that's 7 years. The article says "two years later, I was staring..." so the answer is 2 years after the tattoo, but the emu was 5 years before the tattoo. The question says "after his emu tattoo experience"—maybe it's a mistake, so N/A? Wait, the essay says the author was 21 in Sydney when the emu moment happened. The tattoo was at 26, then two years later in the home. So the emu experience to moving in is 7 years. The answer should be 7? But the question says "after his emu tattoo experience"—the tattoo wasn't the experience. Maybe the question has an error, so N/A? Or maybe the "emus tattoo experience" refers to the moment he got the tattoo, which was when he was 26. But the emu moment was earlier. So the answer would be 2 years. Hmm, tricky. Let me check the exact text again. The essay says: "On my 26th birthday... I had them pull up a photo of an emu on Google Images." Then later: "two years later, I was staring at the emu on my arm..." So from the tattoo (26) to moving in was two years. The emu experience (in Australia) was when he was 21. So the question asks how many years after the emu experience (21) until moving in (28)? 7 years. The question's wording might be off, but the answer is 7? But the article says "two years later" after the tattoo, so maybe the question is correct and the answer is 2? Wait, the question says "after his emu tattoo experience"—maybe the "emus tattoo experience" is the time he got the tattoo. Then the answer is 2 years. But the emu moment was before the tattoo. The question might have a typo. Since the article says two years after the tattoo, the answer is 2. I'll go with 2.

5. **Question 5**: Alcoholic beverage banned during "no heat" period. The article says "no heat, we called it. No flirting, no first dates, no nothing. Just, what do you like that isn't all that unhealthy stuff? And I had to discover what that was. And then when I did, then it's like, OK, now, who wants to be invited into that world with me? That's the difference. That's not people pleasing. And fortunately, for me, my wife, my current wife, fit into that whole world." The "no heat" period included "no drinking, drugging, dating, overworking, bingeing on food". So the banned beverage is alcohol. The question asks specifically what alcoholic beverage was banned. The text says "no drinking", but the question asks for a specific one. Since it's not specified, N/A?

Wait, the question says "which alcoholic beverage did Hank's sponsor Roger explicitly ban him from consuming during his 'no heat' self-dating period". The article says "no heat" involved "no drinking, drugging, dating, overworking, bingeing on food". But it doesn't mention a specific alcoholic beverage. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Historical conflict Kate incorrectly referenced. The text has Hank saying: "I like to ask my wife really inane questions like, hey, sweetie, um, what's your favorite ancient war? Mine's the Peloponnesian. [ANNA LAUGHS] What's your favorite liquid soap? Mine's ivory." So Kate didn't know, and the Peloponnesian was Hank's. So the incorrect reference is when he says Kate didn't know, but the question is which one she got wrong. The question says "Kate incorrectly referenced during their stoop conversation". The stoop conversation was when they were talking about the emu tattoo. Wait, the stoop conversation is mentioned here: "In between, we sat on a stoop in the West Village, and I drew a sketch of an emu. Once, twice, even seven times, until she bluntly said that she couldn't let any of my own drawings on my body." So during the stoop conversation, they discussed the emu, but the historical conflict was in a different part. The Peloponnesian was Hank's answer to Kate's question. The question asks which conflict Kate incorrectly referenced. The text says Hank mentions the Peloponnesian as his favorite, implying Kate didn't have one or got it wrong. The question says "Kate incorrectly referenced", but maybe she was asked and gave a wrong answer. The text doesn't mention Kate's answer, just that Hank's was Peloponnesian. So N/A?

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to when Hank asked Kate "what's your favorite ancient war?" and she gave a wrong answer. The text doesn't say what she said, so N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Age of Hank's son when incorporating Al-Anon principles. The article says "we have a 15-year-old son." When discussing parenting, it says "reverse-engineering from, how are we going to respond to the boy?" So the son is 15 now, but the question is about when he began incorporating principles. Since the son is 15, but the timing isn't specified, maybe N/A? Or the question might be asking the current age? The question says "when he began incorporating", but the text doesn't specify when. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Gaelic phrase for "laugh". The essay says the author considered "laugh" in Gaelic but didn't do it. The answer is "laugh" in Gaelic. The exact phrase isn't given, but the question asks what he nearly tattooed. The answer is "laugh" in Gaelic. Since the question wants the Gaelic phrase, but the text only mentions the word "laugh" translated, so the answer is "laugh" in Gaelic. But the exact Gaelic word isn't provided. The text says "the word 'laugh' in Gaelic", but doesn't give the actual word. So N/A? Or the answer is "laugh" but in Gaelic, but since we can't write it, maybe N/A?

Wait, the question says "which Gaelic phrase"—but the author considered "laugh" in Gaelic. Since the Gaelic word isn't provided, the answer is N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Broadway play's title mentioned. The article says Hank is in a new play on Broadway called "All In". The question is about his current work. So the answer is "All In".

10. **Question 10**: Canned beverage with tropical sunshine. The ad mentions "Dole 100 percent Pineapple Juice... sunshine in a can". So the answer is "Dole 100 percent Pineapple Juice".

11. **Question 11**: Who mixed the episode. The credits say "This episode was mixed by Sophia Lanman". So Sophia Lanman.

12. **Question 12**: Central animal in the essay. The essay is about the emu tattoo. The central image is the emu.

13. **Question 13**: Outdoor locale dismissed by Hank. The text says Hank dislikes the beach. "Helen loves the beach... I hate the beach". So the answer is "the beach".

14. **Question 14**: Recovery program with slogans like "It works if you work it". The article mentions Al-Anon, with slogans like "It works if you work it". So Al-Anon.

15. **Question 15**: Minimum duration for recovery. The article says "it took me, like, a solid year, year and a half to get over my marriage". So the answer is "a solid year, year and a half" but the question asks for approximate minimum duration, so 1 year? Or "a year and a half". The question says "minimum duration he indicates was needed"—so "a year and a half" but needs to be in numbers. The article says "solid year, year and a half", so the minimum is 1 year. But the question says "approximate minimum"—so 1 year. But the answer should be in the format as per the text. The exact phrase is "a solid year, year and a half", so maybe the answer is "a year and a half".

Wait, the question says "minimum duration he indicates was needed for his recovery". The article says "it took me, like, a solid year, year and a half to get over my marriage and feel like I could kind of join the land of the living again". So the minimum is 1 year. But he says it took up to 1.5, so the minimum might be 1. But the question asks for the approximate minimum he indicated, which is a year. The answer should be "a year" or "1 year". The exact text uses "year" and "year and a half". The answer should be "a year and a half" but the question says "minimum"—maybe 1 year. Hmm. The question says "minimum duration he indicates was needed"—so the minimum is 1 year, but the article says it took up to 1.5, so the answer is "a year and a half". Or since he says "solid year, year and a half", the minimum would be 1 year. The question says "minimum duration he indicates was needed", so the answer is "a year and a half" because that's what he says it took. But the question is about the minimum, so perhaps the answer is "a year". But the text says "a solid year, year and a half"—so the minimum is 1 year. The answer should be 1 year. Or the answer is "a year and a half" because that's the duration he mentions. The question is phrased as "minimum duration he indicates was needed"—if he says it took 1-1.5 years, the minimum is 1. But the article says "it took me, like, a solid year, year and a half"—so the answer is "a year and a half". Maybe the answer is "a year and a half".

16. **Question 16**: Consumer product for sleep. The ad mentions "Coop's Original Adjustable Pillow" as solving sleep issues. So that's the answer.

17. **Question 17**: Gaelic language for "laugh". The essay author considered Gaelic for "laugh". The answer is Gaelic (the language), but the question asks for the phrase. Since the exact Gaelic word isn't provided, the answer is N/A? Or the question is asking for the language, which is Gaelic. The question says "which ancient language", so Gaelic.

18. **Question 18**: Drawing recreated multiple times. The essay says "I drew a sketch of an emu. Once, twice, even seven times". So the answer is "an emu".
