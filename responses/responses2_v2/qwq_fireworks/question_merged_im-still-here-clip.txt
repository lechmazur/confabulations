Okay, I need to tackle these 20 questions based solely on the provided article. Let me go through each question one by one, checking the article for exact answers.

The article mentions Nalu entering the house with a friend. It also says the scene is based on how Nalu described it. But does it say she was on the beach? The first paragraph mentions "sounds from the beach" but not that she was there. So maybe Nalu is the daughter who enters, but the beach play isn't directly linked to her. Answer: N/A? Wait, the article says "Nalu, played by Barbara Luz, leads us to the father's room." The initial setting has sounds from the beach, but the daughter on the beach isn't specified. So maybe N/A.

The main character might be Eunice or Rubens. The article says the film is based on Marcelo's memoir, so the character associated would be Rubens, as Marcelo's father. Answer: Rubens Paiva.
