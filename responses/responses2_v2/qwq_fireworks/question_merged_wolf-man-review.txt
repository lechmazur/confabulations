Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful to answer only based on the text and not use any outside knowledge. Let me go through each question and see what the article says.

1. **How many minutes of screen time does Julia Garner have in scenes where she's not reacting to her husband's transformation?**
   - The article mentions that Charlotte (Garner) is "so sketchily written she spends much of the film staring, dumbstruck, at the gibbous monstrosity her husband is gradually becoming." It doesn't specify the exact minutes of her scenes without reacting. So this is N/A.

2. **Which previous horror film director did Leigh Whannell cite as inspiration for the practical effects used in the transformation sequences?**
   - The article says the effects are compared to "An American Werewolf in London" (1981) by Rick Baker, but it doesn't mention Whannell citing a director as inspiration. So N/A.

3. **What medication was Blake prescribed to control his violent outbursts before moving to Oregon?**
   - The text doesn't mention any medication for Blake. N/A.

4. **At what age did Blake first encounter the creature in the woods during his childhood, according to his flashback scenes?**
   - The article states Blake's childhood was overshadowed by threats but doesn't specify the exact age. N/A.

5. **How many victims does the supernatural creature claim before Blake's childhood friend becomes its first on-screen casualty?**
   - The friend is the first mentioned victim. So zero before him. But the article says "a childhood pal shows up just long enough to warn... before a shocking attack leaves him kaput." So the first casualty is the friend. Hence, 0 before him.

6. **What newspaper does Charlotte work for as a journalist in San Francisco?**
   - The article only mentions she's a journalist but doesn't name the newspaper. N/A.

7. **Which famous werewolf movie actor makes a cameo appearance as one of the local townspeople warning the family?**
   - The article doesn't mention any cameo by a werewolf actor. N/A.

8. **What is the name of Blake's father's hunting dog that first alerts them to the creature's presence?**
   - No dog is mentioned in the article. N/A.

9. **During which lunar phase does Blake complete his final transformation into the wolf man?**
   - The review mentions Charlotte sees him during his transformation but doesn't specify the lunar phase. N/A.

10. **What color are Charlotte's eyes when seen through Blake's distorted perspective during his transformation?**
    - The article states that from Blake's POV, his family appears as "glowing-eyed aliens." The color isn't specified beyond glowing. Since "glowing" isn't a color, maybe the answer is "glowing" but the question asks for color. Maybe the article says "glowing-eyed" without specifying the color, so N/A?

11. **In the film’s portrayal of inherited family issues, which undesirable personal trait is hinted at as being passed from Blake’s protective father to his own temperament?**
    - The article mentions "a foul temper can be passed down like a family heirloom." So the answer is "a foul temper."

12. **During the scene where the protagonist undergoes his disturbing change, what graphic transformation detail is used to symbolize his internal turmoil as described in the review?**
    - The article says Blake transforms into a "swollen, oozing wretch who gnaws frantically on his own wounds." The graphic detail is "gnawing on his own wounds."

13. **Within the domestic tensions of the film, which character is noted for having a role that suffers from underdeveloped writing, despite being central to the narrative conflict?**
    - Charlotte is described as "so sketchily written." So the answer is "Charlotte."

14. **Referencing classic horror makeup standards, which 1981 film’s transformation effects does the reviewer mention as a benchmark when contrasting Blake’s metamorphosis?**
    - The article mentions "An American Werewolf in London" (1981) by Rick Baker. So that's the answer.

15. **According to the supplemental film news presented, on which streaming platform is Tom Green’s Return showcased alongside other new projects?**
    - The article says Tom Green's projects are on Amazon Prime Video. So Amazon Prime.

16. **By drawing parallels with another film by Leigh Whannell known for its potent female lead, which earlier horror movie is implied to share thematic elements with Wolf Man?**
    - The article compares it to "The Invisible Man" with Elisabeth Moss. So "The Invisible Man."

17. **When a childhood friend offers what seems like a forewarning about the local dangers, what fate is he described as meeting, thereby intensifying the film’s ominous atmosphere?**
    - The friend is "kaput" after the attack. So "killed" or "dies" but the article says "kaput," which is slang for dead. So "killed" or "dies," but the exact wording is "kaput." Maybe answer as "killed" since "kaput" means dead.

18. **Which family decision involving a return to an inherited home is critiqued in the review as a misguided attempt to resolve the characters’ impaired communication?**
    - The article says dragging the family to the inherited home in Oregon is the decision. So "returning to the inherited childhood home in Oregon."

19. **Given the details about his personal background and career struggles, which age bracket is implicitly emphasized by the portrayal of Blake’s character?**
    - Blake is in his 30s, mentioned as "Now an unemployed writer in his 30s." So "30s."

20. **In a satirical suggestion about resolving marital discord, what remedial measure does the reviewer propose would have been a more effective alternative to the film’s approach?**
    - The article ends with "couples therapy would have been the way to go." So "couples therapy."
