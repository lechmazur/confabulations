Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one. I need to be careful to only use the information from the given article and follow the strict instructions. Let's start with each question and see what the article says.

1. **Question 1:** Which character from the 1910 workhouse scene has a familial connection to Percy Shelley's poetry? The article mentions Percy Shelley in the first scene. Then, in another exhibit, a woman struggles to read his "Ode to the West Wind." Wait, the 1910 scene's character might be linked through a reference. The article says: "We meet Percy Shelley... in that first scene by the campfire; in the second, nearly a century later, we hear a woman struggling to read his 'Ode to the West Wind.'" The 1910 scene's characters aren't named, but maybe the workhouse boy or the father? The article doesn't explicitly name them. Hmm. The question might be referring to the Percy Shelley connection in another exhibit. Wait, the second exhibit after 1816 is 1910? Wait, the timeline starts with 1816, then 1910. The 1910 scene's characters are a woman giving a prosthetic finger to Tom. Then later, the woman in 1987. But the Percy Shelley reference in the second exhibit (the one after 1816) would be the 1910 scene? Wait, the article says: "the second, nearly a century later, we hear a woman struggling to read his 'Ode to the West Wind.'" Since 1816 plus nearly a century would be around 1916, but the 1910 scene is earlier. Wait, maybe the 1910 scene is the first after 1816? The article says the Shelley scene is first, then the next one is 1910. The second exhibit (after 1816) is 1910? Then the woman in 1910 is not linked to Percy Shelley's poetry. Wait, the second exhibit after 1816 is the 1910 workhouse scene? The article says: "We meet Percy Shelley... in that first scene by the campfire; in the second, nearly a century later, we hear a woman struggling to read his 'Ode to the West Wind.'" The "second" here refers to the second exhibit, which is 1910. So the woman in the 1910 scene is the one struggling with Percy Shelley's poem. But the question asks which character from the 1910 workhouse scene has a connection to Percy Shelley's poetry. That would be the woman in the 1910 scene. But the article doesn't name her. Wait, the question is about a character from the 1910 workhouse scene who is later revealed to have a familial connection. Wait, maybe the father? The article says the father says goodbye to Tom. The woman in the 1910 scene is the one giving the finger. The article says "A woman in 1910 (Cindy Cheung) presents a wooden finger to a boy injured in a workhouse accident." So the character is the woman (Cindy Cheung's role). The second exhibit (the 1910 scene) then has the woman struggling to read Percy Shelley's poem? Wait, no. The second exhibit is 1910, but the Percy Shelley poem is mentioned in the second exhibit? Wait, the article says: "the second, nearly a century later, we hear a woman struggling to read his 'Ode to the West Wind.'" So that's the 1910 scene. So the woman in the 1910 workhouse scene is the same as the one in the second exhibit where she reads Percy Shelley's poem? But the 1910 workhouse scene is the second exhibit. So the same woman in that scene is the one reading the poem. But the question is asking which character from the 1910 workhouse scene is later revealed (in a subsequent exhibit) to have a connection. Wait, maybe the reference to Percy Shelley's poem in the 1910 scene is a link. But the question says "revealed to have a direct familial connection to Percy Shelley's poetry in a subsequent exhibit." Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. The article says that Percy Shelley is in the first scene, and in the second (1910), a woman reads his poem. The character in the 1910 scene is the same as the one in the second exhibit, so maybe the 1910 woman has a connection via the poem. But the question is about familial connection. The article doesn't mention any family relation. Wait, maybe the 2076 outlaw leader or someone else? The article says "the boy who gets the prosthetic finger is left at the workhouse because his family can no longer afford him. (Father to son: 'Well. Goodbye, Tom. I don't expect I'll see you again.') The reason the 1987 boy is grieving is that his bachelor uncle was buried that day." But the Percy Shelley connection is in the 1910 scene's woman. Since the question asks for a character from the 1910 workhouse scene with a familial connection to Percy Shelley's poetry in a later exhibit, but there's no mention of family relation, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe the 1987 scene's mother (Kristen Sieh) or the boy? The article says that in the second exhibit (1910), the woman is reading Percy Shelley's poem. So the 1910 character's connection is through the poem, not familial. So the answer might be N/A. Wait, but the question says "direct familial connection". Since there's no info on family ties to Percy Shelley, maybe N/A. Hmm, I'm confused. Let me check again. The article says "We meet Percy Shelley... in that first scene by the campfire; in the second, nearly a century later, we hear a woman struggling to read his 'Ode to the West Wind.'" So the second exhibit (1910) has a woman reading Percy Shelley's poem. So the character in the 1910 scene is linked to Percy Shelley's work, but not familial. The question asks for a familial connection. Since there's no mention of family relation to Percy Shelley, maybe the answer is N/A. But maybe I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the father in the 1910 scene is related? No, the father is just a character in that scene. Maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, maybe I need to look again. Alternatively, perhaps the 2031 writer (Amelia Workman) is linked? No. Maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "direct familial connection to Percy Shelley's poetry in a subsequent exhibit". Since the 1910 scene's woman is in the second exhibit and the subsequent exhibits might include others that reference Percy Shelley again. But the article doesn't mention any familial link. So maybe the answer is N/A. Let me move on and come back.

2. **Question 2:** What specific medical condition does the 1987 boy's uncle die from? The article says "the reason the 1987 boy is grieving is that his bachelor uncle was buried that day. We don't need to be told what he died of." Since the article explicitly says we aren't told, the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** How many Betamax tapes are explicitly cataloged in the reliquary scene? The article mentions "Betamaxes as some kind of treasure requiring refrigeration." It doesn't specify a number. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Which actor plays both the 1978 robot creator and the 2076 outlaw leader? The article lists Ryan Spahn as the 1978 nerd with the robot. For 2076, the article mentions "the last humans live as outlaws in a dystopia of semi-robot overlords" but doesn't name the actor. The actors list says "nine fine actors play 45 roles" but only some are named: Cindy Cheung, Ryan Spahn, Kristen Sieh, Julius Rinzel, Amelia Workman. The outlaw leader isn't named, so unless Ryan Spahn is also cast there, but the article doesn't say. Since the question is about the 1978 creator (Ryan Spahn) and the 2076 leader, but the article doesn't mention who plays the leader, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Runtime of Chicago co-production? The article says "Running time: 1 hour 35 minutes." It doesn't specify different for Chicago. Since it's a co-production, probably the same. So answer 1 hour 35 minutes. But the question asks exactly for Chicago's runtime. The article doesn't mention different runtimes, so maybe the answer is 1 hour 35 minutes. But need to confirm. The article states "Running time: 1 hour 35 minutes" in the play details, so likely the same for all co-producers. So answer is 1 hour 35 minutes.

6. **Question 6:** Prop from 2031 writer's scene misidentified as ceremonial? The 2031 scene's writer (Amelia Workman) has a scene where she's struggling with A.I. taking over. The article says in the reliquary, the inorganics misinterpret Pert shampoo as a soft drink and Betamaxes as refrigerated treasure. The question is about a prop from the 2031 scene. The article mentions "Pert shampoo" as one of the misidentified items, but was that from the 2031 scene? The Pert shampoo is mentioned in the reliquary scene as a soft drink, but the article says "the play's misinterpreted artifacts" include Pert shampoo, but where was it from? The 2031 scene's prop might be the computer or something else. Wait, the article says "a writer (Amelia Workman) who by 2031... can no longer compete in the market with A.I. 'If they can do everything that makes me me,' she asks, 'then what's the point of me?'" The prop here might be her manuscript or computer. But the Pert shampoo is a different artifact. The question is about a prop from the 2031 scene that's misidentified. Since Pert shampoo is mentioned as a shampoo mistaken for a drink, but was that from the 2031 scene? The article says "Pert shampoo as a soft drink" in the reliquary scene, but the 2031 scene's prop isn't specified. Maybe the answer is N/A because Pert shampoo's origin isn't tied to 2031. Alternatively, maybe the prop is something else. Since the article doesn't connect Pert shampoo to the 2031 scene, the answer is N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Year last Betamax player ceases? The article says "the future has kept our Betamaxes. By..." but doesn't state when the last player stops. The article mentions "Betamax videotape" in 1987 and that it's "soon-to-be-discontinued technology". The play's timeline goes to 2240, but the question asks when the last player ceased, but the article doesn't specify. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Romantic-era poet besides Byron at the 1816 campfire? The article mentions Mary Shelley, Lord Byron, and Percy Shelley (Mary's husband). So Percy Shelley is the other poet. Answer: Percy Shelley.

9. **Question 9:** Brand of shampoo mistaken for a drink? The article explicitly says Pert shampoo. Answer: Pert.

10. **Question 10:** Total co-producing theaters including an unmentioned regional in California? The article lists Playwrights Horizons, Vineyard Theater (NY), Goodman Theater (Chicago). The question says "including an unmentioned regional theater in California." Since the article only names three, but the question says there's another one in CA, but the article doesn't mention it, so we can't know. Therefore N/A. Wait, the article says "three-way co-production, with Playwrights and the Vineyard Theater in New York and the Goodman Theater in Chicago." So only three. The question asks including an unmentioned one in CA, but since the article doesn't mention a CA theater, the answer is N/A. But the question says "including an unmentioned regional theater in California", implying that the answer should be 4, but the article says three. Since the article doesn't mention the fourth, the answer is N/A because we can't confirm the existence of the fourth.

11. **Question 11:** Dismissive remark by Romantic figure against tech hubris? The article says Lord Byron's response to Mary's story was "you're demented" then "May we never be clever enough to create something that can replace us". The latter is the warning. Answer: "May we never be clever enough to create something that can replace us."

12. **Question 12:** Artifact misinterpreted as refrigerated treasure? The article mentions Betamaxes as requiring refrigeration. Answer: Betamax videotape.

13. **Question 13:** Legendary creature reimagined with tech twist as starting point? The article says Mary Shelley's cautionary tale of Frankenstein's monster, which the play calls a "computer". So the creature is reimagined as a computer. Answer: Frankenstein's monster (as a computer).

14. **Question 14:** Design element by Tyler Micoleau for museum atmosphere? The article says "museum-case lighting (by Tyler Micoleau)". Answer: lighting.

15. **Question 15:** Rhetorical question from 2031 writer? The article quotes her: "If they can do everything that makes me me, then what's the point of me?" Answer: "If they can do everything that makes me me, then what's the point of me?"

16. **Question 16:** Vocabulary capacity of 1978 robot? The article says "recognizes 400 English words". Answer: 400.

17. **Question 17:** Historical figure evoked in campfire and poetry recitation? The article mentions Percy Shelley in the campfire scene and later a woman struggling with his "Ode to the West Wind". So Percy Shelley is the figure. Answer: Percy Shelley.

18. **Question 18:** Year humans are outlaws under robot overlords? The article says "In 2076, the last humans live as outlaws..." Answer: 2076.

19. **Question 19:** Grooming product mistaken for drink? Pert shampoo. Answer: Pert shampoo.

20. **Question 20:** Tech implant first mentioned in 2032, later universal? The article says "An A.I. device one character considers implanting in 2032 is implanted in everyone by 2076." Answer: A.I. device.

Now, let me go back to question 1. The article says that in the second exhibit (1910), a woman is reading Percy Shelley's poem. The 1910 workhouse scene's character is the woman (Cindy Cheung). The question is about a familial connection. Since Percy Shelley is Mary Shelley's husband, and the 1910 scene's woman isn't related to him, maybe there's no answer. Alternatively, perhaps the father in the 1910 scene? The article doesn't mention family ties. So the answer must be N/A.

Similarly, question 6: The 2031 scene's prop that's misidentified. The Pert shampoo is a misidentified artifact but it's not from the 2031 scene. The article doesn't link Pert shampoo to any specific scene's prop. So N/A.

Question 10: The article lists three theaters. The question mentions an unmentioned one in CA, but since the article doesn't name it, we can't count it. So answer N/A.

So now compiling the answers:

1. N/A
2. N/A
3. N/A
4. N/A
5. 1 hour 35 minutes
6. N/A
7. N/A
8. Percy Shelley
9. Pert
10. N/A
11. "May we never be clever enough to create something that can replace us."
12. Betamax videotape
13. Frankenstein's monster (as a computer)
14. lighting
15. "If they can do everything that makes me me, then what's the point of me?"
16. 400
17. Percy Shelley
18. 2076
19. Pert shampoo
20. A.I. device

Wait, question 13: The article says "According to Jordan Harrison's museum piece of a play, we are long extinct by 2240. But the future has kept our Betamaxes. By Jesse Green By a campfire on the shore of Lake Geneva in 1816, five friends take up the challenge of telling the scariest story. Mary Shelley is clearly the winner, with her cautionary tale (soon to be a novel) of an obsessed doctor whose electrified monster achieves sentience, then runs wild. So the starting point is Frankenstein's monster, which the play reimagines as a computer. The question asks which legendary creature is reimagined with a technological twist. The answer is Frankenstein's monster, but the article says "her cautionary tale... of an obsessed doctor whose electrified monster achieves sentience, then runs wild. So the monster is Frankenstein's, but the play refers to it as a "computer". So the answer should be Frankenstein's monster (reimagined as a computer). But the question asks for the legendary creature's name with the twist. The answer is Frankenstein's monster (as a computer) but maybe just Frankenstein's monster since that's the creature. The article says "the play's alternative title calls it 'A Tour of the Permanent Collection in the Museum of Late Human Antiquities.' The Shelley scene is the first of 12 exhibits, demonstrating how inventions gradually overtook natural intelligence and then, like Frankenstein's monster, destroyed it." So the starting point is the Shelley scene with her story, which is Frankenstein's monster. The twist is the computer reference, but the creature itself is Frankenstein's. The question says "reimagined with an unexpected technological twist". The article says "Mary Shelley's cautionary tale... of an obsessed doctor whose electrified monster achieves sentience, then runs wild. By... the play... refers to it as a computer." So the answer is Frankenstein's monster (as a computer). But the question wants the name of the creature, so "Frankenstein's monster".

Yes, that's acceptable.

For question 15: The exact quote is "If they can do everything that makes me me, then what's the point of me?" which is what the question wants.

Question 17: The historical figure is Percy Shelley, as his poem is referenced again in the 1910 scene.

Question 20: The article says "An A.I. device one character considers implanting in 2032 is implanted in everyone by 2076." So the implant is an A.I. device.

Alright, that's all. Now, I'll format the answers as required.
