Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly.

1. The first question asks how much more debt Country Garden had compared to the company liquidated a year ago. The article mentions Evergrande was liquidated a year ago with over $300 billion debt, and Country Garden defaulted on $187 billion in 2023. Wait, Country Garden's debt is less than Evergrande's. The question is about the difference between Country Garden and the liquidated company (Evergrande). But the question is phrased as "how much more debt... compared to Country Garden". Wait, no, the question is "How much more debt, compared to Country Garden, did the company ordered to be liquidated..." The liquidated company is Evergrande with $300B, Country Garden had $187B. So the difference is 300 - 187 = $113 billion more. But the question is phrased as "compared to Country Garden", so the answer is $113 billion. But I need to check if the article states the exact figures. The article says Country Garden defaulted on $187B in 2023 and Evergrande defaulted on over $300B in 2021. So the answer is $300B - $187B = $113B more. But the question is "how much more debt did the liquidated company (Evergrande) have compared to Country Garden?" So the answer is $113 billion. But the question wording might be tricky. Wait, the question says: "How much more debt, compared to Country Garden, did the company ordered to be liquidated..." So the liquidated company (Evergrande) had $300B debt compared to Country Garden's $187B. So the difference is $113B more than Country Garden. So the answer is $113 billion. But the question might want the exact figure from the text. Let me check the article again.

The article says: "the same court ordered Evergrande, which defaulted on more than $300 billion of debt in 2021, to be liquidated." And "Country Garden... defaulted on $187 billion of debt in 2023". So the difference is 300B - 187B = 113B. So the answer is $113 billion.

2. The second question: What role, similar to Xin Jie's previous position, did Yu Liang assume after his "work adjustment"? Xin Jie is the head of Vanke's largest shareholder (Shenzhen government entity). Yu Liang was the chairman who resigned, and after stepping down as chairman, the article says he "will stay on as an executive vice president." So the role is Executive Vice President.

3. The quarterly loss before S&P and Fitch downgrades: The article says "Vanke reported a $2.5 billion quarterly loss in October and started to warn about its ability to repay creditors. Last week, S&P Global and Fitch... downgraded their outlooks..." So the answer is $2.5 billion.

4. The former CEO's resignation due to health reasons. The question says "besides liquidity issues, what health concern..." Wait, the article says Zhu Jiusheng resigned "due to health reasons," but the question is whether there's another health concern besides liquidity. Wait, the question is phrased as "Besides liquidity issues, what health concern..." but the article only mentions Zhu's resignation was due to health reasons. The "health concern" is his own health. So the answer is "health reasons" but the question might be a trick. Wait, the question says "besides liquidity issues" but the health reason is the reason for his resignation, not a separate concern. Since the question is about the health concern that caused his resignation, the answer is "health reasons". But the question says "besides liquidity issues", so maybe it's redundant. The answer is health reasons.

5. Which company defaulted in 2023 with larger debt than the liquidated one (Evergrande)? Country Garden defaulted on $187B, which is less than Evergrande's $300B. So no, but the question asks which company had a larger debt than the liquidated one. The answer is none, so N/A? Wait the question says "had a larger debt than the one liquidated a year ago" (Evergrande had $300B). Country Garden's $187B is smaller, so the answer is N/A. Wait the question says "which company... had a larger debt than the one liquidated..." Since none, answer N/A. Wait, but the question says "mentioned in the article as having defaulted in 2023" is Country Garden. Since Country Garden's debt is less than Evergrande's, the answer is N/A. But maybe I misread. Wait, the question is "which company... had a larger debt than the one liquidated a year ago?" The liquidated one had $300B. Country Garden's debt is $187B, so no. So answer N/A.

6. What percentage of Vanke's $5B bonds contributed to the $6.2B loss? The article says the loss was "in part because of plunging sales" and mentions the bonds coming due, but doesn't give a percentage. So N/A.

7. The report that was taken down: the article says "Chinese media reported this month that Mr. Zhu had been taken away by police..." but doesn't specify which media. So N/A.

8. The city where Vanke's filing was made, connected to the new chairman. The new chairman is from Shenzhen's government entity. The article says Vanke is based in Shenzhen. So the filing was made in Shenzhen? The article mentions a filing in Hong Kong initially, but the question says "given its connection to the company's new chairman", who is from Shenzhen. So the answer is Shenzhen. Wait the filing was in Hong Kong, but the question asks where else besides Hong Kong. The company is based in Shenzhen, so maybe the answer is Shenzhen. The question says "In what city, other than Hong Kong, was Vanke's financial filing made..." but the filing was in Hong Kong. The article says "In a filing in Hong Kong". So perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait the question might be implying the new chairman's location. The new chairman is from Shenzhen's entity, so the answer is Shenzhen. But the filing was made in HK. The question might be a trick, so N/A.

9. The governmental encouragement beyond the "high quality" list. The article says Vanke was "placed on a government list of 'high quality' developers that China's banks were encouraged to lend to." The encouragement is the lending encouragement. So the answer is "encouraged lending from China's banks".

10. How many executives replaced? The chairman Yu Liang and CEO Zhu Jiusheng are leaving. Also, three new executives from state firms. So total replaced: the chairman and CEO plus three new ones? Wait the question is "how many executives in total, including the chairman, were replaced". The article says Yu (chairman) and Zhu (CEO) are stepping down, and three new executives are coming from state firms. So total replaced: at least two (chair and CEO), but maybe more. The article says "three new executives from state-owned firms, according to the company". So total replacements: the two top executives plus the three new ones? Or are the three replacing existing ones? The article says "the company said it would get three new executives from state-owned firms". So the total number of replacements would be the two top (chair and CEO) plus the three new ones, but maybe some of the three are replacements. The exact number isn't clear. The article mentions "the changes mark an effort... to take greater control of the management". The exact count might not be specified. The question might be referring to the chairman and CEO plus the three new ones? Or just the two top? The article says "three new executives from state-owned firms" in addition to the new chairman. So total: 2 (Yu and Zhu) + 3 new = 5? Or the chairman is Xin Jie replacing Yu, and the CEO is replaced by someone else? The article says Zhu is the CEO resigning, so he's replaced? The exact number isn't stated. The article says "three new executives" in addition to the new chairman. So total replaced: the chairman (1) and CEO (1), plus three others? Or are the three part of the replacements? The exact number might be unclear. The article says "three new executives from state-owned firms" so total replacements would be at least two (the top two) plus three new ones, totaling five? But maybe the three are part of the new appointments, not replacements. The question is "how many executives in total, including the chairman, were replaced at Vanke due to the company's restructuring?" The answer could be 2 (Yu and Zhu) plus the three new ones? Or is it only the two top? The article says the three are "new executives" so maybe they are added, not replacing existing ones. So the answer might be 2 (the chairman and CEO). But the article says "the company said it would get three new executives from state-owned firms", implying replacements. Hmm. Since it's unclear, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait the question might be asking for the number of people who left, which is two (Yu and Zhu), plus any others? The article doesn't specify, so N/A.

11. The executive who left due to health condition intertwined with state changes. Zhu Jiusheng resigned "due to health reasons" and the article mentions the state takeover. So the answer is Zhu Jiusheng.

12. The chairman who left for work adjustment. Yu Liang left for "work adjustment reasons".

13. The company with $5B bonds is Vanke.

14. The ratings agency starting with F is Fitch.

15. The company liquidated in 2021 was Evergrande.

16. The incident involving law enforcement was Zhu Jiusheng being taken away by police.

17. The governmental body is Shenzhen's government, as Xin Jie is from their entity.

18. The forecasted loss is $6.2 billion.

19. The city is Shenzhen, where Vanke is based.

20. The developer granted more time was Country Garden.

Now, let's check each again carefully.

1. The question is how much more debt the liquidated company (Evergrande) had compared to Country Garden. Evergrande's debt was over $300B, Country Garden's was $187B. The difference is 300-187=113B. So answer is $113 billion.

2. Yu Liang became Executive Vice President.

3. $2.5 billion quarterly loss.

4. The health concern is Zhu's own health reasons. The question says "besides liquidity issues", but the health is the reason for his resignation. So answer is "health reasons".

5. The company mentioned as defaulting in 2023 with larger debt than the liquidated (Evergrande)? Country Garden's debt is less, so N/A.

6. No percentage given, so N/A.

7. The report's source: Chinese media, but which one? The article doesn't specify, so N/A.

8. The filing was in Hong Kong, so other city? The company is based in Shenzhen, but the filing was in HK. The question is about where the filing was made other than HK? Maybe N/A, but the connection to the new chairman is Shenzhen. Maybe the answer is Shenzhen? The question says "given its connection to the company's new chairman", so the new chairman's previous position was in Shenzhen's entity. The filing's location is HK, but the question might be looking for the city related to the chairman's origin. Not sure. Maybe the answer is N/A since the filing was in HK only. So N/A.

9. The encouragement beyond the list was "encouraged to lend to".

10. The number of replaced executives: the article says Yu (chairman) and Zhu (CEO) are stepping down. The three new executives are added, but not necessarily replacing others. So total replaced is 2. But the question includes "including the chairman", so 2. The article says "three new executives from state-owned firms" but doesn't say they replaced existing ones. So answer is 2.

11. Zhu Jiusheng.

12. Yu Liang.

13. Vanke.

14. Fitch.

15. Evergrande.

16. Zhu Jiusheng taken by police.

17. Shenzhen government.

18. $6.2 billion.

19. Shenzhen.

20. Country Garden.
