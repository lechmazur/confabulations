Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the given article. 

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks how many performances Menzel did as Elphaba during *Wicked*'s initial Broadway run after being dropped from her record label. The article mentions that *Wicked* was her "new start" after being dropped, but doesn't specify the number of performances. So N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The scenic design element that Diaz incorporated. The article says the musical uses over a thousand LED panels for forest vistas, but it's compared to National Geographic's style. However, the question mentions studying *Skintight*, but Diaz's involvement is about songwriting, not scenic design. So maybe N/A here. Wait, the question says Diaz incorporated something after studying *Skintight*? The article says Diaz studied Menzel's voice via recordings, not *Skintight*. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Landau reaching out to eight male songwriters. The article says Landau scoured the internet and found eight women, not men. The question mentions male songwriters, so N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The award given to Aaron Lohr by Biden. The article says Biden gave Menzel a National Medal of Arts. Lohr isn't mentioned in that context. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The theme Menzel pitched to Landau initially. She pitched Julia Butterfly Hill's activism. The article states Menzel wanted to focus on bravery, but Landau was interested in retreating into nature. The central theme initially was Hill's activism. The question asks what beyond her time in the tree. The article says Menzel was drawn to bravery, so maybe the theme was environmental activism. But the question says "beyond her time spent in Luna" â€“ the article doesn't mention another aspect, so maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "initially pitched" before the collaboration. The article says Menzel approached Landau with Julia Butterfly Hill's story, so the theme was her tree activism. The question asks for what beyond the time spent (738 days), so maybe the environmental aspect? The question's phrasing is tricky. Since the article doesn't specify another aspect beyond the tree sit-in, perhaps N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Jesse's therapy. The article says Jesse is a gallerist grieving her son's death. The question asks what therapy similar to her husband's (who's a therapist) she undertook. The article doesn't mention Jesse's therapy type, so N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The play Menzel did before *Redwood*. The article says her last Broadway before *Redwood* was *If/Then* in 2014, but the question says "written by Diaz." Diaz is the songwriter for *Redwood*. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The song Menzel sang during the preview pause. The article mentions she led "Happy Birthday" and talked about "Rent" and "Wicked". "Let It Go" was mentioned as a song she's known for, but the question says it was intended for Alanis Morissette. The article says Menzel had a record deal where she thought she'd be the next Alanis Morissette, but "Let It Go" is from *Frozen*. The question might be a trick. The song intended for Morissette isn't specified, so N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Kristin Chenoweth's role. Chenoweth originated Glinda in *Wicked*, which Menzel sang parts of. So the answer is Glinda.

10. **Question 10**: The green-skinned character is Elphaba from *Wicked*, mentioned in the article as an example of fragility.

11. **Question 11**: The tech element for forest vistas. The article mentions over a thousand LED panels.

12. **Question 12**: The scenic road trip route was the Avenue of the Giants.

13. **Question 13**: The activist was Julia Butterfly Hill, whose story inspired the musical before shifting away from activism.

14. **Question 14**: The theater is Nederlander, where she debuted in *Rent*.

15. **Question 15**: The dance style is vertical performance with Bandaloop, combining singing and climbing.

16. **Question 16**: The first job was *Rent*.

17. **Question 17**: The character is Jesse.

18. **Question 18**: The award is the National Medal of Arts.

19. **Question 19**: The songwriter is Kate Diaz.
