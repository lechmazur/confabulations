Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article and answer exactly what's asked. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The article says Constellation's stock soared over 20% and closed up 25%, but there's no mention of analysts' predictions before the jump. So, no info on their initial predicted percentage. Answer: N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Goldman Sachs estimated power demand from data centers would increase 15% annually. But the question asks for terawatt hours by 2030. The article doesn't provide specific numbers, just the growth rate. So, N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The article doesn't mention which investment bank advised Calpine. It only says Energy Capital Partners took Calpine private. No bank named here. N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The article states the private deal was valued at $5.6 billion, not including debt. So the total value including debt isn't specified, but the question is about the original investment's value. The answer is $5.6 billion.

5. **Question 5**: Microsoft is funding the restart of the Three Mile Island reactor. The article mentions "a reactor," so that's one. Answer: 1.

6. **Question 6**: Constellation would sell assets to address antitrust concerns, but the question is about regulatory concessions in Texas specifically. The article doesn't specify Texas-specific actions beyond selling assets. Since the answer must be exact, N/A.

7. **Question 7**: No environmental group is mentioned opposing the deal. The article discusses concerns about emissions but no specific group. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The stock price closed up 25% from its previous day, but the actual share price before isn't given. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The Geysers is mentioned as a geothermal complex but not the number of plants. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Dominguez didn't provide a timeline for carbon capture. The article says companies need to figure it out quickly but no specific timeline. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The article mentions new, smaller reactors, but doesn't name a specific type. So N/A.

12. **Question 12**: The article says shares had more than doubled over the past year before the announcement. But the initial offering price isn't stated. N/A.

13. **Question 13**: Yergin talks about regulatory hurdles, but the question specifies beyond antitrust in Texas. The article doesn't mention specific Texas regulations except antitrust. N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Geysers' capacity isn't provided. The article mentions it as part of renewables but no megawatt numbers. N/A.

15. **Question 15**: Novotny mentions zero-emission nuclear and battery storage. The question asks for another type beyond battery. The answer is nuclear, but he already mentioned it. Wait, the question says "beyond battery storage," so maybe nuclear isn't new. Wait, the quote says "zero-emission nuclear to battery storage." So the other is nuclear. But the question asks what they will prioritize beyond battery storage. Since nuclear is already mentioned, maybe it's the answer. The question says "new type of zero-emission power generation beyond battery storage," so nuclear is already there. Wait, the article says "zero-emission nuclear... battery storage". So the other is nuclear. But the question asks for new type beyond battery. Since nuclear is already part of their existing assets, maybe the answer is N/A? Or maybe the answer is "nuclear" since it's part of the new company's priorities. The exact wording: "zero-emission nuclear to battery storage that will power our economy..." So the new company will prioritize nuclear and battery. The question is asking for the new type beyond battery, so nuclear. But the article says they already have nuclear (Constellation operates nuclear plants). So maybe the answer is N/A? Hmm. The question says "reflecting environmental stewardship," so maybe they are prioritizing nuclear again. But the answer should be "nuclear" but since that's already mentioned, perhaps the answer is N/A? Or maybe the question expects "nuclear" as the answer. Let me check again. The question says "what new type of zero-emission power generation, beyond battery storage, will the combined company prioritize..." The article says "zero-emission nuclear" so maybe that's the answer. The question is phrased as "new type," but nuclear isn't new, but maybe it's part of their focus. The answer is "nuclear".

16. **Question 16**: Dominguez mentioned natural gas and geothermal along with nuclear. The question asks for an alternative fuel besides natural gas that he mentioned as crucial for blending with clean energy. The answer is geothermal.

17. **Question 17**: Enverus says exposure to fluctuating commodity prices, specifically natural gas. But the question asks for another beyond natural gas. The article doesn't mention other commodities. So N/A.

18. **Question 18**: The deal is expected to close within a year from the announcement (Friday of the article's date). But the signing date isn't specified. N/A.
