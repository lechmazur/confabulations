Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the given article. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked and not infer anything beyond the text.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions that "Stereophonic" settled a copyright lawsuit before its run ended. It asks about a similar lawsuit for "An Enemy of the People." But the article doesn't mention any lawsuit related to "An Enemy of the People," so the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The article says the venue has 296 seats, designed by Rem Koolhaas and Richard Gluckman. Wait, Frank Gehry isn't mentioned here. The Pershing Square Signature Center is Gehry's, but Studio Seaview was designed by Koolhaas. So the answer is 296, but the question asks about Frank Gehry, who didn't design it. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The article lists "Hold On to Me Darling" last year (2023?) with Adam Driver, preceding "Danny and the Deep Blue Sea" in 2023? Wait, the article says "Hold On to Me Darling" last year (assuming 2023 if the article is recent), and "Danny" in 2023. Wait, the article says "Danny and the Deep Blue Sea" in 2023 and "Hold On to Me Darling" last year. If the article was written in 2024, "last year" would be 2023, so "Hold On to Me Darling" came before "Danny"? Wait no, the order in the text is "Danny and the Deep Blue Sea" in 2023, and "Hold On to Me Darling" last year (which would be 2023 if article is 2024). Wait, maybe I need to check again. The text says: "the company was among the producers of three profitable Off Broadway revivals -- an intimate "Sweeney Todd" in 2017, and two star-driven productions, "Danny and the Deep Blue Sea" in 2023, featuring Aubrey Plaza, and "Hold On to Me Darling" last year, starring Adam Driver." Wait, the order in the sentence is Danny 2023, then Hold On to Me Darling "last year". So if the article is from 2024, "last year" would be 2023, so both in 2023? But the question asks which preceded "Danny"? But according to the text, "Danny" was in 2023 and "Hold On..." was "last year" (2023?), so maybe the order is that "Hold On to Me Darling" came after? Wait, the way it's written: "two star-driven productions, 'Danny... in 2023' and 'Hold On to Me Darling' last year..." So "Hold On" was last year (before 2023?), but if the article is written in 2024, then "last year" is 2023. So they might be in the same year, but the question is which preceded "Danny". Since Danny is in 2023 and Hold On is last year (2023?), it's unclear. Maybe the answer is N/A because the article doesn't specify the exact order within the same year. Alternatively, maybe the article says "Hold On to Me Darling last year, starring Adam Driver" so "last year" before 2023? If the article is written in 2024, then "last year" is 2023, so Danny (2023) and Hold On (2023). The question asks which preceded "Danny and the Deep Blue Sea" with Aubrey Plaza. Since the article lists Danny first, maybe "Hold On to Me Darling" was before, but the order in the text isn't clear. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "immediately preceded", but the article doesn't mention the order, so N/A.

Wait, the question says "immediately preceded their production of 'Danny and the Deep Blue Sea' with Aubrey Plaza?" The article says "Hold On to Me Darling" last year (assuming 2023) and "Danny... in 2023". If both are in the same year, then maybe the order isn't specified, so N/A. Alternatively, perhaps "Hold On to Me" was in 2022 (if the article is 2023), so it preceded Danny 2023. But the article doesn't specify exact months. The answer might be "Hold On to Me Darling" but the question says "immediately preceded", but without dates, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "Hold On to Me Darling last year, starring Adam Driver" and "Danny and the Deep Blue Sea in 2023". If "last year" is before 2023, then Hold On was before. So answer is "Hold On to Me Darling". Let me check again. The article says: "two star-driven productions, "Danny and the Deep Blue Sea" in 2023, featuring Aubrey Plaza, and "Hold On to Me Darling" last year, starring Adam Driver." So the order in the sentence lists Danny first, but "Hold On" is "last year". If the article is from 2024, then last year is 2023, so they are in same year. But if it's from 2023, then "last year" would be 2022. The article's publication date isn't given, but since Seaview is planning to start shows this spring, maybe it's 2024. So if "Hold On" is 2023 and "Danny" is 2023, then maybe they are in same year, but the question is which came first. Since the article lists Danny first, perhaps that's the order, so the answer would be N/A, but maybe the article implies that "Hold On" was before. Not sure. Maybe the answer is "Hold On to Me Darling".

Wait the question is about what preceded "Danny...", so if "Hold On" was last year (2023) and "Danny" is also 2023, but "Hold On" was before, then answer is "Hold On to Me Darling". Alternatively, if "Danny" is in 2023 and "Hold On" is in 2022, then also yes. Since the article says "last year" for Hold On, and Danny is in 2023, so the answer is "Hold On to Me Darling".

3. Answer: Hold On to Me Darling

4. **Question 4**: The question is about Greg Nobile's Friki Tiki bar influencing the redesign. The article says Nobile runs Friki Tiki and that he leads Seaview. The article mentions Scott Pask's goal was to make it more intimate, but there's no mention of the bar's aspects influencing the design. So answer N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Second Stage is now at Pershing Square Signature Center for Off Broadway, but the question asks what else they're doing at Helen Hayes Theater, which they own. The article says they produce on Broadway at Helen Hayes with "Cult of Love" and "another production"? Wait, the article states: "Second Stage also produces on Broadway, primarily at the Helen Hayes Theater, which it owns, and where it is now producing the play "Cult of Love." So the only mentioned is "Cult of Love". The question asks besides "Cult of Love", what other production? The article doesn't mention another, so N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Netflix relinquish control to A24? The article says A24 purchased Cherry Lane, and Netflix assumed Paris Theater. The question asks why Netflix let go, but the article doesn't say. The article mentions nonprofits leaving due to costs, but the question is about Netflix's move. Since the text doesn't mention reasons for Netflix, answer N/A.

7. **Question 7**: After "Sea Wall/A Life", the second show in 2019-2020 was "Slave Play" as per the article. The question says "similar structured pair of monologues"â€”the article says "Sea Wall/A Life" was a pair of monologues. The other was "Slave Play", which isn't a pair. So answer "Slave Play".

8. **Question 8**: Scott Pask aimed to replicate a design element from Pershing Square Signature Center (Gehry's) in Studio Seaview. The article says Pask aimed for intimacy but doesn't mention elements from Gehry's design. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: "Lempicka" had a financial milestone like "Stereophonic" which recouped costs. The article says "Stereophonic" recouped and "Lempicka" was a flop. So answer N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Jana Shea's role in the lawsuit related to "Stereophonic". The article mentions she backed Seaview's founding but no info on lawsuit role. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The architect of the Frank Gehry theater (Pershing Square Signature Center) is Frank Gehry. The question is straightforward. Answer: Frank Gehry.

12. **Question 12**: Greg's bar in Financial District? The article says he currently has Friki Tiki in Hell's Kitchen, not Financial District. So N/A.

13. **Question 13**: Number of Broadway shows in 2023-2024 before acquiring Studio. The article says in 2020 they had 5 shows, and "this season" (current, maybe 2023-2024) they have 5. But before acquiring Studio, they were producing 5. The question is prior to acquiring, so 5? But the article says "this season" (when they acquired it), so maybe before that they had fewer? The article says "since 2020 the company has been half-owned by Sony... Seaview has become more prolific over the past two years: This season it is producing five Broadway shows..." So "this season" (when they took over Studio) is producing 5. The question is prior to acquiring Studio, which they just started leasing, so maybe the previous season had fewer? The article says "before the pandemic -- in the 2019-2020 season, it produced..." So the 2023-2024 would be "this season" with 5. But the question is "prior to acquiring", so maybe it's the same as "this season" which includes the acquisition. The article says "Seaview plans to begin presenting Off Broadway shows there this spring." So maybe the Broadway shows before acquiring would still be 5? The question is tricky. The article doesn't specify the exact count before acquiring, so N/A.

14. **Question 14**: The production that recouped after lawsuit involving Jeremy Strong. The article says "Stereophonic" settled and recouped. Jeremy Strong was in "An Enemy of the People", but there's no mention of a lawsuit there. So answer "Stereophonic".

15. **Question 15**: Cherry Lane's seating capacity. The article mentions A24 purchased it but doesn't give seating numbers. N/A.

16. **Question 16**: Previous owner of Helen Hayes Theater before Second Stage. The article says Second Stage produces there now but doesn't mention prior owner. N/A.

17. **Question 17**: Total funding from Sony since 2012. The article says Seaview raised $50M since founding, but Sony owns half since 2020. The question is Sony's contribution. The text doesn't specify Sony's portion. N/A.

18. **Question 18**: Seaview production directed by Sam Gold with limited run before London transfer. The article mentions "Romeo + Juliet" and "An Enemy" directed by Sam Gold, and "Stereophonic" which went to London. Wait, the article says "Stereophonic" announced it would tour and play London after recouping. So "Stereophonic" was directed by? The article doesn't mention director for "Stereophonic", but says Sam Gold directed the first show at Studio Seaview, which might be "Romeo + Juliet" (since that's mentioned as current). Wait the article says: "The first show, Nobile said, will be directed by Sam Gold, who led the revivals of 'Romeo + Juliet' and 'An Enemy of the People.'" So "Romeo" and "An Enemy" were directed by Gold. "Stereophonic" isn't mentioned with Gold. The article says "Stereophonic" recouped. The question asks which show directed by Gold went to London. If "Stereophonic" wasn't directed by Gold, then maybe N/A. Alternatively, maybe "An Enemy" or "Romeo"? The article says "Stereophonic" transferred to London, but directed by whom? Since the article states that "Stereophonic" recouped and would tour and London, but the director isn't mentioned. The answer would be N/A unless it's "Stereophonic", but director not Gold. Alternatively, maybe the first show at Studio Seaview (directed by Gold) is the one transferring. The first show there is not yet produced (they're planning to start this spring). So the answer might be N/A.

Wait the article says: "The first show, Nobile said, will be directed by Sam Gold..." So the first show at Studio Seaview (Off Broadway) is directed by Gold, but that's not yet produced. The question is about a Broadway production that transferred to London. "Stereophonic" was Broadway and went to London, but director not specified. The answer is N/A unless it's "Stereophonic" but without director info. Alternatively, maybe "An Enemy of the People" which was directed by Gold and went to London? The article says "Stereophonic" transferred, not "An Enemy". So answer N/A.

19. **Question 19**: Landlord is Trans World Equities Inc. as per the article.

20. **Question 20**: Actor in both "Danny..." and "Good Night, and Good Luck". The article mentions Adam Driver in "Hold On to Me Darling", and "Good Night" stars Clooney. "Danny" had Aubrey Plaza. So no overlap. "Good Night" with Clooney and "Danny" with Plaza and Driver. So N/A.
