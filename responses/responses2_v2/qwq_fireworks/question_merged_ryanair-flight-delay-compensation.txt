Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article. 

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions the traveler believes Ryanair owes them about 100 euros for expenses plus a flight. The expert says Ryanair actually owes 600 euros (250 each for two people plus 100 for expenses). But the question is about what Ryanair initially offered before the media office stopped responding. The text says the traveler asked for 100, but Ryanair's form required IBAN. The article doesn't state an initial offer amount, so maybe N/A? Wait, the traveler thought they were owed 100, but the expert says more. The article says "Ryanair owes you much more than that" implying they didn't offer the full amount. The initial offer isn't specified, so maybe N/A. Wait, the user might think the 100 is what they asked for, but the question is what Ryanair offered. Since the article says they got nonsensical responses and the form required IBAN but didn't offer alternatives, perhaps Ryanair didn't offer any amount, so answer N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The mother was in the customer service chat queue at number 200, but the app quit before she reached an agent. The question is how many hours she spent waiting. The article doesn't mention time spent waiting, just the queue position. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The hotel address given by Ryanair was full. The name isn't provided in the article, just that they were given an address. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The responses about IBAN were automated, but no name of the rep is given. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The trip was for spring break, but the article doesn't state when the study program concluded. It says they were heading to Italy for spring break, so maybe the flight was part of leaving Berlin, but exact month isn't given beyond March. The daughter was studying in Berlin when they left in March. The return flight was in May. The question is about when the study program concluded. Since they were going to Italy for spring break, maybe the study program ended in March? But the article says "Last March" they were heading from Berlin to Italy for spring break. So perhaps the study program concluded in March? Or maybe they were still studying there. The article doesn't say when the program ended. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The rescheduled flight was at 6 a.m., but the departure gate isn't mentioned. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The alternative hotel was nearby, but the number of other passengers there isn't stated. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The Flexi Plus terms required rescheduling up to 2.5 hours before departure. So the maximum window is 2.5 hours. The answer is 2.5.

9. **Question 9**: After Rome, the article doesn't mention another city. They planned to go to Rome for spring break. The question is about another city after Rome, but no info. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The reason for the initial delay isn't stated. The article says the flight was delayed for several hours and postponed but doesn't give Ryanair's reason. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The expert says the total is 600 euros (250 each + 100 expenses). The article states this, so the answer is 600.

12. **Question 12**: The flight was postponed to 6 a.m. and "took off at around 9 a.m." So the answer is 9 a.m.

13. **Question 13**: The form requires an IBAN code, which American banks lack. The answer is IBAN.

14. **Question 14**: The response said "You have used the incorrect form to log your request." So that's the phrase.

15. **Question 15**: Because Ryanair requires an IBAN which Americans don't have, so they need a service like Wise to get one. The answer is the IBAN requirement.

16. **Question 16**: The agent mentioned a 180 euro fee for changing over the phone. So 180.

17. **Question 17**: They paid 61 euros for the alternative hotel. The answer is 61.

18. **Question 18**: The second flight cost $908 total. The answer is 908.

19. **Question 19**: Ryanair might claim "extraordinary circumstances" to avoid compensation. The article mentions this possibility.

20. **Question 20**: The column is titled "Tripped Up." The article's byline mentions "Tripped Up" as the column name.
