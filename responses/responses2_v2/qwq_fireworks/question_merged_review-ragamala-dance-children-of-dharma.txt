Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to make sure I only use the given article. Let me start with question 1. The question is asking which character is described as embodying nature and balance through a choreographic motif involving a flexed foot raised during a devotional scene. The article mentions Krishna as the god of nature and balance, and in the description of Garrett Sour's portrayal, it says he balances with one flexed foot raised. So the answer should be Krishna.

Question 2 asks how the Tamil poetry section's emotional tone contrasts with the voice-overs. The article states that the voice-overs sound like a BBC documentary, which is dull, while the Tamil poetry is whispered and untranslated, retaining more mystery. So the contrast is that the Tamil part has more mystery compared to the dull voice-overs.

Question 3 wants to know the historical event influencing the cyclical conflict theme. The article references the Mahabharata's narrative structure, which includes cycles of conflict. The Mahabharata itself is the epic, so the answer is the Mahabharata's narrative structure. But the question says "historical event," which might be tricky. Wait, the article says "the Mahabharata teems with stories..." so the event is the war mentioned in the Mahabharata, like the war between the clans. The question implies that the theme of cyclical conflict comes from the Mahabharata's structure, so maybe the answer is the Mahabharata's narrative structure. Hmm, the question says "historical event," but the Mahabharata is a mythological epic, not a real historical event. The article doesn't mention a real historical event here. Maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "given its connection to the Mahabharata’s narrative structure." So the article implies that the cyclical conflict is from the Mahabharata's own structure. Since the question is about what the article implies influenced the focus, the answer would be the Mahabharata's narrative structure. But the question specifies "historical event," which might be a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the war in the Mahabharata is considered the event. The article mentions the war resulting from the dice game. Maybe the dice game and the war are the events. But the question is about the cyclical conflict theme. The Mahabharata's structure itself (cycles of harmony and disharmony) is the source, so maybe the answer is the Mahabharata's narrative structure. But since the question says "historical event," perhaps it's a trick and the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "the Mahabharata teems with stories... conflict and resolution that lead to more of the same." The cyclical nature is part of the epic's structure, so the answer is the Mahabharata's narrative structure. The question might expect that.

Question 4: The aspect of the score that undermines the dramatic tension despite rhythmic complexity. The review mentions that the "smooth surface" lacks disturbances, so the smoothness or lack of disturbances. The article says "most of what follows is a smooth surface untroubled by such disturbances." The disturbances mentioned were the Tuvan throat singing and Bulgarian harmony at the start. The rest being smooth might be the issue. The answer is the smooth surface or the lack of disturbances. The question is about the recorded score's aspect. The article says the recorded score is lovely but the tension isn't high because the surface is smooth. The answer is the smooth surface.

Question 5: Connects Ragamala's aesthetic to a critique of Bharatanatyam's composure over intensity. The article states that Ragamala's interpretation of Bharatanatyam emphasizes composure over intensity, leading to correctness without blazing clarity. So the answer is that their approach exemplifies Bharatanatyam's traditional emphasis on composure over intensity, which is the basis for the critique.

Question 6: The dissonance in the opening's role in foreshadowing unresolved conflicts. The opening has Tuvan throat singing and Bulgarian dissonance, but later it's a smooth surface. The dissonance might foreshadow but is then minimized. The article says the opening has disturbances, but the rest is smooth, so the dissonance's role is to contrast with the later smoothness, implying that the conflicts are not maintained. The answer is that the dissonance foreshadows but is then minimized by the smooth surface, so the dissonance's role is to introduce conflict that's later unresolved.

Question 7: How Garrett's Krishna portrayal relates to the company's limitation on emotional intensity. The article says Garrett plays Krishna with divine calm, balancing with a raised foot, and lurking in the background. The company's limitation is composure over intensity. So his portrayal exemplifies that limitation by being calm and composed, lacking intensity. So the answer is that his portrayal reflects the company's recurring limitation of calm composure over emotional intensity.

Question 8: The external dance tradition absent in West Coast Swing when contrasting with Lindy Hop. The article says West Coast Swing is descended from Lindy Hop but has few traditional markers of swing. So the tradition that Lindy Hop has, which is absent in West Coast Swing, is the traditional swing markers. But the question asks for an external tradition's absence. Wait, Lindy Hop is the ancestor, so the question is about another tradition. Wait, the question says "external dance tradition’s absence in West Coast Swing does the article indirectly highlight when contrasting it with Lindy Hop’s traditional markers?" Maybe Lindy Hop's traditional markers are the ones West Coast lacks. So the answer would be Lindy Hop's traditional markers. But the question is phrased as "external dance tradition," so perhaps it's referring to another tradition, but the text only mentions Lindy Hop as the ancestor. The article says West Coast has few traditional markers of swing, so maybe the answer is Lindy Hop's traditional elements. But the question says "external," so perhaps it's a different tradition. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait the article says "descended from the Lindy Hop, it has few traditional markers of swing." Wait, Lindy Hop is a swing dance, so the traditional markers of swing (like Lindy Hop's elements) are minimized in West Coast Swing. The question asks which external tradition's absence is highlighted. Since Lindy Hop is the ancestor, maybe the answer is Lindy Hop's traditional markers, but Lindy Hop is the direct ancestor. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is swing dance's traditional elements, but the article says "traditional markers of swing" so the answer is "swing's traditional markers." Wait the question says "external dance tradition" so maybe Lindy Hop is considered the external tradition here. The answer would be Lindy Hop's traditional markers. Alternatively, the article says "few traditional markers of swing," so the absence is the traditional swing elements, which are part of Lindy Hop. The answer is Lindy Hop's traditional markers, but the question says "external," so maybe Lindy Hop is the external tradition. So the answer is Lindy Hop.

Question 9: The instrument that weaves counter melodies with violin. The article says the recorded score has Krishna's flute braiding with violin and vocals, counter melodies and drumming. So the counter melodies are with violin and vocals, but the question is which instrument is highlighted with the violin. The flute and violin are mentioned as braiding, so the answer is flute. The question asks which instrument is highlighted as interlacing with the violin. Wait the question says "which instrument is described as weaving in counter melodies with the violin to enhance the recorded score’s texture?" The article says "Krishna's flute braiding with violin and vocals, counter melodies and rhythmically intricate drumming." So the flute is the instrument that weaves with violin. So answer is flute.

Question 10: The element used to evoke a forest despite minimalistic backdrop. The article mentions hanging strips of fabric conjure a forest; projections on that fabric suggest temples and palaces. So the answer is hanging strips of fabric.

Question 11: The character whose mother's sorrow is portrayed, losing 100 sons. The article says Gandhari is mother of the other clan whose 100 sons are killed. So the character's story is Gandhari's, but the question says the character whose mother's sorrow is portrayed. Wait, Gandhari is the mother, so the character's story is hers. The question says "tragic narrative linked with a character whose mother's sorrow is highlighted" – so the mother is Gandhari, and the character would be her son(s), but the question refers to the character's story marked by the loss of 100 sons. Wait, the question says "the character’s story, marked by the loss of one hundred sons, is highlighted in this context?" So the character is Gandhari, as her sons are the ones lost. The answer is Gandhari.

Question 12: The mythological figure with a flexed foot raised, epitomizing balance. The article says Garrett as Krishna balances with one flexed foot raised. So the answer is Krishna.

Question 13: The celebrated ballerina associated with Balanchine. The article mentions Maria Tallchief, a Balanchine muse, being celebrated by NYCB in her centennial. So the answer is Maria Tallchief.

Question 14: The dance style emphasized by Ragamala known for composure. The article says Ragamala's interpretation of Bharatanatyam emphasizes composure over intensity. So the answer is Bharatanatyam.

Question 15: The language of the whispered, untranslated poetry. The article mentions Tamil poetry, whispered and untranslated, retaining mystery. So Tamil.

Question 16: The instrument interlacing with flute and vocals. As before, the flute and violin are mentioned as braiding, so the answer is violin.

Question 17: The duo with sisterly complementarity. The article mentions Aparna and Ashwini in an early duet, crouching and standing. So the pair is Aparna and Ashwini.

Question 18: The Eastern European choral technique in the opening. The article says the show opens with Tuvan throat singing and Bulgarian harmony. So the answer is Bulgarian harmony (or Tuvan throat singing, but the question specifies the Eastern European technique. Tuvan is from Tuva, which is in Siberia, so maybe not Eastern Europe. Bulgaria is in Eastern Europe, so Bulgarian harmony, specifically the "piercing dissonance of Bulgarian harmony" is mentioned. The question asks for the technique, so "Bulgarian harmony" or "Bulgarian polyphony." The article says "piercing dissonance of Bulgarian harmony," so the technique is Bulgarian harmony. The answer is Bulgarian harmony.
