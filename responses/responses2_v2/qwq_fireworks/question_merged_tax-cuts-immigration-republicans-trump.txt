The article mentions the SALT deduction cap in the context of House Republicans from high-tax states like New York and New Jersey pushing to lift the cap.

The SALT discussion is part of a planned meeting in Florida but no individual senator is credited with this proposal here. So, answer N/A.

2. **How many billions in additional tax revenue would Trump's proposal to eliminate taxes on overtime pay generate according to the Congressional Budget Office?**  
The CBO estimated the cost of extending 2017 tax cuts at over $4 trillion, but there's no specific figure given for Trump's overtime tax proposal. The article says the cost would grow if that proposal is included, but no exact number. So, N/A.

3. **What percentage of House Freedom Caucus members indicated they would support the debt limit increase if paired with manufacturing incentives?**

11. **Given Representative Jason Smith's stance, what legislative outcome did Trump seemingly endorse on social media concerning the SALT deduction discussions planned for the Florida meeting?**

13. **Based on Senator Lindsey Graham's concerns and Representative Steve Scalise's warning about legislative packages, what specific type of manufacturing incentive did Republicans propose to include in the immigration-focused bill?**  
The article mentions manufacturing incentives as part of tax cuts but doesn't link them to the immigration bill. N/A.
