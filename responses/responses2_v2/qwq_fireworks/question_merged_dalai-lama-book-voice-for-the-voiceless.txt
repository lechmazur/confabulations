Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful and only use the information given, no external knowledge. Let me go through each question step by step.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which Chinese leader the Dalai Lama met with in 2015 regarding boarding schools. Scanning the article, I remember it mentions that the book discusses his meetings with Xi Jinping and others, but the specific year 2015 isn't mentioned. The article says he communicated until 2019 but doesn't specify a 2015 meeting with a particular leader. So, N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many autobiographies about his negotiations with China before this book? The article says he wrote two autobiographies but they were on ethics, Buddhism, etc., not specifically about negotiations. So the answer is 0.

4. **Question 4:** The successor the Chinese recognized in 2020. The article mentions China chose the Panchen Lama, but that's not the Dalai Lama's successor.

5. **Question 5:** Percentage of Tibetan kids in Mandarin schools. The article doesn't give a specific number, just mentions the policy exists. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Number of self-immolations since 2010. The article doesn't provide numbers, just mentions self-immolations exist. N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Award similar to Han Kang's. The article mentions Han Kang's Nobel but doesn't say the Dalai Lama got one. N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Governmental structure before exile. The article says he advocated cultural autonomy later, but initial vision isn't detailed. N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Location for next reincarnation. The article says "free world" outside China/Tibet. So answer is "outside Tibet or China."
