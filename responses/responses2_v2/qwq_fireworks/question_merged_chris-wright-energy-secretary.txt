Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article and answer exactly what's asked. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks what percentage of the DOE's budget under Wright's leadership is now dedicated to supporting companies converting wind and solar to hydrogen fuels, with a prior $60.6B in loans. The article mentions that under Biden, the Loan Programs Office gave over $60.6B in loans including projects like converting wind and solar into hydrogen. However, the current percentage under Wright isn't stated. The article says the DOE's budget is $52B, with 80% for nuclear, cleanup, etc. The rest might be for other projects, but there's no specific percentage for hydrogen. So I think this is N/A.

2. The second question is about the software from Pinnacle Tech that facilitated shale-gas. The article says Wright founded Pinnacle in 1992, which created software to measure fluid motion, leading to the shale-gas revolution. The name of the software isn't given, so answer N/A.

3. How many national labs are specifically mentioned as researching green hydrogen? The article says under Biden, the DOE supported projects like converting wind/solar to hydrogen, but doesn't mention specific labs. So N/A.

4. The Senate vote was 59-38. The supporters included all Republicans and some Dems. The question asks for the tally excluding Angus King. King is an independent who usually sides with Dems. The original count includes him as part of the 59 yes votes. If we remove his vote, the total becomes 58 yes (since he was part of the "smaller number of Dems"). The article lists the Dems who supported, including King. So original yes votes: 59. If King is excluded, then 59 minus 1 (King) equals 58. So answer 58.

5. The total value of conditional loans for restarting nuclear plants? The article states the office had $47B in conditional loans, but not specifically for nuclear. However, it mentions a project restarting a shuttered nuclear plant received part of the $60.6B finalized. But the question asks for conditional loans related to that. The article doesn't specify the amount for nuclear in conditional loans. So N/A.

6. The question about West Point clubs: the article mentions DEI section where West Point ended 12 clubs due to Trump's D.E.I. ban. But the question ties it to the Loan Programs Office reorientation. Since the DEI action was separate, the answer is 12, but the question links it to the DOE's Loan Office reorientation. Since the article doesn't connect them, it's N/A.

7. The podcast where Wright discussed the moral case for fossil fuels and impact on the poor. The article says he discussed this on a podcast, but the name isn't given. So N/A.

8. Migrants with Al Qaeda affiliations at Guantanamo? The article says 10 migrants with gang affiliations are held there, alongside those accused of Al Qaeda. Wait, the question asks how many have Al Qaeda ties. The article says "men accused of being members of Al Qaeda" were held there, but the 10 migrants are with gang affiliations. So the count for Al Qaeda isn't specified. The 10 are gang, others might be Al Qaeda but number isn't given. So N/A.

9. Closing stock price of Liberty Energy on the day of confirmation. The article says his shares were worth ~$47M based on Monday's closing. The exact price isn't given, so N/A.

10. Senator who cited USAID closure as reason to support Wright. The article mentions USAID closure was due to Trump's call, but no senator is named linking their vote to that reason. The listed Dems who supported didn't mention USAID in their statements. So N/A.

11. Which state's senators supported Wright despite his stance, given their renewable advocacy. The article lists several states: AZ, CO (Bennet, Hickenlooper), NH (Hassan, Shaheen), NM (Lujan, Heinrich), and ME (King). The question asks for states where senators supported despite his stance. The article mentions their support despite disagreement on climate. For example, NM's Heinrich is noted. The question might be looking for a specific state. The article says "many Democrats opposed... some Senate Dems joined... including... New Mexico's..." So New Mexico's senators are an example, but the question might need a state name. The answer would be New Mexico, but need to check if any other states are specifically highlighted. The question asks for "state's senators", so maybe one of the listed states. The answer could be New Mexico, but the article doesn't single out a specific state as the answer. The question might be looking for a state where both senators supported, but the info isn't clear. Since the question is asking for which state's senators were noted, perhaps New Mexico is correct. Wait, the article says "many Democrats opposed... some Senate Dems joined... including... Ben Ray Lujan and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico..." So New Mexico's senators are mentioned as supporters. So answer is New Mexico.

12. Number of Democratic senators who voted yes. The article lists several: Gallego (AZ), Bennet, Hickenlooper (CO), Hassan, Shaheen (NH), Lujan, Heinrich (NM), and King (independent but counted with Dems). Let's count: AZ:1, CO:2, NH:2, NM:2, plus King (counted as part of the Dems' side but he's not a Dem). The total Dems supporting: 1+2+2+2 =7, plus maybe others? The question says "the listed names and their affiliations". The article lists 8 names (including King?), but King is independent. The article says "all Republicans present and a smaller number of Democrats. The listed Dems are 7 (Gallego, Bennet, Hickenlooper, Hassan, Shaheen, Lujan, Heinrich). So answer is 7.

13. Funding to lithium mining under Biden. The article states the Loan Programs Office finalized over $60.6B including lithium mining. But the exact amount isn't specified. So N/A.

14. Which renewable did Wright prioritize alongside LNG? The question says he mentioned during hearing. The article states he said his priority was to "unleash" domestic energy including LNG and nuclear, and also mentioned supporting renewables like wind and solar. But the question asks what he explicitly prioritized alongside LNG. The article says his top priority was to "unleash" domestic production including LNG and nuclear. The renewables were mentioned as support but not as a priority. Wait, the exact quote: "his top priority was to 'unleash' domestic energy production, including liquefied natural gas and nuclear power. He also told Democrats that he believed climate change... support the development of renewable energy like wind and solar power." So the priority was LNG and nuclear. The renewables were additional support. The question asks what he explicitly prioritized alongside LNG. The answer is nuclear power.

15. Which national lab worked on geothermal with Liberty? The article says Liberty worked on geothermal and small nuclear reactors, but doesn't mention specific labs. So N/A.

16. Cold War cleanup project under Wright's leadership? The article says 80% of budget goes to maintaining nuclear arsenal and cleaning up Cold War messes, but doesn't name specific projects. So N/A.

17. Percentage of budget redirected to fossil fuels? The article doesn't mention any specific percentage changes under Wright, just his priorities. So N/A.

18. Which nuclear project funded by Biden was halted after Trump's order? The article mentions the Loan Office paused since Trump took office, and that under Biden they had funded two nuclear reactors in Georgia. But it doesn't say they were halted. The question asks which project was halted after Trump's order. Since the order was to restart export reviews, but the nuclear projects' status isn't specified as halted. So N/A.
