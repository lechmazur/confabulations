Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict instructions. Let me read through each question carefully.

1. The first question asks about the percentage reduction in whooping cough cases among vaccinated eight-week-old infants compared to unvaccinated ones, based on the CDC advisory committee's most recent clinical trials data. Scanning the article, I found a mention of the eight-week checkup where whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine is given, but there's no specific percentage provided for reduction. The article states that the vaccines are effective but doesn't give exact numbers here. So answer N/A.

2. The second question is about which former U.S. Surgeon General Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cited regarding hepatitis B vaccination timing. The article mentions Kennedy casting doubt but doesn't name any specific Surgeon General he referenced. So N/A.

3. The third question asks how many of the 32 million prevented hospitalizations were due to measles. The article says 32 million hospitalizations prevented by all vaccines, but it doesn't break down by disease. So N/A.

4. The fourth question is about the average ICU stay length for tetanus patients before Dr. Hoffman's case. The article mentions a child with tetanus in ICU for months but doesn't state an average or prior data. N/A.

5. Fifth question: Which trimester do maternal hepatitis A antibodies peak? The article says babies get immunity from mothers for hepatitis A, but doesn't mention trimesters. N/A.

6. Sixth question: Number of members on CDC's vaccine committee. The article mentions the committee has experts but no exact number. N/A.

7. Seventh question: Percentage of 1.1 million deaths in infants under 6 months. The article doesn't specify age breakdown of deaths. N/A.

8. Eighth question: Which vaccine had the highest efficacy in preventing brain damage in trials. The article mentions vaccines prevent brain damage (like from meningitis), but doesn't compare efficacy rates. N/A.

9. Ninth question: How many polio vaccine doses needed for full immunity per Dr. Thielen. The article says multiple doses over 18 months are needed, but the exact number isn't stated by Thielen. Dr. Hoffman mentions additional doses, but no specific dose count. N/A.

10. Tenth question: Annual chickenpox infection rate in unvaccinated 1-year-olds before the vaccine. The article states vaccines start at age one for chickenpox, but no specific rate given. N/A.

11. Eleventh question: Total hospitalizations without vaccines, given 32 million prevented. The article says vaccines prevented 32 million hospitalizations, so without them, it would be 32 million more. But the question asks for total over 30 years, which is exactly the 32 million. So the answer is 32 million.

Wait, let me check question 11 again. The question says "how many total hospitalizations would have occurred" without vaccines. The article states that vaccines prevented 32 million hospitalizations. Therefore, the implied total would be the 32 million that were prevented. So the answer is 32 million. But the question is phrased as "total hospitalizations... without vaccines", so it's exactly the number given. So answer is 32 million.
