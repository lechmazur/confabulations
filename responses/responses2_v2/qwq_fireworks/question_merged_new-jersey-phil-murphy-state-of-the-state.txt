Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one based solely on the provided article. Let me go through each question carefully and check the article for answers.

1. **Question 1**: Which Republican candidate for governor previously served as State Police superintendent during the enforcement slowdown period?
   - The article mentions Colonel Patrick Callahan as the superintendent during the slowdown. But the candidates listed are four Republicans, including a former Republican Assembly member who came close in 2021. The text doesn't say any candidate was superintendent. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2**: How many additional traffic fatalities occurred on NJ's two main highways during the first month after Platkin's report?
   - The article says crashes on the two highways increased after the slowdown. The first full month was August 2023, with 81% fewer tickets. But the question asks for fatalities, not tickets. The text doesn't specify the number of fatalities on those highways. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: What percentage of NJ school districts lack full-day kindergarten?
   - Murphy wants to make it mandatory in "the small number of towns that do not already offer it." "Small number" isn't a percentage. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: How many months of mifepristone stockpiled before Murphy's announcement?
   - Aides said a six-month strategic reserve had already begun. So the answer is 6.

5. **Question 5**: Total reduction in pedestrian fatalities from intersection overhauls?
   - The article mentions a 14% increase in pedestrian deaths, but the overhaul is a plan, so no data yet. Answer N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Which Trump official supported the cellphone ban?
   - The article doesn't mention any Trump official supporting this. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: How many candidates endorsed the 16-year-old voting plan?
   - The article lists candidates but doesn't mention their endorsements. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Funding mechanism for full-day kindergarten?
   - The article doesn't specify the funding source. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Which violation had the steepest decline?
   - The slowdown led to 81% fewer tickets for speeding, DUI, cellphone use, etc. The article says "cellphone use and other violations." But which was steepest? It doesn't specify. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Timeline for intersection overhauls by the new commission?
    - The commission aims for zero traffic deaths by 2040. The question is about the overhaul timeline. The article says "overhaul 10 most dangerous intersections" but no specific timeline. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Percentage decrease in tickets in September 2023?
    - The data given is for August (81% fewer). September isn't mentioned. N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Extra mifepristone for out-of-state residents?
    - The stockpile is for NJ providers. No mention of out-of-state access. N/A.

13. **Question 13**: Which budget allocation is redirected for kindergarten?
    - Bucco criticizes costly proposals, but no specific reallocation mentioned. N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Federal grant example of collaboration?
    - The article doesn't mention any specific federal grants. N/A.

15. **Question 15**: Legal precedent for overriding Callahan?
    - Murphy didn't cite a precedent. He just said he has the power to replace the superintendent. N/A.

16. **Question 16**: Percentage of abortions from restrictive states?
    - The article doesn't provide this statistic. N/A.

17. **Question 17**: Projected turnout for 16-year-olds?
    - No historical data from other states mentioned regarding turnout. N/A.

18. **Question 18**: Engineering firm for redesign?
    - The article doesn't name any firm. N/A.

I need to make sure I didn't miss any details. Let me double-check each answer against the text again. For example, question 4: "six-month strategic reserve" is explicitly stated, so that's 6 months. Others are all N/A because the info isn't there. Okay, that's all.
