Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the given article. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then check the article for the exact answers.

1. **Question 1**: The question is about Allison Kucharczyk's content that contributed to her fame surpassing her husband's, similar to the phallic lollipop incident. The article mentions that Allison shared her lifestyle as a professional athlete's wife with over three million followers. The phallic lollipop was flagged for sexual content. But the article doesn't explicitly state that her content had similar elements. Wait, maybe the question is implying that her content's provocative nature (like the lollipop's ambiguity) is what made her famous. However, the article says she surpassed her husband's fame by sharing her lifestyle. Since the lollipop was about sexual content, but her content isn't described as such, maybe it's N/A? Or is there a connection? The article doesn't link her content to sexual content. Hmm. The answer might be N/A because the article doesn't mention her content's specifics beyond sharing her lifestyle. So I'll go with N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The question asks about a therapeutic technique similar to Orwin's youth theater project that Brooke Eby used to manage her A.L.S. diagnosis. The article says Brooke joined a group of content creators documenting their disease progression. The youth project was therapy, so maybe documenting the disease is the technique? But the article doesn't use the term "therapeutic technique," it just says she documented her disease. Since it's not stated as a therapeutic technique, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question specifies "similar to the one Orwin used in her youth theater project." Orwin's was a "youth theater therapy project." So if Brooke's documentation is a form of therapy, but the article doesn't say it's therapy. So maybe N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The venue in Sheffield where Jax Valentine coached Orwin. The article mentions Valentine is in Sheffield, England, and calls in from their bedroom. So the venue is their bedroom. The question asks for the name of the venue, but the article just says "their bedroom in Sheffield, England." There's no name given, so it's N/A.

4. **Question 4**: TikTok-inspired activity besides the listed ones that mirrors the "beef and beauty" trend. The beef and beauty trend is about beef tallow-based cosmetics. Orwin's activities included doing TikTok dances. Wait, the article says she performed TikTok dances. The beef trend is about cosmetics made with beef tallow. The question asks for an activity that mirrors that trend. Maybe eating? But eating is listed. Wait, the question says besides eating, treadmill, and tumbler drinking. The other activity was dancing. But the beef trend is about beauty products. Hmm, maybe there's no direct match here. The article says she did TikTok dances. The beef trend isn't an activity but a product. So maybe N/A. Or perhaps "dancing" isn't related. The answer might be N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The community guideline that both the cucumber/phallic lollipop and the "boy apartment" trend violated. The cucumber and lollipop were shut down for sexual content. The "boy apartment" trend shows men's curated homes. The article says doctors aren't thrilled about the beef tallow trend but doesn't mention the boy apartment violating guidelines. Wait, the article says "men with meticulously curated homes are going viral... changing the way people think about male living habits." There's no mention of the boy apartment trend violating guidelines. So maybe the guideline about sexual content isn't related. Hmm. The question says what guideline did both violate. Since the boy apartment isn't mentioned as violating, perhaps N/A.

6. **Question 6**: User3361307021887's final comment and Vania Myers' sentiment on censorship. Myers said something about censorship being interesting. The user commented "Loved it." The sentiment about censorship might be Myers pointing out who gets to censor. The user's comment is just approval, not about censorship. So maybe N/A. The question says the same sentiment as Myers, which was about censorship nuance. Since the user's comment is positive, not about censorship, answer N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The number of followers Valentine had when they first met Orwin. The article says when they met in 2020, Valentine was 15 with 30,000 followers. So the answer is 30,000.

8. **Question 8**: The final debasing act that if done by men in curated homes would go viral. The article mentions the final act is a song and a debasing act, but specifics aren't given. However, the debasing act isn't described. The user might infer that the debasing act is something like self-deprecating or something, but since it's not specified, N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The first TikTok account name shut down during the show. The article says two accounts were shut down, first for a cucumber (sexual content), then a lollipop. The account names aren't provided, so N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The number of likes at the finale. The article states "more than 8,000 likes on TikTok" by the finale. The exact number isn't given, so N/A. Wait, the question asks "the number of likes shown... at the finale that the artist mentioned during the debasing act." The article says "more than 8,000 likes" but the exact number isn't specified. Since it's more than 8k, but not exact, answer N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Days the ban was stalled. The article says the executive order stalled it for 75 days. So 75.

12. **Question 12**: The young user who was the mentor, encountered in a theater therapy project. That's Jax Valentine. The article says Orwin met Jax during a youth theater therapy project. So answer Jax Valentine.

13. **Question 13**: New York venue where the live performance occurred. The article mentions SoHo Playhouse. So answer SoHo Playhouse.

14. **Question 14**: Food prop before another ambiguous item that caused shutdown. The cucumber was the first prop that led to the shutdown. The article says two accounts were shut down: first for a cucumber, then a lollipop. So the first was cucumber, which is the food prop before the lollipop. Answer cucumber.

15. **Question 15**: Which platform's rules did Orwin challenge by switching accounts? TikTok's, since she's using TikTok and switching accounts there. Answer TikTok.

16. **Question 16**: Numerical threshold for the debasing act. The artist promised to do something if she got 20,000 likes. The question says the threshold was 20,000.

17. **Question 17**: Political intervention causing app restoration. The article mentions incoming president Donald J. Trump indicated support, and after inauguration, he signed the executive order. So answer Donald J. Trump.

18. **Question 18**: Year Orwin met Valentine. The article says in 2020, so 2020.

19. **Question 19**: Branded beverage container. The Stanley Tumbler is mentioned as one of the tasks. So Stanley Tumbler.
