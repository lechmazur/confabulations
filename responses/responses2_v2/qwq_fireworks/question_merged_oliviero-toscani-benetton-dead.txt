Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict instructions. Let me start by reading through the questions and then cross-referencing each with the article.

1. **Question 1:** How many children did Toscani have with Kirsti Moseng before he followed in his father's footsteps?  
   The article says he had three children with Kirsti: Rocco, Lola, and Ali. But the question asks "before he followed in his father's footsteps." His father was a photojournalist, and Toscani trained at the Zurich School, so "followed in his father's footsteps" might refer to becoming a photographer. Since the children are mentioned after his career, maybe the timing isn't clear. Wait, the article states "His survivors include his wife, Kirsti Moseng Toscani, and their three children, Rocco, Lola and Ali. Mr. Toscani was married twice before and had three other children." So the three with Kirsti are after his career? The question is about before following his father's path. Since the article doesn't specify when he had the children with Kirsti, this might be N/A. Wait, maybe "followed in the footsteps" refers to becoming a photographer like his father. But the article says he was born in Milan, father was a photojournalist, and he trained at Zurich. The question is about children with Kirsti before that path. Since the article doesn't mention the timing of the marriages and children relative to his career start, maybe it's N/A.

2. **Question 2:** What ailment, similar to the one Toscani was diagnosed with, did David Kirby suffer from?  
   Toscani had amyloidosis. David Kirby was the AIDS patient in the ad. So AIDS is the answer here.

3. **Question 3:** What was the name of the exhibition in Zurich that Toscani attended, which featured a sweater, a week before his passing?  
   The article mentions "Museum fur Gestaltung Zurich for a major retrospective of his work called 'Oliviero Toscani: Photography and Provocation.'" The sweater isn't mentioned in the exhibition name. The question says the exhibition had a sweater, but the article doesn't specify that. Wait, the question might be a trick. The exhibition's name is "Oliviero Toscani: Photography and Provocation." The sweater part might be a distractor since the article doesn't mention a sweater there. So the answer is that name.

4. **Question 4:** What position did Toscani's father, Fedele, hold at the Benetton Group before Oliviero joined?  
   The article says Fedele was a photojournalist, but there's no mention of him working at Benetton. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** In what year did Toscani's controversial ad featuring death row inmates first appear in The New York Times?  
   The article says he left in 2000 amid an uproar over the death row ads. But the question is about when the ad first appeared in NYT. The article doesn't specify the year the ad was in NYT, only that he left in 2000. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** What was the profession of Therese Frare's father, who gave permission for the use of the colorized image of David Kirby?  
   The article mentions the Kirby family gave permission. Therese Frare is the photographer who shot the image. The question is about Therese's father's profession. The article doesn't mention her father. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** What was the name of the bridge that collapsed, prompting Toscani's controversial comment and subsequent firing from Benetton in 2017?  
   The article mentions a bridge collapse in Italy but doesn't name it. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** What fashion item, prominently featured in Toscani's 1991 interview with The Times, did he claim his advertising went beyond simply promoting?  
   In the 1991 quote: "I feel responsible to do more than to say, 'Our sweater is pretty.'" So the sweater is the item.

9. **Question 9:** Which Italian designer, mentioned in the article, was Toscani's classmate at the Zurich School of Applied Arts?  
   The article says he trained at Zurich School but doesn't mention classmates. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** What ailment was he noted to be battling?  
    The article says amyloidosis.

11. **Question 11:** What phrase appeared in a green box near the bottom right of the AIDS patient ad?  
    "United Colors of Benetton."

12. **Question 12:** Which artistic professional, known for his boundary-pushing campaigns, made the comment about the bridge collapse?  
    The article says Toscani made the comment, so his name.

13. **Question 13:** Which publication did he cite as evidence of advertising's influence in his interview?  
    The 1991 interview quote mentions The Times (NYT).

14. **Question 14:** In which month did the Zurich exhibition take place?  
    The article says he attended it in September, as it closed just over a week before his death (he died in August? Wait, the article says his death was announced on Monday, but the exact date isn't given. Wait, the article says he died on Monday, and in August he mentioned amyloidosis. Wait, the first paragraph says he died on Monday, and in August he told the paper about the diagnosis. So the death was after August. The exhibition was in September, as he traveled there in September, and it closed a week before his death. So the month is September.

15. **Question 15:** What military apparel did he use in a campaign?  
    "bloodstained uniform of a soldier killed in Bosnia-Herzegovina."

16. **Question 16:** On what day was he born?

    Benetton.

19. **Question 19:** Which designer remarked about his visual impact setting a standard?  
    Giorgio Armani, as quoted in the article.
