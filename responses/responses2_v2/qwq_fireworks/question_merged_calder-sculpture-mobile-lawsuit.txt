Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful and only use the information given, no external knowledge.

1. **Original sale price Pierre Matisse paid**: The article mentions that Pierre Matisse bought it directly from Calder, but the price isn't stated. So N/A.

2. **Museum displaying the mobile**: The article says Brodie is on the Detroit Institute of Arts board but doesn't say the museum displays the mobile. So N/A.

3. **Number of conservation experts between 2018-2019**: The text mentions a conservator in 2019 who did two reports (Nov and Dec). Also, another expert in 2021. Wait, but the question is between 2018-2019. The first was in 2018 when Brodie sent it for authentication, but that's not a conservation expert. The 2019 part has two reports by one expert? The lawsuit says in 2019, a conservator did the first report (Nov 2019) then another review by same or different? The text says "another conservation expert" in 2021? Wait, the article says in 2019, the first report was two pages, then Rower asked for another review, leading to the Dec report. So maybe the same expert did both? The question is total experts, so possibly 1 or 2? The text says "a conservation expert" in Nov 2019, then "the expert" again in Dec, so maybe one. Then another in 2021. But the question is 2018-2019. In 2018, when Brodie sent it, the article says the foundation returned it with damage, but that might be authentication, not conservation. So maybe only one expert between 2018-2019. So answer is 1? Wait, but the first time in 2018, maybe they did an authentication check but not a conservation report. The first conservation expert mentioned is in 2019. So total is two? Wait, the first report in 2019 (Nov) by a conservator, then same or another? The Dec report says "the expert" so same person. So total is 1 expert between 2018-2019. So answer 1.

4. **Length of first report**: The first report in 2019 (Nov) was two pages. The answer is "two pages".

5. **When Klaus Perls first acquired the mobile**: The article says Brodie bought it from Perls in 1994. The text doesn't say when Perls first got it. So N/A.

6. **Percentage of glass damaged in Dec 2019 report**: The report mentions many elements missing sections but no percentage given. So N/A.

7. **Auction house that tried to sell it last year**: The article mentions Brodie resumed efforts through an auction house last year (presumably 2023?), but the name isn't given. So N/A.

8. **Number of mobiles in the series**: The article says it's one in a series but doesn't state how many total. So N/A.

9. **Insurance value in 2018**: The article states the mobile was valued over $8 million but doesn't mention insurance value specifically. So N/A.

10. **Number of board members with Brodie**: The article says he serves on the board but doesn't state the number of other members. N/A.

11. **Who's authentication caused missing hardware**: The article says when Brodie submitted it for authentication in 2018, it was returned missing the hardware and a new break. The Calder Foundation did the authentication, so the answer is Calder Foundation or Rower? Wait, the question says "whose authentication process"—the process was done by the foundation. The article says "the Calder Foundation itself in 2018 when he submitted it for authentication. It was returned..." So the answer is Calder Foundation.

12. **Who initiated the second review**: The article states Rower "subsequently interceded and asked the conservator to review again at the foundation's expense." So the answer is Rower.

13. **Former ownership linked to famous artist**: The owner was Pierre Matisse, son of Henri Matisse, a famous artist. So Henri Matisse's son, but the question asks for the individual's name. The article says "Henri Matisse's son Pierre", so Pierre Matisse's ownership is linked to his father, a famous artist. So the answer is Henri Matisse (the father's name is mentioned as the famous artist).

14. **Monetary value before devaluation**: The article says the suit says it's valued over $8 million. The question asks before the intervention, so $8 million.

15. **Analogy involving Picasso damage**: The lawyer mentioned Steve Wynn, who damaged his Picasso. So Steve Wynn.

16. **Month and year of report noting missing glass sections**: The Dec 2019 report mentions the missing sections. So December 2019.

17. **Relative of Calder involved in authentication**: Rower is Calder's grandson. The question is who is implicated in influencing the process. The answer is Alexander S. C. Rower, Calder's grandson.

18. **Year of initial authentication submission**: 2018, as stated in the article.

19. **Designation of the report with sharp edges**: The December 2019 report is described as the one noting the sharp edges. The question asks for the report's designation. The article says "the December 2019 assessment" but doesn't give a specific name. Wait, the report is referred to as the one where the conservator wrote about the sharp edges. The text says the December 2019 report was the second one. The first was two pages. The second is the more detailed one. The designation might be "December 2019 report", but the question asks for the report's designation. The article doesn't name it. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says "the December 2019 assessment" but maybe the designation refers to the "second review" or "report". Since the question asks for the designation as per the text, perhaps the answer is "December 2019 assessment" but the exact term? The exact wording in the article is "December 2019 report" or "assessment". The question says "designation of the report". The report's designation might not be given. Alternatively, the article says the report mentions the sharp edges, so the designation is the one that noted the modifications. But the answer should be the exact term from the text. Since the question is about the report's designation (like name or title), but none is given except the date. So maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "the December 2019 assessment" so maybe "December 2019 assessment" is the answer. But the question asks for the designation, which might be the report's type. Alternatively, the report was part of the Calder Foundation's process, but the exact designation isn't given. Hmm. The text says "the December 2019 report" so maybe the answer is "December 2019 report". But the question might be looking for a term like "conservation report" but that's too generic. Alternatively, the answer is N/A because no specific designation is given beyond the date. Wait, the article says "the December 2019 assessment" so maybe that's the designation. Let me check the text again. The exact quote is: "according to the December 2019 assessment." So the designation is the December 2019 assessment. But the question says "designation of the report"—maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, the report is part of the foundation's process, but the exact name isn't given. Hmm. Maybe the answer is N/A? Or the designation is the December 2019 report. The question says "designation", which might not be a term used in the text. The article just refers to it as the report. So perhaps N/A. Wait, the text says "the December 2019 report" so the designation would be its date. But maybe the answer is N/A because there's no specific designation. Alternatively, the report is part of the authentication process, so maybe "conservation report". But the article doesn't say. I think it's safer to put N/A here unless the exact wording is present. Let me recheck: the question says "designation of the report that described...", the article says the December 2019 assessment stated that. The report's designation might not be given beyond the date. So answer N/A? Or the December 2019 assessment. The article uses "assessment", so maybe that's the designation. The question might be looking for that. So "assessment" as the designation? The question says "designation of the report"—maybe the answer is "December 2019 assessment". But the exact wording in the question's context might require it. Alternatively, maybe the report is referred to as the "second review" but that's not a designation. Hmm. I'll go with "December 2019 assessment" as the designation, so the answer is "December 2019 assessment".

20. **Confirmation essential for market value**: The article says the foundation's imprimatur (approval) is essential. The answer is Calder Foundation's authentication, so "Calder Foundation" or "foundation's imprimatur". The question asks whose confirmation is essential. The article says "without its imprimatur an artwork's value is diminished". So the answer is Calder Foundation.
