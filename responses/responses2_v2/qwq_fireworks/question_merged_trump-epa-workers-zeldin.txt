Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions. Let me start with the first question.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks how many EPA employees working on lead pipe replacement programs got termination notices. The article mentions that the 1,100 employees were in programs like lead pipe replacement, but it doesn't specify how many of them were in that exact program. So, since the exact number isn't given, the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The question is about which former Republican president had the highest EPA staffing levels. The article says staffing peaked in 2004 during George W. Bush's administration. So the answer is George W. Bush.

3. **Question 3:** The Office of Mission Support's memo about the intranet outage says the access was unavailable and tech specialists were working on it. The primary reason given was the outage itself, so the answer is "Access to work.epa.gov is current unavailable" (though there might be a typo in "current"). But the question asks for the reason stated, so that's the exact phrase.

4. **Question 4:** The article mentions two employees who received the email considered the resignation offer, but it doesn't say how many DEI staff were offered that. The number of DEI staff on leave is 15, but the question is about those offered resignation. Since it's not specified, N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The article states that many of the 1,100 were hired for new Congressional mandates like clean energy. But it doesn't give a percentage. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The union is consulting lawyers about firing based on agency priorities. The question asks for constitutional grounds. The article says cause can't be political affiliation, but doesn't mention a specific constitutional ground. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The staffing decreased from 17,611 in 2004 (Bush peak) to 15,408 when Trump started in 2017. The difference is 17,611 - 15,408 = 2,203. The article says "sharp dip during Trump's first term" but the question is between peak and start of Trump's first term. So 2,203.

8. **Question 8:** The email about the intranet was sent at 9:21 a.m. on Monday. The question is about the time Lee Zeldin finished his tour. The article says he engaged on his first day but no specific time. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The article mentions the Office of Personnel Management directed agencies to submit lists, but doesn't name a specific Congressional committee. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The 1,100 include those hired under Biden and experienced workers who transferred. But exact number of transfers isn't given. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Michelle Roos called it the most chaotic due to the Trump administration's actions, like firing probationary employees. The article states that as the reason. So the answer is the Trump administration's actions.

12. **Question 12:** The article mentions other agencies were directed but only EPA received notices. So N/A.

13. **Question 13:** The email says employees can't access documents needed for their jobs. The specific document type isn't mentioned. N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Legal recourse against Trump's lawsuits? The article says lawsuits lack merit but experts note harassment. The recourse would be defending against the lawsuits, but the question asks for the legal ground. Since it's not specified, N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Marie mentioned DEI staff on leave (15), next targets are environmental justice. But the number placed on leave isn't stated. N/A.

16. **Question 16:** The third initiative is greenhouse gas emissions projects via clean energy. The article says "funding clean energy projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions". So the answer is reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

17. **Question 17:** The spokeswoman said the goal was effective/efficient workforce. The exact quote: "the goal is to create a more effective and efficient federal work force".

18. **Question 18:** The location is Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, used for migrants with gang ties. The article states this.

19. **Question 19:** Trudeau linked Trump's comments to Canada's critical minerals. The answer is critical minerals.

20. **Question 20:** West Point ended 12 DEI clubs per Trump's ban. The action was ending student clubs.
