Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly based on the text and avoid any external knowledge. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question is asking for the percentage of stretch material in dress shirts according to Todd Snyder. The article says Todd Snyder mentioned fabric blends with cotton and stretch materials like spandex. However, there's no specific percentage given. So the answer is N/A.

2. The second question is about a brand Jim Moore styled that exemplifies the transition to streetwear influenced by "Mad Men." The article states that Jim Moore styles for brands like Todd Snyder, Hugo Boss, and Canali. Michael Fisher mentioned "Mad Men" leading to interest in dress shirts in the 2000s. But the transition to streetwear is linked to brands like Band of Outsiders. The question asks for a brand Jim Moore styled that shows the shift. The article says Band of Outsiders helped generate interest, but Jim Moore's styling for Hugo Boss might be the answer. Wait, the question mentions Michael Fisher's observations on "Mad Men's" influence. The transition to streetwear is separate. The question is phrased a bit confusingly. Let me check again. The transition to streetwear pushed office attire to casual. The brands mentioned for the 2000s are Band of Outsiders and Thom Browne. Since Jim Moore is a stylist for Todd Snyder, Hugo Boss, and Canali, maybe Hugo Boss is the answer? The question says "best exemplifies this transition." The text says streetwear pushed office back to casual. Maybe the answer is N/A because the question's specifics aren't in the text. Hmm, the article says "brands like Band of Outsiders and Thom Browne helped generate a new interest in dress shirts..." but the transition to streetwear is mentioned as a reason for casual wear. The question is about a brand Jim Moore styled that shows the transition. Since Jim works with Hugo Boss, but the article doesn't explicitly say Hugo Boss exemplifies that transition. So maybe N/A?

3. The third question is about the chemical process in no-iron shirts from the Wall Street era. The article says no-iron shirts were introduced in the late 1970s with a chemical process to prevent wrinkling. Brooks Brothers offers versions. The chemical process isn't named, so answer is N/A.

4. John Tighe mentioned purchases are for weddings and "special occasions like weddings" but the question asks besides weddings. The article says "weddings, said John Tighe... 'Today's guy... for his special event versus...'" The other example isn't specified beyond "special occasions" which includes weddings. Since the question asks for another specific one, it's N/A.

5. The collar that resurged, according to Jim Moore, which was in dot-com employees' wardrobes. The article says in the 2000s and 2010s, brands like Band of Outsiders did playful patterns, but the question is about the collar. Jim Moore mentioned point collars coming back, which he hadn't seen since the 90s. The dot-com era (late 90s) had relaxed attire. The question asks what collar was featured then. The article says the dot-com era's influence was relaxed, so maybe the point collar was not part of that. Wait, the point collar resurgence is now, but the dot-com era's style was more relaxed. The answer might be N/A because the collar type isn't linked to dot-com in the text. Alternatively, the article says the dot-com era's employees favored relaxed attire, so maybe no collar type is specified here. So N/A.

6. The no-iron shirt debuted in late 1970s. The question asks the year coinciding with "office-core" described by Nick Paget. The article says office-core is recent, while no-iron was late 70s. Since the question is conflating the two, the answer is N/A because the article doesn't link the debut year to office-core.

7. The fabric weave for quintessential shirts is poplin or twill. The question asks what Band of Outsiders used with playful patterns. The article says "quintessential dress shirts -- the kind often made of cotton in a poplin or twill weave -- is by no means extinct." Then mentions Band of Outsiders used playful patterns but doesn't specify the weave. So N/A.

8. Todd Snyder worked before his label at Ralph Lauren and J. Crew. The question asks which company mentioned in the context of no-iron shirts. The article lists Ralph Lauren, J. Crew, Brooks Brothers, Proper Cloth as offering no-iron. Since Todd worked at Ralph Lauren and J. Crew, the answer is either of those. The question says "mentioned in the context of still offering no-iron shirts." The text lists those brands, so the answer is J. Crew or Ralph Lauren. The question is which one he worked at. Since the article says he worked at Ralph Lauren and J. Crew before starting his own, the answer is both? But the question asks for a specific company. Since the question is phrased as "which company mentioned...", the brands offering no-iron are listed, so the answer is J. Crew or Ralph Lauren. The question is asking which of those companies he worked at. The answer would be both, but since the options are listed, perhaps the first one mentioned in the list (Ralph Lauren) is the answer? Wait, the question says "mentioned in the context of still offering no-iron shirts" — the article mentions Ralph Lauren, J. Crew, etc., so the company he worked at before his own label is either Ralph Lauren or J. Crew. The article says "worked at Ralph Lauren and J. Crew before starting his own namesake men's wear label." So the answer is both, but the question requires a specific one. The question says "which company", so perhaps either is acceptable, but the first one mentioned in the text's list is Ralph Lauren. However, the question might be looking for J. Crew. Alternatively, since the question says "still offering no-iron shirts" and the brands listed include Ralph Lauren and J. Crew, either is correct. Since Todd worked at both, the answer would be either, but the question might expect J. Crew? Hmm, I'll go with J. Crew since the question is about the company mentioned in the context of no-iron. Wait, the text says "Ralph Lauren, J. Crew, Brooks Brothers, Proper Cloth — still offer versions." So all are mentioned, but Todd worked at Ralph and J. Crew. Since the question is asking which company he worked at before starting his label, the answer is both, but since the options must be one, perhaps the answer is J. Crew? Wait, the question is phrased as "which company mentioned in the context of still offering no-iron shirts..." so any of the four. Since the question is which one he worked at, the answer would be either Ralph Lauren or J. Crew. The question is asking for the specific company mentioned in the no-iron context that he worked at. Since both are mentioned, but the question wants one, perhaps the answer is J. Crew? Or maybe it's N/A because the question is phrased as "which company mentioned in the context..." and Todd worked at both. Hmm, maybe the answer is J. Crew? Alternatively, since the article lists Ralph Lauren first, maybe that's the answer. Wait, the question is "which company, mentioned in the context of still offering no-iron shirts, was where Todd Snyder worked before he started his own label?" So the answer is either Ralph Lauren or J. Crew. The question expects one answer, so perhaps the first one listed in the text? The article says "Ralph Lauren, J. Crew, Brooks Brothers, Proper Cloth — still offer versions." So Ralph Lauren is first. Since Todd worked at both, but the question requires one, perhaps the answer is Ralph Lauren. But maybe the user expects J. Crew? I'm confused. Alternatively, since the question is about the company mentioned in the context of no-iron shirts (they are all mentioned there), and he worked at both, perhaps the answer is either. Since the question requires one, maybe the answer is Ralph Lauren. But I'm not sure. Maybe it's N/A because the question is about a specific company mentioned in the no-iron context where he worked, and both are valid. Hmm, perhaps the answer is N/A because the question is asking for a specific one and both are possible. Alternatively, since the question is about the company mentioned in the context (the paragraph where no-iron is discussed mentions Ralph Lauren first), perhaps that's the answer. I'll go with Ralph Lauren as the answer here.

9. Sean Estok said customers buy one or two instead of 50. The answer is 1 or 2. The question asks "how many dress shirts did Sean Estok say customers are typically buying at once". The exact quote is "refreshing one or two", so the answer is 1 or 2. The question says "how many"—so answer is "one or two", but the instructions say to prefer sentence fragments. So "1-2" or "one or two". The answer should be "one or two".

10. The trend forecasting agency where Nick Paget works is WGSN. The article says "Nick Paget, the senior men's wear strategist at WGSN...". So the answer is WGSN.

11. Todd Snyder said in the early 2000s they didn't look at stretch fabrics, but now men want to move. The question is asking what fabric innovation he attributed to the early 2000s as a reason men rejected dress shirts. The answer would be "no stretch fabrics" or "non-stretch materials". But the question is about the innovation they rejected. The article says "In the early 2000s, we'd never look at stretch fabrics, but now men want to move". So the innovation they didn't use before (so the lack of stretch was the reason men rejected?) Maybe the answer is "no stretch fabrics" but phrased as the innovation they didn't use. The question is phrased as "fabric innovation did Todd Snyder attribute to the early 2000s as a reason men rejected dress shirts". Wait, actually, the article says that in the early 2000s, they didn't use stretch fabrics, implying that men rejected dress shirts because they were not stretchy. So the innovation they started using now (stretch) is the reason men are returning, but the lack of stretch in the early 2000s was why they rejected. The question is asking what Todd Snyder attributed to the early 2000s as the reason men rejected. The answer would be "absence of stretch fabrics" or "non-stretch materials". But the question says "fabric innovation"—stretch is the innovation. Since they didn't use stretch then, the innovation (stretch) wasn't present, so the answer is "absence of stretch fabrics" but the question is phrased as the innovation they attributed. Maybe the answer is "stretch fabrics" but that's the current innovation. The question is tricky. The answer is N/A because the article says they didn't use stretch in early 2000s, leading men to reject shirts, so the innovation they lacked was stretch. But the question is about the innovation from that era (which was absence of stretch). Since "fabric innovation" refers to the innovation that caused rejection, which was the lack of stretch, but the question is phrased as the innovation they attributed. The answer might be "non-stretch fabrics" but the exact term used is "stretch materials". So the answer is "stretch fabrics" as the innovation not used then, leading to rejection. Wait, the question is asking what Todd Snyder attributed to the early 2000s as the reason men rejected. He said that in the 2000s, they didn't use stretch, and now men want to move (so stretch is the reason they are returning). So the reason men rejected before was the lack of stretch. The fabric innovation he's referring to as the reason for rejection is the absence of stretch, but the innovation (stretch) wasn't present then. Since the question asks for the innovation in the early 2000s that caused rejection, perhaps the answer is "non-stretch fabrics" but the exact term from the text is "stretch materials like spandex". So the innovation they didn't use was stretch, so the reason for rejection was the absence of stretch. The answer should be "lack of stretch fabrics" but the question says "fabric innovation"—maybe the answer is "stretch fabrics" as the innovation they didn't have then. Hmm. Maybe the answer is "stretch fabrics" because that's the innovation that wasn't present in the early 2000s. So the answer is "stretch fabrics".

12. The question asks which company's creative director incorrectly predicted that dress shirts would return to 50 per closet due to post-pandemic office mandates, according to Sean Estok. The article says Sean Estok from Macy's said customers aren't buying 50 shirts anymore. The question is about someone who thought they would. The article mentions John Tighe (Tailored Brands) says purchases are for special events, not daily. The text says "Sean Estok... 'Customers aren't buying four... they're refreshing one or two. They don't need a closet to have 50... because office life is not the same.'" So Sean is the one pointing out that they don't need 50, implying someone else thought they would. The question is which creative director's prediction was wrong. The article doesn't mention anyone predicting 50 shirts, so the answer is N/A.

13. The no-iron shirts debuted in the late 1970s, but the dot-com era (late 90s) had relaxed attire. The question asks how the no-iron shirts contradicted the dot-com era's influence. The dot-com era's preference was for relaxed clothes, so the no-iron shirts (which were for formal) contradicted that. The answer would be "their formal nature" or "they were meant for formal wear". But the exact answer must be from the text. The article says "the focus on Wall Street wardrobes had been eclipsed by an interest in the relaxed attire favored by office workers of another kind — employees of what were then known as dot-com companies." So the no-iron shirts (from 1970s) were part of formal wear, conflicting with the casual dot-com style. The answer is that no-iron shirts were formal while dot-com preferred casual. The question asks how they "directly contradict", so answer is "they were formal" but the exact wording? The article doesn't state this directly, so N/A?

14. The question asks which TV show's costume design was falsely credited by Michael Fisher as reviving 1980s-style instead of 1960s. The article says Michael Fisher of Fashion Snoops mentioned "Mad Men" and its 1960s-era wardrobes helped in the 2000s. If someone else (maybe the question's answer) thought it was 1980s, but Fisher linked it to 1960s. The question says "falsely credited by Michael Fisher" which would mean Fisher himself made the mistake. The text says Fisher said "Mad Men" influenced with 1960s, so perhaps the question is a trick. Alternatively, maybe another show. The article doesn't mention another show, so N/A.

15. Jim Moore associated a chemical process from the 1980s with Thom Browne's 2000s collections. The chemical process from the 1980s was the no-iron treatment. The article says Jim Moore worked with Thom Browne but doesn't mention him linking the chemical process. The question is about a mistake Jim made. The article says Jim mentioned the 1980s no-iron shirts. The text says "Thom Browne's 2000s collections" used playful patterns, but the chemical process (no-iron) was from the 1970s/80s. The question says Jim mistakenly linked the chemical process to Thom's 2000s. The article doesn't state that Jim did this, so N/A.

16. The brand that first marketed untucked shirttails as part of 1970s dot-com collection. The article mentions the 1970s no-iron shirts, but untucked shirttails are mentioned in the context of permutations of dress shirts: "Versions designed to be worn with their shirttails hanging out, for example, or the no-iron shirts introduced in the late 1970s..." So the untucked style was part of the 1970s, but the dot-com era was later. The question says "dot-com workplace collection" which was in the late 90s. The article doesn't specify which brand first did untucked shirttails, so N/A.

17. The designer who collaborated with Hugo Boss on polka-dot shirts, but misattributed to Band of Outsiders. The article mentions Todd Snyder works with Hugo Boss, but the only mention of polka dots is in the first paragraph: "dress shirts -- solid, striped, plaid, polka dot." But no collaboration details. The question's answer isn't in the text, so N/A.

18. Nick Paget incorrectly cited the peak of "office-core" as the 1980s Wall Street era, conflating with no-iron shirts. The article says office-core is recent, while no-iron was 1970s. The question asks the year he cited. The text says "office-core... has helped rekindle an interest" recently. If he cited the 1980s as the peak, but the article doesn't say he did that. The text says Nick Paget linked office-core to white-collar cosplay, not a specific year. So N/A.
