merged_trump-ev-charger-funding-freeze.txt
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and follow the strict format. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks which state halted projects including 60 charging ports across 11 locations, despite already building four. Scanning the article, Vermont's policy director Patrick Murphy mentions they built four ports at one location and had 11 new projects for 60 ports that won't proceed. So Vermont is the answer here.

2. Next, how many companies were named as receiving NEVI contracts in Trump-aligned states? The article mentions Love's, an Oklahoma-based company, as a major recipient. No other companies are named, so the answer is 1.

3. The total dollar difference between allocated funds and spent: The program had $5 billion allocated, with $3.3 billion allocated to states. Out of that, $40 million was spent. Wait, the article says "about $3.3 billion has been allocated to states. Of that, $511 million has been awarded in contracts but only $40 million has been spent." So the total allocated to states is $3.3B, spent is $40M. The difference would be $3,300,000,000 minus $40,000,000 equals $3,260,000,000. But the question might be asking the total allocated (5B) vs total spent (40M), which would be 4,960,000,000. Wait, the article says "states were to receive $5 billion" but only $3.3B allocated so far. The question says "allocated funds to states" versus "actually spent". So the difference is $3.3B - $40M = $3,260,000,000. But the question might be phrased differently. Let me check again. The article says "To date, about $3.3 billion has been allocated to states. Of that, $511 million has been awarded in contracts but only $40 million has been spent." So the total allocated to states is $3.3B, and spent is $40M. The difference is 3,300,000,000 minus 40,000,000 = 3,260,000,000. So the answer should be $3.26 billion, but the question asks for the total dollar amount difference. The article might present it as "3.3B allocated to states minus 40M spent" so the difference is $3,260,000,000. But maybe the question is asking between the total $5B and the spent? The question says "allocated funds to states and the amount actually spent". The $5B is the total authorized, but allocated to states is $3.3B. The answer is $3,260,000,000. But the article might present it as $5B vs $40M? Wait, the first sentence says the program was to give states $5B, but only $3.3B has been allocated so far. The question says "allocated funds to states" so that's $3.3B minus $40M. So the answer is 3,260,000,000. But the question says "total dollar amount difference between the NEVI program's allocated funds to states and the amount actually spent" so 3.3B - 40M = 3,260,000,000. So the answer is $3,260,000,000. But maybe the article uses a different figure? Let me check again. The exact numbers: "about $3.3 billion has been allocated to states. Of that, $511 million has been awarded in contracts but only $40 million has been spent." So allocated to states is 3.3B. The spent is 40M. The difference is 3,260,000,000. So the answer is $3.26 billion. But the question might want the exact numbers written as in the article. Let me write it as 3,260,000,000 or in billions? The article uses $511 million and $40 million, so perhaps the answer is $3.26 billion. But the question says "difference", so the exact figure is 3.3B minus 40M is 3,260,000,000. So that's $3,260,000,000. But the article says "allocated to states" is $3.3B, so that's the key.

4. The state that halted projects after awarding 11 projects for 60 ports. That's Vermont again, same as question 1.

5. The state with a Republican governor who supported 19 stations but now has uncertainty. The article mentions Ohio's governor Mike DeWine (Republican) welcomed federal money for 19 stations. The spokesperson Breanna Badanes said they're unsure. So Ohio is the answer here.

6. The memo was signed by Emily Biondi, an associate administrator at the U.S. Transportation Department. So the agency is the U.S. Transportation Department (USDOT).

7. The state continuing efforts despite the suspension: Tennessee's department spokeswoman said they'll continue finalizing contracts and planning. So Tennessee.

8. The memo's date was Feb 6, so the day is February 6th, but the question asks for the day (like Monday?), but the article just says Feb 6, so answer is Feb 6.

9. The presidential administration causing the halt is Trump's, as the memo aligns with his opposition to EV support.

10. The program suspended is the NEVI program, the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program.

11. The amount spent is $40 million.

12. The analysis is from Loren McDonald of Paren, the EV analytics company.

13. The company is Love's, the Oklahoma-based truck stop company.
