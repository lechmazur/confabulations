Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information given and don't infer anything beyond what's stated.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions the Fed's projections for this year indicate bringing rates down to 3.75% to 4%. But the question is about the target rate at their final 2024 meeting. The article says they "pressed pause on rate cuts" after that meeting, so the target range at that meeting might still be the previous one. Wait, the article says "unanimously pressed pause on rate cuts and now appear unified...", so maybe the final 2024 meeting was when they paused. The projection for this year's end is 3.75-4%, but the target at the final 2024 meeting might be higher. Hmm, the article says "they wrapped up their final meeting of 2024 with splits... given strong economic growth..." but after that, they pressed pause. The exact rate range at the final meeting isn't stated, but maybe the projections mention the current rate before cuts? Wait, the December projections said half a percentage point in cuts this year, implying the starting point was higher. But the question is about the 2024 final meeting. The article doesn't explicitly state the target rate at that meeting. The answer might be N/A, but maybe the 3.75-4% is after the cuts, so the previous rate was higher. But without exact info, maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "the central bank needed to assess... policies" at their final meeting, but the target rate isn't given. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The article says the Fed wrapped up their final 2024 meeting with splits, then later pressed pause unanimously. The question is how many consecutive meetings before the unanimous decision. The article doesn't mention the number of prior meetings. It says "weeks later" they pressed pause. So no info, so N/A.

3. **Question 3**: During Trump's previous presidency (the first trade war), inflation was below 2%, as stated: "inflation was consistently below the Fed's 2 percent goal". So the answer is inflation.

4. **Question 4**: The article says Canada and Mexico "narrowly avoided steep tariffs" but doesn't mention a specific percentage reduction. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The Fed's strategy to monitor inflation expectations... The article mentions Ms. Daly says they need to see scope, magnitude, timing, but when did they first announce this? The article doesn't specify a date for the strategy announcement. The context is current, but the question asks when they first announced it. Since the article doesn't state a date, N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Businesses' latest sentiment survey growth rate? The article says "no sign of weakness" and businesses are "more optimistic now than in the latter half year". But no specific growth rate is given. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: In 2019, the Fed cut rates three times over consecutive meetings. Each cut's size? The article says "lowered interest rates three times over consecutive meetings in the summer and fall of 2019". The total was three times, but each time by how much? The article says "a full percentage point last year" (which might refer to 2023?), but for 2019, it doesn't specify per-meeting cuts. The total was three cuts, but the question asks for the summer of 2019. The article mentions "three times over consecutive meetings" but not the total basis points. Since each Fed meeting typically cuts 25 basis points, three times would be 75 basis points. Wait, but the article says "lowered rates three times over consecutive meetings" but doesn't specify the total. However, the article says in 2019, the Fed "lowered rates three times over consecutive meetings... insurance against the economic impact of his trade war." The total was three cuts, but the question is about basis points. If each was 25bps, then 75. But the article doesn't confirm that. Since it's not explicitly stated, but the answer might be 75 (assuming 25 each). Wait, the article says "lowered rates three times over consecutive meetings", but the exact amount per cut isn't given. The user instructions say to answer only based on the text. Since the text doesn't specify, maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "three times over consecutive meetings in the summer and fall of 2019, action that was later billed as taking out 'insurance'". The total cut in 2019 was 75 basis points? The article says "a full percentage point last year" (maybe 2023?), but the 2019 cuts might have been 3 times 25 = 75. But since the article doesn't state the exact number, maybe N/A. Hmm, tricky. The article says "three times over consecutive meetings", but each cut's size isn't given. So answer N/A.

8. **Question 8**: What inflation target would trigger action? The article says Fed must act if inflation expectations get "unmoored". The target is when expectations are getting unmoored. The exact trigger is "if there are signs that expectations of inflation are getting unmoored". The question asks for the inflation target that would trigger action. The Fed's target is 2%, but the trigger is when expectations are moving away from that. So the answer is when inflation expectations become unmoored.

9. **Question 9**: How many voting members supported the December projection? The article says "unanimously pressed pause" but the December projections had "broad support". The question is about the number of voting members who supported the December projection. The Fed has 12 members (5 governors + 12 regional presidents, but only 5 regional have votes each year). The article says "broad support" but doesn't give a number. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Revised baseline job growth figure? The article mentions the January jobs report and economists expect slower growth than the 256k in December, which was after annual revisions. The revised baseline would be the 256k? Or the revised figure? The article says "reflecting annual revisions", so the 256k was the previous month's (December) number. The question is the revised baseline, which might be the new revised figure. But the article doesn't state the exact number after revisions. The expected figure is slower than 256k, but the actual revised baseline isn't given. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Projected rate range after reduction. The December projections indicate bringing rates to 3.75-4% after cuts this year. So the answer is 3.75-4%.

12. **Question 12**: Fraction for rate cuts this year. The article says "half a percentage point in cuts this year". Half a percent is 0.5%, so 50 basis points. The fraction is half (or 0.5 percentage points).

13. **Question 13**: Persistent measure above target leading to caution. The article says inflation is still above 2%, which is the target. So inflation.

14. **Question 14**: Number of trading partners avoiding tariffs. The article mentions Canada and Mexico, so two.

15. **Question 15**: Triad of considerations. The article says Daly mentioned "scope, magnitude and timing".

16. **Question 16**: Singular action during past trade wars. The article says in 2019, the Fed cut rates three times consecutively. The present strategy is to wait, so the past action was three consecutive cuts.

17. **Question 17**: Labor market attribute. The article says "labor market with 'no sign' of weakness".

18. **Question 18**: Month's report critical. January's jobs report, as mentioned.

19. **Question 19**: Fiscal measure part of Trump's policies. The article mentions "large-scale deportations, reduced regulation and lower taxes" as part of his policies. So lower taxes.

20. **Question 20**: Rate change magnitude supported. The December projections said half a percentage point, so 0.5% or 50 basis points.
