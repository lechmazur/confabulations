Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by reading through each question and then check the article for the answer.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks for the trading volume in millions of dollars during the first week after Donald Trump Jr. joined. The article mentions that Kalshi has seen about $2 billion in betting volume, but it doesn't specify the period after Trump Jr. joined. Since there's no specific timeframe given for that week, the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The question is about which major investment bank first integrated Kalshi's markets after the CFTC ruling. The article says Interactive Brokers and Robinhood offered their own contracts, but it doesn't state which was first. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Total percentage increase in user base after the court decision. The article doesn't provide user numbers before or after, only contract numbers. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The analyst who used Polymarket data. The article doesn't mention any specific analyst's name, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** How many platforms got CFTC approval before Kalshi. The article states Kalshi was first, so the answer is 0.

6. **Question 6:** Minimum deposit required. The article doesn't mention any deposit amounts, so N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The venture capital firm leading the funding. No info on funding rounds, so N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Consecutive months outperforming polls before 2024 election. The article mentions the 2024 election showed Kalshi's accuracy but not the duration, so N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Percentage of contracts related to politics at Trump Jr.'s appointment. The article says 908 active contracts but no breakdown by category. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Number of compliance officers hired after Pham's appointment. The article doesn't mention this number. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The company with $2B volume and 2M downloads aiming for trillion-dollar asset class. The article clearly states Kalshi here. Answer: Kalshi.

12. **Question 12:** The enterprise that overcame CFTC objections and hired a political figure's relative. Kalshi hired Trump Jr., so Kalshi.

13. **Question 13:** Platform with contracts from 290 to 908 and first to allow US bettors. The article says Kalshi was first, so Kalshi again.

14. **Question 14:** Entity constrained by CFTC but now integrating with brokerages. Kalshi, as per the CFTC lifting restrictions. Answer: Kalshi.

15. **Question 15:** Company using a political figure's son to aid financial market transition. Kalshi hired Trump Jr., so Kalshi.

16. **Question 16:** Firm opening to 160M stockholders via brokerages. The quote mentions Kalshi's goal, so Kalshi.

17. **Question 17:** Organization using brokerage integration for political contracts. Kalshi is mentioned with broker integrations, so Kalshi.

18. **Question 18:** Enterprise with 2M downloads and trillion-dollar goal. Kalshi again.

19. **Question 19:** Platform overcoming CFTC objections with Interactive Brokers. Kalshi, since they mention Interactive Brokers as part of others offering contracts. Answer: Kalshi.

I need to ensure that each answer is directly from the text. For example, question 5 says Kalshi was first, so the answer is 0. Others like 11-19 all point to Kalshi. The rest where data isn't provided are N/A.
