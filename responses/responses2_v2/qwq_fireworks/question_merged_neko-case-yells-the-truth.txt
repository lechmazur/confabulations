Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the provided article and answer each exactly as per the instructions. Let me start with the first question.

1. What type of cancer did Neko Case's mother claim to have, leading Neko to struggle with recalling the information at the gynecologist?

The article mentions Neko's mom faked having cancer. She told Neko different types—ovarian and cervical—but didn't have both. The answer is both ovarian and cervical, but since the question asks for the type she claimed, maybe it's both. Wait, but the user wants the exact type. The article says she "used faking having cancer to get away from me as a way to disappear herself from your life." The specific types are ovarian and cervical, but since she gave different answers, the answer is both? But the question is about the type she claimed. Since she mentioned both, maybe the answer is "ovarian and cervical".

2. In what city did Caitlin McCormick meet Soph, prompting her to share her estrangement story earlier than usual, specifically on their third date?

The essay says Caitlin met Soph in a red-lit wine bar in the "Wes Village". Wait, the text says "Wes Village" but that might be a typo. Maybe West Village in New York City? The article says "the Wes Village" but probably a typo for West Village. The city is New York.

3. What nonprofit organization, focused on helping children discuss abuse, did Neko Case's friend, who validated her feelings of being upset, establish?

Jennifer Rauhouse runs Peer Solutions. The article states: "Jennifer Rauhouse, and she's married to my dear friend Jon Rauhouse... she runs a nonprofit organization called Peer Solutions..."

4. What specific dish, reminiscent of a mother's cooking, were guests required to bring to Caitlin McCormick's Friendsgiving?

The Friendsgiving required a dish her mother might have prepared. The exact dish isn't named, so the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "specific dish"—the article says "a dish their mother might have prepared." Since it's not named, answer N/A.

5. What was the title of the memoir written by Caitlin McCormick, reflecting her journey of understanding and forgiveness towards her mother?

The article doesn't mention Caitlin writing a memoir. The memoir mentioned is Neko's. So N/A.

6. What was the name of the Australian veterinarian student, whom Caitlin McCormick met, who effortlessly discussed her deceased mother, inspiring Caitlin to reframe her own narrative?

The Australian is named Soph. The text says Soph's father met her mother in Sydney. The name is Soph.

7. What was the name of the singer-songwriter, mentioned in the article, who inspired Neko Case to be more open about her childhood experiences?

The article mentions Neko's memoir and her music, but no other singer is mentioned as inspiring her. The answer is N/A.

8. What specific song by Joan Osborne and Joni Mitchell did Caitlin McCormick associate with her mother?

The article says Caitlin listed Joan Osborne and Joni Mitchell as artists her mom liked, but no specific song is named. So N/A.

9. What was the name of the "Modern Love" essay read by the author of "The Harder I Fight, The More I Love You," which explored themes of estrangement and forgiveness?

The essay read is "My Mother, the Stranger" by Caitlin McCormick.

10. How many weeks did Neko Case estimate she would spend with her grandmother, providing a temporary escape from her challenging home life?

The article says "six more weeks of school, and then maybe I'll go visit my grandma." So six weeks.

11. What type of cancer did Caitlin McCormick's mother fake having, according to the details provided about Neko Case's memoir?

Wait, the question is about Caitlin's mom. The article says Neko's mom faked cancer, not Caitlin's. Caitlin's mom had cancer (the essay says Soph's mom died of cancer, but Caitlin's mom was an alcoholic). So this question is a mix-up. The answer is N/A because the question is about Caitlin's mom, but the article says Neko's mom faked cancer. So N/A.

12. Which New York City landmark served as the meeting point for Caitlin and Soph's final conversation about hospice care in the essay?

The essay mentions "Citi Field" as the subway stop. The meeting was in the parking lot near there. The landmark is Citi Field.

13. What was the name of the nonprofit organization founded by Jennifer Rauhouse that Neko Case credits with helping her process childhood trauma?

Peer Solutions.

14. Which musical artist did Caitlin McCormick explicitly reference as a shared favorite between her mother and Soph's mother in the essay?

The article mentions Joan Osborne and Joni Mitchell as artists her mom liked, but it doesn't say they were shared with Soph's mom. So N/A.

15. What specific breed of dog accompanied Neko Case during her solitary childhood summers spent at her mother's house?

The article mentions "my dogs and my cats" but doesn't specify the breed. So N/A.

16. Which year was listed as the submission deadline for the Modern Love Valentine's Day episode voice memo contest?

The deadline is February 5. The year mentioned in the article is 2025.

17. What alcoholic beverage did Caitlin's mother reportedly mix with ice, as revealed during her hospice vigil in the essay?

The essay says "She took her chardonnay with ice."

18. Which instrument does Jon Rauhouse play in Neko Case's band, according to her description of their collaboration?

Pedal steel.

19. What was the title of the television show Neko Case repeatedly watched as a child while waiting for her father to return home?

20. Which New York City neighborhood did Soph's mother frequent most often during her time as a professional chef, according to Caitlin's recollections?

The essay mentions Soph's mother's favorite cocktail bar and French bistro, but the specific neighborhood isn't named. So N/A.
