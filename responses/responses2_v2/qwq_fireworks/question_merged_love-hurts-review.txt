Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked and avoid making any assumptions beyond the text.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions Ke Huy Quan's character bakes cookies. The Valentine's Day setting and weaponized boba straws are there, but the dessert is clearly stated as cookies. So the answer is cookies.

2. **Question 2:** Tom Green's new projects are mentioned for Amazon Prime Video. So if he collaborates, it's likely on Amazon.

3. **Question 3:** The article says Marvin is the "regional Realtor of the year," but there's no mention of an award he recently won. The question asks for an award, which isn't specified beyond the title. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The article states that right when Marvin enters his office, the Raven attacks. Since the runtime is 83 minutes, but the exact time isn't given. The question asks how many minutes into the movie this happens. The article doesn't specify the timing, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The Raven's coat is described as having knives, but the color isn't mentioned. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The article mentions "Challengers" in the context of sex scenes, not sports. The action sequences don't reference a sport explicitly. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The article doesn't mention the release year of "Love Hurts." It references Quan's past role in "The Goonies," but no year is given here. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The film's setting is present day (assuming the article is current), but no specific year is given. The Raven's poetry references a decade prior, but without a specific timeline, we can't calculate. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Jonathan Eusebio's stunt credits are listed, but the article doesn't state how many Academy Awards he's won. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The Raven's poetry is compared to Robert Frost, but there's no direct quote mentioned. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The article hints at Marvin's assassin past but doesn't give a body count. N/A.

12. **Question 12:** No mention of a specific soundtrack or sampled songs. N/A.

13. **Question 13:** The article mentions "regional Realtor of the year," which is the award he's competing for. That's the exact name.

14. **Question 14:** The article doesn't reference a 1990s martial arts film influencing the choreography. N/A.

15. **Question 15:** The first action is when the Raven attacks immediately upon Marvin entering the office. The runtime is 83 minutes, but the exact minute isn't specified. N/A.

16. **Question 16:** The poem is compared to Robert Frost's style but isn't named. N/A.

17. **Question 17:** The article's closing notes don't mention a cameo from "The Goonies" besides Quan himself. So N/A.

I need to make sure each answer strictly follows the article and doesn't infer beyond the text. Let me double-check each one against the article again to confirm.
