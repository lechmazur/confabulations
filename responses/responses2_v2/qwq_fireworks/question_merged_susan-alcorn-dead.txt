Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based strictly on the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and avoid any external knowledge. Let me go through each question step by step.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks which Cleveland Orchestra piece Susan Alcorn's mother performed as a piano soloist that influenced her daughter's experimental approach. The article mentions her mother played piano with the Cleveland Orchestra but doesn't specify any particular piece. So the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Asks how many consecutive nights she performed at the Houston nightclub where she discovered the pedal steel. The text doesn't mention the number of nights, so N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The name of the Chilean folk musician whose nueva cancion she reinterpreted. The article mentions "nueva cancion" inspired by her travels in Chile but doesn't name a specific musician. N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The music conservatory that awarded her an honorary doctorate for deep listening. The article doesn't mention any such award or conservatory. N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The Curtis Mayfield-inspired track with Eugene Chadbourne. The article says her 2003 album "Curandera" included "People Get Ready" by Mayfield. So the answer is "People Get Ready".

6. **Question 6**: Year she won an award from Signal to Noise. The article mentions Signal to Noise praised her tones but doesn't state a year or award. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Name of the Western swing band in Chicago. The article says she gigged with Western swing bands in Chicago but doesn't name the band. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Copies sold of "Pedernal" in first week. The article doesn't mention sales numbers. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Blues guitarist who taught her slide techniques. She learned from bluesmen like Son House and Muddy Waters, but it's not stated they taught her personally. The article says she developed an affinity for their work. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Academic paper on political science and music. The article doesn't mention any such paper. She studied political science and history but no paper is referenced. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Locale where she first saw pedal steel. The text says she saw a performance in a nightclub while at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, Ill. So the answer is DeKalb/Chicago? Wait, the article says "while studying... at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, Ill., she was intrigued when she saw a pedal steel player perform at a nightclub." So the locale is DeKalb's nightclub. The question mentions a detail that might be mistakenly relocated to a later city (Houston). So the answer is DeKalb or the nightclub there. The question asks for the locale, so "a nightclub in DeKalb, Ill." but the exact name isn't given. Wait the question says "which locale in the article was the site..." The article says "while studying... in DeKalb, Ill., she was intrigued when she saw a pedal steel player perform at a nightclub." So the locale is the nightclub in DeKalb. But the question might expect just the city, which is DeKalb. Alternatively, maybe the nightclub isn't named, so answer "DeKalb, Ill."? The article doesn't name the nightclub, so the locale is DeKalb, Illinois. So the answer is DeKalb, Ill.

12. **Question 12**: Nation's folk tradition evoked by "Canto". The article states "Canto" was inspired by Chile's nueva cancion. So Chile.

13. **Question 13**: Concept developed by a collaborator, wrongly assumed from Chicago jazz. The concept is "deep listening" by Pauline Oliveros. The question asks which concept might be wrongly thought to be from Chicago's jazz scene. The answer is "deep listening".

14. **Question 14**: Album linked to a New Mexico mesa (Pedernal) which might be thought earlier. The album "Pedernal" was released in 2020, but maybe someone might think it's earlier. The question asks which album is mistakenly attributed to an earlier period despite being 2020. The answer is "Pedernal".

15. **Question 15**: Parent associated with Cleveland Orchestra credited for her experimental work. Her mother was in the Cleveland Orchestra. The article says her mother's background might be inaccurately credited, so answer is her mother, Mary (Auer) Alcorn.

16. **Question 16**: Institution where she first saw pedal steel, not conflated with Houston. She was at Northern Illinois University when she first saw it. So the institution is Northern Illinois University.

17. **Question 17**: Instrument noted for "wailing twang" she redefined. The pedal steel guitar is described as associated with that sound. The answer is pedal steel guitar.

18. **Question 18**: Component for pitch alteration mistakenly thought to mimic a string quartet. The pedals and knee levers are used, but the article says they were for experimental purposes. The component is pedals/knee levers, but the question asks the name. The article says "pedals and knee levers to alter pitch". The answer would be pedals/knee levers, but the question is phrased as which component. Since the question is about a component integral to altering pitch, the answer is pedals and knee levers. But the question might want "pedals" or "knee levers" specifically. The article mentions both, but maybe the answer is "pedals and knee levers".

19. **Question 19**: Album title with revival imagery that's misinterpreted. The 2006 album "And I Await the Resurrection of the Pedal Steel Guitar" uses resurrection imagery. The question states it might be seen as deep listening sessions but is about expanding the instrument. So the title is "And I Await the Resurrection of the Pedal Steel Guitar".

20. **Question 20**: Decade she began gigging with Western swing. The article says she started in Chicago and later Houston in early 1980s, but the gigging started when? "After graduating in 1976, started gigging with Western swing and country bands, first in Chicago and later in Houston..." So the decade is the 1970s? Wait, graduating in 1976, so post-graduation would be late 70s. The question asks the decade. Since she started in Chicago after 1976, that's late 70s, so the decade is 1970s. But the early 1980s is when she moved to Houston. The question says "during which decade did she first begin gigging" so starting in the late 70s, so 1970s.
