Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and follow the strict format. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks how many feet deep the grave was for "Placid Civic Monument." The article mentions that Oldenburg hired grave diggers to excavate six feet of Central Park earth. So the answer is 6.

2. The second question is about who had a bronze Hello Kitty statue at Lever House. The article says Tom Sachs put a bronze Hello Kitty in the plaza in 2008. So the answer is Tom Sachs. Wait, but the question asks for a Pop Art contemporary of Oldenburg. Hmm, the article doesn't explicitly state if Sachs is a contemporary. But the question says "Pop Art contemporary," but maybe the answer is just Tom Sachs regardless. Since the question is asking for the artist's name, I'll go with Tom Sachs.

3. The third question asks in which city Oldenburg's affection for Mies developed, influencing the handkerchief's design. The article says Chicago, where both had first settled after emigrating from Europe. So the answer is Chicago.

4. The fourth question is about the medium Oldenburg abandoned for sculpture. The text says he abandoned painting for sculpture after being influenced by street trash. So the answer is painting.

5. The fifth question asks the material used in "The Street" in 1960. The article states he used newspaper and cardboard from gutters. So the answer is newspaper and cardboard.

6. The sixth question is which company commissioned Lever House as their HQ. The article mentions Lever Brothers soap company. So the answer is Lever Brothers.

7. The seventh question is about European city influence on the handkerchief via Mies. The article says Mies emigrated from Europe and settled in Chicago. Since Mies was German, maybe the city is Berlin? But the article doesn't mention a specific city. Wait, the question is about where Mies was before Chicago. The article says "after emigrating from Europe," but doesn't name a city. Wait, maybe the answer is Germany? Or maybe the article says Mies was from the Bauhaus, which was in Germany. But the question asks for a city. Since the article doesn't specify, maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "European city's influence... through his early career before Chicago." The Bauhaus was in Germany, so maybe Dessau or Weimar? But the article doesn't say. Hmm, maybe the answer is Berlin? Or perhaps the article says "Bauhaus" so the city is Dessau? But the text doesn't specify. Since the article doesn't name a specific city, maybe this is N/A. Wait, the article says "the last director of the Bauhaus", which was based in Dessau and Berlin. Since the question is about the city where Mies's early career was, maybe Berlin? But I'm not sure. Let me check again. The article says Mies was from Europe and settled in Chicago. The handkerchief was plucked from Chicago's Lake Shore Drive. The question is about the European city where Oldenburg's affection for Mies developed. Since the article doesn't mention a specific European city, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, but the article says "Oldenburg's affection for Mies no doubt developed in Chicago..." Wait no, the article says "Oldenburg's affection for Mies no doubt developed in Chicago, where both had first settled after emigrating from Europe." So the European cities are where they came from. But the question is about the city where Oldenburg's affection for Mies developed, which is Chicago. But the question is asking for a European city. Hmm, maybe there's confusion here. The question says "European city's influence is implied... through Mies's early career before he settled in Chicago." Since Mies was part of the Bauhaus in Germany, the European city might be Dessau or Weimar. But the article doesn't name a specific city. Therefore, the answer might be N/A. Wait, but the article says "Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, the last director of the Bauhaus", so the Bauhaus was in Germany. The question is about the European city, so maybe Germany? But the question asks for a city, not country. Since the article doesn't specify, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe the answer is Berlin? Because Mies was associated with Berlin? I'm confused here. Let me think again. The question is about the European city's influence through Mies's early career before Chicago. Since Mies was from Germany and the Bauhaus was there, but the article doesn't name a specific city, maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, but maybe the answer is Berlin. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the Bauhaus's city, which was Dessau. But since the article doesn't mention it, perhaps the correct answer is N/A. Wait, but the article says "Mies no doubt developed in Chicago," so the European part is their origin, but the influence on the handkerchief's design might be from Mies's work in Chicago? Not sure. Maybe this is a trick question where the answer is N/A because the article doesn't mention a specific European city. I'll mark this as N/A for now, but I might be wrong.

8. The eighth question asks about Tom Sachs' material in 2008. The article says Tom Sachs put a bronze Hello Kitty statue. The question is about the material, so bronze.

9. The ninth question is how many years after Coosje's death the "Plantoir" was made. The article states "Plantoir, Red (Mid-Scale)" (2001-2021), and it was manufactured expressly for this show. Van Bruggen died in 2009. The article says "this version was manufactured expressly for this show" (the current presentation). The article mentions the current presentation is through November 2025, but the question is when was it manufactured. The artwork's dates are 2001-2021, but the version for this show is made now. The question is how many years after her death (2009) was it manufactured. Since the article says "this version was manufactured expressly for this show," and the show is in 2023 or 2025, but the question doesn't give the exact year. Wait, the article says "Through November 2025," so the current show is up to 2025. The article was written in present tense, so maybe the manufacturing is recent. The artwork's creation dates are 2001-2021. The question is about when the version for this show was made. Since the article says "manufactured expressly for this show," which is up to 2025, so the time since 2009 would be up to 16 years. But the article doesn't specify the exact year. Wait, the question is "how many years after Coosje van Bruggen's death was the version... displayed... manufactured?" The answer would be the difference between the manufacturing year and 2009. But the article says the version was made "expressly for this show," which is the current presentation. Since the article mentions "Through November 2025," perhaps it's 2023 or 2022. The article also mentions Oldenburg died in 2022, so maybe the show started in 2023. If the manufacturing was in 2023, then 2023-2009=14 years. But the article doesn't state the exact year. The question might be answerable with the dates given. The artwork is listed as 2001-2021, but the specific version for this show is made later. Since the article doesn't specify the exact year of manufacturing for this show, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "this version was manufactured expressly for this show," but the question is about how many years after 2009. If the show is in 2023, then 14 years. But without the exact year, maybe the answer can't be determined. Alternatively, maybe the artwork's creation up to 2021, so 2021-2009=12 years. But the version for the show might be after that. The article says "Plantoir, Red (Mid-Scale)" (2001-2021), so the artwork's latest date is 2021. The version for the show was made "expressly for this show," which could be 2021 or later. If it was made in 2021, then 12 years. Since the question might require using the 2021 date, the answer is 12. Hmm, the article says "manufactured expressly for this show" but doesn't give the year. The article mentions the presentation is through November 2025, so maybe it's 2022. 2022-2009=13. But without exact dates, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 12, considering the artwork's end date is 2021. I'm confused. Let me check again. The question is "how many years after Coosje van Bruggen's death... manufactured?" Since she died in 2009, and the version was made for the show, which is in 2023 or so, but the article doesn't specify. Since the question requires an exact number and the article doesn't provide it, the answer must be N/A. Wait, but the article says "this version was manufactured expressly for this show," which is the current presentation. Since the article was written when the show is ongoing (as it says "Through November 2025"), but the exact start year isn't given. The article mentions Oldenburg died in 2022, so maybe the show started in 2023. 2023-2009=14. But without exact year, can't say. So N/A.

10. The tenth question asks which company commissioned the Good Humor Bar proposal. The article states the proposal was for replacing 200 Park Avenue, and Unilever had acquired Good Humor the year before (the proposal was in 1962, so Unilever in 1961). Therefore, Unilever is the answer.

11. The eleventh question is about Lever Brothers' products in the vitrines. The article says "original steel-rimmed vitrines that once (unironically) levitated Lever Brothers consumer products like works of art." The products would be soap, as Lever Brothers is a soap company. The article mentions "Lever Brothers soap company," so the answer is soap products, but maybe the specific type? The article doesn't specify beyond soap, so just soap.

12. The twelfth question is the decade when Aby Rosen's 20-year tenure began. He bought the building in 1998, so 20 years would end in 2018. The decade is 1990s (since 1998 is in the 90s). The question is the decade when his tenure began, which is the 1990s.

13. The thirteenth question asks the architectural feature "Plantoir" interacts with. The article says it's near the building's white marble planter that leaks through a glass wall. So the feature is the white marble planter and glass wall.

14. The fourteenth question is the material of the suede string bean. The article says "a limp, suede string bean slithering up a steel support column." So the material is suede.

Wait, let me go through each again carefully.

1. Six feet. Correct.

2. Tom Sachs. The question mentions a Pop Art contemporary. The article doesn't say Sachs is a Pop artist, but the question's premise is that he is, so answer is Tom Sachs.

3. Chicago is the city where their affection developed, but the question asks for a European city. Wait, the question is about the city where Mies's early career was before Chicago. Since Mies was from Germany, but the article doesn't name a city, maybe the answer is N/A. The article says "after emigrating from Europe," so their original cities are in Europe. But the question is about the city influencing the handkerchief's design through Mies's early career. Since Mies was part of the Bauhaus in Germany, maybe the answer is Berlin or Dessau. Since the article says Mies was the last director of the Bauhaus, which was in Dessau and Berlin, but the article doesn't specify. Therefore, N/A.

4. Painting. Correct.

5. Newspaper and cardboard. Correct.

6. Lever Brothers. Correct.

7. European city... since Mies was from Germany, but the article doesn't mention specific cities. So N/A.

8. Bronze. Correct.

9. N/A because the article doesn't give the exact year the version was made after 2009. The artwork's dates are up to 2021, but the version for the show might be 2022 or later. Without exact, N/A.

10. Unilever. Correct.

11. Soap products. The article says Lever Brothers was a soap company, so soap.

12. 1990s (1998 start). Correct.

13. White marble planter and glass wall. The question asks for the architectural feature, so "white marble planter" or the combination. The answer is the white marble planter and glass wall, but maybe just the planter? The article says "near the building's white marble planter that leaks through a glass wall", so the feature is the planter and glass wall together. The answer should be "white marble planter and glass wall".

14. Suede. Correct.

Wait for question 7 again. The question is: "European city's influence is implied in the design of 'Architect's Handkerchief' through its connection to Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's early career before he settled in Chicago?" Since Mies was part of the Bauhaus in Germany, the European city would be Dessau or Berlin. But the article doesn't name the city, so N/A. So answer N/A.

Question 13: The architectural feature is the white marble planter and glass wall. The question says "architectural feature", so maybe the answer is "white marble planter" since that's part of the building's design. But the glass wall is part of the architecture too. The article says the planter leaks through the glass wall, so the feature is the combination. The answer is "white marble planter and glass wall".
