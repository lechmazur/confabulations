merged_trump-ira-climate-spending-halt-jobs-construction.txt
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which Republican governor criticized Trump's freeze knowing 80% of IRA funds went to Republican districts. The article mentions that 80% of the Inflation Reduction Act investments went to Republican districts, but I need to find a specific governor who criticized it. Scanning through, the only mention of a governor is Maren Mahoney in Arizona, but she's the director of the governor's office of resiliency. The article doesn't name a Republican governor who publicly criticized it. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Arizona's solar installation before the freeze. The article says Arizona got a $156M grant to deploy 61 megawatts with focus on low-income and tribal communities. But the question is how much was already installed before the freeze. The text doesn't mention any prior installations, only the planned total. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Damage in Camp Hill covered by the $20M grant. The article says the grant was for repairing damage from the hail, but the exact damage amount isn't stated. The $20M is the grant amount, not the damage. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Electric school buses already received by Mercer County. The article states the coalition won a $15M grant to install microgrids and buy "at least one electric school bus." But it's paused, so they might not have received any yet. The question is how many they already had before the pause. The article doesn't say they received any yet, so the answer is 0 or N/A? Wait, "at least one" implies they planned to, but maybe none were delivered. The article says they're worried they won't get them, so probably none yet. Answer: 0? Wait, but the question is about before the pause. The grant was awarded but not implemented. So maybe they had none. So answer 0. Wait, but the article says "had won a $15M grant to install... at least one electric school bus". So before the pause, they hadn't received it yet. So answer is 0. But I need to check the exact wording. The article says "had won a $15 million grant to install micro grids and buy at least one electric school bus is now worried..." So they haven't received it yet. So the answer is 0? But the question is how many they already received before the pause. The answer would be 0. Hmm, but the article might not explicitly state that. Let me check again. The article says the grant was approved but the funding is paused, so they haven't received the buses yet. So the answer is 0. But maybe the question is tricky. Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A if it's not explicitly stated. Wait, the article says "the districts won't have the new equipment in place for another year, if ever." So they haven't received any yet. So answer is 0. But I need to confirm if the article says they had any before. The article says "had won a grant to install... at least one" but not that they had already received any. So the answer is 0. But maybe the question is expecting N/A because it's not stated. Wait the article says "had won a grant" but not that they got the buses. So the answer is 0? Hmm, maybe. I'll note that.

5. **Question 5:** Percentage of workforce furloughed at Zero Emissions Northwest. The article says the company furloughed three employees after reimbursements were halted. But how many total employees? The article mentions they had to furlough three, but the total isn't given. So can't compute the percentage. Answer N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Which former Biden official provided the $167B figure. The article states that "companies have announced plans to invest more than $167 billion..." according to data from Atlas Public Policy. The quote is from Mike Carr of the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America Coalition. The question asks which former Biden official gave that figure. Since the data is from Atlas Public Policy, not a Biden official, the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "according to data from Atlas Public Policy, a research firm." So the answer is N/A because the figure is from them, not a former Biden official. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Days the USDA processed reimbursements after the order. The article says the Department of Agriculture halted reimbursements when Funk tried to submit invoices. It doesn't mention how many days they continued after the order. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Monthly savings from solar panels before the freeze. The article mentions farmers used the program to install solar panels to offset irrigation costs, expecting reimbursement. But the actual savings amount isn't provided. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Number of 22 states suing that were seeking climate grants. The article mentions a federal judge ordered Trump to stop blocking funding to 22 states for all congressionally authorized programs. It doesn't specify how many of those were for climate-related grants. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Percentage of Camp Hill residents with hail damage who applied. The article says nearly half of Camp Hill's residents are below poverty, but doesn't mention how many applied for the grant. So N/A.

Now, going back to question 4 again. The article says the Mercer County district is part of a coalition that won the grant to install microgrids and buy at least one electric school bus. Since the grant was paused, they haven't received any buses yet. The question is how many they had before the pause. The answer would be 0. But the article doesn't explicitly say they had none before. Maybe they had none, so the answer is 0. Alternatively, maybe they started but the project was paused. But the grant was just awarded, so probably 0. I'll go with 0.
