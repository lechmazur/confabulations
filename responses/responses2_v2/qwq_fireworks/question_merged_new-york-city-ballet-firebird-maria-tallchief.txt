Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information given and answer exactly what's asked. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The article says she joined the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo at 17 after studying with Nijinska in LA. So the answer is Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo.

2. **Question 2:** The text mentions she appeared on "The Bell Telephone Hour" from 1959-1966 but doesn't say which was her last. Also, the final televised performance isn't specified, so maybe N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The bracelet was given when they visited her grandmother and he wore it for over 30 years. If the marriage ended in 1951 and he wore it until his death, but the article doesn't say exact years. The answer might be N/A since we don't have exact consecutive years.

4. **Question 4:** The Firebird premiered in 1949. The article says "When his 'Firebird' premiered in 1949 at New York City Ballet..." So the date isn't specific, just the year. The question asks for the date, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The name Maria came from when she was in LA, students teased her Native name so her name became Maria. The article says "Betty Marie became Maria" but doesn't mention who selected it. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** She appeared many times on "The Bell Telephone Hour" from 1959-1966, but exact number not given. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The article states she did the Sugarplum Fairy, but doesn't mention who was first Native American before her. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The Newsweek cover in 1954 shows her with a tiara, but dress color isn't mentioned. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** No mention of a specific Osage dance ritual in Firebird choreography. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Attendance figure for her final performance isn't stated. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The centennial program includes "Scotch Symphony," which she considered Balanchine's most romantic. Tiler Peck is doing "Sylvia: Pas de Deux." The question asks which one she debuted, so the answer is "Sylvia: Pas de Deux".

12. **Question 12:** She performed "Nutcracker" on Ed Sullivan in 1956, but "Bell Telephone Hour" performances are mentioned without exact years. The article says she was on Bell from 1959-1966. Since the question asks when she did "Nutcracker" on Bell, maybe N/A since the specific year isn't given.

13. **Question 13:** Her grandmother was involved with the Osage Allotment Act, but the question asks what role she played. The article only says she was involved, so exact role is N/A.

14. **Question 14:** The family moved to LA in 1933, but the reason isn't given. So N/A.

15. **Question 15:** The 1995 coaching session was about the berceuse in "Firebird" and avoiding the spotlight. The technique mentioned is "berceuse" or the technical note about the spotlight. The answer is "berceuse" or the specific technique, but the question asks for the ballet technique. The article says "meticulously leads through the berceuse in 'Firebird'... technical note about the spotlight". The technique is part of the berceuse, so maybe "berceuse" or "spotlight technique". The exact term is "berceuse".

16. **Question 16:** The quarter features her Osage name, so the 2023 honor is the Maria Tallchief quarter.

17. **Question 17:** The Newsweek cover title is "The Ballet's Tallchief: Native Dancer".

18. **Question 18:** The impresario was Sol Hurok, who suggested she dance Firebird.

19. **Question 19:** Alicia Markova did Firebird in America in 1945.

20. **Question 20:** Suzanne Farrell was inspired by Tallchief's TV appearances, including "Ed Sullivan" and "Bell Telephone Hour", but the question asks about the "Arthur Godfrey Show" which isn't mentioned. So N/A.

Wait, let me check each again:

1. Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo â€“ correct.

2. The final televised performance isn't specified. The article says she appeared on Bell until 1966 but doesn't say last one. So N/A.

3. The bracelet was worn nearly every day for over 30 years. If Balanchine wore it from when they visited (probably after marriage in 1946) until his death. He died in 1983. From 1946 to 1983 is 37 years, but the question is how many consecutive years she wore it. Wait, no, the bracelet was given to Balanchine, not her. The question says "Maria Tallchief wore" but the bracelet was Balanchine's. So the answer is N/A.

4. The date is N/A since only the year 1949 is given.

14. Reason for moving to LA: article says "the family moved to Los Angeles, where Tallchief's ballet training became more serious" but the reason isn't given. So N/A.

15. The technique during coaching was about the spotlight and the berceuse. The answer is "berceuse".

17. The Newsweek title is "The Ballet's Tallchief: Native Dancer".

18. Sol Hurok suggested Firebird.
