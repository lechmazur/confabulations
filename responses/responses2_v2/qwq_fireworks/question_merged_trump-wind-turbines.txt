Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly.

1. The first question asks which state had a Trump golf course opposing an offshore wind farm. The article mentions that Trump opposed a wind farm near his Scottish golf course. Wait, but the question specifies a state in the U.S. Hmm, the article says he tried to stop an offshore wind farm in view of one of his Scottish golf courses. Scotland isn't a U.S. state. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The article says: "he has bashed ever since he unsuccessfully tried to stop an offshore wind farm from being built in view of one of his Scottish golf courses." So the location is Scotland, not a U.S. state. But the question is asking for a U.S. state mentioned as a leader in wind energy production that was also where his golf course was. Wait, maybe there's another part? The states mentioned as leaders are Texas, Iowa. The article doesn't mention a U.S. state with a Trump golf course related to wind farms. The Scottish one is not a U.S. state. So the answer might be N/A? Wait, but the question says "a leader in wind energy production was also the location of a Trump golf course". The leaders are Texas and Iowa. The article doesn't mention a U.S. state where he had a golf course opposing a wind farm. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question might be referring to Scotland, but since it's not a U.S. state, the answer should be N/A. Wait, but maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The article says he opposed a Scottish one, so the question's answer is N/A because there's no U.S. state mentioned where his golf course was involved in opposing a wind farm. So answer 1: N/A?

Wait, no, the question says "according to the text". The text says he opposed an offshore wind farm near his Scottish golf course. But the question is about a state in the U.S. mentioned as a leader in wind energy production that was also where the golf course was. Since Scotland isn't a U.S. state, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the article mentions another U.S. state? Let me check again. The article mentions that in the U.S., the states with wind energy are Texas, Iowa, etc. The only mention of a golf course is the Scottish one. So the answer must be N/A. Wait, but the question says "the president-elect calls it 'garbage'". Maybe the question is referring to the state where the offshore wind farm was opposed, but it's Scotland. Since it's not a U.S. state, then answer N/A. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me proceed and come back.

2. The second question asks for the gigawatts under development in Montana and North Dakota combined. The article states "an additional 24 gigawatts worth of wind farms is currently under development, with major projects planned for Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Texas". It says "with major projects" but doesn't give exact numbers for each state. Since the question asks for the combined total of Montana and North Dakota, but the article doesn't specify how much each has, so we can't calculate. Therefore, answer N/A?

Wait, the question says "how many... combined?" The article only mentions that they are part of the 24 GW under development but doesn't break it down. So the answer is N/A.

3. The third question is about the number of workers in states carried by Trump in the 2024 election. The article says "the wind industry employs more than 125,000 workers" and "two-thirds of that in states carried by Mr. Trump in the November election". So two-thirds of 125,000 is around 83,333. But the question says "states carried by Trump in the 2024 election". Wait, the article says "November election"—probably 2020, since the article is from when Trump was president-elect. Wait, the article's date isn't given, but the context is about Trump being president-elect. Assuming the election is 2020, but the question says 2024. Wait, the question might have a typo? The article says "states carried by Mr. Trump in the November election", which would be 2020. The question says 2024. Since the article doesn't mention 2024, the answer would be N/A because the question's timeframe is different. Wait, but maybe the user made a mistake in the question. The article says "states carried by Mr. Trump in the November election"—probably 2020. The question asks about 2024, which isn't mentioned. Therefore, answer N/A?

Wait, maybe the question is correct and the article refers to the 2024 election. Let me check again. The article's context is when Trump is president-elect. If the article is from 2020, then the election would be 2020. The question says "2024 election" which is not in the article. Therefore, the answer is N/A. But the article says "states carried by Mr. Trump in the November election"—so if the article is about Trump becoming president-elect again in 2024, but the article is written when he's president-elect, which would be after the 2020 election. So the answer is N/A because the question's year is different.

Alternatively, maybe the question's wording is wrong, but I must follow the text. Since the article states "states carried by Mr. Trump in the November election" (probably 2020), the question's 2024 makes it N/A. So answer N/A.

Wait, but the article's context is when Trump is the president-elect. Let me check the first paragraph: "President-elect Donald J. Trump said on Tuesday..." So this is after the 2016 election. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the article mentions Biden's administration, so maybe it's after 2020. Wait, the article starts with "Trump Administration Advertisement"—but the content mentions Biden's offshore wind projects. Wait, the first paragraph says "President-elect Donald J. Trump" and "Biden administration"—so this is during the transition from Trump's presidency? Wait, that's confusing. Wait, Trump was president until January 2021. The article mentions Biden's administration, so this must be after 2020. The "November election" would be the 2020 election. Therefore, the states carried by Trump in 2020. The question's 2024 is different, so answer N/A. Therefore, the answer to question 3 is N/A.

Wait, but maybe the question is correct. Let me check again. The article says "two-thirds of that in states carried by Mr. Trump in the November election, including Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota and Indiana." The "that" refers to the over 153 GW built. But the question is about the number of workers in those states. The total workers are 125,000, two-thirds in those states. So two-thirds of 125,000 is 83,333.33. The question says "how many total workers does the wind energy industry employ in states carried by Trump..." So the answer would be 83,333? But the question says "according to the article"—the article says "more than 125,000" and "two-thirds of that in states carried by Trump". Since it's approximate, maybe the answer is "more than 83,333" but the question wants an exact number? Since the article doesn't specify exact numbers, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the exact figure derived from the given data. Since two-thirds of 125,000 is 83,333, but since the original number is "more than 125,000", we can't know exactly. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

Hmm, this is tricky. The question says "how many total workers"—if it's asking for the number in those states, the article only gives a proportion. Since we can't know the exact number from the given info, it's N/A. But maybe the question expects the approximate figure. Let's see the instructions: "if the answer is not provided and cannot be logically inferred, write N/A". Since the article says "more than 125,000" and "two-thirds", we can infer that it's more than 83,333, but the exact number isn't given. Since the question requires an exact answer, it's N/A.

4. Leah Stokes argues that wind could mitigate energy shortages faster than gas plants. The article says "data shows wind farms also can be built faster than gas plants. 'If we're going to have energy shortages because of things like A.I. and data centers, why wouldn't we try to build cheap, clean and fast power?' she said." So the specific type is wind farms. The question asks for the specific type, so answer: wind farms.

5. Trump vowed to cancel how many offshore wind projects approved by Biden? The article says "which has approved 11 commercial-scale offshore wind projects". Trump said "no new windmills" but the question is about the number he vowed to cancel. The article says "no new windmills would be built" but doesn't specify the number of projects to cancel. The 11 are Biden's approvals, but Trump's statement is a general ban, not specifically canceling those 11. The question is whether he explicitly vowed to cancel those 11. The article says he "directly rebuke[d] the Biden administration, which has approved 11 commercial-scale offshore wind projects". So he's against all new ones, but the question asks how many specifically he vowed to cancel. Since the article doesn't state that he targeted the 11, answer N/A. Wait, but maybe he did. The article says "no new windmills" so that would include the 11. But the question asks "how many offshore wind projects approved by the Biden administration does the article state Trump explicitly vowed to cancel". The article says "no new windmills" but doesn't specify the number. So answer N/A.

6. The critical mineral in Canada that Trudeau mentioned is referenced. The article says: "Threats to Canada: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau... said Canada's wealth of critical minerals are behind Trump's comments about making its northern neighbor a U.S. state." The minerals are critical, but the specific type isn't named. So the answer is N/A? Wait, the question is about the specific mineral. The article just mentions "critical minerals" generally. Since it's not specified which one, the answer is N/A.

7. Trump's dismissive term for wind installations combining visual and environmental critique. The article says he called them "garbage in a field" and "litter". The question asks for the term that combines both. "Garbage" and "litter" are used. The exact term used by Trump is "garbage" and "litter". The question says "single dismissive term"—maybe "garbage" or "litter". The article says "like garbage in a field" and "litter the country". The exact phrase he used was "litter" and "garbage". The question asks for the term that combines both aspects. The article says "he said turbines 'litter' the country and are like 'garbage in a field'". So the term combining both might be "garbage" since it's described as such, but the question wants the single term he used. The article quotes him as saying "like garbage in a field" and "litter". The exact terms are "litter" and "garbage". Since the question asks for the term that combines both, maybe "litter" is the visual critique and "garbage" the environmental? The question says "combines both a visual and environmental critique". The term "garbage" could imply both. The exact quote is "like garbage in a field", so "garbage in a field" is the term. But the question asks for the "single dismissive term". Alternatively, the article says "he said turbines 'litter' the country and are like 'garbage in a field'". The terms are separate. The question might be looking for "garbage" as the term used. The answer would be "garbage".

8. The state that's been the leader for over two decades is Texas. The article says "The No. 1 state for wind energy is Texas, and it has been for two and a half decades".

9. The advantage wind has over gas plants despite intermittency is construction speed. The article says "data shows wind farms also can be built faster than gas plants".

10. Trump's unsubstantiated claim about wind turbines and marine wildlife is that they kill whales. The article says "Mr. Trump insisted that wind farms 'obviously' kill whales, although scientists have said there is no evidence to support that".

11. The wind power capacity built is over 153 GW. The article states "companies in the United States have built more than 153 gigawatts of wind power capacity".

12. The capital investment in 2022 was $12 billion. The article says "an amount the agency said represented $12 billion in capital investment".

13. The constraint on presidential power is that if leases are already issued, permits must be issued. The article says "if the government has already issued leases for wind farms, then legally, companies must be issued permits if they choose to move forward with projects".

14. The expert supporting wind's viability is Leah Stokes. The article quotes her discussing the benefits.

15. The agency Trump wants to close is USAID. The article mentions "Trump directly called for the closure of the U.S. Agency for International Development".

16. The contradiction is that several states (like Texas, Iowa) are Republican-led but have thriving wind energy. The article says "Trump's pronouncement may surprise leaders in some states -- including Republican-led Wyoming, Iowa and Texas -- where wind energy has rapidly expanded".

Now going back to question 1: the state with a Trump golf course opposing a wind farm. The article mentions Scotland, not a U.S. state. So answer N/A.

Question 2: Montana and ND combined under development? The article says 24 GW under development in those states among others, but no breakdown, so N/A.

Question 3: Workers in Trump states. The article says two-thirds of 125,000 is ~83k, but since it's approximate and not exact, N/A.

Question 4: wind farms.

Question 5: N/A, because he didn't specify number.

Question 6: N/A (critical minerals not specified).

Question 7: garbage.

Question 8: Texas.

Question 9: built faster.

Question 10: kill whales.

Question 11: over 153 GW.

Question 12: $12 billion.

Question 13: if leases are issued, permits must be granted.

Question 14: Leah Stokes.

Question 15: USAID.

Question 16: several Republican-led states have thriving wind energy (like Texas, Iowa, etc.).
