Okay, I need to answer these questions based solely on the given article. Let me go through each question one by one and check the text for the answers.

1. **Total number of scripted shows Dick Wolf has in production:** The article says he has nine scripted shows running and soon a tenth ("On Call"). So the current total is nine, but including the new one in pre-production? Wait, the article states: "he now has a staggering nine scripted shows running on several networks. NBC executives even brought 'Law & Order' back to life... Soon Mr. Wolf will have a 10th show..." The question includes "including those in pre-production but not yet aired". The tenth is "On Call", which is in pre-production but not aired yet. So total would be 10? The answer should be 10?

Wait, the exact quote is: "he now has a staggering nine scripted shows running... Soon Mr. Wolf will have a 10th show..." So currently, before "On Call" debuts, it's nine. The question says "currently" but includes pre-production. Hmm. The article says "soon" so maybe the 10th is in pre-production but not yet aired. So the answer is 9 + 1 (On Call) = 10? The question includes pre-production but not yet aired. So the answer is 10? The article says "will have a 10th show", so maybe the current number is 9, and the 10th is upcoming. The question is about "currently in production across all networks and streamers, including those in pre-production but not yet aired". If "On Call" is in production, then it counts. The article mentions "On Call" is his first show for Amazon, and it's coming out soon. So production is ongoing. So the answer is 10.

2. **Specific crime incident in "On Call" pilot mirroring a real 2022 case in Long Beach:** The article doesn't mention any specific real-life case from 2022 that the pilot mirrors. It talks about graphic scenes like someone shot in the jugular, jumping off a parking garage, etc., but doesn't link those to real cases. So answer N/A.

3. **Streaming service's budget cuts in 2023 that led to 30-minute formats:** The article mentions "investors abruptly soured on the spend-at-all-costs behavior... the Netflix correction in April 2022... writer and actor strikes in 2023 slowed production..." But the specific catalyst cited by Wolf Entertainment? The text says "Wolf Entertainment... the shorter episode orders may be temporary" but the reason for prioritizing 30-minutes was due to attention spans and streaming's shift. The article says "the industry is no longer turning up its nose to network-like fare... the company would need some sort of off-ramp... time to enter streaming... Elliot Wolf wanted to find a way in... 30-minute episodes... Amazon agreed." The budget cuts from which service? The article mentions the Netflix correction and 2023 strikes, but the specific service cited as the catalyst? The article says "Amazon's Jennifer Salke... customer focused... reviews, it's only in audience response." The budget cuts leading to 30-minutes? The article says "streaming services now offer lower-priced tiers... the industry is in contraction... studios gravitating to cheaper shows." The answer might be Netflix, but the question asks which service's budget cuts were cited by Wolf Entertainment as the catalyst. The text doesn't explicitly say which service's budget cuts caused this. The closest is "Netflix correction in April 2022" which led to industry contraction. But the question is about 2023. The 2023 strikes slowed production, but which service's budget cuts? The article says "investors soured on Netflix's spend... the number of TV shows produced rapidly plummeted. Then a pair of strikes in 2023 slowed production..." So the budget cuts might refer to Netflix's correction. But the question says "streaming service’s budget cuts in 2023" – the strikes are 2023, but budget cuts? The article says "investors abruptly soured on the spend-at-all-costs behavior that was then the industry norm" after Netflix's 2022 correction. So maybe the answer is N/A because it's not specifically citing a service's 2023 budget cuts as the catalyst. Alternatively, the article says "the Netflix correction in April 2022" which caused the contraction. Since the question is about 2023, perhaps N/A.

4. **Amazon executive with NBC background approving the half-hour format:** The article mentions Jennifer Salke, who was at NBC before joining Amazon. "Jennifer Salke had previously spent nearly a decade at NBC, and knew how addictive Mr. Wolf's programming was..." She was the one who approved "On Call" with 30-minute episodes. So the answer is Jennifer Salke.

5. **Number of scripted shows during his comeback:** The article states: "he now has a staggering nine scripted shows... NBC executives even brought 'Law & Order' back to life more than a decade after the network canceled it. It is now in its 24th season." The question is about how many he had during his comeback. The article says when he started rebuilding: "Chicago Fire" led to "Chicago P.D." and "Chicago Med" (3 shows), then "FBI" and two spinoffs (total 3+3=6). "Within a few years, Mr. Wolf would have 'FBI' and two spinoffs on the air at CBS (clocking in at nearly 300 episodes combined). So total would be Chicago Fire, Chicago PD, Chicago Med, FBI, FBI spinoffs (maybe two?), so 5? Wait, the article says "FBI" and two spinoffs, so that's three (FBI plus two spinoffs). The three Chicago shows plus three FBI series equals six. But the article says "nine scripted shows running on several networks" now, but the question is "as he pursued his comeback"—so during his rebuilding phase. The article says "Within a few years, Mr. Wolf would have 'FBI' and two spinoffs on the air at CBS (clocking in at nearly 300 episodes combined). So during the rebuilding phase, he had the three Chicago shows plus FBI and two spinoffs (total 6?), but maybe the exact number isn't given. Wait, the article says "At 78, he now has a staggering nine scripted shows running on several networks." So the number during his comeback (when he was rebuilding) would be less. The question is asking how many he had "reportedly had running across networks as he pursued his comeback." The article says after "Chicago Fire" took off, "Chicago PD" and "Chicago Med" followed, so three Chicago shows. Then "FBI" and two spinoffs (so three more). That's six. But maybe more? The article mentions "SVU" being revived, but that was already existing. Wait, the article says "NBC executives even brought 'Law & Order' back to life more than a decade after the network canceled it. It is now in its 24th season." So perhaps during the rebuilding phase, the count included those. But the exact number when he was pursuing the comeback? The article says "he now has nine", so the answer might be N/A. Wait, the article says "Within a few years, Mr. Wolf would have 'FBI' and two spinoffs on the air at CBS (clocking in at nearly 300 episodes combined). So adding to the Chicago three, that's six. The article also mentions "SVU" as still running, but that was one of the original ones. The question is about the number during his comeback, so maybe six? But the article doesn't state the exact number, so perhaps N/A. Wait, the article says "he now has a staggering nine scripted shows running on several networks." So the number during his comeback is not specified, but the question asks "reportedly had running across networks as he pursued his comeback". The article says "Chicago Fire" led to "Chicago P.D." and "Chicago Med", and then "FBI" and two spinoffs. So total 3+3=6? The article says "nine scripted shows running now", but during his comeback phase, perhaps it was six. But since the article doesn't explicitly state the number during that time, maybe N/A. Hmm, but the question says "reportedly"—maybe the article mentions a number? Let me check again. The article says "he now has a staggering nine scripted shows running on several networks." So the answer is N/A because the question is about the number during his comeback, not now. Since the article doesn't state the exact number during the rebuilding phase, the answer is N/A.

Wait, the article says "he began mounting his comeback shortly after his fall." After the cancellations, he started with "Chicago Fire", then others. The article says "Within a few years, Mr. Wolf would have 'FBI' and two spinoffs on the air at CBS (clocking in at nearly 300 episodes combined)." So adding the Chicago three (Fire, PD, Med) plus FBI and two spinoffs (total 3+3=6?), so the total would be 6. But the question is "how many scripted shows did Dick Wolf’s company reportedly have running across networks as he pursued his comeback?" The article says "he now has nine", but during the comeback phase, perhaps the answer is six? But the article doesn't explicitly state that number. Since the article doesn't give the exact number during the comeback phase, answer N/A.

6. **Long-running crime series canceled and later resurrected to 24th season:** The article states: "NBC executives even brought 'Law & Order' back to life more than a decade after the network canceled it. It is now in its 24th season." So the answer is "Law & Order".

7. **Running time of "On Call" episodes harking back to earlier eras:** The article says each episode is 30 minutes, a throwback to decades-old era like "Dragnet". So 30 minutes.

8. **Influence credited with initiating streaming entry (marked by his early 30s):** Elliot Wolf, who is 31, initiated the shift. The article says "Elliot arrived at his father's company about six years ago. ... Elliot knew the company was a 'little late to the streaming game,' and wanted to find a way in. He had an idea for a show... centered on two police officers. Elliot Wolf had discussions with Quibi... before approaching Amazon. So the answer is Elliot Wolf.

9. **Streaming platform for "On Call" debut:** Amazon Prime Video. The article says "debut on Amazon Prime Video on Thursday."

10. **Network that canceled the flagship procedural signaling his low point:** NBC canceled the original "Law & Order" and two spinoffs. The article says "First, NBC abruptly canceled his network mainstay, 'Law & Order,' ... A year later, two 'Law & Order' spinoffs were unceremoniously shown the door." So the flagship was "Law & Order" canceled by NBC.

11. **Survived spinoff and later revived to 24th season:** The article says "NBC executives even brought 'Law & Order' back to life more than a decade after the network canceled it. It is now in its 24th season." So the answer is "Law & Order".

12. **First season episodes of "On Call":** The article states "the show runs for only eight episodes, a normal season length for a streaming series."

13. **Producer credited with earlier TV portfolio contributions:** The article mentions "Aaron Spelling or Steven Bochco or David E. Kelley" but in a comparison. The question is about Dick Wolf's earlier contributions. The article says "Dick Wolf... former advertising executive, he was once a writer and producer on celebrated series like 'Hill Street Blues,' 'Miami Vice' and 'New York Undercover.'" So the answer is Dick Wolf himself? Wait, the question says "which producer—credited with contributions to 'Hill Street Blues,' 'Miami Vice,' and 'New York Undercover'—is referenced..." So the answer is Dick Wolf. The article says "Dick Wolf... was once a writer and producer on celebrated series like..." So the producer is Dick Wolf. Alternatively, the question might be asking for someone else, but the article lists those shows as part of Dick Wolf's own career. So the answer is Dick Wolf.

Wait, the question says "which producer—credited with contributions to 'Hill Street Blues,' 'Miami Vice,' and 'New York Undercover'—is referenced..." The article says "Dick Wolf... was once a writer and producer on celebrated series like 'Hill Street Blues,' 'Miami Vice' and 'New York Undercover.'" So the producer is Dick Wolf. The answer is Dick Wolf.
