Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked without assuming anything beyond the text.

1. **Question 1:** The question is about Leslie Cuyjet's former insurance company before becoming a dancer. The article mentions her great-grandfather was president of a Black-owned life insurance company. But it doesn't name the company. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The article says Sarai's father taught her two lasso tricks. It specifically mentions "two lasso tricks," so the answer is 2.

3. **Question 3:** The article refers to Heru Shabaka-Ra playing the trumpet, but there's no mention of the composition's name. N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The text says Milka Djordjevich's "Bob" was at Live Artery, but no prior commission is mentioned. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The wooden sculptures by Gbaga are described as brown. The answer is brown.

6. **Question 6:** The duration of Cuyjet's film portion isn't specified. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The mirror's significance relates to Sarai's reflection, but no direct link to her father's heritage. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The article doesn't mention specific Congolese dance movements in Linyekula's quivering hands. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The duration of Antinozzi's step sequence isn't given. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The clones are a pair, so two. Answer is 2.

11. **Question 11:** Sarai used a rope for lasso tricks, mirroring Cuyjet's exploration of her great-grandfather's insurance work. The answer is lasso tricks.

12. **Question 12:** Shabaka-Ra's role is with Linyekula, not Djordjevich's "Bob." So N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Coffee grinds symbolize memories. Antinozzi's piece had an airless quality but no mentioned ground covering. N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Sarai used folding chairs and a curtain. The curtain might be the other prop. But the question asks for something like the wooden sculptures. The article mentions a mirror and a curtain, but the sculptures are central. The curtain's role isn't compared, so maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "interacted with folding chairs" and the wooden sculptures were central. The other prop might be the curtain? But the question asks for a prop Sarai used that's similar to the sculptures' centrality. The curtain isn't mentioned as central. Maybe N/A.

Wait, the question says "Besides the folding chairs, what other prop did Sarai interact with vigorously..." The article mentions she yanked a curtain back. So the curtain is another prop. The wooden sculptures were central to Linyekula's performance, so the curtain is the answer here. So answer: curtain.

15. **Question 15:** The precarious lean's connection to financial risks isn't directly stated. N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Linyekula's piece references Balanchine? The article says Antinozzi referenced "La Sonnambula," but Linyekula's work isn't linked to Balanchine. N/A.

17. **Question 17:** Sarai needed a couple of attempts (two) for the second lasso trick. The clones were two. So the answer is 2.

18. **Question 18:** Cowboy culture includes lasso tricks. The article says Sarai's dance delved into cowboy culture. The insurance industry's history with enslaved people is Cuyjet's focus. The common aspect is the historical context. Maybe "cowboy culture" itself is the answer? The question asks what else besides lasso tricks. The article mentions her father's roots in the American West/South and cowboy culture, but no other specific elements. N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Cuyjet's gesture for corporate persona? The article says she had a confiding smile and raised eyebrow. The question asks for a gesture. Maybe "eyebrow raise" or "smile." The answer is eyebrow raise or smile, but the exact term? The article says "every raise of her eyebrow, every confiding smile." So the answer is raised eyebrow or confiding smile. But the question asks for a gesture similar to Baryshnikov's use of fame. Baryshnikov uses fame to bring attention to art, but the gesture here is the facial expressions. So answer: raised eyebrow.

20. **Question 20:** The home shopping show in Cuyjet's work. The title of Djordjevich's piece is "Bob," which excavates the female body. The home shopping show's name isn't given. N/A.
