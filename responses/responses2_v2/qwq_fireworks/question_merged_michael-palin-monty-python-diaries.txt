Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let me start by skimming through the questions again to see what's being asked and then cross-reference each with the article text.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which Beatles song inspired Palin's diary habit. The article mentions that Palin quit smoking and started a diary in 1969, but there's no mention of a Beatles song being the inspiration. The part about the Beatles comes later when discussing George Harrison's comment about Python inheriting their spirit. So the answer here is N/A because the article doesn't link a specific Beatles song to his diary start.

2. **Question 2:** This is about how many cigarettes Roy Orbison smoked before Palin convinced him to quit. The text says Palin wrote a song for Orbison, but there's no info on Orbison's smoking habits. So N/A again.

3. **Question 3:** The travel doc about George Harrison's spiritual journey in India. The article mentions Palin's diaries cover Harrison's death in 2001 but doesn't name any documentary related to his travels. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Which Python suggested diaries with rotating authorship? The article states Terry Jones suggested allowing Pythons mentioned in the diaries to write footnotes. Rotating authorship isn't mentioned, so maybe the answer is Terry Jones, but the question's specifics might not match. Wait, the exact quote is "Terry Jones: The next time I do my diaries and the Pythons are in there, they should be allowed to write footnotes." So the answer here is Terry Jones.

5. **Question 5:** Original working title for Holy Grail proposed by Terry Jones. The article says Eric Idle proposed "Jesus Christ: Lust for Glory" leading to Brian, but for Holy Grail's title? The article doesn't mention Terry Jones proposing a title for Holy Grail. The Holy Grail title was already their project. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** How many volumes before Eric Idle started his response series? The first volume was 2006, and the fourth is coming out. The article mentions Idle was upset by the diaries, but the number of volumes before his response isn't stated. The text says "the new volume covers 1999 to 2009" (the fourth volume). Since the first three were published before the fourth, and Idle's response isn't mentioned in terms of series, so maybe N/A. Wait, the question is about how many volumes before Eric started his own series. The article says "the new volume also includes the period when you first started publishing edited versions of your diaries. It sounds like Idle was upset by them." There's no mention of Eric writing his own series. So the answer is N/A because the question assumes Eric started a response series, but the article doesn't say that. It just says he was upset. So the answer is N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Elvis's favorite sketch. The article says Elvis was a fan but doesn't name a specific sketch. The only mention is that Elvis might have talked about the Knights who say "Ni!" So the answer is "Knights Who Say 'Ni!'" but the question asks for the reported favorite sketch. Since the text says "Elvis Presley had been a Python fan, which is just so unbelievable. To think, Elvis might've talked about the Knights Who Say 'Ni!'", that's the closest, so maybe "Knights Who Say 'Ni!'" is the answer. But the question says "reported favorite sketch according to the fan letter he sent to the BBC." Wait, the article mentions that George Harrison sent a fan letter after the first Python show, but Elvis's letter isn't mentioned. The article says "We did. The Beatles broke up in 1969, which was when Python did its first show. George claimed to have sent a fan letter to Python after the very first of the shows went out. I've got a feeling that someone at the BBC threw the letter away. 'You're George Harrison? Well, I'm the Duke of Edinburgh!' There was this sort of accord between musicians and Python. Python was a bit like music. It was very self-expressive. Later we found out Elvis Presley had been a Python fan, which is just so unbelievable. To think, Elvis might've talked about the Knights Who Say 'Ni!'" So the fan letter was from George, not Elvis. Elvis's favorite isn't stated in a letter, just an assumption. So the answer would be N/A because the question specifies a fan letter from Elvis, which the article doesn't mention. The article only says Elvis was a fan, but the favorite sketch isn't stated as per a letter. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Which London theater Palin frequented as a child that was the location for Fish-Slapping Dance. The article mentions the Thames experience but not a specific theater. The Fish-Slapping Dance was part of a Python sketch, but the article doesn't name the theater. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The song co-written by Palin and Booth for the Beatles' final album. The article says Palin wrote "The Last Time I Saw You Was Tomorrow" for Roy Orbison, not the Beatles. The Beatles' final album is mentioned as breaking up in 1969. Since the song was for Orbison, not the Beatles, the answer is N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Which travel doc did he reunite with Cleese to do the cheese shop sketch. The article mentions their onscreen chemistry and the cheese shop sketch, but there's no mention of them reuniting in a travel doc. The cheese shop was in Python's Holy Grail. The travel docs like "Around the World in 80 Days" are mentioned, but no reunion with Cleese in those. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Cigarettes per day before quitting. The article says "40-cigarettes-a-day smoking habit" so the answer is 40.

12. **Question 12:** The working title Eric Idle proposed for Life of Brian that made them reconsider. The article says Eric Idle came up with "Jesus Christ: Lust for Glory" leading to Brian. The question mentions "noted in Palin's diary entry about his sister Angela." The sister's part is separate. The title is correct, so the answer is "Jesus Christ: Lust for Glory".

13. **Question 13:** The type of program Palin did after Python reflecting his desire for challenge, similar to Thames experience, and song for Orbison. The article mentions his travel docs like "Around the World in 80 Days" as a challenge. The Thames experience refers to the Fish-Slapping Dance, but the answer here is travel documentaries. The question says "specific type of program," so "travel documentaries" is the answer.

14. **Question 14:** Feedback from Eric Idle suggesting a collaborative approach like Oxford/Cambridge dynamic. The article says Terry Jones suggested footnotes. The question mentions Eric Idle's feedback. The text says "Eric's brilliant and very funny and lovely. It'd be nice if we could all sit down and just be as we were when we were writing the comedy shows. We don't do that, really, which is a pity because I'm very fond of them all..." So Eric's feedback isn't explicitly stated. The question's premise might be wrong. The article says Eric was upset, but the suggestion was from Terry. So the answer is N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Elvis's quote from Python, demonstrating musicality, like Palin's song. The article mentions Elvis might have talked about the Knights who say "Ni!" So the answer is "Ni" or "Knights Who Say 'Ni!'". The exact quote would be "Ni".

16. **Question 16:** Career after Python inspired by love of English countryside, as in sketches with Cleese, and emulating the Duke of Edinburgh. The article says after Python he did travel docs. The Duke reference is in the part about George's letter: "You're George Harrison? Well, I'm the Duke of Edinburgh!" So the career is travel documentaries. The answer is travel documentaries.

17. **Question 17:** Wife's suggestion for tombstone. The article says Palin wants "Gone to lunch." His wife's input isn't mentioned here. The quote is Palin's own desire, so the answer is "Gone to lunch" but the question says his wife suggested it. Since the article doesn't mention the wife suggesting it, the answer is N/A. Wait, the text says "I want one that says, 'Gone to lunch.'" So the wife didn't suggest it. So the answer is N/A.

18. **Question 18:** Disagreement about filming location for Life of Brian between Palin/Jones vs. Chapman/Cleese. The article says about Holy Grail: "John and Graham would quite happily have done 'Holy Grail' in a studio. It feels like there's a link..." So for Holy Grail, Palin and Jones wanted countryside, others studio. But the question mentions Life of Brian. The article doesn't mention the location for Life of Brian, only Holy Grail. So N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Volume released next month covering travels to Brazil. The first volume is "The Python Years", fourth is "There and Back" released in the US next month. The article says "the fourth volume comes out in the United States next month." The new volume (fourth) includes 1999-2009, which covers Brazil (as mentioned in the text: "sign a contract to go to Brazil"). So the answer is "There and Back".

20. **Question 20:** Extreme act in travel docs similar to Thames experience. The Thames experience was the Fish-Slapping Dance. The travel docs had challenges like "Around the World in 80 Days" which required extreme travel. The article says "I wasn't there as a reporter... just there as Michael Palin trying to get through a seven-day journey." The extreme act might be the 80 Days journey. The question says "undertake during travel docs, reflecting comfortable upbringing and desire to emulate Roy Orbison's career". The Thames was part of Python, not the travel docs. The extreme act in the docs would be the physical challenges of the journey. The answer is "Around the World in 80 Days" but the question asks for the act, like the Fish-Slapping was an act. Maybe "retracing routes" or "crossing the globe", but the article says "extreme situations" like the Thames. The specific act might be the 80 Days journey itself. The answer is "Around the World in 80 Days" but the question wants the act, so "retracing routes in extreme situations" isn't in text. The article says "crossing the globe for acclaimed series like 'Around the World in 80 Days.'" So the extreme act is the 80 Days journey. The answer is "retracing the route of 'Around the World in 80 Days'" but the question's wording is tricky. The article mentions "the new volume also covers the death of your friend George Harrison, in 2001." Not directly related. The extreme act would be the 80 Days journey. So the answer is "Around the World in 80 Days" but the question asks for the act, so maybe "traveling around the world in 80 days" as the extreme act. The answer is "Around the World in 80 Days".
