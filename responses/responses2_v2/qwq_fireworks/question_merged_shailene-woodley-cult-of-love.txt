Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and answer each question directly. Let me start by going through each question and checking the article for the answers.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks about the number of performances per week before extending the run. The article mentions "through Feb. 2" but doesn't say if the run was extended. It does say "nearly every night and twice on Wednesdays and Saturdays." So, calculating that: 7 days a week, with two shows on Wed and Sat. Wait, the question is about before extending, but the article doesn't mention an extension. So maybe the answer is the schedule as described. The question is tricky because it's about before deciding to extend, but the article doesn't say if there was an extension. Hmm, maybe N/A? Wait, the original schedule is mentioned, so "nearly every night and twice on Wednesdays and Saturdays." So how many per week? Let's see: If it's every day except maybe one, plus two on Wed and Sat. Let's see: Assume 7 nights a week, with two shows on Wed and Sat. Wait, the wording is "nearly every night and twice on Wednesdays and Saturdays." Maybe "nearly every night" could mean 6 nights a week, plus adding an extra on Wed and Sat? Not sure. The exact number isn't given. The question is about performances before extending. Since the article doesn't mention an extension, maybe the answer is N/A? Or maybe it's the schedule as is. Wait the question is how many performances per week did she have scheduled before deciding to extend. Since the article says "through Feb. 2" but doesn't mention an extension, perhaps the answer is N/A because there's no info on an extension. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The store symbolizing interdependence with intertwined trunks. The article says she went to a plant store looking for a money tree, which has intertwined trunks as a symbol of interdependency. The store would be a plant store. But the question is what type of store. The store is a plant store. But the question asks what store type symbolized that through intertwined structures. The answer is plant store.

3. **Question 3:** The play directed by Trip Cullman with Mare Winningham that prompted her to overcome stage fright. The play is "Cult of Love," written by Leslye Headland, directed by Trip Cullman. She mentions overcoming stage fright with public speaking and Nicole Kidman's encouragement. So the play that prompted her to seek a role challenging her abilities is "Cult of Love," since that's the role she took. So the answer is "Cult of Love."

4. **Question 4:** The specific item bought at the farmer's market for an upstate trip after reflecting on existential sadness. She bought meat and vegetables for an upstate trip. The article says: "She needed some meat and vegetables for a trip upstate." So the answer is meat and vegetables. But the question asks for a specific item. Since it's plural, maybe "meat and vegetables" is acceptable.

5. **Question 5:** The blue lotus tea's benefit related to her desire for sleep. The article says the blue lotus is good for lucid dreaming. She mentioned wanting sleep from Santa. So the benefit is lucid dreaming. But her desire is for sleep, but the tea's benefit is for lucid dreaming, which is different. But the question says "mirroring her own desire for restful sleep as expressed to Santa." Since she asked Santa for sleep, the tea's benefit is for lucid dreaming. But maybe the answer is lucid dreaming, even though it's not exactly sleep. The question links the two, so answer is lucid dreaming.

6. **Question 6:** The Dahl family's Christmas celebration aspect challenging her non-religious background. The play's family is Christian, taking figgy pudding seriously. The aspect is their strict Christian faith, since she didn't grow up religious. So the answer is their strict Christian faith.

7. **Question 7:** The New York landmark with vendors where she thought of lions/antelopes. The Union Square holiday market is mentioned as where she was. The landmark is Union Square.

8. **Question 8:** The brand of outerwear she wore. The article says "shiny Moncler puffer." So Moncler.

9. **Question 9:** The role described by Helen Shaw as "mean-waif combustibility." The role is Diana in "Cult of Love." The question mentions Nicole Kidman encouraged her to pursue it. Since Diana is her role, the answer is Diana.

10. **Question 10:** The youngest child character with an angelic voice and fear of being misunderstood. Diana is the baby of the family, so the answer is Diana.

11. **Question 11:** The play with caroling actors in holiday pajamas, mentioned alongside Blue Man Group. The play is "Cult of Love."

12. **Question 12:** Apparel item for security team because of warmth doubts. She bought alpaca socks labeled "survival socks." The item is socks.

13. **Question 13:** The concept illustrated by money tree's trunks. The metaphor was interdependency. The concept is interdependency.

14. **Question 14:** Which creature she identified as, between lion and antelope. She said "I'm the antelope."

15. **Question 15:** Co-star from HBO trauma series who encouraged her. Nicole Kidman from "Big Little Lies."

16. **Question 16:** The winter garment she wore at the cafe. Moncler puffer.

17. **Question 17:** Environmental element more elusive in NY than CA. The article says "nature is sturdy and easily accessed in CA, in NY it's more elusive." So nature.

18. **Question 18:** The figure associated with gifts deferred to January. Santa, as she joked Santa's coming in January.

19. **Question 19:** Type of breakdown in the role. The role involves a nervous breakdown, so nervous breakdown.
