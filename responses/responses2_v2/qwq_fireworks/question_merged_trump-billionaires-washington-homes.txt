Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks which Georgetown property Elon Musk considered before focusing on the Adams Morgan hotel. The article mentions Musk looking to buy the Line Hotel but doesn't mention any other properties he considered in Georgetown. So N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The article lists several cabinet members, like Elon Musk (CEO of Tesla/SpaceX), Howard Lutnick (financier), Scott Bessent (Treasury nominee), etc. But only Elon Musk and maybe others? Wait, the article says Rex Tillerson was CEO of ExxonMobil in the first term. The current term's cabinet includes Musk (Tesla/SpaceX CEO?), Howard Lutnick (Commerce Secretary), Scott Bessent (Treasury). The article specifies Musk is the world's richest. But the question is about the second-term cabinet. The article says "Mr. Trump's first secretary of state, Rex Tillerson...". The current cabinet includes Musk, Lutnick, Bessent. Are any of them former Fortune 500 CEOs? Lutnick is a financier (Foxhall Road buyer), Bessent's net worth is over $700M. The article doesn't explicitly state their prior CEO roles. Only Tillerson was a Fortune 500 CEO, but he was in the first term. The current cabinet members mentioned as CEOs? Musk is CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. So maybe Musk is one. The question is about second-term cabinet members. The article says "counting Trump himself, there are at least a dozen billionaires..." but the exact count of former Fortune 500 CEOs isn't specified. Since the article doesn't list their previous roles except Musk (Tesla), maybe only Musk. But the question says "previously served as CEOs". Since the article doesn't mention others, maybe only Musk. But the answer might be 1? Or N/A? Wait, the article says Elon Musk is the world's richest, and he's in a senior role. But does it say he was a Fortune 500 CEO? Tesla is Fortune 500. So yes. But how many others? The article doesn't say others. So answer is 1? Wait, the question is "how many members of Trump's second-term cabinet previously served as CEOs of Fortune 500 companies?" The article says "Elon Musk... who is also planning to run for governor of Ohio". But Musk is co-leader of the Department of Government Efficiency, maybe not cabinet? The cabinet includes Lutnick (Commerce), Bessent (Treasury), etc. The article says "cabinet picks and those headed for senior roles". Musk is a senior role, maybe not in the cabinet. The cabinet members are Lutnick, Bessent, maybe others. The article doesn't list others. So maybe only Musk isn't in the cabinet. So the answer is N/A because the article doesn't specify the number. Hmm. The question is tricky. Since the article doesn't give exact numbers except Musk (who might not be in the cabinet), the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The question asks total contributions from three ambassador nominees to Trump's 2020 campaign. The article mentions three ambassadors: Charles Kushner (pardoned, donor to 2024), Warren Stephens (donated $3M in 2024 after initially opposing), and Tilman Fertitta (no mention of 2020 contributions). The article says Stephens gave $2M in 2016 against Trump, then $3M in 2024. The question is about 2020. The article doesn't mention any contributions from these three to 2020. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The real estate agent who first approached Howard Lutnick about Bret Baier's property. The article says Lutnick closed on Baier's house, but the agent isn't named. The agent mentioned in the context of the Baier sale is not specified. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Percentage increase in Embassy Row luxury prices after Trump's election. The article mentions a "second-term Trump bump" affecting luxury real estate but doesn't give specific percentages. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Previous owner of N Street property before Joseph Alsop. The article says Scott Bessent looked at a house on N Street once owned by Joseph Alsop. The question is who owned it before Alsop. The article doesn't mention prior owners. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Renovation plans by Peter Thiel after buying Wilbur Ross's home. The article states Thiel bought the house but doesn't mention renovations. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Tech billionaire who outbid Bezos for Kalorama property. The article says Bezos bought the Textile Museum in 2016. It doesn't mention others outbidding him, so N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Square footage difference between Lutnick's home and Sally Quinn's. The article says Lutnick's house is 25M, but doesn't give sq ft. Sally's is 18 rooms, 1790s, but no sq ft. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Number of private meetings Ramaswamy held before his role. The article doesn't mention meetings. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Street in Georgetown with Sally Quinn's home (owned by Lincoln's son) now in demand near Line Hotel. The article says Quinn's home is on N Street. The Line Hotel is in Adams Morgan, but the question asks for the street in Georgetown. The answer is N Street.

12. **Question 12**: Architectural style sought by cabinet members. The article mentions Federal-style (Bessent's consideration), so Federal.

13. **Question 13**: Architectural style on N Street besides French Chateau. Bessent looked at Federal-style on N Street. The question asks for another style besides French Chateau (Lutnick's), so Federal.

14. **Question 14**: Policy area influenced by the Department of Government Efficiency. The article says they want policies like less bank oversight, crypto, etc. David Rubenstein mentioned those. The location in Eisenhower Building might influence efficiency in government, but the question asks for the policy area Rubenstein champions. He mentioned "more oil drilling, easier antitrust, crypto, less bank oversight". The answer could be "government efficiency" but the question specifies Rubenstein's policies. Maybe "reducing bank oversight" or "favored crypto policy". The article says "the policies they believe in from the federal government -- more oil drilling, easier antitrust policy, more favorable crypto policy, less bank oversight." The Department of Government Efficiency might focus on efficiency, but the question asks for the policy area Rubenstein champions. So perhaps "less bank oversight" or one of those. The answer might be "bank oversight reduction" or similar. The exact answer isn't clear, but the closest is "less bank oversight".

15. **Question 15**: Number of individuals with over $4B excluding ambassadors. The article lists Musk ($429B), Trump ($6.8B), Penny Pritzker ($4.1B), and others? The cabinet includes Musk, Trump, Pritzker. Also, Vivek Ramaswamy is $1B, so not. So excluding ambassadors, the three are Musk, Trump, Pritzker. So minimum 3 (including Pritzker). The question says "including Penny Pritzker", so total is at least 3. The answer is 3.

16. **Question 16**: Bezos's selling price considering price increase. The article says Sally Quinn's house was offered twice the price, but without knowing her initial price or Bezos's purchase price, can't compute. He paid $23M in 2016. If prices doubled, it would be ~$46M, but the article doesn't state the increase percentage. The question says "approximate selling price considering the initial purchase price and current trends". Since the article mentions prices are up, but no exact numbers, N/A.

17. **Question 17**: Action similar to Charles Kushner (pardoned after donating). Warren Stephens donated after opposing, so maybe a pardon. The answer is "pardon".

18. **Question 18**: Neighborhood with WASP hegemony now meritocracy. The article mentions Georgetown's cobblestone lanes and Jamie Peva says "WASP hegemony declined... meritocracy". So Georgetown.

19. **Question 19**: Ratio of Zients' max assets ($338M) to Musk's $429B. 338M / 429,000M = ~0.000787 or 0.0008. The question asks "approximate ratio", so 1:5500 or similar. The exact answer is 0.000788, but as a ratio, maybe 1 to 1270 (if Zients's max is 338M vs Musk's 429B). 429,000 / 338 ≈ 1270. So the ratio is 1:1270. But the question says "ratio of Zients to Musk", so 338 / 429000 ≈ 0.000788. The answer is "approximately 0.0008" or as a ratio "1:1270". The article says Zients' assets range up to $338M, Musk's net worth is $429B. So the ratio is 338,000,000 / 429,000,000,000 = 0.0007878 or roughly 1:1268. So the answer is "1 to 1270" or similar. But the question says "approximate", so maybe "about 1:1300".

20. **Question 20**: Neighborhood like Kalorama with faster pace due to Trump bump. The article mentions Georgetown's cobblestone lanes and WASP decline. So Georgetown.
