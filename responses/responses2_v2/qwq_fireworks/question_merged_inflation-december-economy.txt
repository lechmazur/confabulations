Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked without adding any extra info or assumptions.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks what percentage increase in egg prices Sarah House cited. Scanning through the article, I find that Sarah House is quoted talking about inflation not going anywhere, but the specific egg price percentage is mentioned in the third paragraph: "the price of eggs, which is up by more than a third over the past year." So "more than a third" translates to over 33%. But the question is whether Sarah specifically cited that. The article says "Prices continued to rise in some of the categories that matter most to consumers. Grocery prices... led by the price of eggs, which is up by more than a third over the past year." Sarah's quote doesn't mention the egg price directly. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "did Wells Fargo's senior economist Sarah House specifically cite"—since the article doesn't attribute the egg percentage to her, it's N/A.

2. **Question 2**: How many consecutive months of declining core inflation before December's 3.2%? The article says "core... was more encouraging: The index rose 3.2 percent from a year earlier after three straight months of 3.3 percent gains." So prior to December, the previous three months were 3.3%, so the 3.2% is a decline from that. So the answer is 0, because the three months were at 3.3% each, so December is the first decline. Wait, but the question is about "declining core inflation rates". The core rate was 3.3% for three months, then 3.2. So the decline is only one month's drop. So the number of consecutive months before December's 3.2 would be zero, since the previous three were flat. Wait, maybe the question is how many months of declining before December? Since before December, the prior three months were at 3.3, so no decline. So answer is 0? Or maybe the question is how many consecutive months of decline ended with December? Hmm. The question says "preceded December's 3.2". Since prior to December, the core was 3.3 for three months, so there were no declines before December. So answer is 0. But the question might be tricky here. The article says "after three straight months of 3.3 percent gains." So the 3.2 is a decrease from 3.3, so that's one month. So the prior three months were flat at 3.3, so the decline started in December. Therefore, the answer is 0.

3. **Question 3**: Which Fed official first expressed concerns about Trump's tariffs? The article mentions that "some Fed officials have said they are already factoring those policies into their outlook for inflation." But it doesn't name any specific official. The only Fed person named here is James Egelhof from BNP Paribas, but he's not a Fed official. So answer is N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Peak monthly increase in shelter costs in 2023 before dropping to 4.6% in Dec. The article says "Shelter prices were up 4.6 percent in December from a year earlier, the smallest 12-month increase in nearly three years." The "smallest in nearly three years" implies that the peak might have been higher. But the article doesn't state the exact previous peak. Since it's the smallest in three years, the peak would be before that. But without specific numbers, we can't answer. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Bank of America economist's projected basis points for rate hikes. The article has Aditya Bhave from BofA saying "I think it's difficult to make a case to keep cutting." But there's no mention of specific basis points. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: BNP Paribas' correlation between labor market strength and wholesale prices. The article says "the continued strength of the labor market... has made policymakers less worried... investors widely expect the central bank to hold interest rates steady... wholesale prices rose more slowly in December." But the question asks about a correlation BNP identified. The article mentions James Egelhof from BNP, but the paragraph talks about labor market strength and the Fed's stance, not a correlation with wholesale prices. The wholesale price data is mentioned in a separate sentence. So maybe no direct correlation stated, so N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Categories with strongest seasonal adjustment factors in Dec CPI. The article mentions grocery prices (eggs), gas, shelter, services outside housing. But seasonal adjustments aren't discussed. The question is about seasonal factors in the calculation, but the text doesn't specify which categories had the strongest. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: BLS's model for housing impact on core inflation. The article doesn't mention any specific mathematical model used by BLS for this. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Consecutive months of service price increases outside housing before December's slowdown. The article says "services prices outside housing... continued to cool." But it doesn't say how many months they were increasing before. Since "continued to cool," maybe they had been increasing but now slowing. But exact number not given. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Threshold for inflation triggering next rate cut. The article doesn't mention any specific threshold number for the Fed to cut rates. They talk about expecting inflation to cool, but no threshold given. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Which category's price increase caused Fed's concern despite cooling shelter and services? The article states that grocery prices (led by eggs) and gas prices (4.4% in Dec) are rising again. Since shelter and services outside housing are cooling, the Fed's concern about stalled inflation is due to groceries and gas. The question asks which category, so groceries/eggs and gas. But the question specifies "primarily responsible"—the first part says "driven in part by another sharp rise in the price of eggs and other groceries." So the answer is groceries/eggs. The exact wording: "the price of eggs and other groceries." So answer: Grocery prices.

12. **Question 12**: Core inflation's monthly change from Nov to Dec. The article says the core index rose 3.2% year-over-year after three months of 3.3%. But the question is the monthly change (November to December). The first paragraph mentions that overall CPI rose 0.4% from November. But core's monthly change isn't stated. The article only gives annual rates. So N/A.

13. **Question 13**: How many consecutive months of slowing core inflation does Dec's report mark? The core was 3.3% for three months, then 3.2. So the slowing started in December. That's one month of decline. So consecutive months of slowing would be 1? Or since the prior three were flat, only the December is the first. The question is how many consecutive months does the Dec report mark. Since before Dec there were no declines, it's 1. But the question might be asking how many months of slowing before Dec? No. So answer is 1.

14. **Question 14**: Trump's policy cited as negating Fed's rate cuts. The article says "President-elect Trump... promised to impose steep tariffs on imports... policies that economists warn could push up prices further." So tariffs are the answer.

15. **Question 15**: James Egelhof's referenced inflation threshold. The article says "inflation already above target and with risks further to the upside..." The Fed's target is typically 2%, but the current core is 3.2% and CPI 2.9. Egelhof mentions that inflation is above target, so the threshold might be 2%, but the question asks what numerical threshold he referenced. The article doesn't state a specific number, just "above target." Since target is 2%, maybe answer is 2%, but the question says "specific numerical threshold" he referenced. Since it's not explicitly stated, N/A.

16. **Question 16**: Which economist linked Fed's reluctance to a stabilized indicator mentioned with job growth. The article says "the labor market... including data released last week showing unexpectedly strong job growth in December... policymakers are less worried... investors widely expect the central bank to hold... Aditya Bhave... stabilizing labor market..." Wait, the economist is Aditya Bhave from BofA. The paragraph where job growth is mentioned is in the same as the labor market strength. The economist mentioned in that paragraph is Aditya Bhave, who said "With a labor market that's stabilizing..." So the answer is Aditya Bhave.

17. **Question 17**: Year-over-year egg price increase. The article states "the price of eggs, which is up by more than a third over the past year." So over 33%.

18. **Question 18**: Number of rate cuts in past year. The article mentions "breaking a streak of three consecutive rate cuts." So prior to the upcoming meeting, there were three. So the answer is 3.

19. **Question 19**: Metric influencing the 10-year Treasury yield drop. The article says "the data is unlikely to do much to ease those concerns. Stock prices rose and bond yields fell... 10-year Treasury yield... fell 0.15 percentage points... data released on Tuesday showed that wholesale prices rose more slowly in December." So the cooling wholesale prices (Tuesday's data) might be the metric. The question asks which metric influenced the drop. The yield fell because of the inflation data (CPI report) and possibly the wholesale prices. The article says "wholesale prices rose more slowly in December" which was released on Tuesday. The CPI report was Wednesday. The bond yield drop is linked to the CPI report ("investors breathed a sigh of relief that the inflation data wasn't worse"). So the answer is the CPI data (Consumer Price Index report), but the question asks for the metric discussed. The article mentions the wholesale prices data as a separate point. The Treasury yield drop is due to the CPI report's not being worse, so maybe the CPI itself. But the question is tricky. The exact sentence: "the data is unlikely to do much to ease those concerns. Stock prices rose and bond yields fell on Wednesday as investors breathed a sigh of relief that the inflation data wasn't worse." So the metric is the inflation data (CPI). But the answer needs to be from the metrics discussed. The question says "which metric discussed in the article directly influenced the 0.15... drop..." The article mentions the CPI report and the wholesale prices. The bond yield drop is due to the CPI not being worse. So the answer is the Consumer Price Index report (CPI). But the options might be "wholesale prices" since that's another metric. Wait, the question says "metric discussed in the article directly influenced". The drop in bond yields is due to the CPI report (the inflation data not being worse than expected). The wholesale prices are mentioned in a different context. So answer is the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data.

20. **Question 20**: Sarah House's reason for 2024's lack of progress. She said "we're not really going anywhere... the pace has been really disappointing." The article then lists categories: groceries rising again, gas up, etc. But the question is specifically what Sarah cited. The article attributes her statement to the overall inflation not moving, but the exact reason she gave is not detailed. The article states her quote as "we're not really going anywhere... the pace has been really disappointing." So the reason is the lack of progress in inflation reduction, but the question asks for the primary reason cited. Since the article doesn't attribute specific categories to her, maybe N/A. Wait, the paragraph after her quote says "Prices continued to rise in some of the categories that matter most to consumers. Grocery prices... are rising again... gas prices jumped..." So perhaps the answer is the continued rise in groceries and gas, but Sarah's quote is general. Since the question specifies her reason, and the text doesn't link her quote to specific categories beyond the general statement, answer N/A? Or is the primary reason the overall lack of progress, which the question accepts as "lack of progress"? The question says "primary reason cited by Sarah House for the lack of progress on inflation in 2024"—she says "we're not really going anywhere" which is the lack of progress, so maybe the answer is "lack of progress" but that's circular. Alternatively, the article's next sentences list the factors (groceries, gas), but it's not her statement. So the exact reason she cited is not specified beyond her general comment. Therefore, N/A.
