Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the provided article and answer strictly based on that.

1. **Total number of seats added?** The article says a seat was added for "new media". The Associated Press already had a seat, so maybe the answer is 1. Wait, the question is about seats added for both new media and AP. But AP's seat wasn't added here. The AP reporter was already there. The article mentions adding a seat for new media. So the answer is 1.

2. **News outlet whose co-founder criticized briefings before their reporter's question?** The first question was asked by Mike Allen of Axios. The article says Jim VandeHei, his partner at Axios, had said their reporters shouldn't go to briefings. So Axios is the outlet.

3. **Number of migrants in Guantanamo?** The article states 10 migrants with gang affiliations are held there. The tent city is separate for 30k, so answer is 10.

4. **Policy reversal causing NCAA's decision?** The article says the NCAA's decision came a day after Trump reversed federal policy. The specific policy isn't named, but since it's about transgender athletes, maybe the federal policy was about Title IX or similar. But the text only says "reversing federal policy", so the answer is "reversing federal policy".

5. **Reason given by Leavitt for reassigning the seat?** She said it's to share Trump's message and adapt to the new media landscape in 2025. Also, the article mentions declining trust in traditional media. The direct reason given was the need to adapt to new media and share the president's message.

6. **Two media orgs without seats before?** Axios and Breitbart. The article says Axios didn't have a seat because they didn't see value. Breitbart also never had one. Both are mentioned.

7. **Legal strategy against press?** The article says Trump's cases against CBS and Des Moines Register lack merit but are effective at harassing. So the strategy is lawsuits.

8. **Mike Allen's previous affiliations?** He was with NYT, WaPo, Politico. Leavitt called him new media. So Mike Allen is the answer.

9. **Reporter from outlet avoiding briefings first question?** That's Mike Allen from Axios, since Axios editors didn't value briefings.

10. **Seat altered for digital media?** The side chair next to lectern, previously for officials, now for new media.

11. **Right-wing reporter supporting change?** Matt Boyle from Breitbart. His email called it a historic step against establishment media.

12. **Outlet linked to first question's reporter?** Axios, since Mike Allen is from there.

13. **AP reporter asking about advocacy vs truth?** Zeke Miller. The article mentions him asking that question.

14. **Agency for global aid Trump wanted closed?** U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

15. **EPA office considering leave?** Office of Environmental Justice.

16. **Collegiate sports org?** NCAA, as stated directly.

17. **Correspondent since 2016?** Michael M. Grynbaum, mentioned at the end.

18. **Graphical aid used?** A chart showing declining trust in traditional media.
