Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure each answer is directly from the text or logically inferred without adding external knowledge.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks about the specific cellular mechanism influenced by the FOXO3 gene that Dr. Province suggested was responsible for Helen Reichert's longevity despite smoking. The article states that FOXO3 is involved in cellular health aspects. However, the text doesn't specifically link Dr. Province to mentioning FOXO3. The FOXO3 mention is from Dr. Milman. Since the question attributes it to Dr. Province, this might be an error. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The study says adopting all eight behaviors adds up to 24 years, expecting to live to ~87. If someone follows seven (excluding stress management), the article doesn't give exact numbers for partial adherence. Dr. Milman's point is that even doing everything right (all 8) doesn't get you to 100. The question specifies excluding stress management. Since partial adherence isn't quantified, answer N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The article says lifespan is 25% genes, 75% environment/lifestyle. Up to 87, which is the age for those following all 8 behaviors, so the 75% (environment) would apply here. So the proportion is 75%.

4. **Question 4**: Dr. Province and Dr. Perls' study (Long Life Family Study) mentions families with smoking/couch potatoes but still have longevity genes. The article states FOXO3 is a gene found in centenarians affecting cellular health. Since the question asks what aspect of cellular health is influenced by the gene in those families, the answer is the cellular health aspects linked to FOXO3. But the exact term from the text is "cellular health" as per the article's statement.

5. **Question 5**: The question asks a single factor other than genetics for increased life expectancy in those who didn't reach 100 but followed a healthy lifestyle. The study's 8 behaviors are the factor. The answer would be "healthy lifestyle" but the article says even those who do everything right can't reach 100, implying lifestyle extends to 87 but not beyond. So the factor is the healthy lifestyle itself, but the question might be looking for something else. Wait, the question says "other than genetics" but the answer is the lifestyle. The article says "adopting eight healthy behaviors could add up to 24 years". So the factor is the adherence to the healthy behaviors. Answer is "adhering to eight healthy behaviors" but the exact phrasing in the question's context? The article says "living a healthy lifestyle" is the key. The question says "increased life expectancy observed in individuals who strictly adhered to a healthy lifestyle, yet did not reach the age of 100"—so the factor is their healthy lifestyle. So answer is "healthy lifestyle".

6. **Question 6**: Helen Reichert said the doctors who told her to quit had died, but the article doesn't state their exact age. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The study by Barzilai and Milman compared centenarian offspring with controls. The text mentions cardiovascular disease had low rates in centenarian offspring even with unhealthy lifestyles. The question asks for another disease besides cardiovascular. The article doesn't mention another specific disease here. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The APOE gene's influence on Alzheimer's is mentioned. The question asks which cognitive decline is less prevalent. Since APOE2 reduces Alzheimer's risk, the answer is Alzheimer's disease. But the question specifies "similar to the reduced risk in veterans with all 8 behaviors". The veterans with all 8 had low cardiovascular disease. But the question is about cognitive decline. The article says centenarians have lower rates of dementia (which includes Alzheimer's). So answer is "dementia" or "Alzheimer's disease".

9. **Question 9**: The maximum years from the study is 24, but the question adds APOE2 and Long Life Study. The article states the study's 24 years is from the 8 behaviors. Genetics (APOE2) might help, but the study's max is 24. So answer 24.

10. **Question 10**: The APOE2 allele is more common in long-lived families. The article states this directly.

11. **Question 11**: In the study, centenarian offspring with unhealthy lifestyles had low cardiovascular disease compared to controls with healthy lifestyles. The trend is that centenarian offspring had low rates regardless of lifestyle, while controls didn't. So the answer is "lower prevalence" or "similar low prevalence".

12. **Question 12**: The study mentions eight behaviors. The answer is 8.

13. **Question 13**: The gene repeatedly mentioned is FOXO3.

14. **Question 14**: The article says genetics matter more for reaching 100. So the implication is genetics have greater impact than lifestyle for extreme longevity.

15. **Question 15**: The veteran study's 8 behaviors lead to ~87, which is 10 years above average (since average is ~77). So the number is 8.

16. **Question 16**: The final caution is not to take health advice from centenarians, since their lifestyle might not matter. The article says "don't take health advice from a centenarian".

Now, applying strict rules: if the article doesn't explicitly state, answer N/A.

Let me go through each again carefully.

1. The article says FOXO3 is involved in cellular health, but Dr. Province's study mentions families with smoking etc., but does Dr. Province specifically link FOXO3? The article says "One that has cropped up in several studies of centenarians is called FOXO3" and Dr. Province is part of the Long Life Family Study. However, the question says Dr. Province suggested it. The article says "studies have revealed" and "Dr. Province said that long-lived families have a higher prevalence of APOE2". The FOXO3 mention is from the general text, not directly tied to Dr. Province's statement. So answer N/A.

2. The study's projection for all 8 is 87. If they followed 7, the text doesn't say. So N/A.

3. The 25% genetics, 75% environment is general. Up to 87 (which is the age for all 8), so environment's proportion is 75%.

4. The gene variant in families is APOE2 (since Province mentions APOE2 in long-lived families). The aspect of cellular health linked to FOXO3, but the question asks what Dr. Province identified. The text says "some special gene variants that experts think help them avoid disease and live longer. Some genes may affect... FOXO3..." but the direct mention by Province is APOE2. The question asks for the aspect influenced by the gene variant in the study families. The answer is "cellular health" but the article says the gene variants help avoid disease. Wait, the question says "directly influenced by the gene variant prevalent in families". The gene variant mentioned by Province is APOE2. The aspect influenced by genes like FOXO3 (which affects cellular health). However, the question is about what Province identified. The text says Province mentions APOE2. The aspect would be avoiding disease. But the question is about cellular health. The article states "FOXO3 is involved in many fundamental aspects of cellular health". Since the question is about Province and Perls' study, which found families with smoking etc. but have genes like APOE2. The direct link from Province's study might be disease avoidance, but the question is about cellular health aspect. Since the text says "cellular health" in the context of FOXO3, but Province's study links to APOE2. Hmm. The question is phrased as "directly influenced by the gene variant prevalent in families". The article says "some special gene variants that experts think help them avoid disease and live longer. One that has cropped up... is FOXO3". So maybe the answer is "cellular health" but not sure. Alternatively, maybe the gene variant's influence on disease avoidance, but the question asks for cellular aspect. Since the article mentions FOXO3's role in cellular health, but the study's finding is about genes like APOE2 and FOXO3. The question is asking what aspect of cellular health was identified. The answer would be "cellular health" as per the text's statement. Alternatively, maybe "disease avoidance", but the question specifies cellular mechanism. I think "cellular health" is the answer.

5. The question asks a single factor other than genetics for the increased life expectancy (up to 87). The factor is the healthy lifestyle (the 8 behaviors). The answer is "adhering to healthy lifestyle" or "eight healthy behaviors". The article says "adopting eight healthy behaviors could add up to 24 years to people's lives". So the factor is the behaviors/lifestyle. The answer is "adhering to eight healthy behaviors".

6. The article says doctors had died, but no specific age. N/A.

7. The study compared cardiovascular disease, but the question asks another disease. The text doesn't mention another. N/A.

8. The APOE gene's influence on Alzheimer's. The question is about cognitive decline. The article says centenarians have lower rates of age-related diseases including dementia. So the answer is "Alzheimer's disease" or "dementia".

9. The maximum is 24 years from the study. The APOE2 and Long Life Study might not add more, so 24.

10. APOE2 is more common in long-lived families.

11. The trend is that centenarian offspring with unhealthy lifestyles had low rates, while controls with healthy had higher. So the answer is "lower prevalence".

12. 8 behaviors.

13. FOXO3.

14. Genetics (or lucky genetics) have greater impact than lifestyle for extreme longevity.

15. 8 behaviors lead to 87, which is 10 more than average (assuming average is ~77). The question asks how many practices, so 8.

16. The caution is not to take advice from centenarians.
