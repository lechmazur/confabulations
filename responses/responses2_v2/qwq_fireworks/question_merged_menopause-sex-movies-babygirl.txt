1. **Question 1:** Which actress founded the menopause-focused online community RESPIN that partnered with Stripes Beauty to create holistic solutions for women in midlife?

The article mentions Naomi Watts founded Stripes Beauty, and Halle Berry started RESPIN. The question asks about RESPIN's founder, so the answer should be Halle Berry.

Since July is the author, maybe the director isn't mentioned here. The article doesn't mention a director for "All Fours," so maybe N/A. But wait, "All Fours" is described as a book, so maybe the director isn't involved. So answer N/A.

10. **Question 10:** What medical symptom associated with perimenopause is explicitly depicted through Romy's eye movement desensitization therapy sessions in "Babygirl"?

11. **Question 11:** In which 2024 horror comedy does the lead actress's real-life entrepreneurial venture focused on menopausal health products directly influence her character's profession?

The article mentions a 40% decrease in sex scenes in top movies from 2000 to 2023, but not partnered sex rates. The question mixes movie scenes with real-world data. The article states "every generation... is having markedly less sex," but no percentage given. So N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Which actress's memoir about open marriage is directly contrasted with a fictional work where the protagonist experiences Burning Mouth Syndrome as a perimenopausal symptom?
