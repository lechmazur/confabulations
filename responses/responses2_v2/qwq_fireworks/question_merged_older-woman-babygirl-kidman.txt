Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the strict instructions.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which streaming service produced the film where the older woman protagonist meets her younger love interest at a grocery store and must teach him how to shop there properly. I remember the article mentions "A Family Affair" where Nicole Kidman's character is wooed by Zac Efron. The ending part says he has to enter a grocery store to win her back. The article also mentions "A Family Affair" as a movie, but the streaming service isn't directly stated. Wait, the article says "streaming romance films" but doesn't specify which service for each. The user might be referring to "A Family Affair" as the answer, but the question is about the streaming service. Since the article doesn't mention the streaming service for that film, the answer is N/A. Wait, no, actually, the article mentions "A Family Affair" in the context of streaming? Let me check again. The first paragraph says "streaming romance films, she was wooed by a boy-band member ("The Idea of You"), an action movie star ("A Family Affair") and a finance bro ("Lonely Planet"). So "A Family Affair" is a streaming film, but which service? The article doesn't specify, so the answer is N/A. Wait, the question is asking for the streaming service, but the article doesn't state that. So answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The boy band member had to wait five years before the gallery owner agreed to date him again. The article says in "The Idea of You," Hathaway's character makes him wait five years. So the answer is 5.

3. **Question 3:** The psychological conditions mentioned in classic films like "Sunset Boulevard" (Norma Desmond's delusion) and "To Die For" (crazy). The article says older women were given "too-obvious psychological tics (alcoholism, narcissism, delusion)". So the answer is delusion.

4. **Question 4:** The actress who pioneered the transformation in the 1950s. The article mentions "Sunset Boulevard" (1950) with Norma Desmond played by Gloria Swanson. But the question is about who pioneered the transformation from villain to complex protagonist. Wait, the article says "In 1967's 'The Graduate,' as Mrs. Robinson, she scrambled to a slightly higher perch, representing a legitimate sexual threat." But the question is about the 1950s. The article mentions "Sunset Boulevard" in 1950, so the actress there was Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson's role). But the question is about who pioneered the transformation. The article says in 1950, she was a tragic figure, but maybe the transformation to complex was Mrs. Robinson in 1967. Wait the question says "in 1950s Hollywood". The 1950s would include Sunset Boulevard (1950). So maybe the answer is Gloria Swanson? But the article doesn't state she pioneered the transformation. It says Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate (1967) was a step up. The question might be a trick. The article says "the older woman archetype is as old as film itself. In the 1927 silent film..." but the 1950s example is Sunset Blvd. So the answer might be N/A because the article doesn't mention who pioneered the transformation in the 50s. Wait, the article says "In the 1950 classic 'Sunset Boulevard,' as Norma Desmond, she was inflated into a comic and tragic character..." but that's still a villain or tragic figure, not a complex protagonist. The question is about who pioneered the transformation to complex protagonist in 1950s. Maybe the answer is N/A because the article doesn't mention that. Wait the article says "she has been at risk of being yanked back into her cage, dismissed again as a desperate animal. Now she is presumed to be an attractive human." The transformation to complex might be Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate (1967), which is 60s, not 50s. So for 1950s, the answer is N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The robotics company executive's husband whose affair was discovered via surveillance. The article mentions in "Babygirl" Romy (Nicole Kidman) is the robotics executive. The intern is Samuel. The article says "he could expose their arrangement, break up her family and derail her career." But the husband's name isn't mentioned. The article says "her husband" but no name. So answer is N/A.

6. **Question 6:** How many beauty treatments Romy underwent before the intern noticed the injection. The article says "a gantlet of zaps and jabs, with results that provoke her daughter's mockery and her intern's uncomfortably close interest. After he spies a new injection under her eye..." It doesn't specify the number. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The 1980s film that sent older women to psychiatric institutions. The article mentions "In the 1983 comedy 'Class,' in which an exquisite Jacqueline Bisset plays a kind of manic pixie dream mom who improbably pursues the dough-faced prep school kid Andrew McCarthy, our older woman disappears into a psychiatric institution." The director of "Class" is probably the answer. The article says "the famous director's 1980s film" so the film is "Class" directed by? The article doesn't mention the director's name. Wait, the question is asking for the director's name. Wait the question says "which famous director's 1980s film established the trope..." The article doesn't name the director of "Class". It just mentions the film's title and actors. So answer is N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Age difference between Catherine and Jonathan in "Disclaimer". The article says "a married journalist (a younger version of Catherine) encounters the young tourist Jonathan on a beach vacation..." but doesn't specify the age difference. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** How many times she faked orgasms. The article says "fakes an orgasm with her husband" once. But it's a single instance, so the answer is 1. Wait the question says "how many times", the article only mentions it once, so 1.

10. **Question 10:** The name of the unpublished novel in "Disclaimer". The article says "the novel claims to expose..." but doesn't give a title. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The movie where the older woman is a robotics leader during a festive occasion. The article says "For Christmas... she got a starring role in the erotic thriller 'Babygirl'..." So "Babygirl" is the answer.

12. **Question 12:** The movie with defense attorney and stepson. The article mentions "Last Summer" where she is a defense attorney with a stepson. The question says "recently" but the article says "Last Summer" is a film where she is a defense attorney. So answer is "Last Summer".

13. **Question 13:** The 1927 film with frustrated wives hiring escorts. The article says "In the 1927 silent film 'Cradle Snatchers'..." So the answer is "Cradle Snatchers".

14. **Question 14:** Actresses preserved in their 30s. The article says "so was Anne Bancroft (and she was only 35!)" in reference to being preserved. So Anne Bancroft.

15. **Question 15:** Film with boy band member. The article says "The Idea of You" features a boy band member. So answer is "The Idea of You".

16. **Question 16:** Streaming series with investigative journalist and past affair. The article says "Disclaimer" is the limited series where Catherine Ravenscroft is the journalist. So "Disclaimer".

17. **Question 17:** Film with tabloid scandal and pop star. The article mentions "The Idea of You" where the tabloids call her a cougar. The pop star type is Zac Efron in "A Family Affair". Wait the question says "reassessment of the older protagonistâ€™s relationship with a pop star-type admirer". The article says in "The Idea of You" she rejects the boy band member (Galitzine) when tabloids call her a cougar. So the film would be "The Idea of You". But the question's answer might be "A Family Affair" since Zac Efron is a pop star. Wait the article says "In 'The Idea of You,' Hathaway's character is pursued by Galitzine's boy-bander only to discover that he has a history of older girlfriends, and a romantic playbook for snagging them. When the tabloids catch on, and call her a 'cougar,' she decides he's not worth it." So the film here is "The Idea of You". But the question mentions "pop star-type admirer" which is the boy band member. So the answer is "The Idea of You".

18. **Question 18:** Film where movie star searches for affection in a grocery store. The article mentions "A Family Affair" where Zac Efron (movie star) has to go to a grocery store to win back Kidman. So "A Family Affair".

19. **Question 19:** Film title linked to global travel and romance. The article mentions "Lonely Planet" as the title evocative of travel. So "Lonely Planet".

20. **Question 20:** Recent Todd Haynes film reimagining the trope. The article says "Todd Haynes' 2023 film 'May December' -- which also plays with tabloid interest..." So "May December".
