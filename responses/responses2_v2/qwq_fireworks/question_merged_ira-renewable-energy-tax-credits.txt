Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions beyond that. Let me go through each question and check the text for answers.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon as the one who came up with the idea of a broad tax credit. So the answer should be Ron Wyden.

2. **Question 2:** The article states that a next-gen nuclear reactor backed by Bill Gates broke ground in Wyoming, but there's no mention of megawatt capacity or the first month's data. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The Treasury Department's analysis found a 2-5% reduction, but does it guarantee it? The article says "could help lower," not guarantee. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The analysis by the Rhodium Group is mentioned, but they didn't say geothermal becomes dominant. The question specifies an environmental organization, but Rhodium is a research firm. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** No specific dollar amount for fusion projects in Republican districts is given. The total investment is $500 billion but not broken down by technology. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The article mentions 28 states with battery storage under construction, but not which had the highest percentage. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The American Clean Power Association isn't cited giving job numbers for nuclear specifically. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The Heritage Foundation opposes the credits but doesn't mention an emissions threshold for phase-out. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The first approval for carbon capture isn't named. The article mentions it exists but no specific company. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The per-megawatt-hour credit is at least $30, but cost savings compared to fossil fuels aren't specified. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The article states "$30 credit for every megawatt-hour". So $30.

12. **Question 12:** David Turk from Energy Department said "we're all in the same boat". So David Turk.

13. **Question 13:** The credits stay until emissions are 75% below 2022 levels. So until 75% reduction from 2022.

14. **Question 14:** 28 states have battery storage under construction. Answer is 28.

15. **Question 15:** The project in Wyoming is the next-gen nuclear reactor backed by Bill Gates. So that project's name isn't given, but the description is "next-generation nuclear reactor backed by Bill Gates". The answer is that project's existence, but the question asks for the name. Since it's not named, maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "which innovative energy project... noted for next-gen and supported by billionaire (Bill Gates)". The article says "next-generation nuclear reactor backed by Bill Gates broke ground in Wyoming". So the answer is the next-generation nuclear reactor.

16. **Question 16:** The range is 2-5%. So 2 to 5 percent.

17. **Question 17:** Edison Electric Institute is mentioned as working with Republicans. So Edison Electric Institute.

18. **Question 18:** Burning wood is mentioned alongside methane from farms needing analysis. So burning wood.

19. **Question 19:** Ron Wyden again, as he was the Senate Finance Committee chairman. So Ron Wyden.

20. **Question 20:** President-elect Trump is cited for criticizing wind turbines. So Donald J. Trump.

Let me cross-verify each again to ensure accuracy.
