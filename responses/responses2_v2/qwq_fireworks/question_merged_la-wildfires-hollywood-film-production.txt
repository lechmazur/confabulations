Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which Disney executive coordinated relief efforts from their evacuated home while managing Pixar's production delays. The article mentions Robert A. Iger, Disney's CEO, who lost his home and was overseeing relief efforts from a hotel. Pixar is a Disney subsidiary, so he's the one. Answer: Robert A. Iger.

2. **Question 2:** How many IATSE members who lost homes got temporary housing from Disney? The article says Disney offered housing to employees who lost homes, but IATSE members are a separate group. The text states 8,000 IATSE members were in affected areas, but there's no mention of them being offered Disney housing. Answer: N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Percentage of affected productions from studios in fire-threatened areas. Only two Disney productions were halted. Studios like Disney's Burbank, Pixar (Northern CA), Sony in Culver City, etc., but the article doesn't specify percentages. So can't calculate. Answer: N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Which trade publication editor resigned over awards coverage? The article mentions trade publications had mixed coverage but doesn't mention any resignations. Answer: N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Revenue loss for Pacific Palisades theaters. The article talks about damage there but no specific theater revenue numbers. Answer: N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Criteria for Disney's housing assistance. The article says employees who lost homes qualify. So the criteria is losing their home. Answer: Employees who lost their homes.

7. **Question 7:** First executive to propose canceling Oscars. The article mentions some push for business as usual, others question it, but no one is named as proposing cancellation. Answer: N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Modifications to "The Last Showgirl" marketing. The film's premiere was canceled but the release went on. No changes to marketing mentioned beyond that. Answer: Cancelled premiere but released as planned.

9. **Question 9:** Streaming service offering facilities as shelter. The article doesn't mention any streaming service doing this. Answer: N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Number of Academy members requesting extensions. The Academy extended the voting period but no number is given. Answer: N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Public figure touring damage and discussing Warner Bros. response. The article mentions Kamala Harris toured Pacific Palisades but didn't mention Warner Bros. policies. Answer: Kamala Harris.

Wait, let me check question 11 again. The article says Kamala Harris met with local officials, but does it say she discussed Warner Bros.' policies? The text says "met with local officials" but doesn't specify the topic. So maybe it's N/A. Wait, the question says "to discuss Warner Bros.' wildfire response policies". The article doesn't mention that detail. Hmm. So maybe N/A? But the question says "due to disagreements over continuing awards coverage during the wildfire crisis" for question 4, but that's a different part. For question 11, the article states Harris toured the area and met with officials, but the specifics of discussing Warner Bros. policies aren't there. So answer N/A. Wait, the exact text: "Kamala Harris toured fire damage in Pacific Palisades and met with local officials, during her first visit... since leaving office." It doesn't mention discussing Warner Bros. policies. So answer should be N/A. But the user's question 11 says "due to disagreements over continuing awards coverage during the wildfire crisis" for question 4, but that's not here. Wait, no, question 11 is about the public figure. Let me check again. The article says Harris met with local officials but not specifically about Warner Bros.' policies. So the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "discuss Warner Bros.' wildfire response policies during their first post-office public appearance?" The article doesn't mention Warner Bros. in that context, so N/A. But maybe I missed something. Alternatively, the question might have a trick, but based on the text, it's N/A. Wait, the exact text: "Kamala Harris Tours Destruction: Former Vice President Kamala Harris toured fire damage in Pacific Palisades and met with local officials, during her first visit to the neighborhood since the devastating wildfires last month and one of her few public appearances since leaving office." No mention of discussing Warner Bros. So answer N/A. Wait, but the user's question 11 says "due to disagreements over continuing awards coverage during the wildfire crisis" – no, that was question 4. For question 11, the answer is Kamala Harris, but since the article doesn't specify discussing Warner Bros. policies, maybe it's N/A. Wait, the question says "to discuss Warner Bros.' wildfire response policies" – that detail isn't in the article. So the answer should be N/A. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the answer to be Kamala Harris because she toured there, but the question adds the part about discussing Warner Bros.' policies which isn't mentioned. Therefore, N/A. I'll go with N/A for question 11.
