Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article and follow the instructions strictly. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** Which director used an intimacy coordinator for all scenes except the final hotel encounter? The article mentions that Mikey Madison declined an intimacy coordinator for "Anora" and described some scenes as "sex shots." The final hotel encounter isn't specified here. Wait, the article says she declined to use an intimacy coordinator on set. So maybe the answer is N/A because the question is about a director who used one except for one scene, but the article says the lead actress (Mikey Madison) declined it. The director (Sean Baker) might have not used it, so the question's premise is incorrect. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many minutes of screen time for the pivotal sex scene between Romy and Samuel before focusing on Kidman's face? The article says "nearly the entire scene is foreplay until Reijn focuses on Kidman's face..." but doesn't specify minutes. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Bridal gown color Ellen wore. The article mentions "bridal gown" but no color. N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Character's backstory as a tennis instructor before the hotel scene. The hotel scene in "Challengers" involves Tashi, Art, Patrick. The article says Tashi's ex is Patrick, but their backstories? The article doesn't mention any of them being a tennis instructor before. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Temperature in Mexico City during Lee and Allerton's encounter. The article sets it in 1950 Mexico City but no temperature. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Takes required for Ivan's premature climax. The article mentions the scene's comedic timing but not the number of takes. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** European city for plague sequences in "Nosferatu." The classic Nosferatu is set in Wisborg, but the article's version by Eggers might be different. The article doesn't mention the filming location, only that Ellen's town has a plague. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Robotics brand Romy's company made. The article says she's CEO of a robotics company but no brand name. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Tennis tournament when Art met Patrick. The scene is during the U.S. Open as mentioned in the hotel room scene description. The U.S. Open is a tournament, so answer is U.S. Open.

10. **Question 10:** Hotel name where the trio met as teens. The article describes the hotel room during the U.S. Open but doesn't name it. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Director contrasting transactional sex brevity with athletic tension. The article mentions Luca Guadagnino's "Challengers" uses tennis as a strategic game, and his "Queer" has a sex scene. The article says "Challengers" saved erotic energy for tennis. So Guadagnino is the answer.

12. **Question 12:** Film with sacrificial intimacy leading to demise with flowers. "Nosferatu" ends with Ellen and Orlok dead surrounded by flowers. So answer is Nosferatu.

13. **Question 13:** Lead actress who talked about "sex shots" vs scenes. Mikey Madison in "Anora" discussed this with Variety and NYT. So her film is Anora, director Sean Baker, but the actress is Mikey Madison. The question asks for the film's name? Wait, the question says "lead actress of a film involving a sex worker" which is Anora. So the answer is Anora.

14. **Question 14:** Movie with CEO's submission complicated by subordinate's threat. Romy in "Babygirl" is a CEO with Samuel, who threatens to expose her. So Babygirl.

15. **Question 15:** Film with vampire's embrace during epidemic. "Nosferatu" has plague and Ellen's sacrifice. Answer is Nosferatu.

16. **Question 16:** Director with vomiting before sex showing obsession. "Queer" by Guadagnino has Lee and Allerton where Allerton vomits before the encounter. So Guadagnino.

17. **Question 17:** Film with three-way kiss as strategic game. The "Challengers" hotel scene with Tashi manipulating the boys. So Challengers.

18. **Question 18:** Movie where sex worker realizes lack of control due to a quick sex scene. "Anora" where Ani's encounter with Ivan is fast and transactional. So Anora.

19. **Question 19:** Character's climax with shame and empowerment in office romance. Romy in "Babygirl" has that facial expression. So Babygirl.
