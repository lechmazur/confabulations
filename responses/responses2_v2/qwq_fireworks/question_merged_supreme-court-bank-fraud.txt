Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **First question**: It's asking about Justice Sotomayor's toxic mushroom analogy and if she added artificial sweeteners, what type of statement the lawyer (Flynn) would say it is. The article mentions that Sotomayor asked about labeling toxic mushrooms as "a hundred percent natural," and Flynn didn't give a direct answer. But the question is hypothetical, adding artificial sweeteners. Wait, the article doesn't mention anything about artificial sweeteners in the mushroom example. Since the original question is hypothetical and the article doesn't elaborate beyond the "toxic mushrooms as natural" part, maybe the answer is N/A because the article doesn't provide Flynn's response to that specific scenario. Hmm.

Wait, but the question says "according to the lawyer arguing for the conviction of the nephew of Richard M. Daley," which is Flynn. Since the article states that Flynn didn't give a direct response to Sotomayor's mushroom question, there's no info on how she would address the addition of artificial sweeteners. So answer N/A here.

2. **Second question**: It refers to Justice Alito's possible action mirroring Thompson's, as per Kagan's humor. The article mentions that when Gair (Thompson's lawyer) used a hypothetical about his own website saying "40 years of litigation experience" and "Supreme Court advocate" in bold, Kagan said it was the "humblest answer" and "good show." But the question is about Alito's action post-arguments. Wait, the example given by Gair was about misleading but technically true statements. If Alito did something similar, maybe he would make a misleading statement like that? The question says "most closely mirror the actions of the former Chicago alderman (Thompson), according to Kagan's humorous assessment." Thompson was convicted for making false statements. But the example Gair used was about himself. Maybe the answer is N/A because the article doesn't mention Alito doing anything post-arguments. Or perhaps the question is a trick, expecting that the answer is the same as Gair's example, but the question is about Alito. Since the article doesn't say Alito did anything after, it's N/A.

Wait, the question says "after the conclusion of the arguments, would most closely mirror the actions of the former Chicago alderman..." The alderman (Thompson) made false statements. The example Gair gave was about a misleading statement. So maybe if Alito did something like that, but the article doesn't mention his actions post-argument. So N/A.

3. **Third question**: How many payments exceeding $300 each did Thompson make before the bank's collapse? The article says he made a single payment of $390 in 2012. The bank went under in 2017. The $390 is over $300, so that's one payment. So the answer is 1.

4. **Fourth question**: The stated profession of the person who used a hypothetical self-promotional statement. The article says Gair (Thompson's lawyer) gave the example of changing his website to say "40 years of litigation experience" and "Supreme Court advocate." So his profession is lawyer. The question asks for the stated profession of the individual (Gair), which is lawyer.

5. **Fifth question**: Original loan amount for settling debt with another bank. The third loan was $89,000 to repay a debt to another bank. So the answer is $89,000.

6. **Sixth question**: Duration of sentence served by the grandson (Thompson) in months. The article says he served four months in prison. So answer is 4.

Now, double-checking each question against the article.

1. The first question's scenario adds artificial sweeteners to the mushroom example. Since the article only mentions the natural mushrooms question and Flynn didn't answer directly, there's no info on the artificial sweetener part. So N/A.

2. The question is about Alito's action mirroring Thompson's actions. Since the article doesn't mention Alito doing anything post-argument, it's N/A.

3. Only one payment over $300 (the $390). Correct.

4. The person was Gair, a lawyer. Correct.

5. Third loan was $89k. Correct.

6. Four months. Correct.

So all answers should be filled, with the first two being N/A.
