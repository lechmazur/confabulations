Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not infer anything beyond what's written.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which East German publishing house contacted Kaspar about Birgit's manuscript. The article mentions that after Birgit's death, Kaspar received a postmortem query from a publisher. However, the name of the publishing house isn't specified. The text says "a publisher" but doesn't give a name, so this is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many years did Birgit work as a bookseller with Kaspar? The article states that Kaspar was a bookseller, but there's no mention of Birgit working alongside him for a specific number of years. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The name of the Communist Party officer who fathered her child isn't provided in the text. The article refers to him as "an older Communist Party officer" but doesn't give his name. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The month when Sigrun began challenging her beliefs isn't mentioned. The timeline is vague, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The medical condition contributing to her abandoning the child isn't stated. The text says she "kept secret" her reasons but doesn't specify a medical issue. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The specific museum exhibition in Berlin that changed Sigrun's views isn't named. The article mentions museums but no particular one, so N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The monetary amount offered isn't specified. The article says "payments from Birgit's estate" but doesn't give a figure. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The social worker facilitating the arrangement isn't mentioned. The text doesn't name any intermediary, so N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The music piece Sigrun mastered isn't listed. The article mentions piano lessons but no specific piece. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The Berlin neighborhood where Kaspar's bookshop was located isn't given. The text just says Berlin, so N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The historical document referenced isn't mentioned. The article talks about books given to challenge her worldview, but no specific document like a constitution or treaty is named. N/A.

12. **Question 12:** The solitary remnant left by Birgit that starts Kaspar's quest is her manuscript. The article states he received a query about her manuscript which he then read, leading him to find her daughter. So the answer is the manuscript.

13. **Question 13:** The hidden relationship Kaspar investigates is Birgit's affair with the Communist officer and her abandoned daughter. The primary focus is finding her daughter, so the hidden relationship is her daughter Svenja.

14. **Question 14:** The ideological label influencing familial discord is neo-Nazi, as Svenja's husband is part of that group. The text mentions "neo-Nazi husband," so that's the label.

15. **Question 15:** The act of omission by Birgit is her abandoning her daughter. The text says she kept it secret, so that's the catalyst.

16. **Question 16:** Kaspar's action to bridge the gap is taking Sigrun into his home, arranging visits, and offering payments. The specific action is arranging regular visits through payments.

17. **Question 17:** The monetary arrangement is payments from Birgit's estate for the visits. The article mentions "payments from Birgit's estate" so that's the answer.

18. **Question 18:** The personal disclosure in her account is her affair and abandonment of her daughter, leading to her inner conflict. The article says she wrote about her hopes to meet the daughter she abandoned.

19. **Question 19:** The artistic venue is the philharmonic. The text mentions they attend the philharmonic together.

20. **Question 20:** The hopeful future Kaspar envisions is a stable, cosmopolitan future for Sigrun, as stated in the conclusion of the article.

Alright, going through each question again to ensure I didn't miss any details. The key is to stick strictly to the text provided without adding any assumptions. Most of the answers are either explicitly stated or can be inferred directly. For those not mentioned, it's N/A.
