Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked without assuming anything beyond the text.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions Cardea's closest approach in October 2026 will be about 18.5 million miles away. But the question asks for light years. The article doesn't convert miles to light years, so I can't answer that. Answer: N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The panel included Bill Nye, Penn Badgley, and Celia Rose Gooding. The article doesn't specify which figure Penn advocated for. So, no info. Answer: N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Clayton's motivation was an extra credit assignment in an astronomy class. The question asks about researching Roman mythology before finding Cardea. The article says he participated as part of the assignment. So his original motivation was the extra credit. Answer: Extra credit assignment.

4. **Question 4**: The article states Earth had a handful of quasi-moons eligible for naming, besides Kamo'oalewa. But "handful" is vague. However, it mentions that only one had a non-alphanumeric name. But exact number? The text doesn't specify. Answer: N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The article says they weeded out duplicates, but no percentage is given. Answer: N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The University of Georgia's course submitted two finalists. No info on third-highest. Answer: N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The duration of public voting isn't mentioned. The process went from panel to public but no timeframe. Answer: N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The panel had astronomers, journalists, teachers, students, celebrities, but no number. Answer: N/A.

9. **Question 9**: LINEAR project in Socorro discovered 2004 GU9 in 2004. The article doesn't state when LINEAR was established. Answer: N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The article mentions submissions from 100+ countries and examples like Philippine, Estonian, Aztec. But which had the highest? No data. Answer: N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The article says Earth had a handful eligible besides Kamo'oalewa. "Handful" is vague. Answer: N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Clayton was a sophomore studying accounting and finance. He learned about Cardea in his astronomy class. The question asks what he was studying when he learned about her. Answer: Accounting and finance.

13. **Question 13**: The panel included Bill Nye, Penn Badgley, and Celia Rose Gooding. The question asks besides Bill Nye, which other celebrity? So either Penn or Celia. The article mentions Penn Badgley and Celia Rose Gooding. The question specifies "mentioned in connection with the LINEAR project"—LINEAR is mentioned in the discovery context, but the celebrities are part of the panel. So answer: Penn Badgley or Celia Rose Gooding. The article lists them both, but the question doesn't specify which one. Wait, the article says "including Bill Nye, Penn Badgley and Celia Rose Gooding." So either is correct, but the question asks "which other", so either is acceptable. But the answer should be one. Since the question says "the other celebrity nerd", but there are two. Hmm. The article lists three: Bill Nye, Penn Badgley, and Celia Rose Gooding. Since the question says "besides Bill Nye", the answer could be either. But the question is phrased as "which other celebrity nerd", so perhaps the first listed? But the article doesn't specify who helped narrow down. The question might have a trick here. Since the article doesn't specify who among them was involved in the narrowing, answer N/A? Wait, the question says "mentioned in connection with the LINEAR project". The LINEAR project is mentioned in the context of discovering 2004 GU9. The celebrities are part of the panel. The article doesn't link the celebrities to LINEAR, so maybe answer N/A. Alternatively, the question might be a trick. The LINEAR project is in Socorro, but the celebrities aren't connected to it. So answer N/A. Wait, the question says "mentioned in connection with the LINEAR project". The LINEAR project is part of the discovery, but the celebrities are part of the panel. The article doesn't link the celebrities to LINEAR. So maybe N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the fact that the quasi-moon was discovered by LINEAR, so the panel was involved in naming that object. But the question is about the celebrity's connection to LINEAR. Since the article doesn't say, answer N/A. Hmm, tricky. But the question might have a different angle. Wait, the LINEAR project is mentioned in the same sentence as the discovery of 2004 GU9, which is the object being named. The celebrities helped narrow down the names for that object. So the question is asking which celebrity, besides Bill Nye, was part of the panel that helped with that object. Since the panel included both Penn and Celia, but the question is about the one "mentioned in connection with the LINEAR project"—maybe not. So perhaps N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick. The article mentions "the quasi-moon discovered in New Mexico (LINEAR project)", so the celebrity is connected to that. Since the panel includes them, maybe the answer is either. But since the question is about "the other celebrity nerd mentioned in connection with the LINEAR project", perhaps N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Penn Badgley because he's listed first. But the article doesn't specify any connection to LINEAR for the celebrities. So safest is N/A. Wait, the question might be a trick. The LINEAR project is in Socorro, and the article says "the quasi-moon discovered in New Mexico by the LINEAR project", so the panel was selecting the name for that object. The celebrities helped with that. So the question is asking for another celebrity besides Bill Nye who helped. Since the panel had both, the answer could be either. But the question says "which other", implying one. The article lists them as "including Bill Nye, Penn Badgley and Celia Rose Gooding." So the answer is either Penn Badgley or Celia Rose Gooding. Since the question says "the other", but there are two, perhaps N/A. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is one of them. Since the question is in the article's context, perhaps the answer is Penn Badgley. Let me check the exact wording: "including Bill Nye, Penn Badgley and Celia Rose Gooding." So three people. The question asks besides Bill Nye, so the other two. Since the question asks for "which other celebrity nerd", maybe it's expecting one of them, so I'll pick the first one mentioned. So answer: Penn Badgley.

14. **Question 14**: The WNYC episode was about a quasi-moon near Venus (Zoozve) which was misidentified as a moon on a poster. The question asks what celestial body was misidentified on the poster. The answer is Zoozve. But the question says "sharing characteristics with Zoozve" — since Zoozve is a quasi-moon, the answer is a moon (since the poster showed it as a moon). The article says the poster showed a moon named Zoozve, but it's actually a quasi-moon. So the answer is a moon. But the question is phrased as "specific type of celestial body... that the WNYC audio program initially misidentified on a poster in an episode about a quasi-moon near Mars?" Wait, the episode was about a quasi-moon near Venus, not Mars. The question might have a typo? Let me check the article. The article says: "Radiolab featured an episode about a quasi-moon near Venus last year after Latif Nasser... found himself staring at an astronomy poster on his son's wall. On the poster, Venus had a moon, and the moon had a quirky name: 'Zoozve.' But after further research, Mr. Nasser... learned that the fleck on the poster designated a moon was not technically a moon..." So the misidentified body was a moon (the poster showed Venus having a moon named Zoozve, but it's actually a quasi-moon). The question says "near Mars" but the article says near Venus. Maybe a mistake in the question, but I have to answer based on the article. The article says the episode was about a quasi-moon near Venus. The question mentions Mars, which might be a trick. If the question is about the episode about Venus's quasi-moon, then the misidentified body is a moon. So the answer is moon. But the question says "near Mars"—since the article's episode was about Venus, maybe the answer is N/A. But the question might have an error. Since the article's episode was about Venus, but the question says Mars, then the answer is N/A. But the question might have a typo. However, I must follow strictly. Since the article says the episode was about a quasi-moon near Venus, and the question says Mars, then the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is correct, but the article doesn't mention Mars. So answer N/A. Wait, the question says "initially misidentified on a poster in an episode about a quasi-moon near Mars?" But the episode was about Venus. So the answer is N/A. Because the episode was about Venus's quasi-moon, not Mars's. So the question's premise is incorrect. Thus, answer N/A.

15. **Question 15**: Zoozve's real name was 2002-VE. The question asks what alphanumeric was assigned after the name was approved. Since Zoozve was given the name, the alphanumeric is still 2002-VE. So the answer is 2002-VE.

16. **Question 16**: The article mentions the 2026 approach. The question asks in what year will Cardea be at its furthest point. The article only mentions the closest approach in 2026, not the furthest. Answer: N/A.

17. **Question 17**: The Philippine folklore dragon is Bakunawa. The article mentions Bakunawa as a finalist alongside Tecciztecatl. Answer: Bakunawa.

18. **Question 18**: Latif Nasser, one of the hosts, was inspired by the poster on his son's wall. The article says he has a Ph.D. in the history of science from Harvard. His profession is host of Radiolab. Answer: Radiolab host (or host of the audio program). The question asks his profession. The article says "Latif Nasser, one of the hosts". So answer: Radiolab host.

19. **Question 19**: The collaboration was initiated after Nasser saw the poster leading to Zoozve's naming, then he pushed for Earth's quasi-moons. The specific event prompting the IAU and Radiolab's collaboration isn't stated. The article mentions the episode about Zoozve led to the contest. The question asks what astronomical event prompted the collaboration. The article doesn't mention an event like an eclipse or launch, just the episode. So answer N/A.

20. **Question 20**: The Estonian figure is Ehaema ("Mother Twilight"). The article mentions Ehaema alongside Tecciztecatl and others. Answer: Ehaema.
