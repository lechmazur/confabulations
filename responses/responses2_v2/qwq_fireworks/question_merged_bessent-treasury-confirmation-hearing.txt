merged_bessent-treasury-confirmation-hearing.txt
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not infer anything beyond that.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions that Bessent is "likely to be confirmed by the Senate," but there's no mention of an actual vote count. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The article says Hindenburg's reports "helped demolish billions of dollars in market value" but doesn't specify the amount for Carvana. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The text states Senator Warren called Bessent "smart and thoughtful." So the answer is Scott Bessent, but the question asks which CEO she praised. Wait, maybe I misread. The question says "prominent tech CEO." Wait, the article says Warren called Bessent "smart and thoughtful," but Bessent is a Treasury Secretary nominee, not a tech CEO. So maybe there's a mistake here. The answer would be N/A because the question is about a tech CEO, which Warren didn't mention. Hmm, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The article says Warren criticized Bessent but also called him "smart and thoughtful." But Bessent isn't a tech CEO, so the answer is N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The futures market is mentioned as pricing in "as many as two" rate cuts. The question asks for the interest rate announced. The article doesn't specify the exact rate number, just the number of cuts. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The article quotes Anderson saying he might "grow tomatoes" but it's hypothetical, not stating any actual count. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Democrats accuse Bessent of avoiding "more than $900,000 in payroll taxes." That's the figure given, so the answer is $900,000.

7. **Question 7**: The article mentions Jay Powell referencing a tradition of breakfast or lunch with the Treasury Secretary, but not specific items. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The rocket's second stage went into orbit, but the duration isn't mentioned. The article doesn't say how long it stayed there. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The article mentions selling pieces to satisfy a "qualified divestiture," but no percentage is given. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The song rights could fetch about $3 billion, per the text. So the answer is $3 billion.

11. **Question 11**: The $900,000 figure is from Democrats' claims, but the question asks which senator incorrectly attributed it to a different committee. The article doesn't mention any senator making an incorrect attribution. The info is from Democrats, but not specifying a wrong committee. So N/A.

12. **Question 12**: The tax cuts extension would add to the debt and inflation, which might make the Fed stop rate cuts. The Fed's recent actions (cutting rates) conflict with policies that could force them to hold. The answer is that extending tax cuts would add to debt/inflation, making the Fed slow down rate cuts. The article says "adding other breaks would cost trillions... scare global bond markets... inflation would probably persuade the Fed to slow down on cutting rates." So the direct conflict is the Fed slowing rate cuts due to inflation from tax cuts. The answer should be "slowing down rate cuts" or similar. The question asks how the extension conflicts with Fed actions. The answer is "force the Fed to slow down cutting rates."

13. **Question 13**: The Southwest lawsuit seeks over $2.1 million, and the John Deere case doesn't mention a specific amount. So total can't be calculated. N/A.

14. **Question 14**: The article says bond markets might check the agenda because tariffs could raise inflation, leading the Fed to pause rate cuts. The mechanism is inflation causing the Fed to hold, thus affecting policies. The answer is "inflation forcing the Fed to slow rate cuts."

15. **Question 15**: TikTok's CEO Shou Chew is attending the inauguration, linked to the Supreme Court ruling. The answer is Shou Chew.

16. **Question 16**: The article mentions both events but doesn't connect their timing. So N/A.

17. **Question 17**: The tradition is having breakfast/lunch with the Fed chair, as mentioned by Jay Powell. The answer is "regularly having breakfast or lunch with the central bank's chair."

18. **Question 18**: TikTok's CEO is at the inauguration, but internally told employees they'd keep jobs if they lose. This contradicts the public stance of shutting down. The answer is "public appearance vs internal reassurance."
