Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions that Jeff Baena was inspired by "A Clockwork Orange" and then watched "8½" by Fellini. So the answer is "8½".

2. **Question 2**: The article talks about "I Heart Huckabees" having existential detectives. The exact name isn't given, so "N/A".

3. **Question 3**: The question links a film to his medieval studies minor. "The Little Hours" involves nuns, which might tie to medieval themes. The article says it's tied to his minor, so that's the answer.

4. **Question 4**: The article mentions "Horse Girl" was co-written with Alison Brie, but doesn't specify her character's condition. So "N/A".

5. **Question 5**: Where was "The Little Hours" filmed? The article doesn't mention filming locations, so "N/A".

6. **Question 6**: Unfinished project with Wahlberg as a sequel? The article doesn't mention this, so "N/A".

7. **Question 7**: Kubrick film influencing "Life After Beth" besides "A Clockwork Orange"? The article only mentions "A Clockwork Orange" and "8½", so "N/A".

8. **Question 8**: Snake species in "Life After Beth"? The article says a snake bite killed Plaza's character but doesn't name the species. So "N/A".

9. **Question 9**: Post-2020 project on grief and divorce. "Horse Girl" (2020) is mentioned, but the article says his divorce influenced humor. The answer might be "Horse Girl".

10. **Question 10**: Official cause speculated before suicide? The article states the medical examiner confirmed suicide, but doesn't mention prior speculation. So "N/A".

11. **Question 11**: The film is "I Heart Huckabees", which matches the description given.

12. **Question 12**: The movie with a snake bite and reanimation is "Life After Beth".

13. **Question 13**: "Spin Me Round" (2022) is directed by Baena, co-written with Alison Brie, and features his wife Aubrey Plaza.

14. **Question 14**: The director who inspired him was Stanley Kubrick, due to "A Clockwork Orange".

15. **Question 15**: He graduated from New York University.

16. **Question 16**: Same as question 11, so "I Heart Huckabees".

17. **Question 17**: The cause was suicide, as stated by the medical examiner.

18. **Question 18**: "The Little Hours" deals with improper religious figures (nuns) and dark comedy, not environmental themes.

19. **Question 19**: "Spin Me Round" fits here as it's directed by him, co-written with Brie, and features Plaza.

20. **Question 20**: The core element from his reflections is "divorce" influencing his humor.
