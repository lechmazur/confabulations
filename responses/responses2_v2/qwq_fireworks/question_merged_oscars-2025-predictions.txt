Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions "The Substance" with Demi Moore's Golden Globe win and Fargeat as the director. BAFTA recognition for the score is mentioned in the "Challengers" section, but the question asks about the horror comedy film. Since "The Substance" is the horror comedy and Fargeat is its director, she's the answer. So answer is Fargeat.

2. **Question 2:** The article states three documentaries (Union, No Other Land, The Bibi Files) had no U.S. distributor. It doesn't say any got distribution deals after, so answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The article doesn't mention box office revenue for A24's films. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The L.A. Film Critics gave Marianne Jean-Baptiste top honors. Michele Austin won supporting, so maybe runner-up? But the question is about the L.A. Critics' runner-up to Marianne's win. The article says Michele won supporting, so maybe the question's answer is Michele Austin's role. But the exact phrasing needs checking. The article says "supporting trophy to Michele Austin" so the main winner was Marianne, and Michele was supporting, so the runner-up for lead would be N/A? Wait, the question says "runner-up to Marianne's winning role." Since Michele was in supporting, not lead, so the answer might be N/A. Wait, the L.A. Critics gave Marianne their top honor. The question is what performance was ranked runner-up by them? The article doesn't mention a runner-up, only that Michele won supporting. So maybe N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The article mentions the academy added more international members but doesn't give a percentage. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The article doesn't mention when Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross started composing. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The article doesn't give screen time minutes for Bardem's scene. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The article says "A Different Man" got a Golden Globe for best actor in a comedy (Sebastian Stan), but there's no info on the margin against the runner-up. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The three documentaries had no U.S. distributor, but the article doesn't mention which platform acquired them. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The article doesn't mention previous collaborations between Michele and Marianne. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The director highlighted as a potential surprise due to academy diversification is Fargeat, from the horror genre. So Fargeat.

12. **Question 12:** The article says the BAFTA omitted "Challengers" score because it was too cutting-edge for traditional voters. Answer: being too cutting-edge.

13. **Question 13:** The article mentions Sebastian Stan's Golden Globe for "A Different Man" might draw attention to his earlier work. So answer is Sebastian Stan.
