Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly as per the instructions. Let me start with the first question.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about a mechanism suggested by the AnitaB.org president as an alternative to the D.E.I. acronym, similar to Meta's restructuring. Looking at the article, there's a mention of Bo Young Lee, former Uber executive now at AnitaB.org, who talks about policies like paid parental leave being safe. Wait, the article says she mentioned that paid parental leave is a diversity policy now deeply embedded and safe. But the question is about an alternative to the D.E.I. acronym. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Let me check again. The article says Glasgow considered dropping the term D.E.I., but the president of AnitaB.org (Bo Young Lee) was talking about maintaining optimism and mentioned paid parental leave as an example. Wait, the question is about a shift similar to Meta's restructuring. Meta ended its D.E.I. work, so maybe the alternative is using different terms or programs. But the answer might be "paid parental leave" as a policy that's safe. Wait, the question is about the acronym's alternative. The article says Glasgow suggested dropping the D.E.I. term. But the question specifies the AnitaB.org president. Let me re-read the relevant part: "Bo Young Lee... said the backlash has been against a very narrow band of activities... She views paid parental leave, for example, as a diversity policy that is now deeply embedded in corporate culture and safe from attack." So maybe the answer is "paid parental leave" as an alternative. But the question says "mechanism" and "reflecting a shift similar to Meta's restructuring". Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A because the AnitaB.org president didn't suggest an acronym replacement but a policy. Hmm, tricky. Let me hold that thought.

2. **Question 2**: The question is about the percentage increase in D.E.I. job postings after the 2023 Supreme Court decision, mirroring the post-George Floyd trend. The article mentions that after George Floyd's death in 2020, D.E.I. job postings rose 54%. Then, after the 2023 decision, there was a wave of lawsuits. But does it say the percentage? The article says "a 54 percent rise in job postings for D.E.I. roles in 2020... compared with levels before the pandemic." The question is about the 2023 Supreme Court decision's effect. The article states "in 2023, a Supreme Court decision struck down race-conscious preferences in college admissions and was followed by a wave of lawsuits against company diversity efforts." But no percentage is given for the job postings post-2023. So this would be N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Which Fortune 500 company revoked the 1965 executive order? The article says President Trump revoked the 1965 executive order (Executive Order 11246 from 1965). The question asks which company did this, but it's the President, not a company. The Fortune 500 companies mentioned as revoking their own programs are Meta, Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley Davidson, Amazon, etc. But the revocation of the 1965 order was done by Trump. The question is incorrect in asking for a company. So answer N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The specific type of training Amazon scaled back and endorsed by the Apple HR chief. The article says Amazon scaled back diversity programming, including "winding down outdated programs and materials." The Apple HR chief, Denise Young, said diversity is good for business. The question asks what training she endorsed. The article mentions "unconscious bias training" as legally safe. Since the question says "similar to the programs Amazon scaled back," and Amazon scaled back some diversity programs, but the safe ones are unconscious bias training. So the answer is "unconscious bias training".

5. **Question 5**: Former Uber exec now at AnitaB.org who criticized Walmart's data sharing. The article mentions Bo Young Lee (from Uber now at AnitaB.org) said Walmart stopped sharing data with HRC. The question is who criticized that. The article says she "views" that as part of the backlash. So Bo Young Lee.

6. **Question 6**: Initiative launched by the Meltzer Center in response to the executive order. The article says the Meltzer Center's director, David Glasgow, mentioned the fear caused by the order. But the article doesn't mention a specific initiative they launched. The question might be N/A unless I missed it. The article talks about Glasgow's opinion but no specific initiative. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Vice president at Amazon who announced continuation of diversity goals. The article says Amazon scaled back diversity programs, with a VP named Candi Castleberry writing a memo to wind down programs. The question is about someone announcing continuation, but the article says Amazon scaled back. So this is N/A because the memo was about winding down, not continuing.

8. **Question 8**: Law firm's managing partner who cited the 1965 order's revocation. The article mentions Ishan Bhabha of Jenner & Block, who said clients are worried. The revocation of the 1965 order was part of Trump's actions. The question is whether he cited the revocation as a concern. The article says "revoked an executive order signed in 1965" and Bhabha's clients are worried. So answer is "Jenner & Block".

9. **Question 9**: Legal challenge anticipated by Ishan Bhabha against companies sharing data with HRC. The article says Bhabha expects legal challenges to the executive order or its actions. The question is about a challenge against sharing data with HRC. The article says companies like Walmart stopped sharing with HRC, and Yoshino said it's not legally risky but companies did it to avoid backlash. The legal challenge isn't mentioned specifically for that, so N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Nonprofit Walmart stopped sharing data with. The article says Walmart stopped sharing with Human Rights Campaign (HRC). So answer "Human Rights Campaign".

11. **Question 11**: The single integer for investigations per agency. The article says "each federal agency... identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations." So the number is "9".

12. **Question 12**: The 1965 executive order revoked by Trump. The article says Trump revoked the 1965 executive order (EO 11246). The name is "Executive Order 11246", but the question asks for the name. Wait, the article says "executive order signed in 1965 that prohibited discriminatory hiring and employment practices for private government contractors." The name is EO 11246, but the question might want the title. The article doesn't give the title, just mentions it's from 1965. The answer is "Executive Order 11246" but the article only says "executive order signed in 1965". Since the question asks for the name, maybe just the year is not enough. Alternatively, the article might not state the name beyond that, so answer N/A? Wait, the user instruction says to use only the article. Since the article refers to it as "an executive order signed in 1965", the name is not provided beyond that. So answer N/A. Wait, but the question says "which historical executive order... originally enacted in 1965". The article says "executive order signed in 1965 that prohibited discriminatory hiring... for private government contractors." So the answer is that executive order, but the name isn't given. The user might expect the EO number, but since it's not in the text, the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is answered by the fact that it's called "Executive Order 11246" but the article doesn't state the number. Hmm. Let me check the article again. The article says "executive order signed in 1965 that prohibited discriminatory hiring..." but doesn't name it. So the answer is N/A.

Wait, the 1965 EO is likely Executive Order 11246, but since the article doesn't say that, I can't answer. So N/A.

13. **Question 13**: Company that eliminated chief diversity officer and diversity goals. The article says Meta "ended its D.E.I. work, including eliminating the chief diversity officer role and dropping diversity hiring goals". So answer "Meta".

14. **Question 14**: Constitutional lawyer criticizing the number of investigations (nine) as inducing fear. The article mentions Kenji Yoshino said "That discrete number is a way of striking fear...". So answer "Kenji Yoshino".

15. **Question 15**: Workplace policy considered safe and embedded. The article says Bo Young Lee mentions "paid parental leave" as safe. So answer "paid parental leave".

16. **Question 16**: Executive leader at law school center (Meltzer Center) expressing concern about D.E.I. acronym. The article says David Glasgow (director of Meltzer Center) considered dropping the D.E.I. term. So answer "David Glasgow".

17. **Question 17**: Who's early actions triggered retreats at Meta/Amazon? President Trump's administrative actions, so "Donald Trump".

18. **Question 18**: Data policy change considered legally unnecessary. The article says companies stopped sharing data with HRC, and Yoshino said it's not legally risky. So the action is "withholding data from the Human Rights Campaign".

19. **Question 19**: The system accused of undermining values. The executive order's text condemns "an unlawful, corrosive, and pernicious identity-based spoils system". So answer "identity-based spoils system".

Now, let me verify each answer again to ensure accuracy based on the article text.

1. AnitaB.org's Bo Young Lee suggested paid parental leave as safe, not an acronym replacement. The question is about an alternative to the acronym. The article mentions Glasgow considering dropping D.E.I., but the question specifies AnitaB.org's president. Since she didn't suggest an acronym replacement, maybe it's N/A. Wait, the question says "mechanism... reflecting a shift similar to Meta's restructuring". Meta ended D.E.I. programs, so maybe the answer is "paid parental leave" as an alternative policy. But the question is about the acronym's alternative. Since the article says Glasgow thought the acronym is problematic, but the AnitaB.org leader didn't mention that. So perhaps the answer is N/A. Hmm, conflicting. Let me check again. The question is about the AnitaB.org president's suggestion for an alternative to D.E.I. acronym. The article states that Bo Young Lee (AnitaB.org) said the backlash is against narrow activities but policies like paid parental leave are safe. But the question is about replacing the acronym. Since she didn't suggest an acronym, maybe N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "N/A".

Wait, the first question says "mechanism... reflecting a shift similar to Meta's restructuring". Meta's restructuring involved ending D.E.I. programs. The AnitaB.org president's suggestion might be to use different terms or focus on policies like parental leave. But the question asks for the mechanism. Since the article doesn't mention a specific mechanism from her except safe policies, perhaps N/A. Hmm, this is a tough one. The article says Glasgow is considering dropping the term, but the AnitaB.org person didn't suggest an acronym replacement. So answer N/A.

2. Percentage after 2023 decision: No data given. N/A.

3. The company that revoked 1965 EO is Trump, not a company. So N/A.

4. Unconscious bias training is safe and Amazon scaled back some programs. The Apple HR chief endorsed that. Answer is "unconscious bias training".

5. Bo Young Lee.

6. Meltzer Center's initiative: Not mentioned. N/A.

7. Amazon's VP wrote about winding down, so continuation is N/A.

8. Jenner & Block.

9. Legal challenge against HRC data sharing? The article says Yoshino said it's not legally risky, but Bhabha mentions possible challenges to the EO or its actions. The question is about a specific legal challenge against data sharing. The article doesn't mention such a challenge. So N/A.

10. Human Rights Campaign.

11. 9.

12. The name of the 1965 EO isn't given. N/A.

13. Meta.

14. Kenji Yoshino.

15. Paid parental leave.

16. David Glasgow.

17. Donald Trump.

18. Withdrawing data from HRC.

19. Identity-based spoils system.
