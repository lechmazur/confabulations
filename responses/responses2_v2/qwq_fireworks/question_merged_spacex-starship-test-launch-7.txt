Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to make sure I only use the article provided. Let's start with question 1: "What was the total number of dummy Starlink satellites successfully ejected by the PEZ dispenser system during the seventh test flight before communications were lost?" The article mentions that the dummy satellites were supposed to be shot out, but since communications were lost, maybe they didn't get deployed. The text says "it would have shot out 10 dummy satellites". The word "would have" suggests they didn't actually do it. So the answer is N/A because they didn't successfully eject them.

Question 2 asks about the metallurgical composition of the heat shield contributing to disintegration. The article mentions the upper stage had a new heat shield with smaller flaps, but doesn't specify the material composition. So N/A.

Question 3: The exact duration between leak detection and loss of comms. Musk's analysis mentioned a leak, but the article doesn't give a time frame. So N/A.

Question 4: Shift4 executive besides Isaacman on the first crewed flight. The article only mentions Jared Isaacman from Shift4. No other name given, so N/A.

Question 5: Which segment failed despite other milestones? The upper stage (Starship) had the malfunction while the booster was caught. The answer is Starship upper stage.

Question 6: The mechanical arms successfully caught the booster again. The article says the booster was caught by the arms again, so that's the key achievement.

Question 7: Minutes after liftoff when comms were lost. The article states "about 8.5 minutes after launch", so 8.5 minutes. But the question asks for minutes, so 8.5 is acceptable. Wait, the format might need it in seconds? No, the question says minutes. So 8.5.

Question 8: Musk's analysis attributes the failure to an oxygen and fuel leak, so that's the answer.

Question 9: Liftoff time was 5:37 p.m. Eastern time. The question asks for local Eastern time, so that's the exact time.

Question 10: The intended splashdown was in the Indian Ocean. The article mentions the upper stage was to splash down there, so Indian Ocean.

Question 11: The upper stage is made of stainless steel. The article says "stainless steel with large fins".

Question 12: The engines are Raptor engines. The Super Heavy has 33 Raptor engines, so Raptor.

Question 13: The Federal Aviation Administration (F.A.A.) controlled air traffic near debris.

Question 14: Jared Isaacman was picked as NASA administrator, so his name here.
