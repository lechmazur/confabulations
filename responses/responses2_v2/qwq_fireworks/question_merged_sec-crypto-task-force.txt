Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **First question**: The SEC's crypto unit was created in 2017 during the first Trump administration. The question asks how many enforcement actions it brought before Gary Gensler expanded it. The article mentions that under Gensler, the unit expanded, and in May 2022, they nearly doubled to 50. But before that expansion, when was the unit's previous size? Wait, the article says the unit was created in 2017 and "greatly expanded during Mr. Gensler's tenure." It also states that in May 2022, they nearly doubled to 50. But the article doesn't mention the number of enforcement actions before Gensler's expansion. Wait, the article says that the unit had brought more than 80 enforcement actions related to crypto by May 2022 when they expanded. But that might include actions during Gensler's time. Wait, the exact sentence is: "The unit had brought more than 80 enforcement actions 'related to fraudulent and unregistered crypto asset offerings and platforms,' the S.E.C. said at the time. A recent tally shows it brought more than 100 crypto-related actions during the Biden administration." The "at the time" refers to May 2022. So before that expansion (May 2022), they had 80 actions. But the question is about during the first Trump administration, before Gensler expanded it. Wait, the first Trump administration was 2017-2021. Gensler was chair under Biden. So the article says the unit was created in 2017 during the first Trump administration. The expansion under Gensler (who was chair under Biden) happened later. So the question is asking how many actions were brought during the first Trump admin (before Gensler expanded it). The article says that the unit had brought over 80 by May 2022, but that might include actions during Gensler's time. The article also says "during the Biden administration" had over 100. Wait, the exact quote: "The unit had brought more than 80 enforcement actions... the S.E.C. said at the time [May 2022]. A recent tally shows it brought more than 100 crypto-related actions during the Biden administration." So the 80 was up to May 2022 (which is during Biden's term), so the 80 includes some under Biden. The question is about before Gensler expanded it, which was during his tenure. Wait, when was Gensler's tenure? The article says he left the SEC when Trump was inaugurated, so he was there under Biden. The expansion to 50 in May 2022 was during Biden's term. So before Gensler expanded it (i.e., before the expansion in 2022), but the unit was created in 2017 under first Trump. The article doesn't state the number of actions before the expansion. The article only mentions that after expanding to 50 in 2022, they had 80 actions. But before that expansion (so before May 2022), the unit was smaller, but the number of actions before that isn't given. So the answer might be N/A because the article doesn't specify the number during the first Trump admin before Gensler's expansion. Wait, the article says "the unit greatly expanded during Mr. Gensler's tenure." But Gensler was under Biden, so maybe the expansion under Gensler was the 2022 doubling. So before that, the unit had a smaller size, but how many actions? The article doesn't give that number. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

2. **Second question**: The percentage increase when initially formed vs after May 2022. The unit was created in 2017. The article says in May 2022, they nearly doubled to 50. So initial size before expansion? The article says "nearly doubling the team's size to 50," so the previous size was about 25 (since doubling to 50 would be from 25). The question is asking the percentage increase when it was initially formed compared to after expansion. Wait, the question is phrased as "how many enforcement actions did it bring during the first Trump administration, before Gary Gensler significantly expanded it?" Wait, the second question is about staffing percentage increase when formed compared to after May 2022. Wait, the question says: "the percentage increase in staffing did the crypto unit experience when it was initially formed, compared to its size after the May 2022 expansion?" Wait, that wording is confusing. Wait, "initially formed" would be when it was created in 2017. The question is comparing the initial size (when formed) to the size after May 2022 (which was 50). But the article doesn't state the original size when it was formed in 2017. The article says in May 2022 they nearly doubled to 50. So the original size before expansion (in 2022) was about 25. But the initial formation in 2017's size isn't mentioned. The article says the unit was created in 2017, but doesn't say how big it was then. Therefore, the percentage can't be calculated because we don't know the original size. So answer N/A.

3. **Third question**: Brian Armstrong's stance is against law firms hiring SEC officials involved in the crypto crackdown. The question asks which SEC official, mentioned as having joined MIT, faces difficulty. The article mentions Gary Gensler left the SEC the day Trump was inaugurated and joined MIT. So the answer is Gary Gensler, because Coinbase's CEO (Armstrong) said they won't work with firms that hire SEC officials involved in the crackdown, and Gensler was a key figure in that crackdown. So the official is Gensler.

4. **Fourth question**: Hester Peirce's task force's new framework might reduce what legal challenge exemplified by a case against a company whose CEO retaliates against law firms. The case against Coinbase is mentioned, which is about operating as an unregistered exchange. If the framework changes the regulatory approach, the legal challenge related to whether digital assets are securities (as Gensler argued) would be less frequent. The case against Coinbase is central to that issue, so the specific legal challenge is the classification of digital assets as securities contracts. The answer would be "violation of federal securities laws by operating as an unregistered exchange" or similar. The question asks for the specific legal challenge, so the answer is "violating federal securities laws by operating as an unregistered exchange".

5. **Fifth question**: Gary Gensler joined MIT after leaving SEC. Tyler Winklevoss's statement about Gemini not hiring MIT graduates. So the academic program at MIT affected would be the one Gensler was part of. The article says he had taught at MIT before Biden tapped him, so perhaps his former position's program. The article doesn't specify the program, but since he was in finance regulation, maybe a finance or business program. But the article says he joined the faculty, so the answer might be "the faculty" but the question asks for a specific program. Alternatively, since Gemini is not hiring MIT graduates, the program is unspecified. Wait, the question says "the institution Gensler rejoined" (MIT) and the academic program. The article doesn't state the specific program, so maybe "N/A". Wait, the article says "Gary Gensler, who had taught before Biden tapped him", so perhaps the academic program is the one related to finance or regulation. But since it's not specified, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, if the question is about the program that Gensler is part of, but the article doesn't name it, so N/A.

6. **Sixth question**: The position paper by Hester Peirce that criticizes the SEC's approach, which saw over $130M in election spending. The article mentions a position paper by Peirce on the SEC site, criticizing past approach. The election spending is mentioned as part of the crypto industry's spending over $130M. The position paper's title is needed. The article says "position paper published Tuesday on the S.E.C. website, Ms. Peirce took issue with the commission's past approach..." but the title isn't given. So answer N/A.

7. **Seventh question**: The Congressional committee for the confirmation hearing of the nominee to replace Gensler. The nominee is Paul Atkins, and the committee is the Senate Banking Committee. The article says "Senate Banking Committee has yet to schedule a date for his confirmation hearing." So the answer is "Senate Banking Committee".

8. **Eighth question**: The legal violation central to the 2023 case against the company whose CEO (Armstrong of Coinbase) is retaliating. The case is about Coinbase violating federal securities laws by operating as an unregistered exchange. Under new leadership, this might be redefined. The answer is "operating as an unregistered exchange" or "violation of federal securities laws by operating as an unregistered exchange".

9. **Ninth question**: The new approach would reduce a practice criticized by Corey Frayer (former Gensler advisor) as removing "speed limits and guardrails". The practice might be strict enforcement actions or oversight. The article says Frayer criticized the new approach as removing regulations, so the practice to be reduced is strict enforcement of securities laws on crypto, leading to fewer enforcement actions. The question asks for the previously common practice now being reduced, which is "enforcement actions against crypto platforms for unregistered securities".

10. **Tenth question**: The former senior advisor is Corey Frayer, who criticized the new leadership, and his former boss is Gensler, who is restricted by Gemini. The answer is Corey Frayer.
