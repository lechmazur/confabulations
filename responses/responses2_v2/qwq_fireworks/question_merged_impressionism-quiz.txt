Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly based on the text and avoid any external knowledge.

1. **Question 1**: Which Impressionist artist painted their spouse more than 40 times, including a deathbed portrait in 1879?  
   The article mentions Monet painted his first wife Camille at least 30 times, including on her deathbed in 1879. Since 30 is less than 40, but maybe another artist? Wait, the question says "more than 40". Hmm, the article doesn't mention anyone else with over 40. Maybe it's a trick? Wait, maybe the question is wrong. The answer would be N/A because the article only states Monet did 30 times. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Clothing shop operated by Guillemets in "In the Conservatory".  
   The article says "Manet's friends, the Guillemets, who ran a clothing shop in Paris." So the name of the shop isn't given. The question asks for the name of the shop, but the text doesn't provide it. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Years between Manet's still life (1866) and Monet's (1872).  
   Manet's was 1866, Monet's 1872. 1872 - 1866 = 6 years. So answer 6.

4. **Question 4**: Artist who declined Societe Anonyme despite Salon rejections.  
   The article says "Manet declined to show his work alongside Monet and the other Impressionists at their renegade Societe Anonyme." So answer Manet.

5. **Question 5**: Profession of Manet's wife before marriage (from "Madame Manet at the Piano").  
   The article states "Manet's wife and former piano teacher, Suzanne." So former piano teacher.

6. **Question 6**: Paris neighborhood for Caillebotte's "Paris Street; Rainy Day".  
   The article lists "Paris Street; Rainy Day" as one of the options under the location question. The options were The Seine, Tuileries Garden, Place de Dublin, The Pont Neuf. But the correct answer is listed as "Paris Street; Rainy Day" by Caillebotte. However, the question asks the neighborhood. The article's location options don't mention a specific neighborhood. Wait, the text says "Drag the painting to the location. The Seine Tuileries Garden Place de Dublin The Pont Neuf Ici c'est Paris! ... 'Paris Street; Rainy Day', 1877 by Caillebotte". The location options are those four, but "Paris Street" is the title. The article's exact text under that section says "Ici c'est Paris!" which translates to "Here is Paris!" implying it's a Parisian street, but the exact neighborhood isn't given. The options listed don't include a neighborhood name. The question might be expecting "Paris" but the options given in the article's text don't specify a neighborhood. Since the article doesn't state the neighborhood, answer N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Jeanne Demarsy's relation to Manet before "Jeanne (Spring)".  
   The article says "Jeanne (Spring)" depicts Jeanne Demarsy, who posed for Manet in the studio. So she posed for Manet before, so answer "posed for Manet".

8. **Question 8**: Months to complete "Luncheon of the Boating Party".  
   The article doesn't mention the time taken to paint it. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Museum with Monet's "Impression, Sunrise".  
   The image credits list "Impression, Sunrise" as via Getty Images from Fine Art Images/Heritage, but the article doesn't state the museum. The image credit mentions "Fine Art Images/Heritage Images, via Getty Images" but that's a photo source, not the museum. The article doesn't specify the museum holding it. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Cause of Camille's father's death referenced in "Camille Monet on a Garden Bench".  
    The article says "the year her father died". The cause isn't mentioned. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Painting that defined early Impressionism by Monet, not rainy, year of radiance.  
    The article says "Impression, Sunrise" (1872) gave the movement its name. The question mentions "radiance rather than drizzle" so that's "Impression, Sunrise". Answer that.

12. **Question 12**: Still life with melon, peaches, grapes, by Manet, but linked to renegade Salon.  
    Manet's still life is 1866, Monet's 1872. The question says the creator is erroneously linked to renegade Salon (but Manet declined to join them). So the correct artwork is Manet's "Still Life with Melon and Peaches".

13. **Question 13**: Subject in a garden bench during familial loss.  
    The article mentions "Camille Monet on a Garden Bench" in 1873 when her father died, perhaps receiving a condolence. The other was "Reading" by Morisot. The question asks for the one showing domestic sorrow. So Camille Monet.

14. **Question 14**: Haystack with midday light.  
    The haystacks: "Haystacks, Midday, 1890" so that's the midday one. The other options are morning, evening, sunset. Answer "Haystacks, Midday".

15. **Question 15**: Degas' work with rhythmic body movement (dance class).  
    "The Dance Class" by Degas is mentioned. The question says "rhythmic body movement class", so that's it.

16. **Question 16**: Cafe scene depicting absinthe drinker.  
    The article mentions "In a Cafe (The Absinthe Drinker)" by Degas. So that's the answer.

17. **Question 17**: Reciprocal portraits from year on boat and sitter image.  
    The article has "Monet in his Boat" 1874 by Manet, and "Manet" 1874 by Monet. The reciprocal portraits. The question asks for a painting that represents a renowned painter captured by a contemporary. So "Manet" by Monet or "Monet in his Boat" by Manet. The question says "renowned painter captured as a subject by his contemporary". The options given in the article's drag section are "Monet by Manet" or "Manet by Monet". The answer is "Manet" by Monet (since the question says "his contemporary"—Monet painted Manet).

18. **Question 18**: Painting of Monet's first wife from later time.  
    The article says "Meditation. Madame Monet on the Sofa" c.1871 and deathbed in 1879. The question asks for a later, more reflective time. The deathbed is later, but maybe "Camille Monet on a Garden Bench" (1873) is later than 1871. Or "Meditation" is earlier. The question says "originating from a later, more reflective time"—deathbed is 1879, so "Meditation" is 1871, so deathbed is later. But the question is about a painting that mistakenly is linked to Salon refusals. Since Manet declined, but Monet's works were in the renegade. The answer might be "Meditation" but the question is a bit confusing. Wait, the question says "acknowledged as originating from a later, more reflective time"—the deathbed is later, so "Madame Monet on the Sofa" is c.1871, deathbed is 1879. The article says "on her deathbed in 1879", so that's the later one. So "Meditation" is before, but the deathbed painting isn't named. The article mentions "Meditation. Madame Monet on the Sofa" c. 1871 and "Camille Monet on a Garden Bench" 1873. The deathbed is a different painting not named here. The question might refer to "Camille Monet on a Garden Bench" as later than 1871. Alternatively, perhaps "Meditation" is the answer. Wait the question is about "a later, more reflective time"—deathbed is more reflective, but the article doesn't name that painting. The article says "on her deathbed in 1879"—so the painting's name isn't given except "Camille with a Small Dog" 1866. Wait, the deathbed painting isn't listed except in the text as "on her deathbed in 1879" but the name isn't given. The question might be referring to "Camille with a Small Dog" but that's 1866. Hmm. Maybe the answer is "Camille Monet on a Garden Bench" as a later work. Alternatively, the question might be pointing to "Meditation" as a later time but that's 1871. The question is confusing. Alternatively, maybe "Camille with a Small Dog" is the only one named, but that's before. The question says "mistakenly attribute the sentiment linked to Salon refusals"—maybe the deathbed painting is the answer, but since it's not named, maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "Monet painted Camille, his first wife, at least 30 times, including in 'Meditation. Madame Monet on the Sofa,' c. 1871 and on her deathbed in 1879." So the deathbed painting isn't named, so the question's answer must be "Camille Monet on a Garden Bench" (1873) as later than 1871 but before deathbed. Alternatively, perhaps "Camille with a Small Dog" is too early. The question says "later, more reflective time"—maybe the deathbed is intended, but since the name isn't given, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the options in the questions might have the correct title. The article mentions "Camille with a Small Dog" 1866, which is earlier. The "Meditation" is 1871. The garden bench is 1873. The deathbed is 1879 but not named. The question says "acknowledged as originating from a later, more reflective time"—so the deathbed painting, but since it's not named, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the question might be pointing to "Camille with a Small Dog" but that's not later. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to "Meditation" as a later work? Not sure. Hmm. Maybe the answer is "Meditation. Madame Monet on the Sofa" but that's not later than deathbed. Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong. Since I can't find the exact name, maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "originating from a later, more reflective time"—the deathbed is later, but the article doesn't name that painting. So answer N/A?

Wait, the article mentions "Camille Monet on a Garden Bench" (1873) and "Meditation" (1871). The deathbed is mentioned but not named. So the answer might be "Camille Monet on a Garden Bench" as later than 1871, but the question wants a painting that's mistakenly linked to Salon refusals. Since Manet declined, perhaps the answer is "Meditation" but that's Monet's work, which was part of the renegade. Hmm, perhaps the answer is "Camille Monet on a Garden Bench".

Alternatively, the question might be referring to "Meditation" as a later time, but no. Maybe I should go with "Camille Monet on a Garden Bench".

19. **Question 19**: Renoir's floral work with one type of bloom.  
    The options are Chrysanthemum, Lilac, Peony, Rose. The question says if someone thinks it's mixed, which one is actually one type. The article lists "Chrysanthemums", "Bouquet of Lilacs", "Bouquet of Roses", "Peonies"—each is a single type. So any of these would be correct. The question asks to identify which artwork is characterized by one type. The answer should be one of them. The question says the scholar mistakes it for a mix, so the correct is one that's singular. The article says "Bouquet of Roses" is c.1882, etc. The answer is any of the four, but the question asks to pick the one that's solely one type. Since all are single types, but the question probably refers to one. The question might be referring to "Bouquet of Roses" or another. Wait, the question is phrased as "which artwork must be identified that is characterized solely by one type of delicate bloom?" The answer would be any of the four, but the question expects one. The options in the article's drag section: "Chrysanthemums", "Bouquet of Lilacs", "Bouquet of Roses", "Peonies". The answer is one of those. Since the question is hypothetical, perhaps the correct answer is "Bouquet of Roses" but I need to check the text. The article says each is a single type, so any is correct, but the question expects one. Wait the question says "mistakes one work for displaying a mixture of various blossoms rather than a singular focus"—so the correct one is any of the four, but the question must have a specific answer. The article's exact text for Renoir's specimens: "Drag Renoir's specimens to the species. Chrysanthemum Lilac Peony Rose" followed by the works. So the answer must be one of those four, but which? The question is to pick one that's actually single. Since all are, but the question requires the answer, perhaps the answer is "Chrysanthemums" or another. Wait the question says "depicting marital figures within the circle of revolutionary painters"—no, maybe I need to pick one. Since the question is hypothetical, perhaps the answer is "Bouquet of Roses" but I can't tell. Wait the question is part of the article's drag section, so the correct answer is one of the four. Since the question says "which artwork must be identified that is characterized solely by one type of delicate bloom?" any of them would fit, but the question probably refers to one. Let me check the text again. The article says "Renoir's specimens to the species. Chrysanthemum Lilac Peony Rose" then lists "Chrysanthemums", "Bouquet of Lilacs", "Bouquet of Roses", "Peonies". So each is a single type. The question is hypothetical, so perhaps the answer is "Bouquet of Roses" or any. Since the user expects one answer, maybe the first one listed, but not sure. Alternatively, the answer is "Bouquet of Roses" but I'm not certain. Wait, perhaps the question refers to "Peonies" as the correct one. Hmm. Since I have to choose, maybe "Bouquet of Roses".

20. **Question 20**: Painting with small dog created before cafe/absinthe culture.  
    The article mentions "Camille with a Small Dog" 1866. The cafe/absinthe works are later (Absinthe Drinker is 1875-76). So 1866 is before. Answer "Camille with a Small Dog".
