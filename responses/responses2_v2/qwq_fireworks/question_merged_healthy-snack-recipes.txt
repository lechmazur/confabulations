Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then cross-checking the article for the answers.

1. **Question 1:** The Flaming Hot Cheese Dust is used on popcorn. The question asks about using it on pecans. The article mentions that Kwame Onwuachi's House Spice pairs well with pecans, but the Flaming Hot Cheese Dust isn't mentioned for pecans. The article says "you can sprinkle either of these toppings on any nuts you'd like." So the Flaming Hot Cheese Dust can be used on pecans. The yield for Flaming Hot Cheese Dust is about 2/3 cup. But the question is about the House Spice? Wait, no. Wait, the user is asking for the Flaming Hot Cheese Dust's ingredient for pecans, but the answer might be N/A because the question mentions "House Spice." Wait, the question says "adequately season a batch of pecans, assuming the pecans are prepared similarly to the popcorn." The Flaming Hot Cheese Dust's preparation requires coating with butter or oil first. The amount of House Spice isn't involved here. Wait, the question is about the Flaming Hot Cheese Dust's preparation for pecans. The yield for Flaming Hot Cheese Dust is 2/3 cup. The question is about the volume of House Spice needed? Wait, the user might have a typo. Wait, the question says "what volume of House Spice would be needed..." but the Flaming Hot Cheese Dust doesn't use House Spice. The Plantain Spice uses House Spice. So maybe the answer is N/A? Hmm. Wait, the user's question might be confusing. Let me check again. The question is about the Flaming Hot Cheese Dust's preparation for pecans, but the House Spice is another recipe. The answer might be N/A because the Flaming Hot Cheese Dust doesn't require House Spice. Alternatively, maybe the user confused the recipes? Since the question mentions "assuming the pecans are prepared similarly to the popcorn," and Flaming Hot Cheese Dust is for popcorn, then using it on pecans would still use the same seasoning. But the question asks about House Spice, which isn't in that recipe. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Jancee's favorite is cheese-flavored chips. The article says to add salt, sweetness, fat, and spice to whole foods. Cheese-flavored chips have salt and maybe fat. The crucial ingredient besides cheese would be salt? Or maybe the spice blend includes salt. The article mentions "adding the salt, sweetness, fat and spice." Since cheese is already salty, maybe another key is spice? Wait, the chips might have a spicy element. The Flaming Hot Cheese Dust includes chili flakes. So maybe chili flakes? Wait, but the question says besides cheese. The article says "the recipes are forgiving and worth a try." The key to mimic cheese flavor might be salt. But the question is about a single ingredient besides cheese. The article says "salt, sweetness, fat, and spice." Since cheese is part of the blend, the other key could be salt. Alternatively, maybe the spice blend's components. Wait, the Flaming Hot Cheese Dust has chili flakes, but the question is about cheese-flavored chips, which are salty. So salt is crucial. But the answer might be salt. Let me check the article again. "add the salt, sweetness, fat and spice that can make more healthful foods pop." So to mimic the chips, which are salty and maybe with some spice, the key ingredient besides cheese would be salt. So answer: salt? Or maybe the spice blend's components. Wait, the question is asking for the most crucial besides cheese. The article mentions "salt, sweetness, fat, and spice," so perhaps salt. Alternatively, maybe the chili flakes if the chips have a spicy kick. The article's example for cheese chips are the Flaming Hot Cheese Dust which uses chili flakes. So maybe chili flakes. Hmm. The article says "any chili flakes you have on hand" in Flaming Hot Cheese Dust. But the question is about the key besides cheese. So maybe salt? Or the combination, but the answer should be a single ingredient. The question says "most crucial to include in her spice blend." Since cheese is part of the blend, the other key would be salt. Alternatively, maybe the fat (butter) is needed, but the question says besides cheese. The article's Flaming Hot Cheese Dust includes Parmesan, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cayenne, chili flakes, salt, and melted butter. The key besides cheese (Parmesan) would be the cayenne or chili flakes? Or the salt. Since the chips are salty, salt is crucial. Maybe the answer is salt. Alternatively, the article mentions that the spice blends add salt, sweetness, etc. Since cheese is salty, maybe another component. Hmm. Maybe the answer is salt. Let me go with salt.

3. **Question 3:** The sweetest spice blend with popcorn. The Easy Snack-y Spice Blend has sugar (4 tbsp), while Plantain Spice has confectioners' sugar (6 tbsp). The yield for Easy is 2/3 cup, Plantain is 1 1/2 cups. Since the question is about sweetness (sugar content), the Plantain Spice has more sugar (6 tbsp vs 4 tbsp). So the total yield is 1.5 cups. Answer: 1.5 or 1 Â½ cups?

4. **Question 4:** The survey says 95% have at least one snack, "most of us eat two or more." The question is about at least three snacks. The article doesn't specify the percentage for three snacks. So answer N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Kwame Onwuachi's House Spice for sweet snacks like Coconut Granola Bars. The House Spice has cayenne and paprika, which are spicy. For a sweet snack, he'd omit the cayenne or the spice. The answer is cayenne pepper. Because coconut bars are sweet, so removing the heat.

6. **Question 6:** Primary flavor note of Plantain Spice that distinguishes it from others. The Plantain Spice includes Caribbean curry powder, which is a unique ingredient. So curry powder.

7. **Question 7:** Substitute sugar in Easy Snack-y Spice Blend with a whole food. The article mentions using whole foods, so maybe honey or fruit? The answer would be something like honey, but the article doesn't specify. Wait, the article says "minimally processed foods like walnuts, fruit or carrot sticks" but the substitution isn't mentioned. The question asks what Ashley would recommend. Since the article doesn't say, maybe N/A? Wait, the challenge is about using whole foods. Maybe the substitution is dates or another natural sweetener. But since it's not in the article, maybe N/A. Alternatively, the article says "healthier whole foods" so maybe using honey? But the answer isn't directly stated. Hmm. The answer might be N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Additional step for House Spice on walnuts. The Flaming Hot Cheese Dust requires coating with butter or oil. The House Spice recipe doesn't mention that, but to adhere, maybe oil is needed. So the answer is coating with melted butter or oil spray.

9. **Question 9:** Common ingredient in three sweet snacks. The NYT Cooking recipes include Coconut Granola Bars, Strawberry and Sesame Swirl Soft Serve, Vegan Banana Bread, Yogurt Parfaits, Apple Compote. Looking for a common ingredient. Yogurt is in Yogurt Parfaits. Coconut in Granola bars. Maybe yogurt isn't in others. Alternatively, maybe sugar? The Plantain Spice has confectioners' sugar, but the NYT recipes might use sugar. The Coconut Granola Bars probably have oats and coconut. The Vegan Banana Bread has bananas. The Soft Serve has sesame and strawberry. The Yogurt Parfaits have yogurt. The common one might be yogurt? Or maybe none. Wait, the question is about the NYT Cooking recipes. The recipes listed are Coconut Granola Bars (coconut), Strawberry and Sesame Soft Serve (sesame?), Vegan Banana Bread (banana), Yogurt Parfaits (yogurt), Apple Compote (apple). The common ingredient might not be present. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "N/A". Wait, maybe "sweetness" via sugar? But the question asks for an ingredient. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "sugar" but not sure. Alternatively, maybe the common ingredient is "yogurt" in the Parfaits and maybe another? The article says "check out these easy sweet-snack recipes... Yogurt Parfaits..." so maybe yogurt is in one, but others? Maybe N/A. Hmm. Alternatively, the article mentions "sugar" in the Easy Snack-y Spice Blend, but the NYT recipes might use it. The question is about three of the sweet snacks. Let me think again. The listed NYT recipes are Coconut Granola Bars (has coconut), Strawberry and Sesame Swirl (sesame?), Vegan Banana Bread (banana), Yogurt Parfaits (yogurt), Apple Compote (apple). The common ingredient might be "sweetness" via sugar but that's not an ingredient. Alternatively, maybe "nuts" but not sure. Maybe the answer is N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Number of savory blends with Korean chili flakes as optional. The Easy Snack-y Spice has Korean chili flakes as optional ("or any chili flakes"). The Flaming Hot Cheese Dust uses Korean chili flakes but not as optional. The House Spice uses cayenne and paprika, not Korean chili. The Plantain Spice uses Caribbean curry. So only the Easy Snack-y Spice lists Korean chili as optional. So answer is 1.

11. **Question 11:** Warming component in both a sweet-savory and cheese dust. The Plantain Spice might be sweet-savory. The Flaming Hot Cheese Dust has paprika and chili. The Easy Snack-y has coriander, turmeric, etc. The warming component could be paprika, which is in both House Spice (paprika) and Flaming Hot Cheese Dust (paprika). Wait, House Spice has Hungarian paprika, and Flaming Hot has paprika. So paprika is in both. The sweet-savory could be Plantain Spice which has curry. Alternatively, the "sweet-savory" might refer to the Plantain Spice (which is used on plantains?), but the question says "sweet-savory dust" and "cheese dust". The cheese dust (Flaming Hot) has paprika, and the House Spice has paprika. So paprika is the common warming component.

12. **Question 12:** Ingredient to bind seasoning to popcorn, like fat in processed snacks. The Flaming Hot Cheese Dust uses melted butter or oil spray to help the seasoning stick. So the answer is melted butter or olive oil spray.

13. **Question 13:** Sucrose-based ingredient in a blend with spice and sweetness. The Plantain Spice has confectioners' sugar (which is sucrose). The Easy Snack-y uses sugar. The question says "sucrose-based" so either. The blend that combines sweetness and spice: maybe the Plantain Spice (has sugar and spice), or the Easy Snack-y. The question says "sucrose-based ingredient to mimic abrupt flavor". The answer is confectioners' sugar or sugar. The question specifies "in the blend that combines elements of sweetness and spice", which could be Plantain Spice (sweet with spice) or the Easy Snack-y. The Plantain Spice has confectioners' sugar. The answer would be confectioners' sugar.

14. **Question 14:** Fiery spice in House Spice and another blend. House Spice has cayenne. The Flaming Hot Cheese Dust has cayenne and chili flakes. The Plantain Spice uses cayenne? Let me check. House Spice has cayenne pepper (2.5 tbsp). The Plantain Spice has House Spice (6 tbsp), so it includes cayenne. So cayenne is in both House Spice and Plantain Spice, hence consistent heat.

15. **Question 15:** Seasoning agent used across both savory and spicy-sweet to fortify flavor. The article mentions adding salt, sweetness, fat, and spice. Salt is in many blends. Looking at the recipes, salt is in all spice blends. So salt is the common one.

16. **Question 16:** Dry seasoning to elevate umami in a dust for veggies/dips. The Flaming Hot Cheese Dust has Parmesan, which is umami. The Plantain Spice has curry, which can have umami. The House Spice has Worcestershire powder (umami). The Flaming Hot's Parmesan provides umami. The question says "dry seasoning included specifically to elevate umami". The House Spice's Worcestershire powder is for umami. So Worcestershire powder.

17. **Question 17:** Adjusting salt for granola bars using savory dust. The savory blends have high salt (House Spice has 5 tbsp salt). The granola bars are sweet, so adding savory dust would require reducing salt. So the adjustment is reducing salt.

18. **Question 18:** Nutrient for prolonged satiety. The article says "fiber, water and protein" contribute to sated longer. The answer is fiber, protein, or water. The question asks for the macronutrient. Protein and fiber (fiber is a carb). The answer would be protein or fiber. The article says "minimally processed foods generally include things that make you feel sated for longer, like fiber, water and protein". Since the question asks for the macronutrient, protein is a macronutrient. Fiber is a type of carbohydrate. So answer: protein.

19. **Question 19:** Culinary function of dust blends to parallel ultraprocessed snacks. The article says they add salt, sweetness, fat, and spice to make whole foods "pop" and be as craveable. The function is to enhance flavor to make them as appealing as processed snacks. The answer is to enhance flavor or make them craveable. The exact wording in the article: "mimic the crave-worthy qualities of ultraprocessed foods, adding the salt, sweetness, fat and spice that can make more healthful foods pop." So the function is to add craveable qualities.

20. **Question 20:** Chef from NYC restaurant who pioneered a spice mix. Kwame Onwuachi is from NYC (Tatiana), and his House Spice is mentioned. The question says "indirectly credited with pioneering a spice mix that bridges traditional and modern techniques." Answer: Kwame Onwuachi.
