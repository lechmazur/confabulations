Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and answer each exactly as per the instructions.

1. **How many days did the Supreme Court give ByteDance to prepare their closing written arguments after setting the abbreviated schedule last month?**
   - The article says the briefs were filed on an "exceptionally abbreviated schedule set last month by the justices." But it doesn't specify the number of days. Hmm, maybe the question is about the time between the schedule being set and the arguments? Wait, the first paragraph mentions the briefs were filed a week before oral arguments. But the question is about the time given to prepare after the schedule was set. The article doesn't give the exact days, so maybe N/A?

2. **Which Constitutional Amendment did President-elect Trump cite in his argument...**
   - The brief mentions the First Amendment. Trump's brief says "save a social-media platform that provides a popular vehicle for 170 million Americans to exercise their core First Amendment rights." So the answer is the First Amendment.

3. **What percentage of TikTok's American users did the government claim were potentially exposed to Chinese propaganda...**
   - The article doesn't state any specific percentage related to propaganda exposure. The 170 million is user count, but the government's argument is about control, not a percentage exposed. So N/A.

4. **Who was the legal representative that argued for maintaining Soviet-owned radio stations during the Cold War precedent case cited in TikTok's defense?**
   - The government's brief compared it to Soviet ownership of American radio stations. The question is who argued that. The article doesn't mention a specific legal representative for that historical case, so N/A.

5. **What conditions did ByteDance need to meet according to the certification requirement for the 90-day extension provision?**
   - The law requires the president to certify "significant progress toward a sale backed by 'relevant binding legal agreements.'" So that's the condition.

6. **Which federal agency's report did Elizabeth B. Prelogar reference...**
   - The article doesn't mention any specific agency report she cited. She just argued that disclosure is ineffective. So N/A.

7. **What was the total number of student organizations at West Point that were terminated...**
   - The DEI section says "ending a dozen student clubs." Dozen is 12.

8. **When did ByteDance first acknowledge removing content from TikTok at the request of Chinese officials according to the government's brief?**
   - The government's brief says ByteDance didn't "squarely deny" censorship but denied removing content at China's request. The article doesn't mention when they first acknowledged it, so N/A.

9. **How many critical mineral resources did Trudeau identify...**
   - The article states "wealth of critical minerals" but doesn't specify a number. So N/A.

10. **What was the maximum capacity of the migrant detention facility...**
    - The article says "tent city to house as many as 30,000 migrants." So 30,000.

11. **How long before the scheduled oral arguments were these documents submitted?**
    - The first paragraph says "filed a week before oral arguments." So one week.

12. **What certification to Congress is required for the president to extend the deadline...**
    - The law requires the president to certify to Congress "significant progress toward a sale backed by relevant binding legal agreements."

13. **Which Cold War-era propaganda tool is referenced...**
    - The users' brief mentions Pravda, the Soviet newspaper.

14. **Which brief is blamed for interfering with the president’s ability...**
    - The law's timing is what Trump's brief says interferes. The question is which brief blamed? The article says the law's timing, not a specific brief. Wait, the question might refer to the law itself. The brief from Trump is the one that mentions the interference. The answer is Trump's brief.

15. **What single deadline, linked to a change in government, is given...**
    - The deadline is Jan. 19, the day before Trump's inauguration.

16. **What is the case number...**
    - The article states "TikTok v. Garland, No. 24-656."

17. **Which leader’s capacity...**
    - The question refers to the law's timing interfering with the president's ability. The article says "President Trump's ability to manage the United States' foreign policy." So Trump.

18. **Enforcing the law without disclosures would deprive how many Americans of a key right?**
    - The users' brief says 170 million Americans use TikTok. The key right is First Amendment, so the number is 170 million.

19. **What term do both TikTok and users reject...**
    - The term is "censorship," as TikTok's brief says "censorship is a loaded term" and they deny removing content at China's request.

20. **Which historical comparison does the government use...**
    - The government compared it to Soviet ownership of American radio stations during the Cold War.
