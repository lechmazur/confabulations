Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the given article.

1. **Jordan Fisher's previous role**: The article mentions Jordan Fisher as Bobby Strong and notes he was "fresh from a stint as Orpheus in 'Hadestown'". So the answer is Hadestown.

2. **Original Broadway orchestra size**: The article states the Encores! revival's orchestra was "slightly bigger than the Broadway one (nine players as opposed to five)". Wait, so Broadway had 5? Wait, the Encores! orchestra is bigger than Broadway's. The article says "nine players as opposed to five" for Broadway. So original Broadway had 5. So the answer is 5.

3. **Running time of 1999 Fringe Festival production**: The article mentions the running time for the current Encores! revival is 2 hours 30 minutes. But it doesn't specify the original Off-Broadway run's runtime. So N/A.

4. **Original Little Sally actor**: The article says Pearl Scarlett Gold is playing Little Sally now, and notes that the original Sally was Spencer Kayden, who was 33 when the show opened. So the original was Spencer Kayden. So answer Spencer Kayden.

5. **Total box office revenue**: The article doesn't mention box office numbers. So N/A.

6. **Keala Settle's understudy role**: The article doesn't mention who she understudied for. It just describes her role as Penelope. So N/A.

7. **Hollmann and Kotis's follow-up musical**: The article says "Hollmann and Kotis never had another Broadway show", so no follow-up. Answer N/A.

8. **Number of Off-Broadway performances in 2001**: The article says it had an Off-Broadway run in spring 2001 but doesn't specify the number of performances. So N/A.

9. **Ticket price for Amenity No. 9**: The article doesn't mention specific prices. It talks about the corporation charging for pee, but no exact price given. N/A.

10. **Critic who panned then praised**: The article mentions the author (Elisabeth Vincentelli) didn't like it initially but now does. It says "I confess to not liking 'Urinetown' when I saw it way back when". But the question asks for a theater critic. Since the author is the critic here, maybe her name? The article is by her, so the answer would be Elisabeth Vincentelli. But the question specifies "theater critic" and the article's byline says "By Elisabeth Vincentelli", so yes. Answer Elisabeth Vincentelli.

11. **Added musicians in Encores! vs original Broadway**: The Encores! orchestra has nine vs Broadway's five. So 4 more. Answer 4.

12. **Award Keala Settle won**: The article mentions Penelope Pennywise in the original Broadway but doesn't mention any awards. It says she's in the revival now. So N/A.

13. **Theater name before shutdown due to title complaints**: The article says the show premiered at the International New York Fringe Festival, then Off-Broadway. But it doesn't mention the theater name being changed or shut down due to title complaints. The article mentions the Off-Broadway run but not the theater's name. So N/A.
