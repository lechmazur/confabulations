Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and answer each question based strictly on the information given. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: Did Kamala Harris's visit include an announcement of a new grant initiative through the Hearthland Foundation? The article mentions Kamala Harris touring the area but doesn't say anything about her announcing a grant or the Hearthland Foundation being involved in her visit. The Hearthland Foundation is mentioned as a contributor (Spielberg's and Capshaw's), but there's no link to Harris's visit. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Which LA-based museum in the Mohn Art Collective is administering applications? The Mohn Art Collective includes LACMA, the Hammer, and MOCA. The article says the fund is administered by the Center for Cultural Innovation, and applications are through them or the Getty. So none of the Mohn Art Collective museums are directly administering it. Answer N/A.

3. **Question 3**: How many GoFundMe campaigns are explicitly mentioned? The text says "grass-roots way through GoFundMe pages" but doesn't specify the number. So answer N/A.

4. **Question 4**: International gallery not in the US contributing with Gagosian and Hauser & Wirth? Both Gagosian and Hauser & Wirth are international, but the question asks for another one. The article mentions only those two galleries. Since both are based outside the US (Gagosian has locations worldwide, Hauser & Wirth too), but the question specifies "not headquartered in the US". Since the article doesn't mention another, answer N/A. Wait, the question says "alongside Gagosian and Hauser & Wirth"—so maybe they are the only ones mentioned. So answer N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Mellon Foundation's contribution target Hammer Museum's residency? The Mellon Foundation is mentioned, but their contribution isn't specified to target any particular group. Elizabeth Alexander's quote talks about L.A.'s multiculturalism but doesn't mention Hammer's residency. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Institution described by Michael Govan as a precedent? The quote from Govan says L.A. is pulling together quickly, "no precedent for that." He's talking about the collaborative spirit, but the question asks which institution pioneered it. The answer might be LACMA since he's the director there, but the text doesn't name an institution as the pioneer. The Mohn Art Collective is part of the contributors, but the question is about Michael Govan's statement. Hmm, the answer might be N/A, but wait, the Mohn Art Collective is part of the contributors. Wait, the article says "the Mohn Art Collective, which comprises LACMA, the Hammer and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles." The collaborative effort is the collective? The question is which institution Michael Govan called a precedent. The quote says "we were hearing from our people... we needed to help." Wait, the quote from Govan is: "This collaborative spirit was instantly activated... I don't know that there is a precedent for that." So he's referring to L.A. pulling together, not a specific institution. So the answer is N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Percentage of the $12M allocated by Getty for housing? The article states the Getty led the fund but doesn't specify percentages or allocations. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Who is the arts leader quoted about preserving LA's arts scene and is chief of the fund leader? Katherine E. Fleming is the CEO of the Getty Trust, which leads the fund. Her quote is about not wanting artists to leave. So answer Katherine E. Fleming.

9. **Question 9**: Which president from a NY-based foundation warned effects might be just the beginning? The Mellon Foundation's president is Elizabeth Alexander. She said "we still don't know the full measure... Stage 1." The question refers to a president (of a foundation), so Elizabeth Alexander. But the question says "president referred to in connection with a New York-based foundation"—Mellon is based in NY. So answer Elizabeth Alexander. But the question asks "which president"—so the answer is Elizabeth Alexander.

10. **Question 10**: Former high-ranking official mentioned in connection with Pacific Palisades tour? Kamala Harris is the former VP who toured there. So answer Kamala Harris.

11. **Question 11**: Primary catastrophic event linked to both the fund and Harris's visit? The California wildfires. The fund is for wildfire relief, and Harris's visit was about the fire damage. Answer California wildfires.

12. **Question 12**: LA museum in the Mohn Art Collective noted for using online tools? The Mohn Art Collective includes LACMA, Hammer, MOCA. The article mentions grassroots efforts using GoFundMe, donation centers, Google Docs. The collaborative part might be the Mohn Art Collective contributing, but the online tools part is part of the general efforts. The question asks which museum in the collective is noted for using online tools. The article says "applications will be accepted... through the center or the Getty." The Mohn Art Collective isn't mentioned directly for online tools. So N/A.

13. **Question 13**: Family-associated foundation linked to a filmmaker? The filmmaker George Lucas's Hobson/Lucas Family Foundation is mentioned. So answer Hobson/Lucas Family Foundation.

14. **Question 14**: Banking institution with directional name? East West Bank is mentioned. "Directional cues" like East and West. So answer East West Bank.

15. **Question 15**: Gallery with a famous surname? Gagosian is a surname (Larry Gagosian). Hauser & Wirth might not be a surname. The question specifies a gallery with a famous surname. Gagosian is correct. Answer Gagosian.

16. **Question 16**: Initiative's label contrasted with insurance call? The article mentions "The Agony of the List" as the emotional toll of listing objects, and the insurance regulator wants to avoid itemization. So the label is "The Agony of the List".

17. **Question 17**: Foundation linked to Spielberg and Capshaw? The Hearthland Foundation (Spielberg and Kate Capshaw). So answer Hearthland Foundation.
