Okay, I need to answer these 20 questions based solely on the provided article. Let me go through each question one by one and check the article for the answers.

1. Which talent agency dropped Blake Lively after the Times article was published, leading to significant career repercussions?  
The article says "William Morris Endeavor dropped Mr. Baldoni as a client." Wait, the question is about Blake Lively, but the article mentions the agency dropped Baldoni. So the answer might be N/A because the question is about Lively, but the text says Baldoni was dropped. So answer N/A.

2. How many millions in damages did Blake Lively seek in her federal court lawsuit against Baldoni and his team?  
The article states Baldoni's lawsuit seeks $250 million. Lively's federal lawsuit is mentioned, but the amount isn't specified. The California complaint had that $250M, but the question is about her federal suit. The text doesn't mention the federal lawsuit's damages. So N/A.

3. What was the name of the communications consultant who documented the successful social media narrative shift in text messages to Nathan's employee?  
The article says: "one of Ms. Nathan's employees wrote in a group text message..." Wait, no, the example given is an employee of Nathan's wrote that. The consultant is Jed Wallace, as per "Mr. Wallace, a self-described 'hired gun,' leading a digital strategy..." So the consultant is Jed Wallace.

4. On what date did Stephanie Jones return the company phone containing the subpoenaed messages to Jennifer Abel?  
The article says the phone was returned when she was fired, but no date is given. So N/A.

5. Who was the first cast member to publicly denounce Baldoni's behavior after the Times article was published?  
The article lists Colleen Hoover, Jenny Slate, Brandon Sklenar, and Alex Saks as supporters of Lively. But it doesn't specify who was first. So N/A.

6. What safeguards did Wayfarer Studios implement on set after Lively's initial complaints about physical boundaries?  
The article says "the studio also agreed not to retaliate against the actress" in a side letter. The safeguards are mentioned as being installed, but specifics? The text says "install safeguards on set" but doesn't list them. So N/A unless "agreed not to retaliate" is part of that. Wait, the safeguards are separate from the side letter. The exact wording: "their studio, Wayfarer, agreed to install safeguards on set, her legal complaint said. In a side letter... agreed not to retaliate." So the safeguards on set are the first part, but the article doesn't detail what they were. So answer N/A.

7. How many pages of text messages were specifically cited in the Times article as evidence of the smear campaign?  
The article mentions "thousands of pages of text messages and emails obtained through a subpoena, which were reviewed by The Times." But the exact number cited in the article isn't given. The question asks how many were specifically cited, but the article says "excerpts from thousands of pages," so no exact number. N/A.

8. What role did Steve Sarowitz play in coordinating the crisis management response to Lively's allegations?  
The article lists him as a co-founder of Wayfarer, but doesn't mention his role in the crisis management. So N/A.

9. Which social media platform did Jed Wallace primarily use to execute his digital strategy against Lively?  
The article says "boosting social media posts" but doesn't specify the platform. N/A.

10. What was the duration of the investigation conducted by Megan Twohey and Mike McIntire before publishing their article?  
No timeframe given. N/A.

11. What was the total amount of damages sought in the federal lawsuit filed by Blake Lively against Justin Baldoni and others, given that her California complaint referenced a $250 million claim?  
The article says Baldoni's lawsuit (his own) seeks $250 million. Lively's federal lawsuit is mentioned but the amount isn't stated. The California complaint (her initial) had the $250M, but the federal suit's amount isn't in the text. So N/A.

12. Which co-host of the "Man Enough" podcast remains affiliated with the show following Liz Plank's departure, according to the article's description of professional repercussions for Baldoni?  
The article says Liz Plank announced she would no longer appear. The podcast is hosted by Baldoni and Heath. The article doesn't mention others co-hosting besides them. Since Plank left, the remaining would be Baldoni and Heath. But the question asks who "remains" besides her? The article doesn't name others, so maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "co-hosted the 'Man Enough' podcast with Mr. Baldoni and Mr. Heath," so Plank was a co-host. After her departure, the remaining co-hosts would be Baldoni and Heath, but the question asks "who was the first cast member..." maybe not. The question is phrased as "which co-host... remains", so perhaps Baldoni and Heath, but the answer isn't in the text. Since the article doesn't mention another co-host remaining, maybe N/A.

13. Which individual signed the side letter to Blake Lively's contract guaranteeing no retaliation, as explicitly stated in the California Civil Rights Department complaint?  
The article says "a side letter to Ms. Lively's contract, signed by Mr. Heath". So Jamey Heath.

14. What specific reason did Stephanie Jones provide in her lawsuit for being terminated from her role as a publicist for Wayfarer and Baldoni?  
The article says her lawsuit alleges breach of contract and other claims but doesn't specify the reason for termination. So N/A.

15. How many months prior to the film's August 2024 release did Melissa Nathan allegedly begin orchestrating the social media campaign against Blake Lively, according to the text messages cited in the Times article?  
The article states "as the release of the film approached in August 2024, fearful that her allegations would become public..." but doesn't mention when Nathan started. So N/A.

16. Which public relations executive mentioned in the article was directly responsible for implementing the digital strategy involving boosted social media posts targeting Blake Lively?  
The article mentions Jed Wallace leading the digital strategy, so he's the one. The answer is Jed Wallace.

17. What legal jurisdiction was specified in Blake Lively's federal lawsuit against Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios, given that her initial complaint was filed with the California Civil Rights Department?  
The lawsuit was filed in "federal court in the Southern District of New York".

18. Which cast member of "It Ends With Us" publicly criticized Justin Baldoni's conduct during filming before the Times article was published?  
The article mentions Colleen Hoover (author), Jenny Slate, Brandon Sklenar, and Alex Saks supported Lively after the article. It doesn't say who did so before. So N/A.

19. What explicit contractual obligation did Melissa Nathan violate, according to Blake Lively's legal complaint, when she allegedly manipulated news coverage?  
The article doesn't mention specific contractual terms violated by Nathan. The complaint says she was part of the smear campaign but not which contract clause. N/A.

20. What financial penalty did William Morris Endeavor impose on Justin Baldoni after dropping him as a client, as implied by the article's discussion of professional consequences?  
The article only says they dropped him as a client. No mention of a financial penalty. So N/A.
