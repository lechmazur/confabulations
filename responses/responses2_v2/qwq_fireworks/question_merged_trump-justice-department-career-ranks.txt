Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer strictly based on that. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **First question**: How many days did it take for the Trump administration to complete the transfer of all Senior Executive Service members to the sanctuary cities task force? The article mentions that transfers happened in the first eight days, but it doesn't specify the exact number of days to complete all transfers. It also says "at least four" section chiefs were moved, but not all. So the answer is N/A because the exact days aren't given.

2. **Second question**: The official retired in 2024? Wait, the article says Andrew Mergen retired in 2023. The question says 2024, which contradicts the text. Since the year is wrong, the answer is N/A.

3. **Third question**: Bradley Weinsheimer's reason for accepting reassignment. The article states he was told he'd be reassigned, but his resignation letter isn't quoted here. The text mentions he might face reassignment but doesn't give his reason for accepting. So N/A.

4. **Fourth question**: How many environmental division section chiefs remained? The article says "at least four" were moved, which is nearly half the total. If four were moved and that's half, total would be 8, so 4 remained. But the exact total isn't stated. The article says "nearly half", so maybe 4 out of 8, but since it's approximate, the answer might be N/A because exact numbers aren't given.

5. **Fifth question**: Percentage of probationary employees terminated. The article says the list was submitted but it's unclear what officials plan to do. So the percentage isn't mentioned. N/A.

6. **Sixth question**: Who replaced Corey Amundson? The article says he resigned and doesn't mention a replacement. So N/A.

7. **Seventh question**: Total number transferred from civil rights, national security, and criminal divisions. It says "at least two" from civil rights, "at least two" from national security, and one from criminal (public corruption leader). Adding those gives at least 5, but the exact number isn't specified. Since it's "at least", the exact total isn't given. So N/A.

8. **Eighth question**: Which court ordered the division to file? The article mentions that some were required by court order to issue filings like procedural updates. But it doesn't name a specific court. So N/A.

9. **Ninth question**: Average service length of fired immigration officials. The text doesn't mention their tenure, only that they were fired. N/A.

10. **Tenth question**: Number of honor program offers rescinded from environmental law graduates. The article says job offers to the honors program were rescinded, but not specifying environmental graduates. So N/A.

Wait, let me check again for question 4. The article says "four of the environment division's section chiefs -- nearly half its total -- were reassigned". So if four are nearly half, total is around 8, so 4 remained. But the exact number isn't stated. The question asks how many remained. Since it's approximate, maybe the answer is 4? But the article says "nearly half", which could mean exactly half or close. If exactly half, then 4 remained. But the article uses "nearly", so maybe it's not exact. Since the text doesn't state the exact number, the answer is N/A.

Alright, that's all. Let me make sure each question is addressed with N/A where applicable.
