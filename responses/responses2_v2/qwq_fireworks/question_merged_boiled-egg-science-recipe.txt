Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each question exactly as per the instructions.

1. **Question 1:** The polymer expert who mentioned not eating all 300 eggs is named in the article. Let me check. The article says, "Pellegrino Musto, a polymer expert at the National Research Council of Italy." So the answer is Pellegrino Musto.

2. **Question 2:** Ms. Di Lorenzo is not a fan of sous vide. The new method uses cycles of boiling (212°F) and lukewarm (86°F). The article mentions the cycle is repeated eight times. Wait, the question says 230-degree water, but the article states 212°F. Since the question has an incorrect temperature (230 instead of 212), the answer would be N/A because the temperature is wrong.

3. **Question 3:** The ideal temperature for the yolk according to the method that preserves polyphenols. The article says the sous vide method uses 150°F, which is the ideal for the yolk. But the new method's average is 150°F. Since the question asks for Celsius, I need to convert 150°F. Wait, 150°F is about 65.5°C. But the article might not specify Celsius, so maybe the question is wrong? The article states sous vide is 150°F, so the answer in Celsius would be 65.5°C, but the article might not convert it. Since the question asks for Celsius and the article gives Fahrenheit, but doesn't convert, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "150 degrees Fahrenheit" for sous vide, which is the ideal for the yolk. The new method's average is 150°F. Since the question is about the method that preserves polyphenols (the new method), the ideal temp is 150°F, which is 65.5°C. But the question asks for Celsius, so I need to convert. But the article doesn't give Celsius, so maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "according to the method that preserves more polyphenols" which is the new method. The article states the average temp is 150°F, so converting to Celsius would be 65.5°C. But since the article only gives Fahrenheit, maybe the question expects the answer in Fahrenheit but the question asks for Celsius. Hmm. Maybe the answer is N/A because the article doesn't state Celsius.

Wait, the question says "ideal temperature, in Celsius" but the article only mentions Fahrenheit. Since the article doesn't provide Celsius, the answer is N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The American Egg Board's concerns besides bird flu. The article says "soaring prices and worries about the bird flu." So the other concern is soaring prices.

5. **Question 5:** Lopez-Alt's recipe in NYT uses a pot and another utensil. The article says "steaming the egg in a single inch of water." The utensil would be a steamer, but maybe a lid? The article says "steaming" which requires a steamer basket? Or just a pot with water and cover. The question says "besides a pot," so perhaps a lid? But the article doesn't specify another utensil. Wait, maybe a steamer basket. But the article just mentions "steaming in a single inch of water" implying just a pot with a lid. So maybe N/A? The article doesn't mention another utensil beyond a pot. Hmm. The answer might be "N/A".

Wait, the article says "steaming the egg in a single inch of water" which is done with a pot and a lid, but perhaps the utensil required is a steamer basket? Since the question asks for another utensil besides the pot, but the article doesn't mention it, so maybe N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The materials scientist in Milan? The article says Dr. Di Maio is in Naples. The colleague who suggested the project was in Milan? Wait, the first paragraph says "Dr. Di Maio, a materials scientist in Naples, Italy" and the colleague wanted to do the egg project. The chef Carlo Cracco is in Milan. The question is about the materials scientist in Milan, but the article doesn't mention one. So answer is N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The compound protecting against DNA damage is polyphenols. The article says "higher concentration of polyphenols, compounds that protect against DNA damage."

8. **Question 8:** The graduate student who published on foaming pizza and dislikes runny yolk. The article mentions Emilia Di Lorenzo is the grad student in Di Maio's lab who published on foaming pizza. Also, Ms. Di Lorenzo says she's not a fan of sous vide (runny yolk). So the answer is Emilia Di Lorenzo.

9. **Question 9:** The smelly compound in the green ring is ferrous sulfide. The article says "the presence of smelly ferrous sulfide." But the question attributes it to Deb Perelman, who runs Smitten Kitchen. The article states that the green ring is from ferrous sulfide, but the part about the smelly compound is from the article's general info, not Deb. The question's attribution to Deb is incorrect, so the answer is N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Sous vide time is an hour. The article says "a third method, known as sous vide, cooks an egg for an hour..." The question asks how long in hours, so 1 hour. The ideal temp for albumen? Wait, the question says "according to the scientists' new method" but the sous vide temp is 150°F, which is the ideal for yolk. The albumen's optimal temp might be higher, but the question is about the sous vide's duration. Answer is 1.

11. **Question 11:** Total temperature transitions. The cycle is 2 min boiling, 2 min lukewarm, repeated 8 times. Each cycle has two temps, so 8 cycles x2 = 16 transitions? Wait, each cycle is two steps, so 8 cycles would be 8x2=16. But the question is total transitions. The article says "cycle repeated eight times," so each cycle has two steps. The total transitions would be 16. But maybe the first immersion is the start, so total transitions (changes) would be 16 steps minus the first? Or just 16 steps total. The answer is 16? Wait, the question says "temperature transitions," so each switch is a transition. Starting at boiling, then lukewarm (1 transition), then back to boiling (another?), but the cycles are repeated 8 times. Let me see: starting at boiling, then lukewarm (transition 1). Then again boiling (transition 2), etc. Each cycle has two steps, so 8 cycles would be 8*2 steps, but transitions between each step. So for 8 cycles: each cycle has two steps, so 8 cycles have 16 steps, but transitions between each step. So 16 transitions? Wait, maybe not. Let me think: the first cycle: boil to lukewarm (1 transition), then back to boil (another? Or is the cycle 2 min boil, then 2 min lukewarm, so each cycle is two steps, so after 8 cycles, you've done 16 steps (each step being 2 minutes). The transitions between each step would be 16 transitions. But the question is about total temperature transitions. Alternatively, the number of temperature changes is 16? Because each step is a transition. Wait, maybe the answer is 16. The article says "repeated eight times," so each time you do boil then lukewarm. So 8 times would be 8*2 steps, so 16 total steps. Each step is a temperature, so transitions between each step. The total transitions would be 16-1? No, each step is a transition. Hmm, maybe the answer is 16, but the question might want 16. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the number of times they switch between temps. Each cycle has two steps, so each cycle has one transition (from boil to lukewarm?), but that's not right. Wait, the cycle is two minutes in boiling, then two minutes in lukewarm. So each cycle is two steps, so each cycle has one transition (from boil to lukewarm). Wait, starting at boil, then lukewarm, that's one transition. Then repeating the cycle again would start with boil again, which is another transition? No, perhaps the total transitions are 8 cycles * 2 steps? Not sure. The article says "repeated eight times", so the total number of temperature changes would be 16 (each 2-minute period is a temperature, so transitions between each). Alternatively, the total number of temperature transitions (i.e., how many times they switch between temps) would be 16 steps, but each step is a temperature. Since the question says "temperature transitions", maybe the answer is 16. But maybe the question is trickier. Alternatively, the total transitions (number of times the temp changes) is 16 steps minus 1? Probably the article doesn't specify, so maybe the answer is 16. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the question might want the number of times they cycled between the two temps. Since it's repeated 8 times, each cycle has two temps, so total transitions (number of steps) is 16. So answer is 16.

12. **Question 12:** The element in yolk causing ferrous sulfide. The article says the green ring is from ferrous sulfide. Ferrous is iron (Fe), so the element is iron. The yolk has sulfur compounds? The question is which element in the yolk leads to it. Since ferrous sulfide contains iron (Fe), the element is iron.

13. **Question 13:** Previous research by Emilia Di Lorenzo on foaming pizza. The article says she recently published a paper on foaming pizza. That's the answer. But the question asks what was cited as influencing the egg method. The article doesn't mention that her pizza paper influenced the egg technique, so the answer is N/A.

14. **Question 14:** How does the periodic method's average temp compare to sous vide's optimal for albumen? The new method's average is 150°F, which is the ideal for yolk. Sous vide is at 150°F, which is ideal for yolk but not optimal for albumen. The question asks about the albumen's optimal temp. The article says sous vide's 150°F is not enough for albumen proteins. The new method's boiling temp (212°F) is better for albumen. The average temp of the periodic method is 150°F, same as sous vide. But the question is comparing the average to the sous vide's optimal for albumen. Since the sous vide's temp (150) is not optimal for albumen, the periodic's average is same as sous vide. So the answer is "same as" but the article says the periodic's average is ideal for yolk while the hotter bath helps albumen. The question is tricky. The answer might be "same as" but the article states that the sous vide's temp is not optimal for albumen, so the periodic's average is same but the method uses higher temp for albumen. The question is about comparing the average temp to the optimal for albumen. Since the optimal for albumen is higher (needs boiling), the periodic's average (150) is lower than optimal. But the article says "the hotter bath is sufficient to cook the albumen." The average is 150, which is the same as sous vide, but the periodic uses higher temp for albumen. So the answer would be that the average is lower than the optimal for albumen? But the question is phrased as "how does the periodic's average compare to the optimal sous vide temp for denaturing albumen proteins". The sous vide's temp is 150, which is not enough for albumen. The optimal for albumen would be higher (like boiling at 212). The periodic's average is same as sous vide (150), but the method uses higher temps. So the answer is the periodic's average is the same as the sous vide's temp, which is below the optimal for albumen. So the answer is "the same as" but the question is phrased as comparing the average to the optimal sous vide temp. Wait, the sous vide's optimal for yolk is 150. The question says "optimal sous vide temperature for denaturing albumen proteins". Since sous vide at 150 isn't enough for albumen, the optimal for albumen would be higher (like boiling). But the question is about the sous vide's temp, which is 150. So the periodic's average is same as sous vide's temp, which is insufficient for albumen. The comparison is that the periodic's average is same as the sous vide's temp, which is not optimal for albumen. So the answer is "same as" or "equal to". The question asks how the periodic's average compares to the optimal sous vide temp for albumen. Since the sous vide's temp (150) is not optimal for albumen, but the question is about comparing to that temp, the answer is "same as".

15. **Question 15:** Lopez-Alt's method requires a utensil besides a pot. The article says he proposed steaming with "a single inch of water". That's done with a pot and a lid, so maybe no other utensil. The question asks for another utensil beyond the pot. Since it's not mentioned, answer is N/A.

16. **Question 16:** The study mistakenly attributed polyphenols but actually preserved another component. The article says the study found higher polyphenols, but maybe the question is about another component? Wait, the question says "mistakenly attributed to polyphenols in the initial study draft". The article mentions the study found higher polyphenols, so maybe the correct answer is N/A because there's no mention of a mistake. Wait, the article says "the study found a higher concentration of polyphenols", so maybe the question is wrong, so answer N/A.

17. **Question 17:** Primary chemical reason for harder peeling. The article says "everything is softer", so the proteins didn't clump as much, making it harder to peel. The reason is that the albumen is softer, not clumped. The article says the periodic method prevents the proteins from clumping, so the egg is softer, making peeling harder. The primary reason is that the albumen remains softer (not denatured as much?), but the article states "the very key of our method is to have a well-cooked albumen without wasting the yolk". Wait, the article says the periodic method's eggs are harder to peel because "everything is softer". The chemical reason is that the proteins didn't denature as much, remaining softer. So the answer is "the albumen remains softer due to less protein denaturation".

18. **Question 18:** Polymer science principle applied by Musto. Musto is a polymer expert. The article mentions the method used fluid dynamics software. Maybe heat distribution related to polymer principles? The article doesn't specify which principle, so answer N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Percentage reduction in protein clumping. The article doesn't mention a specific percentage, so N/A.

20. **Question 20:** Historical technique's failure inspired the new method. The article mentions sous vide and hard-boiling as existing methods. The new method was inspired by the failure of sous vide (runny yolk) and hard-boiling (overcooked albumen). The article says "the task was harder than it might seem... the two parts require different temperatures". The sous vide approach kept the yolk ideal but albumen undercooked. Hard-boiling overcooked albumen. So the inspiration was the failure of hard-boiling and sous vide. The question asks which historical technique's failure inspired it. The article mentions sous vide and traditional methods. The answer might be "hard-boiling" because it overcooks the albumen, leading to the need for a better method. The article states "the task was harder... the yolk and albumen have different chemical components". The new method was inspired by the problems with existing methods like hard-boiling and sous vide. The question specifies a "historical" technique's failure. Since sous vide is a modern technique, maybe hard-boiling. The article says the task was harder because existing methods like hard-boiling and sous vide didn't handle both parts well. So the answer is "hard-boiling".
