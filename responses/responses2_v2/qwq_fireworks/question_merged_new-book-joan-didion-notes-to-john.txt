Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. 

1. **Question 1**: The question asks what prompted the New York Public Library to acquire Didion and Dunne's archives a year before "Blue Nights" was released. The article mentions that the archives were opened in 2025, but "Blue Nights" was published in 2005. Since the question refers to a year before "Blue Nights," that would be 2004. However, the article states the archives arrived at the library in 354 boxes after her death in 2021. There's no mention of an earlier acquisition. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The question is about how many boxes were reviewed excluding the therapy notes. The article says there were 354 boxes total, but it doesn't specify how many were excluded or reviewed. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The cause of death in "Blue Nights" is acute pancreatitis. The therapy sessions also discussed this. The article states Quintana died of acute pancreatitis, so that's the answer.

4. **Question 4**: The trustees are Lynn Nesbit and two editors. The question asks for a fourth trustee advocating for publication. The article lists three trustees; no fourth is mentioned. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The essay in "Slouching Towards Bethlehem" with her psychiatric eval is the title essay, "The White Album." The article mentions this.

6. **Question 6**: Didion compared her own writing process to Hemingway's in the 1998 essay. The article says she criticized Hemingway's posthumous work, possibly referencing his approach to completion. The key aspect is withholding or not publishing unfinished work. The answer is "what she reveals and what she withholds," but the question asks for the aspect she attributed to Hemingway. Wait, the article says "Didion's art... electricity from what she reveals and withholds." In her critique of Hemingway, she mentions he didn't think his work was publishable. The aspect is the idea of withholding, so the answer is "withholding."

7. **Question 7**: The vertigo and nausea in "The White Album" were from 1968. The article says she had an attack then. The trigger isn't specified, so N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The original title from the unlabeled folder isn't mentioned. The article just says it was in an unlabeled folder. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: "The Year of Magical Thinking" was published in 2005. "Notes to John" came out in 2023 (April 2023 is implied by 2025 archives). 2023-2005 is 18 years. But Jordan Pavlin's comment is in the article now, so from 2005 to when the article was written (2023?), 18 years. The article doesn't give exact years for his statement, but the question is how many years after 2005. The article says "since she stopped releasing new work in 2011", but the exact number might need calculation. Since "Notes to John" is published in 2023, that's 18 years after 2005. But the question is about when Pavlin made the statement. Since the article doesn't specify the current year, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says the book is published in April 2023 (since the release is in 2023 as per the first paragraph). So 2023 minus 2005 is 18. So answer is 18.

10. **Question 10**: The question asks for an unpublished memoir about her daughter's cancer. The article mentions Quintana's death from pancreatitis, not cancer. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The Hemingway work she criticized is the posthumous novel mentioned in her 1998 essay. The article says it was a posthumous novel by Hemingway, but the title isn't given. So N/A.

12. **Question 12**: A co-authored chapter with Dunne about their grief, later excised. The article mentions "The Year of Magical Thinking" and "Blue Nights," but no co-authored chapter. N/A.

13. **Question 13**: The exact cause is acute pancreatitis, as stated in the article. So answer is "acute pancreatitis."

14. **Question 14**: A trustee who opposed publication due to marital conflicts. The article doesn't mention any opposition, just that they saw it as important. N/A.

15. **Question 15**: The abandoned novel from late 90s mentioned in "Notes to John." The article doesn't name it. N/A.

Now, let me check each again carefully.

1. The archives were acquired after her death, so before "Blue Nights" (2005) is impossible. N/A.

2. No number given excluding the notes. N/A.

3. Acute pancreatitis is correct.

4. Only three trustees listed, so N/A.

5. Title essay is "The White Album."

6. The aspect is "withholding" as per her critique of Hemingway's view on publication.

7. The trigger event for vertigo isn't mentioned, so N/A.

8. Unlabeled folder's title isn't given. N/A.

9. 2023 minus 2005 is 18 years. But the article says the book is published in April 2023 (assuming current year is 2023 as the article is recent). So 18.

10. The cause was pancreatitis, not cancer, so N/A.

11. The Hemingway novel's title isn't in the text. N/A.

12. No mention of a co-authored chapter excised. N/A.

13. Acute pancreatitis is correct.

14. No opposition mentioned. N/A.

15. No title given for the abandoned novel. N/A.
