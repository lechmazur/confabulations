Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The Countess Gabriele Von Blerkom's song and how Christopher Gattelli highlighted her political leanings. The article mentions that the Countess is a take on Baroness Elsa and is "definitely a Nazi though 'it's never explicitly stated.'" The reviewer says Angel Reda does a great job with her "why-does-this-minor-character-have-a-song song, a Cole Porter pastiche." But the question is about a theatrical device used by Gattelli. Wait, the article says Gattelli's direction included "scenes and dances... sampling the athletic period style of Onna White and Michael Kidd." However, the specific device related to the Countess's political hints? The article doesn't mention Gattelli's specific direction for her, only that her character is hinted as a Nazi. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, no, the question is about the device used to highlight her political leanings. Since the article says her political leanings are "never explicitly stated" but the show "definitely a Nazi," perhaps the device is the costume or something else. The article mentions Linda Cho's costumes as "hilarious," and there's a mention of Billy's high-waisted pants. But the question is about the director's theatrical device. Since the article doesn't specify a device used by Gattelli for her political leanings, maybe N/A. Hmm, but the article says "the Countess... is deftly pegged as a likely Nazi though 'it's never explicitly stated.'" The device here might be implication through performance or other elements, but the question is about Gattelli's direction. Since the text doesn't specify, I think N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Total seasons produced or planned. The article says the TV show had a first season (2021), second season ("Schmicago" for 70s musicals), and an unproduced third season "Into the Schmoods." So that's 2 produced and 1 planned, total 3. The answer is 3.

3. **Question 3:** Narrative element from "Oklahoma!" used to expand Betsy's character. The article says Betsy is "a possibly underage variant on Ado Annie from 'Oklahoma!'" and Cinco Paul added a song "Not That Kinda Gal" to give her more substance. The question asks what narrative element from "Oklahoma!" was used. Since Ado Annie is from Oklahoma!, and the song mirrors her flirtatiousness but with darker undertones, the answer is the song "Not That Kinda Gal."

4. **Question 4:** Another song title besides "Corn Puddin'" that shows honoring and satirizing. The article mentions "I Thought I Was the Only One" for the closeted attraction between the mayor and reverend. That's the other song mentioned. So answer is "I Thought I Was the Only One."

5. **Question 5:** Aspect of Billy's character highlighted by Linda Cho's costumes during the "Soliloquy" parody. The article says Melissa points out that "steal it" and "take it" are the same, and there's a joke about his "really high-waisted" pants. The costumes by Linda Cho are mentioned as "hilarious," so the high-waisted pants were part of the costume design to highlight the critique. So answer is "high-waisted pants."

6. **Question 6:** Teaching method in "Do-Re-Mi" parody cut short. The parody is called "Va-Gi-Na" where Melissa teaches the facts of life. The article says the parody "vanishes as soon as you get to the zinger" when it reaches the title. So the teaching method is "the facts of life," but the question asks for the method's name. The article says "teaching the facts of life to a highly pregnant but deeply naive young woman," so the method is the song's approach, but the title is "Va-Gi-Na." The question is about the method, but the answer might be "the facts of life" or the song title? Wait, the question says "what teaching method... employed by Melissa... was cut short just as it reached its comedic climax." The article says the parody "vanishes as soon as you get to the zinger. (It's called 'Va-Gi-Na.')". The method is the song's approach, so the answer is "teaching the facts of life" or the song's title. The exact wording says "teaching the facts of life to a highly pregnant...", so the method is "teaching the facts of life." The answer is "teaching the facts of life."

7. **Question 7:** Which musical is parodied through the phlegmatic reverend. The article says the reverend is "arguably from 'Guys and Dolls'". So the answer is "Guys and Dolls."

8. **Question 8:** Prop central to "Brigadoon" but absent in the set. The town "Schmigadoon" references "Brigadoon," which is a musical where the town appears only every 10 years and is tied to a magical fog or something. The set is "brightly lit and flatly decorated" with no mention of fog or magical elements. The article doesn't specify a prop, but the original Brigadoon's plot involves the town disappearing, so maybe the fog or the time limit? The article mentions the set design by Scott Pask is flatly decorated, so perhaps the magical elements like the mist or a clock are absent. But the question asks for a prop central to Brigadoon's plot. In Brigadoon, the key prop might be the town itself appearing magically, but since it's a set, maybe the absence is the mist. The article doesn't mention any specific prop being absent, though. Alternatively, maybe the "bell tower" or something else. Since the article doesn't specify, perhaps N/A. Wait, the article says the set is "brightly lit, flatly decorated," so maybe the magical elements like the fog or the time-bound setting's visual cues are missing. But the question asks for a prop. Since there's no specific prop named, maybe N/A. Hmm, tricky. The article says "Schmigadoon" references "Brigadoon," so the original Brigadoon's plot involves the town disappearing, but the stage production's set doesn't have that element. The prop might be the town itself, but that's the setting. Alternatively, perhaps the "bell tower" or "timepiece," but the article doesn't mention. So maybe N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Establishment central to Danny Bailey's character, parodying Billy Bigelow's profession. Danny is described as a "carnival barker" like Billy in "Carousel." Billy was a carnival worker, so the establishment is a carnival. The answer is "carnival."

10. **Question 10:** Dance style by Michael Kidd for "Guys and Dolls" replicated in the Mayor's scene. The article says Gattelli's direction samples "the athletic period style of Onna White and Michael Kidd." Since the question is about Michael Kidd's style for "Guys and Dolls," the answer is the dance style from that show. The article doesn't specify the exact name but mentions Michael Kidd's style. The dance style associated with Michael Kidd in "Guys and Dolls" is the "Petting in the Park" number, which is a jazz ballet. But the question asks for the type of dance style. Since the article just says "athletic period style," maybe the answer is "athletic period style," but that's not a specific name. Alternatively, perhaps "jazz ballet" or "precision dance," but the article doesn't name it. Since the question specifies "originally choreographed by Michael Kidd for 'Guys and Dolls,'" the answer is the "precision dance" or "jazz ballet," but without the article specifying, maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "sampling the athletic period style of Onna White and Michael Kidd." The style here is "athletic period style," but is that the specific name? Maybe the answer is "athletic period style," but the question wants the dance style's name. Alternatively, since "Guys and Dolls" is mentioned, and the mayor's scene might use a specific dance like "Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat," which is a tap dance. But without explicit mention, maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "athletic period style of Onna White and Michael Kidd." The question is about a dance style originally by Kidd for "Guys and Dolls." The answer would be the style associated with Kidd, which is known for jazz and ballet fusion. But since the article just refers to "athletic period style," perhaps that's the answer. The question asks for the specific dance style's name. Since the article doesn't name it beyond "athletic period style," maybe N/A. Alternatively, the answer is "athletic period style," but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reviewer mentions a specific dance like "Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat," but no. Hmm, this might be N/A. But the question says "replicate in the Mayor Menlove's introductory scene," and the article says the direction samples Kidd's style. Since the question is about the style's name, and the article just says "athletic period style," perhaps that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "jazz ballet," but I'm not certain. Since the article doesn't specify the exact name beyond "athletic period style," I'll go with N/A unless the answer is "athletic period style." Wait, the question says "originally choreographed by Michael Kidd for 'Guys and Dolls,'" so the dance style is "precision dance" or "jazz ballet," but without the article stating it, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the article's mention of "athletic period style" is the device, so answer is "athletic period style." I think the answer here is N/A because the article doesn't name the specific dance style by name beyond "athletic period style," which isn't a standard term for Kidd's work.
