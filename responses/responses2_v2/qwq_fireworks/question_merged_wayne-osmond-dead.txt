Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and don't assume anything else. Let's start with the first question.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which instrument Wayne learned specifically to honor his Mormon heritage during early Disneyland performances. Scanning the article, I remember that his daughter mentioned he played 18 instruments, including bagpipes, banjo, clarinet, and was most proficient in guitar. However, the article says he started performing at 6, and the brothers formed a barbershop quartet. The mention of bagpipes might relate to Mormon heritage since Utah has a strong LDS community and bagpipes could be part of traditional Mormon music? Wait, the article says they performed at Disneyland to earn money for mission trips, but there's no specific instrument mentioned as tied to Mormon heritage. The article doesn't explicitly state that any instrument was chosen for that reason. So maybe this is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many consecutive weeks "One Bad Apple" stayed at #1 according to Andy Williams' assessment. The article says "One Bad Apple" reached No. 1 but doesn't mention how many weeks. Andy Williams introduced them, but the article doesn't state his assessment about the chart duration. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The London venue where their performance caused hysteria needing crowd control. The article mentions their 1972 trip to Heathrow Airport in London caused scenes like the Beatles, but the venue isn't named. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Which brother taught him lead guitar for "Yo-Yo." The article says he played lead guitar and wrote songs, but doesn't mention who taught him. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Song about his brain tumor. The article mentions he wrote "And You Love Me" for his wife, not about the tumor. The tumor was discovered in his 40s, but no song title related to that is given. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The Mormon hymn they performed on Andy Williams' show. The article says they performed "Yes Sir, That's My Baby," but no hymn is mentioned. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Talent scout who discovered them before Andy's father. The article says Andy Williams' father saw them at Disneyland and introduced them to Andy. So the father of Andy Williams is the one, but the question asks for the talent scout's name. Since it's Andy Williams' father, maybe his name isn't given here. The article doesn't name the talent scout as a separate person. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Number of gold records as lead guitarist between 1970-1974. The article mentions hits like "One Bad Apple" and "Yo-Yo" but doesn't specify gold records count. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Medical condition preventing mission work in late 60s. The article states he had a brain tumor discovered in his 40s, but the question is about the late 60s. The health issue in his 40s (after 1980s) doesn't relate to the 1960s. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Record producer comparing his voice to Elvis. The article doesn't mention any producer's comparison to Elvis. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Decade he first performed with siblings. He started at 6 (born 1951, so 1957). The decade would be the 1950s. The article says he started at 6, so yes, 1950s.

12. **Question 12:** Neurological incident in 2012. The article states he had a stroke in 2012 that left him unable to play guitar. So the answer is stroke.

13. **Question 13:** Wife's name corrected from Kathryn to Kathlyn. The article's correction says her name is Kathlyn, not Kathryn. So answer is Kathlyn.

14. **Question 14:** Instrument he was most proficient in. His daughter said he was most proficient at guitar.

15. **Question 15:** Date of first TV appearance on Andy Williams' show. The article says December 2, 1962.

16. **Question 16:** Decade their persona with flared jumpsuits was prominent. The article mentions 1970s as their era with flared jumpsuits and "early 1970s" for hits. So 1970s.

17. **Question 17:** Recreational activity in last decade. The article says he took up fly fishing and other hobbies after the 2012 stroke.

18. **Question 18:** Singer who provided their breakthrough. Andy Williams' father introduced them to Andy, and they debuted on his show. So Andy Williams.

19. **Question 19:** Sibling with raspy high notes compared to Michael. The article says Donny had raspy high notes, compared to Michael Jackson's role in the Jackson 5. So Donny.

20. **Question 20:** Family member who commented on his deep nature. Marie Osmond commented on his artistic leanings and solving life's questions in 2022.
