Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each question exactly as asked. Let's go step by step.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks how many years Mona was away from the Disorder'd Rabble after Milton's exile before her anxiety about playing Cleopatra prompted her return. The article states that Mona hasn't seen Milton in nearly a year. Since she's returning to play Cleopatra for the Rabble without him, the time away would be "nearly a year." But the question specifies "years," so maybe it's 1 year? The exact wording is "nearly a year," but since the answer needs to be in years, the closest is 1. However, the article says "nearly a year," so maybe "N/A" because it's not a whole year? Wait, the question says "how many years," so if it's nearly a year, maybe it's 1. I'll go with 1 year.

2. **Question 2:** The substance besides opiates Mona used. The article mentions "weed she vaped to boost the pills' effect." So the answer is weed or marijuana. Since the question asks for the substance, "weed" is mentioned directly.

3. **Question 3:** Mona's niece Rachel's role in the expulsion. The article says Rachel was an intern at the Rabble and became an anonymous source for the Times reporter. So her role was providing an anonymous tip.

4. **Question 4:** The Shakespeare play quoted in the postcard and used as a novel title. The postcard has "I am dying, Egypt, dying" from Antony and Cleopatra. The novel mentioned is "Mona Acts Out," but the other novel listed by Isabella Hammad is "Ghost," which uses "Hamlet" in the West Bank. Wait, the article says "Mona Acts Out" is inspired by the Jessica Bennett article, and the other books are listed separately. The question asks for the play referenced in the postcard and also the title of Hammad's novel. Wait, the play is Antony and Cleopatra, but the novel by Hammad is "Ghost," but the question says the title is directly quoted from the Shakespeare play. Wait, the postcard uses a line from Antony and Cleopatra. The Hammad novel's title isn't directly from that play. Wait, the question says the novel's title is directly quoted. The article says Hammad's book is about "Hamlet" in the West Bank, so maybe the play is "Hamlet"? But the postcard line is from Antony and Cleopatra. Wait, the question is asking for the play that's both in the postcard and the novel title. Hmm. Wait, the Hammad novel's title isn't directly from Shakespeare. The question might be referring to "Antony and Cleopatra" as the play quoted in the postcard, and that's the same play mentioned in the novel's context? Or maybe the title of Hammad's novel is "Ghost," but that's not Shakespeare. Wait, maybe I misread. The question says the play is directly quoted by Milton and also serves as the title of Hammad's novel. But Hammad's novel is "Ghost," which isn't a Shakespeare play. The play in the postcard is Antony and Cleopatra. The Hammad novel uses "Hamlet." Wait, the article says "a staging of 'Hamlet' in the West Bank." So maybe the answer is "Antony and Cleopatra" for the play, but the novel's title isn't that. Wait, the question is confusing. Let me check again. The postcard line is from Antony and Cleopatra. The Hammad novel's title is "Ghost." But the question states that the play's line is quoted and the novel's title is the same as the play? Or that the play's title is the same as the novel's? No, the novel's title is "Ghost," but the play referenced in the question is the one quoted in the postcard and also the title of Hammad's novel. That can't be. Wait, maybe the question is pointing to "Antony and Cleopatra" as the play, but the novel's title isn't that. Maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, the Hammad novel's title isn't Shakespeare, so maybe the answer is "Antony and Cleopatra" even if the novel's title isn't that. The question might have an error, but based on the info, the play is Antony and Cleopatra.

5. **Question 5:** The dog breed. The article says Mona's beagle, Barney, is like a clown. So the answer is beagle.

6. **Question 6:** Mona's husband's profession. The article mentions her doctor husband. So the answer is doctor.

7. **Question 7:** The literary device used in structuring the novel. The article says it's structured in five acts and an interlude, mirroring a Shakespearean play. The device is the use of acts, so the answer is acts or five acts. The question asks for the device, which is structuring in acts.

8. **Question 8:** The location in the East Village for the Disorder'd Rabble. The article says "the Disorder'd Rabble -- the name is borrowed from 'King Lear' -- he has lived in disgraced exile." Wait, the name is borrowed from King Lear, but the location isn't specified except that the company was in the East Village. The article says "the Disorder'd Rabble -- the name is borrowed from 'King Lear'". The question asks where the theater company was based before expulsion. The article says Milton was expelled from his "legendary East Village company, the Disorder'd Rabble." So the location is the East Village. But the question asks for the specific location in the East Village. The article doesn't mention a specific address or theater name, only that it's in the East Village. So maybe the answer is East Village, but the question says "specific location." Since it's not given, maybe "N/A"?

Wait, the question says "what location in the East Village did Milton's company call home." The article says "legendary East Village company," so the answer is East Village, but maybe that's too broad. Since it's not more specific, perhaps "N/A".

Wait, the article says "the Disorder'd Rabble -- the name is borrowed from 'King Lear'". The name itself is the company's name, but the location is the East Village. The question is about the specific location in the East Village. Since the article doesn't specify a street or theater name, the answer might be "N/A". Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the answer is East Village. But the question specifies "in the East Village," so the answer is East Village. But the question says "specific location," which might require more detail. Since it's not given, maybe N/A. I'm confused here. The article says the company is in the East Village, so the location is the East Village. So answer is East Village.

9. **Question 9:** The Shakespearean character compared to Milton and Mona. The review says "Milton is something of a Lear figure, and Mona something of a middle-aged Cordelia." So Lear and Cordelia. The question asks for the character Milton is compared to, so Lear.

10. **Question 10:** The price of "Fieldwork" by Berlinski. The article mentions "Fieldwork" in Berlinski's previous works, but the price given is for "Mona Acts Out" at $27.99. The question asks for "Fieldwork," which isn't listed with a price. So answer is N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The director who sent the postcard. The article says Milton Katz is the director. The question asks for his name, so Milton Katz.

12. **Question 12:** The dog's breed. Already answered as beagle.

13. **Question 13:** The Shakespeare play whose imagery Milton repurposed. The postcard uses a line from Antony and Cleopatra: "I am dying, Egypt, dying." So the play is Antony and Cleopatra.

14. **Question 14:** The investigative report by Jessica Bennett. The article says "a 2017 article in The Times by Jessica Bennett, about nine women accusing the veteran playwright and artistic director Israel Horovitz of sexual misconduct." So the answer is the 2017 article by Jessica Bennett in The Times. But the question asks for the report's title? The article doesn't mention the title, just the reporter and content. Since the question asks for the report, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "investigative report outlining allegations..." The article says "a 2017 article in The New York Times by Jessica Bennett...", so the report is that article. The exact title isn't given, so perhaps the answer is "N/A". Alternatively, maybe the answer is "the 2017 article by Jessica Bennett in The New York Times", but the question asks for the report's title. Since it's not provided, N/A.

Wait, the question says "what investigative report...", but the article only mentions the reporter and the content. Since the title isn't given, the answer is N/A.

15. **Question 15:** The protagonist whose relationship with a mentor is like Shakespearean tragedy. The protagonist is Mona, who is compared to Cordelia, and her relationship with Milton (Lear) is the tragic one. So the answer is Mona.

16. **Question 16:** The niece who provided the tip. The article says Rachel was the anonymous source. So Rachel.

17. **Question 17:** The number of major narrative segments. The article says "structured in five acts and an interlude," so the major segments are five acts. The question excludes supplementary sections, so the answer is five.

18. **Question 18:** The inhaled substance. The article says "weed she vaped." So weed or marijuana. The question specifies "inhaled," so vaping weed.

19. **Question 19:** The starting neighborhood. The article mentions Mona's Manhattan apartment in Morningside Heights. So Morningside Heights.

20. **Question 20:** The Shakespearean tragedy compared to Milton's fall. The review says Milton is a Lear figure, so the tragedy is King Lear.

Wait, let me recheck each:

1. The article says "hasn't seen him in nearly a year." So "nearly a year" is less than a year, so the answer is 1? Or since it's "nearly," maybe N/A? The question asks for years. If it's less than a year, then it's 0 years? But the article says "nearly a year," so the closest is 1. The answer should be 1.

2. Weed.

3. Rachel was an anonymous source for the article that led to his expulsion.

4. The play quoted is Antony and Cleopatra. The novel by Hammad is "Ghost," which uses Hamlet. The question says the novel's title is the same as the play quoted? No. Wait, the question says "directly quoted by Milton and also serves as the title of a novel by Isabella Hammad mentioned in the article?" The Hammad novel's title isn't the same as the play. The postcard line is from Antony and Cleopatra, and the Hammad novel is "Ghost." The question might have a mistake, but based on the info, the answer must be Antony and Cleopatra because that's the play quoted. The other part about the novel's title might be a trick. Maybe the question is wrong, but per the article, the play is Antony and Cleopatra.

5. Beagle.

6. Doctor.

7. Acts (five acts structure).

8. East Village. Since the company is in the East Village.

9. Lear.

10. N/A (Fieldwork's price not given).

11. Milton Katz.

12. Beagle.

13. Antony and Cleopatra.

14. N/A (title not given).

15. Mona.

16. Rachel.

17. Five.

18. Weed (vaped).

19. Morningside Heights.

20. King Lear (since Milton is compared to Lear).

Wait, for question 20, the article says "Milton is something of a Lear figure," so the tragedy is King Lear. But the question says "emblematic of a ruler’s devastating decline," which Lear's story is. So yes, King Lear.

Double-checking all answers:

1. 1

2. weed

3. anonymous source for the article

4. Antony and Cleopatra

5. beagle

6. doctor

7. five acts

8. East Village
