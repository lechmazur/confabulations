Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and follow the instructions strictly. 

Starting with question 1: "How many black-and-white photographs from Robert Frank's "The Americans" were displayed alongside the colorful magazine pages from House Beautiful in the exhibition's section dedicated to the Civil Rights Movement?" 

Looking at the article, it says in the first paragraph that "a half dozen black-and-white photos from "The Americans" are displayed in the first room, on a wall opposite an array of colorful magazine pages from the same time, from Sports Illustrated, Life and House Beautiful." However, the question mentions the Civil Rights Movement section. The article doesn't specify that these photos were in the Civil Rights section. The Civil Rights part is mentioned later when discussing the evolution of the American dream. The first room's display is in the beginning, not specifically tied to the Civil Rights Movement. So the answer is N/A because the location isn't in the Civil Rights section as stated.

Question 2: The name of the New York collector related to the American dream theme whose donated images were next to Chief Keokuk's daguerreotype. The article mentions Peter J. Cohen donated photos of unknown strangers. The daguerreotype of Chief Keokuk is from Thomas M. Easterly's studio. The article says Boom and Rooseboom selected over 170 pics from Cohen's collection. The question links the American dream theme and the donated images next to Chief Keokuk's. Since Cohen's photos were part of the exhibition's American dream theme and the article mentions his donations, the answer is Peter J. Cohen.

Question 3: The year "The Scourged Back" was taken. The article states it was taken around 1863 in Baton Rouge, LA. The exact year given is 1863.

Question 4: The photographic plate type used by Thomas M. Easterly for the Harlem man's portrait. The article says the earliest daguerreotype is Henry Fitz's self-portrait from 1840. The Harlem man's 1938 portrait is in a studio, but the question is about the type used by Easterly when photographing Chief Keokuk. Wait, the article mentions Thomas M. Easterly's studio took Chief Keokuk's daguerreotype in 1847. The Harlem man's portrait in 1938 is a studio portrait but the question is about Easterly's plate type. Since daguerreotype was used in 1847 for Keokuk, the answer is daguerreotype. But the question says "when photographing the Harlem man in a three-piece tuxedo." Wait, the article mentions the Harlem man's portrait in 1938 as a studio portrait, but the daguerreotype example is Henry Fitz's. The question's wording might be a trick. The article says Easterly did Keokuk's daguerreotype in 1847, but the Harlem man's portrait in 1938 isn't linked to Easterly. The question says "photographer of 'The Scourged Back' captured the image... which was later used by Peter J. Cohen..." Wait no, the question is about Thomas M. Easterly's studio when photographing the Harlem man. Wait, the article says the Harlem man's 1938 portrait is separate. The question is mixing up details. The article says Thomas M. Easterly did the 1847 daguerreotype of Chief Keokuk. The Harlem man's 1938 portrait isn't by Easterly. So maybe the answer is N/A because the question incorrectly attributes the Harlem portrait to Easterly. But the question asks what type Easterly used when photographing the Harlem man. Since Easterly was in 1847, the Harlem man's 1938 portrait isn't his work, so answer N/A.

Wait, let me recheck. The question says "the daguerreotype of Chief Keokuk" was taken by Easterly. The Harlem man's portrait is a studio one in 1938 but not by Easterly. The question is about what type Easterly used when photographing the Harlem man. Since he didn't, the answer is N/A.

Question 5: The fourth magazine besides Sports Illustrated, Life, and House Beautiful. The article mentions "Sports Illustrated, Life and House Beautiful" in the first room. The question asks for the fourth. The article doesn't mention another, so N/A.

Question 6: The ideal social order coined in the 1950s represented by Mapplethorpe's work. The article states the American dream started as an ideal social order in the 1930s, then in the 1950s it was materialistic. The question says the 1950s ideal was the term, but the term was coined earlier. The name of the concept is the American dream. The answer is American dream.

Question 7: The profession of the anonymous individual in a 19th-century image next to Chief Keokuk's studio portrait. The article mentions 19th-century documentary images of urban street sweepers and newsboys alongside studio portraits. So the profession is street sweeper or newsboy. The question asks for the profession, so either is acceptable. The answer would be street sweeper or newsboy. The article lists both, but the question asks for the profession depicted. Since it's one of them, maybe either is correct. The question says "the anonymous individual" so likely one of the two. The answer is street sweepers/newsboys, but the question might expect one. The article says "documentary images of anonymous urban street sweepers and newsboys" so the answer could be street sweeper or newsboy. Since it's one, but the question might require both. The question says "the profession", so maybe street sweeper or newsboy. Let's pick street sweepers as one example.

Question 8: The transportation used by Boom and Rooseboom to reach MoMA. The article says they traveled as much as possible on buses and trains to get a ground view. The question says during research trips to reach MoMA. So the answer is buses and trains.

Question 9: The item worn by the Harlem man in 1938 that was also in Henry Fitz's daguerreotype. Henry Fitz's self-portrait is a daguerreotype, so maybe he wore something like a bow tie or a hat. The Harlem man has a bow tie. The article mentions "Harlem man in a three piece tuxedo and bow tie". Henry Fitz's self-portrait from 1840 might have a bow tie. The question asks for the specific item. The answer is bow tie.

Question 10: The studio that produced "The Scourged Back". The article says the image was taken by McPherson & Oliver's studio. So the answer is McPherson & Oliver.

Question 11: The collector who donated over 170 photos. The article mentions Peter J. Cohen donated over 170. So his name is Peter J. Cohen.

Question 12: Years the museum has been collecting. The article says started 17 years ago. Current year isn't given, but the question asks for the duration, which is 17 years.

Question 13: Photographer of the parade in Hoboken. Robert Frank's "The Americans" has that photo. So answer is Robert Frank.

Question 14: The fourth magazine. The first three are Sports Illustrated, Life, House Beautiful. The question asks for the fourth paired with Life and House Beautiful. The article only lists those three, so N/A.

Question 15: The early photography form referenced. The article talks about daguerreotype as the earliest, so answer is daguerreotype.

Question 16: Number of individual photos in Rijksmuseum's collection. The article states 7,500 individual photographs and 1,500 photo books. So 7,500.

Question 17: The central theme. The article's central theme is the tension between American self-image and reality, which is the American dream's evolution. The overarching concept is the American dream.

Question 18: The portrait with grizzly bear claws. Chief Keokuk's by Thomas M. Easterly.

Question 19: The curator who remarked on photography's practicality. The article says Rooseboom mentioned affordability and utility. "Rooseboom said, 'America is much bigger...' photography was a useful medium..." So answer is Hans Rooseboom.

Question 20: Title of the image of the scars. The title given is "The Scourged Back".
