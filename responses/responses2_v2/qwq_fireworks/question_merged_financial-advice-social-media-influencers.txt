Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I'm only using the information given and not relying on any outside knowledge. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks for the total amount of reported fraud from fake investment opportunities on social media for the entire year of 2023, given that the FTC reported $350 million for the first half. The article mentions that in the first half of 2023, the FTC reported nearly $350 million in fraud. But the question is about the entire year. Since the article doesn't provide the full-year data, I can't calculate it. So the answer is N/A.

2. The second question is about a finfluencer who endorsed a cryptocurrency lender (like BlockFi) and later settled a lawsuit related to his promotions, causing losses for an investor who spent 32k pounds. From the article, Kevin Paffrath is mentioned as promoting BlockFi, and there's a lawsuit against him related to FTX. The investor Amy Ryan lost money following his advice. So the answer should be Kevin Paffrath.

3. The third question asks for the investor from Wales who panicked in April 2020 and later lost money after buying the "Stocks and Psychology" course. The article clearly mentions Amy Ryan from Wales. So that's her.

4. The fourth question is about the individual who admitted losing money on BlockFi and assured fans about his ethics. The article states that Kevin Paffrath admitted losing $433k of his own money on BlockFi. So again, Kevin Paffrath.

5. The fifth question is about the Santa Clara University law professor warning investors could lose everything. The article cites Sue S. Guan as the professor. So Sue S. Guan.

6. The sixth question asks which social media service warns about 'get-rich-quick' schemes. The article says YouTube warned viewers about such schemes. So YouTube.

7. The seventh question is about the academic from Oxford and Luxembourg recommending brand accountability and platform content removal. The article mentions Felix Pflucke. Correct.

8. The eighth question is about the Brooklyn financial planner warning about career-ending false claims. The article mentions Landon Tan. Yes.

9. The ninth question refers to a former trader who lost life savings on FTX and joined lawsuits. Sunil Kavuri is the one mentioned. Correct.

10. The tenth question asks which body fined a brokerage $850k for influencer posts. The article states FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority). So FINRA.

11. The eleventh question is about the investor who publicly warned others. The article ends with Amy Ryan doing so. So Amy Ryan again.

I need to make sure each answer is directly from the text. Let me check again for each:

1. N/A because only first half data given.

2. Kevin Paffrath.

3. Amy Ryan.

4. Kevin Paffrath.

5. Sue S. Guan.

6. YouTube.

7. Felix Pflucke.

8. Landon Tan.

9. Sunil Kavuri.

10. FINRA.

11. Amy Ryan.

All answers are directly from the article. I don't see any that require inference beyond what's stated. The only possible issue is question 1, which asks for the entire year's total. Since the article doesn't provide the full year's number, it's N/A. The rest are all explicitly mentioned.
