Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked and avoid making assumptions beyond the text.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions that Musk's new role in the Trump administration includes the Department of Government Efficiency, but there's no specific percentage mentioned about reallocating NASA's $4 billion contract. So, answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The second air traffic controller mentioned debris "outside of the protected areas". The specific type isn't stated; the article only refers to "debris" generally. So, N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The explosion happened at 90 miles altitude and 13,250 mph. To find time, use distance/speed. Convert 90 miles to feet or keep in miles. Time = 90 / 13,250 ≈ 0.0068 hours, which is ~0.4 minutes. But the article doesn't give exact time, so N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Todd Harrison talked about potential FAA demands like launch time or flight path restrictions, but no specific protocol name is mentioned. So, N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Blue Origin's launch on Thursday was their first orbital with New Glenn. The article doesn't state payload tonnage for either company that day. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The FAA's investigation is about debris outside protected areas, but no specific regulation name is cited by Tim Farrar. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The first controller's warning mentioned debris but didn't specify weight. The article states the Starship weighed "somewhat more than 100 tons" when it blew up. Maybe that's the answer? The question asks for the estimated weight prompting the warning. The 100 tons is mentioned, so maybe 100 tons?

8. **Question 8:** Musk's post on X said "pushing next launch past next month", so the proposed date is "next month", but the question asks for a specific date. Since it's vague, N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The altitude was 90 miles. The atmosphere's layers: the Kármán line is ~62 miles (100 km) for space. So above that is exosphere, but debris burning typically happens in the mesosphere or thermosphere. The article doesn't mention the layer, so N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The article says Blue Origin's launch at 2am minimized interference, but no numbers on how many fewer flights would be affected. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** 90 miles to feet. 1 mile = 5280 feet. 90 * 5280 = 475,200 feet. The question says "convert using standard rate", so this is the answer.

12. **Question 12:** The company launching New Glenn from Cape Canaveral is Blue Origin.

13. **Question 13:** The agency with radio communications in Puerto Rico is the FAA, which is overseeing the investigation.

14. **Question 14:** The article states the Starship's mass without fuel is approximately 100 tons.

15. **Question 15:** Blue Origin's launch time was 2:03 a.m.

16. **Question 16:** NASA has over $4 billion in contracts with SpaceX for lunar landings.

17. **Question 17:** The executive is Todd Harrison from the America Enterprise Institute.

18. **Question 18:** The mishap was the seventh Starship test flight.

19. **Question 19:** The speed was 13,250 mph as the second stage separated.

20. **Question 20:** Musk mentioned the next launch wouldn't be pushed past next month, so the timeframe is "next month".

Wait, let me check each again:

1. N/A – article doesn’t mention reallocation percentages.
2. Debris type not specified beyond "debris".
3. Calculation possible but article doesn't provide time, so N/A.
4. No specific protocol named by Harrison.
5. No tonnage data for Blue Origin's payload that day.
6. No regulation name cited.
7. The 100 tons is the spacecraft's mass without fuel, but the question asks for debris weight prompting the warning. The article says "weigh somewhat more than 100 tons when it blew up". The debris that fell would be part of that, but the exact weight isn't given. The first controller's warning just mentions debris, not weight. So maybe N/A? Or is 100 tons acceptable? The question says "estimated weight of the debris mentioned by the first air traffic controller". The controller didn't mention weight, so N/A.
8. The date isn't specific, so N/A.
9. No atmospheric layer named.
10. No number given.
11. 90 miles to feet is 475,200.
12. Blue Origin.
13. FAA.
14. 100 tons.
15. 2:03 a.m.
16. $4 billion.
17. Todd Harrison.
18. 7th.
19. 13,250 mph.
20. "next month" as per Musk's comment, so the timeframe is "next month".

So correcting a few:

For question 7, the answer is N/A because the controller didn't specify the weight. The 100 tons is the spacecraft's mass, but the debris's weight isn't stated.
