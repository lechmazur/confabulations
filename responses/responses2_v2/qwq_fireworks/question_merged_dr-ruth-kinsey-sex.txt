Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer strictly based on that. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions Dr. Ruth's daily planners had entries like "phone call with Oprah," "meeting with Kissinger," and "go on Arsenio Hall." The question asks which talk show host she met for tennis matches. Wait, the entry says "meeting with Kissinger," but Henry Kissinger was a politician, not a talk show host. The others listed are Oprah (Oprah Winfrey) and Arsenio Hall. The article doesn't mention tennis matches, so maybe it's a trick. The question might be incorrect. Since the article says "phone call with Oprah," "meeting with Kissinger," and "go on Arsenio Hall," perhaps the answer is Arsenio Hall? But the question specifies "tennis matches," which isn't mentioned. Hmm, maybe it's a mistake. Since the article doesn't say she met with any host for tennis, the answer might be N/A. Wait, but the question says "according to her 1990s daily planners" which lists "meeting with Kissinger" but not tennis. So I think it's N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The article states she had "hundreds of turtle figures -- including at least one pair locked in the throes of what Dr. Ruth... might have called 'terrific sex.'" The question asks how many boxes of turtles the Kinsey initially cataloged before finding the engaged ones. The article mentions 31 boxes were taken initially, then 35 more. But the turtles are part of her collection, but the article doesn't specify boxes of turtles. The Kinsey took 31 boxes first, but the turtle count isn't broken down into boxes. So answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The article says "after a radio executive heard her give a talk, she started 'Sexually Speaking'..." but doesn't name the executive. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The article mentions in 2011 she worked with Nate Berkus to declutter. So the decade is 2010s. The question asks the decade of the first major declutter with celebrity (Nate Berkus). So 2010s.

5. **Question 5**: The pink settee had items like an ancient-Egyptian statuette with an erection. The question asks what was inscribed on the settee. The article doesn't mention any inscription on the settee itself, just that it was heaped with items. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The article says Dr. Ruth once said skiers make the best lovers because "they take a risk and wiggle their behinds." So the theory is about skiing and romantic prowess. The exact name isn't given, so answer is N/A unless we can infer. The question asks for the name of the theory she developed. Since it's her statement, maybe the answer is N/A as there's no named theory mentioned.

7. **Question 7**: The article says in 2023, Indiana Republicans voted to strip all state funding. The Kinsey's annual budget is $3M, but none comes from state funds. So the total lost would be whatever was previously state-funded, but the article doesn't specify the amount. It just says "all state funding," but the answer requires the monetary value. Since the article doesn't state the exact figure, answer is N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Dr. Ruth was part of the Kindertransport, which rescued children. The article mentions she transcribed a list of Kindertransport children's names. But how many did she help rescue? The article says she was on the train to Switzerland at 10, so she was a rescued child herself. The question is about how many she helped rescue, which the article doesn't mention. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The article mentions her work at Planned Parenthood but doesn't name any specific research paper. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The turtle metaphor isn't linked to a specific anthropologist. The article mentions Helen Fisher, an anthropologist at Kinsey, but no collaboration on turtles. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The article says the Kinsey took 31 boxes initially but doesn't mention the size of the boxes. So N/A.

12. **Question 12**: The article mentions she worked with Nate Berkus in 2011, but how many meetings? It just says "started working," so no number given. N/A.

13. **Question 13**: The study had "Sex as a Sublimation for Tennis: From the Secret Writings of Freud" next to "Judaism on Pleasure." Joel didn't know she wrote some books, but the question is about the title next to it. The answer is "Sex as a Sublimation for Tennis: From the Secret Writings of Freud."

14. **Question 14**: Besides the Kindertransport list, Fasman described the transcription of the Kindertransport list as "beautiful." The question asks for another document related to her early life. The article doesn't mention another document, so N/A. Wait, the Kindertransport list is the main one. Maybe the question is a trick, but the answer is N/A because the only other mentioned is the list itself.

15. **Question 15**: Dr. Ruth covered stuff with sheets, calling it a "ski hill." The item is sheets. The answer is "sheets."

16. **Question 16**: The Library of Congress acquired letters in 2022. Discussions with Kinsey started in 2023. So prior to that, the year with Library of Congress was 2022.

17. **Question 17**: The article says a caregiver was hired after her stroke, but doesn't name the caregiver. So N/A.

18. **Question 18**: The statuette is described as "ancient-Egyptian-style statuette with an impressive erection." The title is "ancient-Egyptian-style statuette with an impressive erection," but the question asks for the specific type. The answer is "ancient-Egyptian-style statuette with an impressive erection."

19. **Question 19**: The legislator who accused Kinsey of hiding child predators is mentioned as "one representative," but the name isn't given. So N/A.

20. **Question 20**: The article doesn't mention the call sign of the radio station for "Sexually Speaking." So N/A.
