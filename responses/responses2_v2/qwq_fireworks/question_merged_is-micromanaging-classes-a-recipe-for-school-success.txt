Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and answer exactly as per the instructions. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks for the percentage of economically disadvantaged students at Thompson Elementary. The article mentions Hilliard Elementary has over 97% economically disadvantaged students, but Thompson isn't specified. Wait, looking again: "At another school, Thompson Elementary, fourth grade students pointed out..." but the percentage isn't given there. So answer is N/A.

2. How many schools voluntarily joined after initial implementation? The article says "more schools were added later or joined voluntarily." But the exact number isn't provided. So N/A.

3. Wheatley High's state rating improvement. The text says Wheatley had consistent F ratings leading to takeover. But after the takeover? The article doesn't mention Wheatley's rating change post-takeover. So N/A.

4. Year when enrollment dropped more in New System schools. The article states "schools in the New Education System saw larger drops last year than others did." The article was written in 2023, so "last year" might refer to 2022. But the exact year isn't specified. The takeover started in 2015, but the system was implemented over two school years. The article mentions "Halfway through the second school year that the new model has been in use" so maybe 2021-2022? But without explicit year, answer N/A.

5. Specific classroom management element at Hilliard. The article mentions "strict behavior policies" like orange cones for bathrooms, but Hilliard's specific element? The article says "disruptive students are removed from the classroom" and "orderly hallways". The cones are mentioned as part of the system, but Hilliard's specific element might be the removal of disruptive students. Alternatively, the countdown timer? Wait, the first paragraph mentions countdown timers in the classroom. The question is about Hilliard. The article says "Posters with school test score data hung on the walls" but not sure. The strict policies include removing students. The answer might be the removal of disruptive students, but the question says "specific element of classroom management". The cones are part of the system but maybe not Hilliard-specific. Hmm. Alternatively, the countdown timer was in the Hilliard example. The first paragraph says the English lesson at Hilliard had the countdown timer. So the specific element could be the countdown timers. But the question asks for "classroom management", which might refer to the cones or removal. Wait, the question says "element of classroom management, criticized for being overly regimented". The cones are mentioned as part of controlling movement. The article states "students were required sometimes to carry orange traffic cones to the bathroom" as part of behavior policies. Since the question is about Hilliard Elementary, but the cones are part of the overall system. Maybe the answer is the orange traffic cones. But the question specifies Hilliard's element. Alternatively, the removal of students? The article says "disruptive students are removed from the classroom" at Hilliard. Not sure. Alternatively, the countdown timer. Since the example starts with that. The question says "specific element... implemented at Hilliard". The first paragraph's example is about the timed lesson with countdown timer. So maybe the countdown timer. But the question is about classroom management, which might include behavior policies. The cones are part of controlling movement, which is classroom management. So maybe the orange cones. The article says "students were required sometimes to carry orange traffic cones to the bathroom, instead of the traditional hall passes, as part of an effort to prevent disorder." That's a specific classroom management element. Since the question is about Hilliard, but the cones are part of the system. The article doesn't specify Hilliard uses cones, but since they're part of the system, maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, the strict removal of students. The article says "disruptive students are removed from the classroom" at Hilliard. But that's a policy, not an element. Hmm. Maybe the answer is "orange traffic cones". I'll go with that.

6. Margin of the bond measure. The bond failed by 58% to 42%. So the margin is 58-42=16% against, but the question asks for the margin of victory. Since it failed, the "margin of victory" would be N/A, but the question might mean the margin by which it failed. The article says "failed by 58 percent to 42 percent." So the margin is 16 percentage points (58-42). So the answer is 16.

7. Other metric besides test scores. The article mentions a pay-for-performance system for teachers and principals, which is contentious. So the answer is "pay-for-performance system".

8. Suggested teaching practice by Amy Poerschke. After observing a math lesson, she suggested the teacher might have paused to explore the idea where two students had different methods. She suggested "Turn and talk to your neighbor: Why are they both right?" So the practice is "turn and talk to your neighbor" or "pair and share". The question says "specific teaching practice". The article mentions "pair and share" when Miles said "I would've liked to see a little bit more of that pair and share." But in the math lesson, the teacher moved on quickly. Poerschke suggested they could have done a turn and talk. So the specific practice is "turn and talk to your neighbor" or "pair and share". The exact wording from the article: Dr. Poerschke said "That could have turned into a 'Turn and talk to your neighbor: Why are they both right?'" So the answer is "turn and talk to your neighbor".

9. Subject with score gains besides math. The article says "Math and reading scores on state standardized tests have risen". So the other subject is reading.

10. Institution Mike Miles founded before his appointment. He founded a charter school network.

11. The countdown timer after login. The teacher set it to one minute for the reading exercise. The initial login was 10 seconds, then she set the timer to one minute. The question says after the 10-second login, she reset it for the reading exercise. The answer is 1 minute (60 seconds), but the question asks for the number shown. The article says "set the timer to one minute, and called out at the 25- and 15-second marks." So the number when reset is 1 minute (60 seconds). The question asks "what number is shown on the countdown timer when the teacher resets it for the reading exercise?" The answer is "60".

12. Road safety item repurposed as hallway pass. Orange traffic cones.

13. Superintendent with military background. Mike Miles.

14. Length of instruction before quiz. The curriculum has math and English teachers spend about 45 minutes on instruction before the quiz. The article states: "Math and English teachers spend about 45 minutes on instruction for each lesson, followed by a quiz."

15. Number of schools implementing the system. The article says "The New Education System is now in use at 130 schools in Houston."

16. Lawmaker who enabled state intervention. Harold V. Dutton Jr.

17. Word used by union rep to describe student perception. "prison" (Michelle Williams said "Children are saying that school is a prison")

18. Subject without federal gains. Reading. The article says "The Houston schools did not make overall gains in reading last year on a federal exam... but it did avoid the national slide in achievement in the subject." Wait, "did not make overall gains" so the answer is reading.

19. Minutes quiz was advanced. The math teacher started the quiz five minutes early, truncating two more problems. So the answer is 5 minutes.

20. Duration for partner sharing. The students took 30 seconds to share answers with a partner before the quiz.
