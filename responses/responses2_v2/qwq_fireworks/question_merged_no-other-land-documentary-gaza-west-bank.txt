Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions beyond that.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions that "such a movie would often find a home with a major streamer, like Max or Netflix." But it says "No Other Land" couldn't find a distributor and ended up self-distributing. The question asks which major streaming platform initially agreed before pulling out. The text doesn't mention any specific platform that agreed then pulled out. It just lists possible ones like Max or Netflix as examples of where it "would often find a home." Since there's no info on any actually agreeing and then pulling out, the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The article states that families moved into caves with what they could salvage, but it doesn't specify how many families. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The text says "most of the major international film festivals programmed it," so it doesn't mention any festivals rejecting it. Therefore, N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The article doesn't mention a specific film critic who championed it first at Berlin. It just says it won awards there, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** No budget figures are provided in the article. Answer N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The article doesn't mention the hours of raw footage collected. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The text doesn't mention any humanitarian organization funding the collaboration. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** There's no data on viewership ratings compared to other documentaries. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The article doesn't name any Israeli military commander interviewed. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The text doesn't mention an alternative location proposed by Israeli authorities. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The Palestinian directors are named as Basel Adra and Hamdan Ballal. The question specifies the one who documented family archival footage. The article says "archival footage from Adra's family," so Basel Adra is the answer.

12. **Question 12:** The article mentions "Max or Netflix" as examples of major streamers that typically take such films, but "No Other Land" couldn't find a distributor. It doesn't say which one declined it, so N/A.

13. **Question 13:** The film covers from 2019 to 2023, which is 4 years. The question includes both original and archival footage. The article says "between 2019 and 2023 and in archival footage from Adra's family." The time frame is 5 years (2019-2023 inclusive?), but the exact number isn't specified. Wait, 2019 to 2023 is 4 years (2019,2020,2021,2022). But maybe including 2023? The article says "between 2019 and 2023," so that's four years. But the archival footage is from Adra's family, which might be prior. The question asks how many consecutive years of demolitions are shown, including both original and archival. The article doesn't specify the duration covered by the archival footage. Since the main period is 2019-2023 (5 years?), but the exact count isn't given. The article says "repeated demolitions" over the years shown, but without exact years, it's N/A. Wait, maybe the original footage is from 2019-2023 (4 years?), and the archival is from before, but the question is about consecutive years in the film. The article doesn't state the total consecutive years, so N/A.

14. **Question 14:** The friction includes that Abraham can travel freely while Adra cannot. So the restriction is Adra's inability to travel freely, contrasting with Abraham's freedom. The answer is that Yuval Abraham can travel freely, so the restriction is Adra's restricted mobility. The question asks what restriction Yuval faces? Wait, the question says "what specific restriction does Yuval Abraham face that creates tension with Basel Adra..." Wait, actually the article states "Abraham can travel freely around the country, while Adra cannot." So Yuval doesn't have a restriction; Adra does. The question is phrased wrong. Since the question is about Yuval's restriction, but the article says he can travel freely, so the answer would be N/A because Yuval doesn't have that restriction. Wait, but maybe I misread. Let me check again. The article says: "friction points emerge in Adra and Abraham's relationship -- for instance, Abraham can travel freely around the country, while Adra cannot -- and this strain starts to build a lucid picture of frustration for both men." So Yuval can travel freely; the restriction is on Adra. The question asks what restriction Yuval faces, which he doesn't. Therefore, the answer is N/A because the question is incorrect, so answer N/A.

15. **Question 15:** The film won both the top documentary award and the audience award at Berlin. The question asks which award is typically associated with mainstream audience appeal. The audience award is for mainstream, so the answer is the audience award.

16. **Question 16:** The article says they self-distributed after failing to find a U.S. deal. The question asks what alternative method they used, which mirrors other controversial docs. The article mentions "producers eventually opted to self-distribute" and mentions "Union" and "The Last Republican" as other films in similar situations. So the answer is self-distribution.

17. **Question 17:** The article says "many families had moved into underground caves with whatever they could salvage." It doesn't specify a demographic group like children or elderly, just families. So N/A unless "families" is acceptable, but the question asks for a specific group like "children" or "elderly," but the text doesn't specify. Answer N/A.

18. **Question 18:** The legal justification given by Israeli forces is that the area is needed for a live-fire military training ground. The article states "Israeli forces, which claim the area is needed for a live-fire military training ground." So the answer is that it's a military training zone.

19. **Question 19:** The article says distributors favor "biographical portraits of musicians or true-crime stories." So the genre overshadowing is those genres, so the answer is biographical portraits of musicians and true-crime stories. But the question asks for the genre that has overshadowed politically challenging films, so the answer is those genres. The question might want one term, but the article lists both as favored. Maybe combine them: "biographical portraits of musicians or true-crime stories."

20. **Question 20:** The article mentions the film's timeline up to 2023 and the release challenges, but doesn't link a specific 2023 event causing distributors to avoid it. It just says they couldn't find a distributor, possibly due to political climate, but no specific event is named. So N/A.
