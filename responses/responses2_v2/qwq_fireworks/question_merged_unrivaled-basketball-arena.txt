Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I don't use any outside knowledge and only the information given in the text.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which former WNBA MVP declined to participate due to overseas commitments. The article mentions that A'ja Wilson (three-time MVP) and Caitlin Clark (2024 rookie of the year) are not participating. Since A'ja Wilson is a former MVP, that's the answer. The reason given is they play overseas during the WNBA off-season, so scheduling conflicts fit here.

2. **Question 2:** The rail camera's minutes captured per match. The article says there's a rail camera that runs the length of the court, but it doesn't specify how many minutes of footage. The total game time is an hour, so maybe the camera runs the whole time? But the question is about the footage captured by the rail camera specifically. Since it's not stated, I'll go with N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Equity stake percentage per player. The article says players get equity stakes but doesn't mention the exact percentage. So N/A here.

4. **Question 4:** Streaming platform with exclusive rights. The article mentions Warner Bros. Discovery has an exclusive media rights deal and games are streamed on Max. So Max is the answer.

5. **Question 5:** Construction cost of the arena. The text doesn't mention the cost, only the size (23,000 sq ft). So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Breanna Stewart's personal sponsorship deals. The article lists sponsors but doesn't say how many Stewart negotiated. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Minimum salary requirement. The article states players get a higher salary than in the WNBA season, but no specific figure is given. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Former NBA player as head of player development. The text doesn't mention anyone in that role. The commissioner is Micky Lawler, and others like Carmelo Anthony are investors. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Tech innovations for Max subscribers. The article talks about 18 cameras, rail camera, and social media highlights. But specifically for Max subscribers? It mentions streaming on Max but not unique tech for them. Maybe the rail camera and on-site services? The article says "social media team will be on standby with additional hand-held cameras to create highlight reels," which might be for streaming platforms. But the question is about technological innovations in the arena's design. The rail camera and camera placements are part of that. But the answer should be directly from the text. The article mentions the rail camera and proximity of cameras. Since the question is about what was implemented for Max, maybe the answer is the rail camera and other camera systems. But the article doesn't specify Max's tech. Hmm, maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "about 18 cameras will be focused on the game, including a rail camera..." which is part of the arena's design. The answer might be the rail camera system and proximity cameras. But the question is about innovations for Max subscribers. Since the article doesn't explicitly link them, maybe N/A? Or maybe the rail camera is part of it. The text says "the social media team will be on standby with additional hand-held cameras to create highlight reels." Not sure if that's a tech innovation for Max. I'll go with N/A since it's not explicitly stated for Max.

10. **Question 10:** Number of funding rounds before the $35M. The article only mentions the $35M announced in December, not prior rounds. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Compare total players in Unrivaled to WNBA average. Unrivaled has 6 teams with 6 players each = 36. WNBA teams average around 12 players (as per common knowledge, but the article doesn't specify). The question says "given the league's structure" so maybe the article states the average? Wait, the article says "the league's structure of six teams with six players each." But the question is comparing to the average WNBA team's roster size. The article doesn't provide WNBA's average, so without that number, we can't compare. So N/A.
