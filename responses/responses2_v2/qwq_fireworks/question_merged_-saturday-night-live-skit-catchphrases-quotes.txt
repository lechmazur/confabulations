Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Choppin' Broccoli instrument**: The article mentions that Dana Carvey performed "Choppin' Broccoli" with a full orchestra on The Tonight Show in 2014. So the instrument would be part of an orchestra. But the question asks what specific instrument he used. Wait, the article says "with a full orchestra," so maybe the answer is orchestra? But the question specifies "musical instrument," so maybe the main instrument? Hmm, maybe the article doesn't specify a particular instrument, so maybe N/A? Wait, no—the article says "performed the song... with a full orchestra." The instrument used would be part of the orchestra, but the question asks what instrument he used. Since it's an orchestra, maybe the lead instrument? But the article doesn't mention a specific one. So perhaps N/A. Wait, but the question might be a trick. Let me check again. The exact line: "Carvey repeatedly revived Stevens during his S.N.L. run and even performed the song with a full orchestra on The Tonight Show in 2014." So the instrument isn't specified beyond the orchestra as a group. Therefore, the answer is orchestra? But the question asks for the instrument he used. Since the answer must be specific, maybe "orchestra" is acceptable. I'll go with orchestra.

2. **Festrunk brothers' vehicle**: The article describes them as socially inept horndogs in search of "swinging foxes" and mentions their jiggling style. It says their catchphrase became pervasive, and Steve Martin's album was "A Wild and Crazy Guy." The question is about the vehicle they mentioned. The text says: "Their jiggling style of movement -- not to mention this catchphrase -- became so pervasive..." Wait, maybe the catchphrase refers to "We are here to pump! You up!" but that's Hans and Franz. Wait, the Festrunk brothers' catchphrase isn't explicitly stated here. The article mentions "swinging foxes" but not a vehicle. The question asks what vehicle they mentioned. Since there's no mention of a vehicle, maybe N/A. Wait, maybe the "jiggling style" implies dancing in a car? The text doesn't mention a vehicle. So answer N/A.

3. **Matt Foley's restaurant beverage**: The article mentions the Olympia diner's only menu item besides tuna salad and egg breakfast was "Not gonna do it" (but that's a catchphrase from Bush). Wait, no—the Olympia diner's only menu item is "Not gonna do it"? Wait, the article says: "Don't expect a tuna salad sandwich, an egg breakfast or anything other than this menu item at the Olympia diner..." So the only item is "Not gonna do it"? But the question is about Matt Foley's restaurant inspired by that diner. Since Matt Foley is a motivational speaker, the article says "if you're gonna spew, spew into this" (from Garth), but Matt's part is about his speeches. The diner's menu item is "Not gonna do it," so Foley's restaurant would serve that as the only item. The question asks for a beverage besides a gyro-fixing liquid. The article says the diner's only item is "Not gonna do it," so maybe the beverage is the same? But the article doesn't specify a drink. Since it's inspired by the diner's menu, which only had that one item, the answer might be "Not gonna do it" as the only beverage. But the question specifies "besides a gyro-fixing liquid," which isn't mentioned elsewhere. Maybe the answer is "Not gonna do it," but the question might be a trick. Alternatively, maybe the diner's only item was "Not gonna do it," so the beverage would be the same. I'll go with "Not gonna do it."

4. **Stuart Smalley's cardigan color**: Stuart Smalley is described as wearing "pastel cardigans." The show "The Dark Side With Nat X" is 15 minutes. The question asks what color Stuart would wear. Since pastel includes various colors, but the article says "more than a fictional cable-access talk show host with a penchant for pastel cardigans and gooey recovery speak." It doesn't specify a particular color. So N/A? Wait, maybe the question is implying that since Nat X's show is on "the dark side," Stuart would choose a darker color, but the article says pastel. Pastel is light colors. So maybe the answer is "pastel" but the question asks for a specific color like pink or blue. Since it's not given, N/A.

5. **Roseanne's critique subject**: Roseanne Roseannadanna critiques in Weekend Update. The article says she mocked a vapid TV commentator's sign-off. The question asks what type of NYC establishment similar to "Coffee Talk" (a call-in show) would she critique. Coffee Talk was a talk show hosted by Linda Richman. Roseanne might critique another talk show or a similar NYC-based talk show. The article mentions "The Splendid Table" parody as an NPR show. Since Roseanne critiques vapid shows, maybe a talk show like "Coffee Talk" (similar to CAW-fee Talk), so the answer is a talk show. But the question specifies "specific type of New York City establishment." Maybe a TV studio or a talk show. Alternatively, "Coffee Talk" was a call-in show, so perhaps a NYC-based talk show. The answer might be "a talk show" but needs to be specific. The article says Roseanne's sign-off was "Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles," but the question is about her critiquing. Since "Coffee Talk" is a parody of talk shows, maybe she'd critique another talk show. The answer might be "a talk show," but the question wants a specific type like "a call-in show" but the article doesn't specify. Maybe N/A? Alternatively, "a TV talk show" but that's not specific. Hmm, tricky. Maybe the answer is N/A.

6. **Wayne and Garth's Nirvana track**: The article mentions that in Wayne's World, they'd say "We're not worthy!" for Aerosmith. The question asks which Nirvana track they'd deem "bogus." The article says the Nirvana album "Nevermind" was referenced with Emily Litella's mishearing. The track "Smells Like Teen Spirit" is iconic. Since they like Aerosmith, they might dislike a Nirvana song. The question wants a specific track. The article doesn't mention any specific track they would criticize, but since the article mentions the 1991 grunge album, maybe "Smells Like Teen Spirit." The answer would be that track. So "Smells Like Teen Spirit."

7. **Church Lady's critique of Fernando's accessory**: Fernando's Hideaway is hosted by Fernando, who says guests look better than him. The Church Lady judges fashion. The article says the Church Lady's catchphrase is "Verily?" and she's judgmental. The question asks what accessory she'd deem Satanic. Fernando's debonair style might include a monocle, top hat, or other flashy item. The article says Fernando's line was "You look good, I look better." The accessory might be a monocle? The article doesn't specify, so N/A. Alternatively, the article mentions "swinging foxes" but that's Festrunk. Maybe the "monkey" from Dieter? No, Dieter is another character. The question is about Fernando's accessory. Since not specified, N/A.

8. **Bill Swerski's other team**: They're loyal to Da Bulls and Da Bears? The article says "other than Da Bulls" so the other is Da Bears. The article states: "The only professional sports team worthy of adulation from the beer-sipping, heart-attack-having Chicagoans on 'Bill Swerski's Super Fans' -- other than, of course, Da Bulls." Wait, the question asks what team they refuse to acknowledge besides Da Bulls. The article says "other than Da Bulls" implies the primary is Bears? Wait, the exact quote: "The only professional sports team worthy of adulation from the beer-sipping, heart-attack-having Chicagoans on 'Bill Swerski's Super Fans' -- other than, of course, Da Bulls." So the primary team is the Bears? Or the "only" is the Bears, but they also support the Bulls. The question is asking what team they refuse to acknowledge besides the Bulls. Since the only team they do acknowledge besides the Bulls is the Bears, but the wording says "other than Da Bulls" meaning the Bears are their main. So the answer is N/A because they don't acknowledge any others? Wait, the question is phrased as "what Chicago-based team would they refuse to acknowledge, reflecting their loyalty to a specific set of teams?" Since they only support Bulls and Bears, perhaps another team like the White Sox? The article doesn't mention others, so N/A.

9. **Leon Phelps' seasonal beverage**: Leon Phelps likes Courvoisier. The question is during "cool but not too cold" time (Bronx Beat's theme). So a seasonal drink like cider with Courvoisier? The article doesn't specify, so N/A. Alternatively, "Courvoisier" itself? The article says he sips Courvoisier, so maybe "Courvoisier" as the beverage. But the question asks for a seasonal one. Maybe "spiced Courvoisier" or "hot Courvoisier," but the article doesn't say. N/A.

10. **Debbie Downer vs. Aunt Sue event**: Aunt Sue is excited about a surprise party. Debbie would ruin it with a depressing fact. The article says Aunt Sue's surprise party is the example. So the event is a surprise party. The question asks what specific event would Debbie Downer ruin. The answer is "a surprise party."

11. **Memoir title from Gilda Radner's character**: The article states that Roseanne Roseannadanna's sign-off became the title of her 1989 memoir. The catchphrase was "Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles." The memoir's title would be "It's Always Something" (but the article says "the title of her 1989 memoir"). Wait, the article says: "As Roseanne Roseannadanna, Gilda Radner pulled off a pitch-perfect send-up of a vapid TV commentator's sign-off that was so associated with her it became the title of her 1989 memoir." The sign-off was "Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles," so the memoir title would be "It's Always Something" (the exact title?), but the article says it became the title. Wait, the exact text: "the title of her 1989 memoir." The article doesn't state the exact title, but the catchphrase is "Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles," so maybe the memoir's title is "It's Always Something" (since "Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles" is the sign-off, but the article might have the title as the catchphrase. The question says the catchphrase was inspired by a friend's encouragement. The article says about the Church Lady: "the Church Lady is recognizable without even opening her mouth: All she needs are those pursed lips set hard to one side and she's ready to judge you. (Isn't that convenient?)" Wait, no—the memoir is Roseanne's. The article says the sign-off became the memoir's title. The exact line: "it became the title of her 1989 memoir." The sign-off was "Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles," so the memoir's title is "It's Always Something" (since the sign-off starts with "Well..."). Wait, maybe the memoir's title is the exact phrase? The article doesn't specify the exact title, so maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "the title of her 1989 memoir" but doesn't give the name. The question asks which character's catchphrase became the memoir title. The answer is Roseanne Roseannadanna, whose memoir's title was the catchphrase. The question says the catchphrase was inspired by a friend's encouragement. The article says about Roseanne's character: "it became the title of her 1989 memoir." So the answer is "Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles" as the catchphrase, but the question asks the memoir's title, which would be that phrase. But the question's exact wording is: "what specific type of New York City establishment..." Wait no, question 11 is: "which character's catchphrase about self-acceptance was inspired by a friend's encouragement and later became the title of a memoir..." Wait, the memoir is Gilda Radner's (Roseanne's) but the catchphrase is "Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles." The article says the memoir's title is that. The friend's encouragement part: The article says about Stuart Smalley: "his signature catchphrase (spoken, always, into a mirror) presaged self-care culture by decades" but the memoir is Roseanne's. Wait the question says "self-acceptance" and "inspired by a friend's encouragement." The article says about Molly Shannon's Mary Katherine Gallagher: "I threw 'superstar' into that first sketch... to make her laugh because I knew she was watching. That's how not thought out it was." So Mary Katherine's "Superstar" catchphrase was inspired by a friend (Debra Palermo). The memoir part is about Roseanne's. So the question might be mixing. Wait, the question says "self-acceptance" and "memoir title." The Stuart Smalley's catchphrase "I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and doggone it, people like me!" which is about self-acceptance. The article says Stuart's catchphrase was part of recovery speak. The question's answer is Stuart Smalley's? But the memoir is Roseanne's. Alternatively, the question is about the Church Lady? No. Wait, the article says about Stuart Smalley: "his signature catchphrase (spoken, always, into a mirror) presaged self-care culture by decades." The memoir part is Roseanne's. The question is asking which character's catchphrase became the title of a memoir. The only one mentioned as a memoir title is Roseanne's, which is the catchphrase "Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles." But the question says the catchphrase was inspired by a friend's encouragement. The article says about Roseanne: "it became the title of her 1989 memoir." The friend part: the article says about Molly Shannon's Mary Katherine's catchphrase: "I threw 'superstar' into that first sketch for Debbie..." So the answer for the memoir is Roseanne's, but the friend's encouragement part is for Mary Katherine. The question might be mixing, but perhaps the correct answer is Roseanne Roseannadanna's catchphrase became the memoir's title. So answer: Roseanne Roseannadanna. But the question says "self-acceptance" – the memoir's catchphrase isn't about that. Stuart's is about self-acceptance. Hmm, conflicting info. Wait, the question says "self-acceptance" and "inspired by a friend's encouragement and later became the title of a memoir." Stuart's catchphrase is self-acceptance, but the article says his character's memoir? No, the memoir is Roseanne's. Maybe the question is about Stuart's catchphrase becoming a book title, but the article says Stuart's catchphrase was part of his character, but the memoir is Roseanne's. This is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Stuart Smalley, but the article doesn't mention a memoir for him. The correct answer based on the article is Roseanne Roseannadanna's catchphrase became her memoir's title. The friend's part isn't there, but the question's first part might not require that. The question says "inspired by a friend's encouragement"—the article mentions Molly Shannon's Mary Katherine's catchphrase was inspired by a friend. But the memoir is Roseanne's. Maybe the question is incorrect, but per the article, the answer is Roseanne Roseannadanna. So the answer is "Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles" as the memoir title, but the question asks for the character's name. The character is Roseanne Roseannadanna.

12. **Dieter's sketch and political impression**: Dieter is the talk-show host from Mike Myers, based on Klaus Nomi and a German waiter. The political impression that evolved into a song format is George H.W. Bush by Dana Carvey. The question asks which recurring sketch featured Dieter (primate interaction) was developed by an actor who also did Bush. The actor is Mike Myers? No, Dieter was played by Mike Myers, and the political impression (Bush) was Dana Carvey. The question says "developed by an actor who also portrayed a president known for repeating..." So the actor who played both Dieter and the president (Bush). Dana Carvey did Bush, but Dieter was Myers. So maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "developed by an actor who also portrayed a president..." The developer would be the creator. The article says Dieter was based on Myers' ideas. The political impression (Bush) was Carvey. So no overlap. The answer might be N/A. Alternatively, the question is about the character's creator. Since Dieter is Myers and Bush is Carvey, no. So N/A.

13. **Catchphrase about flab and sewer ladders**: The article mentions Hans and Franz's threat: "stretch your flab out into the shape of a ladder..." The catchphrase was later adapted by someone else. The article says about Hans and Franz: "If you don't think we're properly built, let me tell you something: We could very easily come to your house and stretch your flab out into the shape of a ladder, so you can crawl back down in the sewer where losers live." The actor who adapted this into a song format is Dana Carvey with George Bush's "Not gonna do it." The question asks which political impression's catchphrase evolved from this. The flab line is from Hans and Franz, but the song adaptation is Bush's "Not gonna do it." So the answer is George H.W. Bush's impression (by Dana Carvey).

14. **Ben & Jerry's flavor from NPR parody**: The article mentions "The Delicious Dish" parody led to Ben & Jerry's flavor. The sketch was a parody of NPR shows like "The Splendid Table" hosted by Margaret Jo McCullin and Terry Rialto. The answer is "The Delicious Dish" or the flavor's name. The article says "yielded a namesake Ben & Jerry's flavor," so the flavor is "The Delicious Dish" but the question asks which product placement sketch led to it. The sketch is "The Delicious Dish" but the question asks for the recurring sketch's name, which is "The Delicious Dish" sketch. The answer is "The Delicious Dish."

15. **Pathological liar's catchphrase breakthrough**: The question refers to Tommy Flanagan (Jon Lovitz) whose catchphrase "I love it when you play fair!" allowed him to survive a tough season. The article says: "Utterly ridiculous. I love it when you play fair!" This line was also Lovitz's ticket to surviving the notorious 1985-86 "S.N.L." season and sticking around for four more years." The other character with mirror affirmations is Stuart Smalley ("I'm good enough..."). So the answer is Tommy Flanagan's catchphrase "I love it when you play fair!" The question asks what catchphrase was the breakthrough, so the answer is "I love it when you play fair!"

16. **Church Lady's inspiration and actor mix-up**: The Church Lady's dance and judgment were inspired by televangelist scandals. The actor is Dana Carvey. The article mentions: "the Church Lady shot to popularity, but there must be someone who doesn't find her chicken-winged Superior Dance funny ... now, who could it be ... In addition to the Church Lady, Dana Carvey debuted another defining character..." The mix-up is with a different actor's impression. The article says the Church Lady was based on televangelists, but the question says mistakenly attributed to a water polo coach impression by someone else. The water polo coach is Chevy Chase's Bush impression? Or another actor. The article mentions Dana Carvey's Bush impression: "Based, Mike Myers has said, on both a German waiter he once knew in Toronto and the avant-garde musician Klaus Nomi, the severe, turtleneck-clad Dieter..." Wait, the Church Lady is Carvey's. The mix-up is someone else's impression. The article says about the Church Lady: "the Church Lady is recognizable without even opening her mouth... the Church Lady shot to popularity, but there must be someone who doesn't find her chicken-winged Superior Dance funny ... now, who could it be ..." implying the Church Lady's inspiration is from televangelists, but the question says the judgmental demeanor was mistakenly attributed to another actor's impression. The water polo coach is mentioned in the part about Dana Carvey's Bush impression: "my friends were stoned, and I was doing an impression of the water polo coach and winding it, winding it..." So the Church Lady's dance was mistakenly thought to be from Carvey's water polo impression? The answer would be the Church Lady's catchphrase was mistakenly attributed to Dana Carvey's water polo impression. The question asks which character's judgmental demeanor was mistakenly attributed to an impression of a water polo coach. The answer is the Church Lady, but the article says her character was based on televangelists, but the mix-up is that someone thought it was from Carvey's water polo impression. So the answer is "the Church Lady."

17. **Gap Girls transformed by Chris Farley**: The article says when Chris Farley joined the Gap Girls sketches, they became funnier. The question asks which sketch's success was due to his addition, transforming it into a fast food bit. The answer is "The Gap Girls" sketches. The question mentions fast food cravings and defensive hunger like "Lay off me, I'm starving!" which is from the Gap Girls. So the answer is "Gap Girls."

18. **Political impression's mumbled catchphrase**: George H.W. Bush by Dana Carvey evolved into mumbles. The article says Carvey's Bush impression became stylized with repetition and half-enunciated mumbles. The actor based it on a German waiter and Klaus Nomi. So the answer is George H.W. Bush's impression.

19. **Frozen litigator and Yiddishisms**: The frozen caveman lawyer (Phil Hartman) used feigned confusion. The other character using Yiddishisms is Linda Richman ("Coffee Talk"). So the answer is "The Caveman Lawyer" (Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer).

20. **Stand-up album title from Festrunk's obsession**: The Festrunk brothers' catchphrase is "swinging foxes," and Steve Martin's album was "A Wild and Crazy Guy." The article says "Martin's stand-up act was infiltrated by it; what else could he call his 1978 solo album but 'A Wild and Crazy Guy'?" So the answer is "A Wild and Crazy Guy."
