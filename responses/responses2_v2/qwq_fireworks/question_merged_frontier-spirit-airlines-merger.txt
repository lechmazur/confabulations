Okay, I need to go through each question and answer based strictly on the article provided. Let me start with the first question.

1. What percentage of domestic air travel would the combined entity of Frontier, Spirit, and Hawaiian Airlines control?

The article says Spirit and Frontier together control about 8.5% of domestic air travel. Hawaiian Airlines was acquired by Alaska Airlines in September. The combined Spirit-Frontier would be fifth, leapfrogging Alaska. But the question includes Hawaiian, which is part of Alaska. Since the article states Alaska acquired Hawaiian, adding Hawaiian's share to Spirit and Frontier's 8.5% would require knowing Alaska's percentage. However, the article doesn't mention Alaska's specific percentage. The only data given is that United has 15.9%, and Southwest, American, Delta each over 17%. The article doesn't provide Alaska's exact share, so this is N/A.

2. How many times has William A. Franke's private equity firm initiated bankruptcy proceedings for airlines it controlled?

The article mentions Indigo Partners, Franke's firm, but doesn't say they initiated bankruptcy for any airlines. Indigo owned Spirit from 2006-2013 and has a stake in Frontier. Spirit filed for bankruptcy in November, but that's not stated as initiated by Indigo. So N/A.

3. Considering the Biden administration's stance on corporate deals, what legal strategy did JetBlue likely employ to counter the Justice Department's block of its merger with Spirit?

The article says the Justice Department successfully blocked JetBlue's deal. The Biden admin challenged many deals, but JetBlue's case is already done. The question is about their strategy. The article doesn't mention JetBlue's legal strategy, so N/A.

4. What was the initial dollar amount per share offered by Frontier in the rejected 2024 bid, assuming the total offer was evenly split between stock and cash?

The 2024 offer is $2.1B. The question asks per share, but the article doesn't mention shares outstanding or per share value. So N/A.

5. Which airline, mentioned in the article as having a similar business model to Frontier and Spirit, was acquired by a larger carrier before Spirit filed for bankruptcy?

Alaska Airlines acquired Hawaiian in September. Hawaiian isn't mentioned as having a similar model. The article says Spirit and Frontier have similar models. The only other mention is Indigo's firms. The answer is Alaska? No, the question asks which airline (the one acquired) has similar models. Hawaiian isn't described as such. Wait, maybe not. The article says Alaska acquired Hawaiian, but Hawaiian's model isn't discussed. So N/A.

Wait, the question says "airline... having a similar business model to Frontier and Spirit". The article says Spirit and Frontier have similar models, but the acquired airline would be Hawaiian? The article doesn't say Hawaiian has a similar model. So N/A.

6. What specific Airbus model, beyond the A320 family, does Frontier plan to incorporate into its fleet after a successful merger with Spirit, to enhance long-haul capabilities?

The article says both use Airbus A320 family. There's no mention of other models like A330 or A350. So N/A.

7. In what year did Indigo Partners divest its controlling interest in Frontier, leading to Frontier's subsequent public offering?

Indigo held Spirit 2006-2013, then bought a stake in Frontier. Frontier went public in 2021. The divestment from Spirit was 2013, but the question is about Frontier. The article says Indigo had a controlling interest in Spirit until 2013 when they bought a stake in Frontier. It doesn't say when they divested Frontier's control. So N/A.

8. Besides the $350 million investment condition, what other financial restructuring demand did Frontier place on Spirit's creditors as part of the merger offer?

The article says Frontier placed a condition that Spirit's creditors were unwilling to invest $350M. The question asks for another condition. The text doesn't mention another, so N/A.

9. What percentage of routes currently served by Southwest Airlines would be directly competitive with the combined network of Frontier and Spirit?

The article states Spirit and Frontier overlap on 18% of their routes. But the question is about Southwest's routes overlapping with the merged company. The article doesn't provide that data. N/A.

10. What was the total percentage of domestic air travel market share controlled by United Airlines at the time of the article's publication, according to federal data cited?

The article says United has 15.9%. That's direct. Answer is 15.9%.

11. Which private equity firm's founder serves as Frontier's chairman and previously held a controlling stake in Spirit during its initial public offering?

William Franke is chairman of Frontier's board and founder of Indigo, which owned Spirit until 2013 (when Spirit went public in 2011, so Indigo had controlling stake then). So Indigo. Answer is Indigo Partners.

12. What specific financial condition did JetBlue Airways impose as part of its counteroffer to Spirit in 2022 that ultimately contributed to the deal's collapse?

The article says Spirit walked from the 2022 deal for a higher counteroffer from JetBlue, but the DoJ blocked JetBlue. The question is about JetBlue's condition. The article doesn't specify the financial terms of JetBlue's offer beyond it being higher. So N/A.

13. How many daily flights does the combined Spirit-Frontier entity operate to destinations in Europe, based on the Cirium aviation data mentioned in the article?

The article mentions their combined 1,400 daily flights serve US, Caribbean, Latin America. Europe isn't mentioned. So N/A.

14. Which U.S. president's administration successfully blocked the proposed merger between Frontier and Spirit in 2022, citing antitrust concerns?

Actually, the article says the Justice Department blocked JetBlue's deal, not Frontier-Spirit. The 2022 merger between Spirit and Frontier was walked away from by Spirit for JetBlue's offer, which was then blocked. The question is about the Frontier-Spirit merger in 2022? Wait, the first paragraph says the 2022 merger (Spirit and Frontier) was abandoned when Spirit took JetBlue's offer. The DoJ blocked JetBlue's deal. The Frontier-Spirit 2022 deal didn't get blocked by DoJ; Spirit chose to leave. So the answer is N/A because the question is about the Frontier-Spirit merger being blocked, which wasn't. The correct answer would be the JetBlue deal was blocked by Biden's admin. But the question specifies Frontier-Spirit's 2022 merger. Since they didn't proceed, no block. So N/A.

Wait, the article says "the Justice Department successfully blocked in federal court last year" the JetBlue deal. So the answer for question14 is the Biden administration.

Wait, the question is asking which administration blocked the Frontier-Spirit merger in 2022. But the article says that the 2022 merger between Spirit and Frontier was abandoned by Spirit in favor of JetBlue, which was then blocked. The Frontier-Spirit merger wasn't blocked by DoJ; it was Spirit's choice. So the answer is N/A. The merger wasn't blocked by any admin.

15. What was the exact date scheduled for the bankruptcy court hearing to approve Spirit's restructuring plan before Frontier's renewed merger offer?

The article says the hearing is scheduled for Feb. 13. So answer is February 13.

16. Which consulting firm analyzed the Frontier-Spirit merger proposal and concluded it would generate over $600 million in annual cost savings?

The article says Frontier hired an aviation consulting firm that concluded revenue could rise by at least $500M and costs reduced by at least $100M. The total is $600M, but the question says over $600M in cost savings. The firm isn't named. So N/A.

17. What percentage of overlapping routes between Spirit and Frontier does the article cite as evidence supporting their complementary operational structures?

The article states they overlap on about 18% of their routes. So 18%.

18. Which U.S. budget airline acquired Hawaiian Airlines in September, according to the article's discussion of market share rankings?

The article says Alaska Airlines acquired Hawaiian in September. Alaska isn't a budget airline. The question asks which budget airline. Since the article mentions Alaska as the acquirer, but it's not budget, so N/A. Wait, the article says "Alaska Airlines, which acquired Hawaiian Airlines in September". So the answer is Alaska, but it's not a budget airline. The question might be a trick, but according to the text, the answer is Alaska, but since the question specifies a budget airline, it's N/A. Wait the article says "budget airlines like Spirit and Frontier" but Alaska isn't mentioned as budget. So the correct answer is N/A.
