Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to be careful and make sure I only use the information given, no outside knowledge.

1. The first question asks for the total number of students in the core group that devised the scheme. The article mentions a "core group" of six students, five of whom were charged. So the answer should be 6.

2. The second question is about the other social media platform besides TikTok that inspired the students. The article says they were inspired by "To Catch a Predator" and TikTok. So the answer is "To Catch a Predator" but since it's a TV show, maybe the question wants the platform? Wait, the question specifies "social media platform", so maybe just TikTok and the show. Wait the question says besides TikTok, so the answer is the TV show? Hmm, but the question says "social media platform", but "To Catch a Predator" is a TV show. The article says they were inspired by the show and TikTok. Since the question asks for a platform besides TikTok, but the show isn't a social media platform. Wait, maybe the article says "videos popular on social media" so perhaps the answer is TikTok and the show? Wait the question says besides TikTok, so the other is the show. But the question specifies "social media platform", so maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says "inspired by 'To Catch a Predator,' and videos popular on social media, the complaint said." So the videos on social media (TikTok) and the show. The question is asking for the other platform besides TikTok, but the show isn't a platform. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait no, the question says "social media platform, besides TikTok", but the article mentions the show as inspiration. Since the show isn't a platform, the answer might be N/A. Wait, the question might be referring to the show as the other inspiration, but since it's not a social media platform, the answer would be N/A. Wait the question is phrased as "social media platform, besides TikTok", so the only other is the show, which isn't a platform. Therefore, answer is N/A? Wait the article says "videos popular on social media" so maybe the answer is just TikTok and that's it. Hmm, maybe I need to check again. The article says: "inspired by 'To Catch a Predator,' and videos popular on social media, the complaint said." So the inspiration was both the show and the TikTok videos. Since the question is asking for the other platform besides TikTok, but the show isn't a platform. Therefore, the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "besides TikTok, was cited as inspiration". The other is the TV show, but it's not a social media platform. So the answer must be N/A. Wait no, maybe the question is wrong? The user's instruction says if the question has an incorrect premise, answer N/A. Since the show isn't a social media platform, the question's premise is incorrect, so answer N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "To Catch a Predator" even though it's not a platform. The question might have a mistake, but according to the instructions, if the question's premise is wrong, answer N/A. So I think the answer is N/A here. Wait the user's example says if the question asks about a social media platform and the article mentions the show, then N/A. So answer 2 is N/A.

Wait, but the article says "videos popular on social media", so maybe the answer is TikTok and the show? No, the show is not a platform. The question is asking for another platform besides TikTok, but the article only mentions TikTok as the social media. The TV show is separate. Therefore, answer is N/A.

3. The third question is how much NBC paid in the settlement. The article says NBC reached a settlement with the man's family in 2008 after they filed a $108 million lawsuit. But it doesn't specify the settlement amount. So the answer is N/A because the article doesn't state the amount paid.

4. The fourth question asks the specific branch of the military the victim was in. The article says "active-duty military service member" but doesn't mention which branch. So answer is N/A.

5. The fifth question is about the advocacy group that partnered with NBC. The article says "NBC's relationship with the police and an advocacy group that helped orchestrate the stings." The name isn't given, so answer N/A.

6. The sixth question asks the date the Worcester District Court issued the complaint. The article states "a criminal complaint issued in Worcester District Court on Dec. 4." So the answer is December 4.

7. The seventh question: What object did Kevin Carroll use as a deadly weapon? The article says Kevin Carroll was accused of assault and battery with a deadly weapon, and it mentions he slammed the victim's head into the car door. So the weapon was the car door. But the question is about the object used as a deadly weapon. The answer is car door.

8. The eighth question: How many individuals were hidden in the student lounge before confronting the victim? The article says "a large group of students appeared from hidden locations" but doesn't specify the exact number. So answer N/A.

9. The ninth question: Age of the minor involved. The article mentions a minor who punched the man, but doesn't state the minor's age. So N/A.

10. The tenth question: Which university official made the statement? The article says the president, Greg Weiner, released the statement. So answer Greg Weiner.
