Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. 

1. **First question:** The Manhattan Institute fellow who championed voucher programs is Stephan Thernstrom. His dissertation became "Poverty and Progress," which won the Bancroft Prize. The question asks which university gave this accolade. The article says the Bancroft Prize is a top history award, but it doesn't mention the university involved. Wait, the dissertation's accolade is the Bancroft Prize itself, so maybe the question is asking which university's prize? Or maybe the university where he did his dissertation? Wait, the article states his dissertation became his first book, which won the Bancroft Prize. The Bancroft Prize is awarded by Columbia University. But the article doesn't explicitly state that. Hmm, the article says "won the Bancroft Prize, a top honor in history writing." Since the question is about the university that bestowed the accolade, but the article doesn't mention the university's name for the prize, maybe it's N/A. Wait, maybe the question is a trick. The dissertation was done at Harvard, since he studied there. But the Bancroft is from Columbia. Since the article doesn't say, I have to answer N/A.

2. **Second question:** The Harvard Crimson article that led him to stop teaching the course was in the late 80s/early 90s. The article mentions "in 1988" when he found himself in the political correctness wars. The Crimson article was in 1988. The book "Illiberal Education" by D'Souza was published in 1991, so the article was 1988.

3. **Third question:** The entity criticized in "No Excuses" as the fortress preventing skills? The article says "The structure of American urban education is a fortress against fundamental reform" from the 2003 Globe article. The Thernstroms pointed at teachers' unions and education bureaucracies. The question asks what entity was the obstacle. The fortress itself is the structure, but the answer should be the entities they criticized. The article says "teachers' unions, education bureaucracies and, again, racial preferences." So the entity is "teachers' unions and education bureaucracies," but the question asks for the one named as the obstacle. The fortress is the urban education structure. The answer might be "teachers' unions and education bureaucracies" but the exact wording? The question says "the sole obstacle," but the article mentions both. Hmm, maybe the fortress is the structure, but the question asks what entity was the obstacle. The article says "The structure of American urban education is a fortress..." so the entity is the structure of urban education. But the question might be looking for the named entities they criticized. The question says "entity," so the answer is "teachers' unions" or "education bureaucracies," but the exact wording? The article says "The alternative to a radical overhaul is too many Black and Hispanic youngsters..." so the fortress is the structure, which includes the entities mentioned. The answer might be "teachers' unions and education bureaucracies," but need to check. Alternatively, the question might want "the structure of American urban education," but the answer must be from the article's exact wording. The article says "The structure of American urban education is a fortress..." so the entity is "American urban education's structure" but the question asks for the entity criticized. The answer is "teachers' unions, education bureaucracies" but the question says "sole obstacle," so maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "the sole obstacle preventing Black and Hispanic youngsters from acquiring essential life skills?" The article says "The alternative to a radical overhaul is too many Black and Hispanic..." so the fortress (structure) is the obstacle. So the answer is "the structure of American urban education."

4. **Fourth question:** The father of the person who co-authored "America in Black and White" (Stephan) met his spouse at an I.F. Stone talk. His father's profession: the article says his father, Albert, worked for a railroad.

5. **Fifth question:** The Northwestern scholarship recipient (Stephan) initially studied speech before history. The article says he won a scholarship to study speech at Northwestern.

6. **Sixth question:** The interview where the Brandeis professor (Stephan) talked about double standards was in The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1998. The article quotes him saying "If you need double standards in admission..." in an interview with The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1998.

7. **Seventh question:** The reform opposing the fortress was vouchers and raising teaching standards. The article says they advocated vouchers and raising standards. The specific reform is vouchers, as mentioned in "they advocated ideas like using vouchers..."

8. **Eighth question:** The book by Dinesh D'Souza ("Illiberal Education") included allegations from Stephan, who before Brandeis was on the left. The article mentions D'Souza's book includes his allegations.

9. **Ninth question:** Stephan's primary historical focus before critiquing unions was social mobility. His early work was on social mobility in cities like Newburyport and Boston.

10. **Tenth question:** The honor for his Massachusetts research (dissertation) was the Bancroft Prize.

11. **Eleventh question:** The book arguing bilingual education widened the gap? The article mentions "No Excuses" and "America in Black and White," but not bilingual education specifically. So N/A.

12. **Twelfth question:** The 1995 legislation? The article mentions No Child Left Behind under Bush, but not a 1995 federal law. N/A.

13. **Thirteenth question:** Feud with a UCLA colleague over plantation journals? The article mentions students complained about him reading plantation journals, but doesn't name a colleague. N/A.

14. **Fourteenth question:** Abigail's award for voting rights? The article says Abigail died in 2020 but doesn't mention her awards. N/A.

15. **Fifteenth question:** Which Ivy League rescinded an honorary degree? The article mentions the 1988 scandal but not a specific university. N/A.

16. **Sixteenth question:** Federal court case in 2003 with their amicus brief on teacher tenure? The article doesn't mention specific cases. N/A.

17. **Seventeenth question:** Civil rights leader who debated him in 1999? Not mentioned. N/A.

18. **Eighteenth question:** Congressional committee inviting Abigail to testify in 2005? Not mentioned. N/A.

19. **Nineteenth question:** Historian whose work on Irish immigrants he rejected? The article mentions Oscar Handlin's influence but not a rival. N/A.

20. **Twentieth question:** 1989 documentary with Stephan on busing? The article doesn't mention a documentary. N/A.
