Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the strict format. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks which French philosopher's theories Weegee explicitly rejected through his pre-1947 work according to the curator. The article mentions that the curator, Clement Cheroux, uses Guy Debord's "Society of the Spectacle" theory. However, it says that Weegee's New York photos refute Debord's theory because his subjects connected with each other, not just as spectacle. So the answer should be Guy Debord.

2. The next question is about how many darkroom techniques Weegee used for his celebrity distortions. The article lists heating negatives with boiling water or flame, curved glass between enlarger and paper, and multiple exposures. That's three techniques. So the answer is 3.

3. The third question asks the name of the assistant who helped with the Metropolitan Opera photo. The article says "an assistant found a disheveled, drunken woman" but doesn't name the assistant. So N/A.

4. Question 4 is about when the police headquarters moved from opposite his apartment. The text doesn't mention any move, only that his apartment was opposite police HQ. So N/A.

5. The original title of the Brooklyn fire photo was "Roast" before changing to "I Cried When I Took This Picture". The answer is "Roast".

6. The celebrity photographed with curved glass that influenced Francis Bacon's style. The article says Andy Warhol's face was made into a blurry montage like Bacon's. So Andy Warhol.

7. The cafe ad said "5 Extra Smokes Per Pack" so the answer is 5.

8. The bouillon cubes' price? The article only mentions the slogan "Simply Add Boiling Water", not the price. So N/A.

9. The mobster's aunt is in "Their First Murder". The text says the victim was a small-time mobster whose aunt was grieving. But the mobster's name isn't given. N/A.

10. Temperature of water used: the article says he used boiling water, so boiling. But the question asks for the temperature in degrees? The text just says boiling water, so maybe "boiling" is acceptable. But the question might expect a numerical value which isn't provided. Hmm. The text says "heating the negatives with boiling water or flame" so the answer is boiling.

11. The French critic whose theory is Debord's, as mentioned earlier. So Guy Debord.

12. The artist compared to Weegee's distortions is Warhol, with his silk-screen of Marilyn etc. So Andy Warhol.

13. The exhibition about Anne Frank's Secret Annex is first shown outside Amsterdam. So Amsterdam.

14. The title change for the fire photo was "I Cried When I Took This Picture".

15. Weegee's heritage is mentioned as an immigrant from Ukraine, so Ukrainian.

16. The manipulation technique mentioned is heating negatives, curved glass, multiple exposures. The question asks which one is likened to Dada techniques. The article says "Surrealist and Dada photographers had similarly manipulated negatives... melting emulsions..." but Weegee used heating, curved glass, etc. The answer might be heating with boiling water or flame, or curved glass. Wait the question is which technique was likened to Dada. The text says "Surrealist and Dada photographers had similarly manipulated negatives and prints, even melting emulsions..." but Weegee's techniques were different. The article says Weegee used heating, curved glass, multiple exposures. The question is asking which of his techniques were similar to Dada's? The Dada used melting, but Weegee's methods are different. Wait the article says "Weegee's... methods: heating... curved glass..." and "Surrealist and Dada photographers had similarly manipulated negatives..." so maybe the answer is heating negatives with boiling water or flame. But the question is which one was likened. The article says "Surrealist and Dada photographers had similarly manipulated negatives and prints, even melting emulsions to suggest deliquescing bodies. But for Weegee, the technique seemed to serve no purpose..." So the technique that Weegee used which is similar to Dada? Or the article is contrasting? The answer might be that the article mentions Dada's melting, but Weegee's techniques are different. Wait the question says "which experimental manipulation... likened to techniques used by Dada photographers, did Weegee employ?" The article says Dada used melting emulsions, but Weegee used heating, curved glass, etc. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait no. The question is about Weegee's techniques that were likened to Dada's. The article says "Surrealist and Dada photographers had similarly manipulated negatives and prints, even melting emulsions..." implying that they used similar techniques, but Weegee used different ones. Wait, the article says "for Weegee, the technique seemed to serve no purpose other than buffoonery... Surrealist and Dada photographers had similarly manipulated negatives..." So maybe the answer is that the techniques he used were heating, curved glass, etc., but the question is which of those were likened to Dada. Since the article says Dada used melting, which is different, perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait the question says "described in the review and likened to techniques used by Dada photographers". The article says "Surrealist and Dada photographers had similarly manipulated negatives and prints, even melting emulsions to suggest deliquescing bodies. But for Weegee, the technique seemed to serve no purpose..." So the techniques Weegee used are different from Dada's melting. Therefore, the answer might be N/A. Wait, but maybe the question is referring to the fact that he used techniques similar to Dada, but the article says they were different. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "heating negatives with boiling water or flame" since the article mentions it. But the article says Dada used melting, which is different. I'm confused here. Let me check the exact wording again: "Surrealist and Dada photographers had similarly manipulated negatives and prints, even melting emulsions to suggest deliquescing bodies. But for Weegee, the technique seemed to serve no purpose other than buffoonery..." So the techniques of Dada/Surrealists included melting, but Weegee used heating, curved glass, etc. So the answer to question 16 is the techniques Weegee used, but the question is which one was likened to Dada. Since the article contrasts them, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the techniques he used, which are heating, curved glass, or multiple exposures. The question is which one was likened to Dada techniques. Since the article says Dada used melting, which isn't one of Weegee's methods, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the fact that he used "manipulated negatives" similar to Dada, even if the specific technique was different. The question says "experimental manipulation of photographic negatives, described in the review and likened to techniques used by Dada photographers". The article says "Surrealist and Dada photographers had similarly manipulated negatives..." so the manipulation itself is similar in concept, even if the specific technique (melting vs. heating) differs. Therefore, the answer would be the techniques he used, which are heating, curved glass, or multiple exposures. The question asks for the name of the technique, like "heating negatives" or "curved glass". The article lists three methods: heating with boiling water or flame, inserting curved or wavy glass, or multiple exposures. The question is which one is likened to Dada. Since the Dada used melting, which isn't listed here, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question is which technique did Weegee employ that was likened to Dada techniques. The article says "Surrealist and Dada photographers had similarly manipulated negatives and prints...", implying that manipulating negatives in general was a technique they used. So maybe the answer is "heating negatives with boiling water or flame" or any of his methods. But the question asks for the name of the technique. The article says "heating the negatives with boiling water or flame, inserting curved or wavy glass between the enlarger and the printing paper, or superimposing multiple exposures on the same sheet." So the techniques are heating, curved glass, and multiple exposures. The question is which one was likened to Dada's. Since the Dada used melting, which is different, perhaps none, so N/A? Alternatively, maybe the answer is "heating negatives" because the article mentions Dada's manipulation. Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, the question might be looking for "manipulating negatives" in general, but the options given are the specific techniques. Since the article says Dada used melting, which isn't one of Weegee's methods, the answer might be N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the fact that he used techniques similar to Dada in concept, so the answer would be one of his methods. But I'm not sure. Let me tentatively say N/A for now and revisit.

17. President Kennedy's smile was transformed into a "palisade fence". The article says "President Kennedy's teeth into a palisade fence".

18. The photograph with children and the grieving woman is "Their First Murder".

19. The publication that featured the changed title photo is "Naked City", his book.

20. The German sculptor with humorous angst is Thomas Schutte, mentioned in the additional exhibitions.

Okay, let me go back to question 16. The article says: "Surrealist and Dada photographers had similarly manipulated negatives and prints, even melting emulsions to suggest deliquescing bodies. But for Weegee, the technique seemed to serve no purpose other than buffoonery..." So the techniques Weegee used (heating, curved glass, multiple exposures) are different from Dada's melting. The question is which of his techniques were likened to Dada's. Since the article contrasts them, perhaps the answer is none, so N/A. Alternatively, the question might be asking for the type of manipulation, like "manipulating negatives", but the exact technique isn't linked. Since the question says "experimental manipulation... described... likened to techniques used by Dada", the answer might be N/A because the article says Dada used melting, which isn't one of Weegee's methods. So I'll go with N/A for question 16.

Now, let me check all answers again to ensure they're correct based on the text.

1. Guy Debord
2. 3
3. N/A
4. N/A
5. Roast
6. Andy Warhol
7. 5
8. N/A
9. N/A
10. boiling
11. Guy Debord
12. Andy Warhol
13. Amsterdam
14. I Cried When I Took This Picture
15. Ukrainian
16. N/A
17. palisade fence
18. Their First Murder
19. Naked City
20. Thomas Schutte

Wait, question 10: The question is "What was the temperature of the water...", the article says "heating the negatives with boiling water or flame", so the answer is boiling. But the temperature in Celsius? The text doesn't specify, so "boiling" is acceptable as it's a temperature description.

Question 16: Since the article says Dada used melting, which is different from Weegee's methods, the answer is N/A.

Okay, that should cover all the questions. Let me make sure each is addressed with the correct answer.
