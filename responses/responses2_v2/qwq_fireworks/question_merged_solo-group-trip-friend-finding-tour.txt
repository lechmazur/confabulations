Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer strictly based on that.

1. **Question 1**: Toni Greenberg's first solo trip to Rome was with Road Scholar. The article mentions her trip to Rome with Road Scholar, so that's straightforward.

2. **Question 2**: The article says G Adventures introduced Solo-ish Adventures but doesn't specify how many destinations they offer. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Melissa Biggs Bradley said the number of solo travelers on Indagare tours had quintupled since 2019. Quintupled means 500% increase. So the answer is 500%.

4. **Question 4**: The article mentions Quebec City as a Canadian city but doesn't say it partnered with Exoticca. The partnership isn't mentioned, so N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The group size for Rich Harrington's trip isn't stated. The article talks about group experiences but no numbers. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The article says Toni's 2023 Rome trip was with Road Scholar, but the specific month isn't given. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Indagare's pre-trip video calls are mentioned but not the number required. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The primary reason cited is making friends and leaving logistics to pros. The article says they want curated trips that turn into friend-finding events. So the answer is making friends or similar, but the exact phrase is "turn into multiday friend-finding events". The question asks for the primary reason, so maybe the logistics and connections.

9. **Question 9**: The article mentions Yogyakarta's temples but doesn't name an Indonesian tour operator. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The text mentions FTLO but no age requirement. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Rich Harrington is an animator, which is his background. The question asks for his profession related to coordinating dinners. So animator.

12. **Question 12**: Quebec City resists English incursion. The article says French speakers resist English there. So Quebec City.

13. **Question 13**: Toni and her group are going to Costa Rica on another Road Scholar trip. The question asks besides Road Scholar, so maybe another operator? The text says they're doing another Road Scholar trip, so N/A because the other is still Road Scholar.

14. **Question 14**: Rich's 2023 trip is mentioned, but no subsequent trip year. N/A.

15. **Question 15**: Yogyakarta's Javanese culture includes the Cosmological Axis. But Rich went to Italy, so this is conflicting. The question is about Rich's experience in Italy, but Yogyakarta is in Indonesia. So N/A because he was in Italy, not Indonesia.

16. **Question 16**: Barbados has rum punch, but the restrictive aspect Mr. Harrington faced was about group tour downsides like flight choices. The article says he disliked restricted flights, etc., but not specific to Barbados. N/A.

17. **Question 17**: Indagare's solo travelers quintupled (5x), but destinations offered aren't specified. Can't compare, so N/A.

18. **Question 18**: The widows in Rome bonding over a dish in Barbados? The article mentions Barbados has fresh seafood and rum punch, but the Rome trip's bonding didn't mention a specific dish. N/A.

19. **Question 19**: Barbados has calypso vibes. The animator enjoyed that during his European trip? Wait, he was in Italy. The article says he was in Italy with Exoticca. So calypso is in Barbados, but he wasn't there. N/A.

20. **Question 20**: G Adventures' Solo-ish inaugural destination isn't mentioned. The article lists some destinations but not the first. N/A.
