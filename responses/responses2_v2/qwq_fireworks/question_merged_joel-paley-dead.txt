Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the provided article and answer exactly based on what's there. Let me start with the first question.

1. Which Broadway theater hosted the original 1992 run of "Ruthless!" before it moved to the Players Theater?

Hmm, the article says "Ruthless!" opened in 1992 at the Players Theater. Wait, the question is asking if it was at another theater before moving there. The article mentions the original opening was at Players Theater, so maybe there was no prior theater. So answer N/A.

2. How many songs from "Ruthless!" reached the Billboard charts during its initial Off-Broadway run?

The article doesn't mention Billboard charts or any songs reaching them. So N/A.

3. What was the name of the character Joel Paley played in his debut performance with Les Ballets Trockadero?

The article says he was with Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo starting in 1975 but doesn't mention specific characters. So N/A.

4. Who played the role of Sylvia St. Croix during the show's entire original 1992 run?

The article mentions Paul Pecorino got sick in the 2015 revival, and Paley took over Sylvia St. Croix then. The original 1992 run's cast isn't specified here. So N/A.

5. What was the running time of the Shirley MacLaine TV special where Paley and Laird first met?

The article states they met while Paley was rehearsing with Trockadero for a Shirley MacLaine TV special, but no running time is given. N/A.

6. Which famous theater critic's negative review of "Seedy" convinced Paley to revise it into "Ruthless!"?

The article doesn't mention any critic's review leading to revisions. It says the obstacle was the estate refusing rights, so they expanded the story. No critic named. N/A.

7. What was the name of the grade school production within "Ruthless!" where Tina Denmark commits her first murder?

The show's plot involves Tina's murders for the school show, but the specific production's name isn't mentioned. N/A.

8. How many weeks did Britney Spears perform as Tina Denmark's understudy before being replaced by Natalie Portman?

The article says Britney and Portman were understudies but doesn't specify duration. N/A.

9. What was the title of the song Bernadette Peters performed at the 1996 AIDS charity concert that wasn't in the original show?

The article mentions the concert version but doesn't name any new songs. N/A.

10. Which famous actress from "The Bad Seed" film attended the opening night of "Ruthless!" and gave her blessing?

The article doesn't mention anyone from "The Bad Seed" attending. N/A.

11. How many years did it take for the fully realized version of "Seedy," with music by Marvin Laird and starring Bernadette Peters, to finally premiere after Paley initially conceived the idea?

"Seedy" became "Ruthless!" which opened in 1992. The initial conception was in 1976. 1992-1976=16 years. But the article says it took nearly two decades (about 20 years). Wait, the article says "it took nearly two decades to turn 'Seedy' into 'Ruthless!'". So two decades is 20 years. But Paley and Laird started in 1976, so 1992-1976=16. Hmm, maybe the question is about the Bernadette Peters concert. The 1996 concert with Peters was later. The question says "fully realized version with Peters". The original was 1992, and the concert was 1996. But the question is about the time from conception (1976) to the premiere of the version with Peters. That's 20 years (1996-1976). But the article says the 1996 concert was a "concert version" directed by Paley. The original was 1992. The question says "fully realized version" with Peters. The article doesn't specify when that version premiered. Maybe the answer is N/A, but the article says "it took nearly two decades" to make "Ruthless!" from "Seedy". So 1976 to 1992 is 16, but the article says "nearly two decades", so maybe the answer is 16? But the question is about the version with Peters. Wait the question says "fully realized version of 'Seedy', with music by Laird and starring Peters". The original "Ruthless!" had Laird's music, and Peters was in the 1996 concert. So the time from Paley's initial idea (1976) to the 1996 concert would be 20 years. But the question is about the premiere of that version. The concert was in 1996. So 1996-1976=20 years. So answer is 20. Let me check the article again: "An early obstacle was the refusal... they expanded the story... 'Ruthless!' finally opened in 1992... In 1996, Bernadette Peters starred in a concert version..." So the concert version with Peters was in 1996. The question is about the time from conception (1976) to the premiere (the concert in 1996). So 20 years. So answer is 20.

12. What role did Norma Paley's heavenly intervention play in securing the rights from Maxwell Anderson's estate for the initial production?

The article mentions Paley's mother Norma, but the part about heavenly intervention was when Paley stepped into a role in 2015. The rights issue was resolved by expanding the story, not through Norma's intervention. So N/A.

13. What was the name of the AIDS charity for which the Los Angeles concert version of "Ruthless!", directed by the founder of Trockadero, raised money?

The article says the 1996 concert raised money for an AIDS charity, but the name isn't specified. N/A.

14. What award did Britney Spears accept on behalf of the production team?

The article mentions Laura Bell Bundy won awards, but Britney was an understudy. No mention of her accepting an award. N/A.

15. Besides "Ruthless!", what other musical did Paley direct during his time with Les Ballets Trockadero?

The article says his first job was with Trockadero, but during that time, he wrote "Seedy". The question asks for a musical directed by him during that time. The article mentions he choreographed an episode of "Maude" and directed an episode of "She TV" later. Nothing during Trockadero. N/A.

16. What prop from "Born to Entertain" did Laura Bell Bundy use to convey menace?

The song's lyrics mention "tap of my shoes" and "cane". The article says she used "cane" in the lyrics and that she used it to convey menace. So the prop is a cane.

17. What play did Joel Paley act in at age 11?

The article says he was 13 in "Summertree" by Ron Cowen. The question says 11, so N/A.

18. What character did Paul Pecorino play in the original 1992 production?

In the 2015 revival, Pecorino played Sylvia St. Croix and got sick, so Paley took over. The original 1992 run's cast for that role isn't mentioned. So N/A.

19. What Denver venue hosted "The Yiddish Are Coming..."?

The article says it was produced in Denver in 2006. The venue isn't named. N/A.

20. What lifesaving measure did medics perform on Paley?
