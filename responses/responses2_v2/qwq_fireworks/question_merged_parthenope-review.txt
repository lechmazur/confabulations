    The techniques listed are "gliding pans, voyeuristic close-ups and touches of the surreal." Answer "gliding pans" or "voyeuristic close-ups," but the question asks for the technique mentioned. The exact term given is "gliding pans, voyeuristic close-ups and touches of the surreal." Since it's a list, maybe pick one. The review says "gliding pans, voyeuristic close-ups and touches of the surreal" are part of the style. The question asks for the cinematic technique mentioned. The answer should be one of them. The first mentioned is "gliding pans." But maybe the answer expects "surreal" as part of the style. Wait, the question says "cinematic technique... specifically mentioned." The article says "gliding pans, voyeuristic close-ups and touches of the surreal." So the techniques are gliding pans and voyeuristic close-ups. The answer is "gliding pans" or "voyeuristic close-ups." But the question might want "gliding pans and voyeuristic close-ups" but the answer should be concise. The exact phrase is "gliding pans, voyeuristic close-ups and touches of the surreal." Since it's a technique, maybe "gliding pans" is the first one. Alternatively, the answer might be "gliding pans" as the first technique mentioned. Alternatively, the question might accept "surreal" but that's a style, not a technique. Let me check the exact wording: "accented by gliding pans, voyeuristic close-ups and touches of the surreal." So the techniques are gliding pans, voyeuristic close-ups. The answer is one of those. Since the question asks for the technique mentioned, perhaps the first one. Alternatively, the answer could be "gliding pans and voyeuristic close-ups" but the instructions say to answer in fragments. Let me see the article again: "gliding pans, voyeuristic close-ups and touches of the surreal" are the techniques. The question asks for the cinematic technique mentioned. Since it's a list, maybe pick the first one. Alternatively, the answer might be "gliding pans" since it's listed first. But the question might accept any of them. Since the user wants the exact answer, perhaps "gliding pans" is the best. Alternatively, the answer could be "voyeuristic close-ups". Wait, the user says "cinematic technique described as contributing... specifically mentioned in the review?" The exact terms are the techniques listed. Since the user wants the answer from the text, the correct answer is "gliding pans" or "voyeuristic close-ups", but the question might require all? No, the user wants the specific one. Since the question is phrased as "what cinematic technique... specifically mentioned," perhaps the answer is "gliding pans" as the first mentioned. Alternatively, the answer could be "surreal" but that's a style. Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is "gliding pans".

19. **What is the symbolic object presented in the opening scene that hints at Parthenope’s fated path and luxurious beginnings?**  
    The opening scene is her being gifted a carriage from Versailles. Answer "carriage from Versailles."

20. **Reflecting themes shared with the director’s earlier work, which paradoxical effect of beauty is emphasized in the film as both uplifting and isolating?**  
    The article states "Beauty may inspire awe and worship, but it also alienates." The paradox is beauty's dual effect. Answer "inspires awe and worship but alienates" or the exact quote. The question asks for the paradox, so "beauty inspires awe and worship but also alienates" or "both uplifting and isolating." The exact phrase from the article is "Beauty may inspire awe and worship, but it also alienates." So the answer is that paradox.
