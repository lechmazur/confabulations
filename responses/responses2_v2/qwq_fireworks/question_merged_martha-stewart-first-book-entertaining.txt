Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based strictly on the article provided.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions Martha Stewart's Turkey Hill farm but doesn't say anything about her autographing copies at the 1982 launch. No info, so N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The article states she catered a party for the book "Gnomes" with tablescapes, but doesn't name a Manhattan restaurant. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The text says she wanted all-color over publisher's objections but doesn't mention the initial price. N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Roger Black mentions many copper pans but not an exact count. "100 times more" is mentioned, but no specific number counted. N/A.

5. **Question 5**: There's no data on sales increases for other cookbooks after the documentary. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The article doesn't mention a European cooking school she credited. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: No production budget figures are given. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The cover photo setup time isn't specified. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The reissue uses nicer paper but doesn't name the manufacturer. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The co-writer was Elizabeth Hawes, but the question asks about a celebrity chef writing the foreword. The article doesn't mention a foreword by a chef. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The makeup artist tried the gingerbread mansion recipe, but the article says it's from "Entertaining". The question asks if it was in a different book. Since the article doesn't say that, N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Alan Mirken is mentioned, but the article doesn't state the initial print run number. N/A.

13. **Question 13**: The cover photo shows Martha in white, but the co-writer's dress color isn't mentioned. N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Hailey uses the book's tips but the specific glassware color isn't stated beyond "turquoise" on the cover. The question is about what she recommended. The article says "turquoise glassware" in the cover description, but it's part of the book's imagery, not Hailey's specific recommendation. So N/A unless that's considered. Wait, the article says "turquoise glassware and red and yellow poppies" on the cover. The question asks what Hailey recommended. Since the article doesn't explicitly say Hailey mentioned turquoise, maybe N/A.

15. **Question 15**: Both docs featured "Entertaining" prominently. The article doesn't mention another book. So N/A.

16. **Question 16**: The hives have Italian honeybees, but the specific breed isn't given. N/A.

17. **Question 17**: The original title before Alan Mirken's suggestion isn't provided. N/A.

18. **Question 18**: The video by Meredith Hayden is mentioned but not titled. N/A.

19. **Question 19**: The article says her love for collecting cookware in excess is a dated aspect. The specific item? It just says "cookware and other items". No specific item like copper pans (though Roger noted them, but the question asks for the item mentioned by Nick). The article states "collecting cookware" as the aspect, so answer: cookware.

20. **Question 20**: The article says she was a caterer in Westport but doesn't name the company. N/A.

Wait, let me check each again carefully:

1. No autograph info → N/A.

2. The Gnomes party location isn't a restaurant in Manhattan. Catered a party for the book's event, but no restaurant name. → N/A.

3. Initial print price? The article mentions the book's current prices but not the original. → N/A.

4. Roger saw "100 times" more pans but not a count. → N/A.

5. Sales increase for other books? The article talks about "Entertaining" sales, not others. → N/A.

6. No European school mentioned. → N/A.

7. Budget not stated. → N/A.

8. Time on lighting? No. → N/A.

9. Paper manufacturer? Says "nicer paper" but no name. → N/A.

10. Foreword by celebrity chef? Elizabeth Hawes was co-writer, not a chef's foreword. → N/A.

11. The gingerbread is from "Entertaining", so the question's premise is wrong. Answer N/A.

12. Alan Mirken is quoted about the reissue, not the original print run. → N/A.

13. Elizabeth's dress color not mentioned. → N/A.

14. The turquoise glass is on the cover, but Hailey's recommendation isn't specified. → N/A.

15. No other book mentioned. → N/A.

16. Just "Italian honeybees", no breed. → N/A.

17. Original title change? The article says the book was titled "Entertaining" after Alan's suggestion, but doesn't give the original title. → N/A.

18. Video title not given. → N/A.

19. The article says "collecting cookware" is the dated aspect. So answer: cookware.

20. Catering company name? Not provided. → N/A.
