Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the given article. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked and not infer anything beyond the text.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions that Trump tried to ban TikTok in 2020 but doesn't name a specific Republican senator who proposed the legislation. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The outage started Saturday night and was restored by noon Sunday. The article says "late Saturday" and "around noon on Sunday." Assuming "late Saturday" is midnight, that's 12 hours until noon. But the exact hours aren't specified. Wait, the article says "late Saturday night" and "around noon on Sunday." If it went dark late Saturday night (say, 11 PM) and restored at noon next day, that's about 13 hours. But since the exact times aren't given, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question asks how many hours it lasted. The article says "late Saturday night" to "around noon on Sunday." The time from midnight to noon is 12 hours, but "late night" could be later. Since the article doesn't give exact times, the duration isn't specified, so N/A.

Wait, maybe the article says "started on Saturday night" and "came back around noon on Sunday." So from Saturday night until noon Sunday. Let me check the first paragraph again: "The popular video app went dark in the United States late Saturday and then came back around noon on Sunday." "Late Saturday" to "around noon Sunday." Assuming "late Saturday" is midnight, that's 12 hours. But since the exact start time isn't given, maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, but the user wants the exact number if possible. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting an approximate based on "late Saturday night" to noon, so around 12-14 hours? But the article doesn't specify the exact hours, so the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The article states TikTok's headquarters are in Singapore and LA, and ByteDance is "largely owned by global investors." But it doesn't mention a percentage. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The article says Trump's 2020 ban was "struck down by federal courts" but doesn't name the judge. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The article mentions penalties for service providers but doesn't state the exact dollar amount. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The article states the law was passed by Congress with bipartisan support, signed by Biden, but doesn't give the vote count. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The article mentions moving headquarters to Singapore but doesn't specify the month of 2023. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The article doesn't mention the number of data misuse cases documented by U.S. intelligence. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Oracle is mentioned as one of the internet companies penalized under the law. The article says Oracle is an example of companies that distribute TikTok content, but their role in data storage isn't detailed. Wait, the article says "internet companies, like Oracle" are penalized for distributing content. So maybe Oracle was involved in data storage? The exact role isn't stated. The answer is N/A unless the article specifies. Let me check again: "It is not clear if Mr. Trump can stall the ban under the law..." No, the article doesn't mention Oracle's specific role beyond being an internet company affected. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The article mentions laws allowing Chinese government to demand data, but doesn't specify the law's name or year. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The article says service was restored "around noon on Sunday." So the period is around noon on Sunday. The answer is "around noon on Sunday."

12. **Question 12:** The article states President-elect Trump provided clarity, so the political leader is Donald J. Trump.

13. **Question 13:** The article says Trump planned a deal giving the U.S. a 50% ownership stake. The answer is 50%.

14. **Question 14:** The law allows a one-time 90-day extension. The article says "a one-time extension of 90 days." So 90 days.

15. **Question 15:** Trump has over 14 million followers. The article says "over 14 million followers."

16. **Question 16:** The article mentions the Israel-Hamas war as a time when concerns about misinformation escalated. So Israel-Hamas war.

17. **Question 17:** The law was upheld by the Supreme Court. The article says "upheld by the Supreme Court."

18. **Question 18:** The sensitive user data mentioned is location information. The article states "location information" as an example.

19. **Question 19:** The article refers to app stores (Apple, Google) and other internet companies. The category is app stores and internet companies. The exact term used is "digital distributors" like app stores. The answer is "app stores and other internet companies," but the question asks for the category. The article says "app stores, like Apple and Google, and other internet companies, like Oracle" are penalized. The category is "digital distributors" as per the question's wording. Wait, the question says: "Which category of digital distributors, exemplified in the text by companies like Apple and Google..." So the category is "app stores" and "internet companies," but the exact term used in the article for the category? The law penalizes app stores and internet companies. The question is asking for the category name, but the article might not use a specific term beyond "app stores" and "internet companies." The question says "category of digital distributors" so the answer is "app stores and other internet companies" but the exact term in the article? Alternatively, the article says "app stores, like Apple and Google, and other internet companies, like Oracle" so the category is "app stores and other internet companies." But the question asks for the category name. Since the question provides examples, maybe the answer is "app stores" and "internet companies," but the exact category term? The article says "digital distributors" in the question's phrasing. Wait the question says: "Which category of digital distributors, exemplified in the text by companies like Apple and Google..." So the category is "app stores and internet companies" but the article refers to them as "app stores" and "other internet companies." The answer should be "app stores and other internet companies" but the question might expect "app stores" as the category. Alternatively, the law penalizes "app stores and other internet companies," so the category is "digital distributors" as per the question's wording. Wait the question says "category of digital distributors" so the answer is "app stores and other internet companies," but the exact wording from the article is "app stores, like Apple and Google, and other internet companies, like Oracle." The category is "app stores and other internet companies." So the answer is "app stores and other internet companies."
