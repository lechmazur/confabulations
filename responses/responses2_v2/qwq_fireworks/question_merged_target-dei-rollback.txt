Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by reading through the questions again and then cross-check with the article.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about the percentage decrease in Target's stock price after the November earnings report that led to Brian Cornell's emotional reaction and the $2 billion commitment. The article mentions Target had a weak earnings report in November which sent investors fleeing. However, it doesn't specify the exact percentage decrease. So the answer should be N/A because the percentage isn't provided.

2. **Question 2**: The question is asking which company, besides Tractor Supply, faced boycotts by Robby Starbuck and also resisted changing D.E.I. policies. The article says Tractor Supply, John Deere, and Harley-Davidson ditched D.E.I. programs in response to Robby Starbuck's boycotts. But the companies that scaled back later include Meta, Walmart, Amazon. The question mentions "shareholder resistance" like Costco. Wait, the question says "in the context of shareholder resistance to altering D.E.I. policies" and similar to Tractor Supply. Wait, the article says that Costco's shareholders rejected a proposal to report risks of D.E.I. policies. But the question is which company faced Starbuck's boycotts. The ones that faced Starbuck's were Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson. But the question asks for one of those, besides Tractor Supply. So the answer is either John Deere or Harley-Davidson. Since the question says "mentioned in the context of shareholder resistance to altering D.E.I. policies", but those companies (John Deere, etc.) had already rolled back their programs. The shareholder resistance part refers to Costco. Wait, the question is phrased as: "Which company, mentioned in the context of shareholder resistance to altering D.E.I. policies, also faced boycotts instigated by Robby Starbuck, similar to Tractor Supply?" Hmm, maybe I misread. The shareholder resistance context is part of the question's phrasing. The companies that faced Starbuck's boycotts are Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson. The shareholder resistance part refers to Costco. But the question is asking for a company that is mentioned in the shareholder resistance context AND also faced Starbuck's boycotts. Since the article says "Target joins a fast-growing group of companies dropping diversity commitments and policies, as Mr. Trump makes clear his intent... Last summer, Tractor Supply, John Deere and Harley-Davidson ditched D.E.I. programs, in part in response to threats of boycotts led by the conservative activist Robby Starbuck. More recently, other companies have rolled back diversity programs too, including Meta, Walmart and Amazon." Then later, "Costco, too, has fought changes. On Thursday, its shareholders rejected a proposal brought by a conservative group that would have required the company to report the risks of its D.E.I. policies." So the question is asking for a company mentioned in the shareholder resistance context (like Costco) but also faced Starbuck's boycotts. Wait, the companies that faced Starbuck's are the first three (Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson). The shareholder resistance part is about Costco. The question says "in the context of shareholder resistance to altering D.E.I. policies" – so the company mentioned there is Costco, but did Costco face Starbuck's boycotts? The article doesn't say that. So maybe the question is looking for one of the first three (John Deere or Harley-Davidson) because they were mentioned in the context of Robby Starbuck's boycotts. The question says "which company, mentioned in the context of shareholder resistance... also faced boycotts..." But maybe the shareholder resistance part is not about those companies. The answer might be John Deere or Harley-Davidson, but since the question is asking for a company mentioned in the shareholder resistance context (Costco's case), but that's not linked to Starbuck. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-read the question. "Which company, mentioned in the context of shareholder resistance to altering D.E.I. policies, also faced boycotts instigated by Robby Starbuck, similar to Tractor Supply?" The shareholder resistance part is about Costco (since they rejected a proposal). But they weren't mentioned in the boycotts part. The companies that faced boycotts are Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson. The question is looking for a company that is in both contexts. Since the answer options are those three, but they weren't mentioned in the shareholder resistance part. The question might be a trick, but according to the article, the answer would be N/A? Wait, the question says "similar to Tractor Supply", so the other companies mentioned with Tractor Supply in the same sentence are John Deere and Harley-Davidson. So the answer is either of those, but the question is asking which is mentioned in the shareholder resistance context. Since they aren't, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The question is phrased as "in the context of shareholder resistance to altering D.E.I. policies" – the article mentions Costco in that context. But the companies that faced Starbuck's boycotts are the first three. Since none of those are mentioned in the shareholder resistance context, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to Tractor Supply itself, but the question says "which company, mentioned in the context of shareholder resistance...", so Tractor Supply was mentioned in the context of Robby Starbuck's boycotts, but not in the shareholder resistance part. Therefore, the answer is N/A. Hmm, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the article again. The article says: "More recently, other companies have rolled back diversity programs too, including Meta, Walmart and Amazon. JPMorgan... Costco, too, has fought changes. On Thursday, its shareholders rejected a proposal..." So the shareholder resistance is about Costco. The companies that faced Starbuck's are Tractor, John Deere, Harley. The question is asking for a company that's in both contexts. Since none are, the answer is N/A. But maybe the question is a trick and the answer is Tractor Supply, but the question says "similar to Tractor Supply", so the other two. But they weren't mentioned in the shareholder resistance part. So I think the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "mentioned in the context of shareholder resistance to altering D.E.I. policies"—so only Costco is in that context. But they didn't face Starbuck's. So answer N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The question asks besides Meta, Walmart, and Amazon, which other major retailer headquartered in the same city as George Floyd's murder (Minneapolis) scaled back D.E.I. The article mentions Target, which is in Minneapolis, and they did scale back. The answer is Target. But the question says "besides Meta, Walmart, Amazon"—so Target is the answer. The article says "Target announced... will conclude its D.E.I. goals" so yes.

4. **Question 4**: What specific regulatory action by a federal agency prompted Kiera Fernandez's announcement? The article says "Days after President Trump ordered federal agencies to investigate private sector entities for 'illegal' diversity, equity and inclusion programs, Target has become the latest major company to retreat..." So the action was the order to investigate. The answer is the order to investigate.

5. **Question 5**: The year when the CEO (Brian Cornell) gathered his Black officers after George Floyd's murder. The murder was in 2020, as per the article: "After the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020...". So the answer is 2020.

6. **Question 6**: The form of subtle protest by Silicon Valley workers at the company led by the CEO who said "Bring them on". The article says "JPMorgan... its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, announcing this week that the bank does not intend to back down on diversity. 'Bring them on,' he said..." So the company is JPMorgan. The article also mentions "Silicon Valley Workers Quietly Protest: As Mark Zuckerberg and other tech titans have embraced President Trump and muffled internal dissent at their companies, their mostly left-leaning employees have objected with subtle acts of defiance." So the subtle protest is "subtle acts of defiance". The question asks for the form, so the answer is "subtle acts of defiance".

7. **Question 7**: The name of the unproven blood filter used in Antigua. The article says "A Start-Up's Claim of a Miracle: Two U.S. companies teamed up to treat cancer patients using an unproven blood filter in Antigua..." but the name isn't given. So answer N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Which company's CEO mirrored Jamie Dimon's stance (committing to D.E.I.) and also committed to spending $2 billion with Black-owned businesses. Jamie Dimon is at JPMorgan. The article says Target's CEO made the $2 billion commitment. The question is asking which CEO besides Jamie Dimon (since the question says "mirroring" but the other is Target's CEO. Wait, the question says "which company's CEO, mirroring Jamie Dimon's stance on D.E.I., also recently committed to spending $2 billion..." Jamie Dimon's stance is not about the $2B, but Target's CEO did commit to that. So the answer is Target. But the question is phrased as "mirroring Jamie Dimon's stance"—since Dimon's stance is to not back down on D.E.I., and Target's CEO also didn't back down initially but now they did? Wait, Target is the one that scaled back. Wait, the $2B commitment was made by Target's CEO after George Floyd's murder. The question is asking which CEO, besides Jamie Dimon (who is in the same stance as him on D.E.I.), also made the $2B commitment. Since Jamie Dimon is at JPMorgan, and Target's CEO (Brian Cornell) made the $2B commitment, but Target is now scaling back. The question is about a CEO who both mirrored Dimon's stance (supporting D.E.I.) and made the $2B commitment. Since Target is now scaling back, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "mirroring Jamie Dimon's stance on D.E.I." which is not backing down. Target is now backing down, so their CEO's stance is opposite. Therefore, the answer is N/A. But the $2B was made by Target's CEO. The question is asking which company's CEO did both. Since Target's CEO made the $2B but is now scaling back, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about another company. Wait, the article says "Costco, too, has fought changes" but didn't mention any $2B commitment. The only one mentioned with the $2B is Target. So since Target's stance is now opposite, the answer is N/A. Hmm, tricky.

9. **Question 9**: What specific type of business is DeepSeek, besides a hedge fund, primarily focused on? The article says "DeepSeek's Rise: The little-known artificial intelligence firm has emphasized research, even as it emerged as the brainchild of a hedge fund." So the type is "artificial intelligence firm" or "research". The question asks besides a hedge fund, so the answer is "artificial intelligence firm" or "research". The article says they are an AI firm emphasizing research. The answer is "artificial intelligence firm" or "research"? The question says "specific type of business", so "artificial intelligence firm".

10. **Question 10**: Philanthropic endeavor similar to Bill Gates's current focus, done by Brian Cornell after the weak earnings. The article says Bill Gates is "taking a break from the future to examine his past" and "mulling where the billionaires now fit in." Brian Cornell's action after the earnings report was the $2B commitment. The question asks a philanthropic endeavor similar to Gates's current focus. Since Gates is looking at his past and philanthropy, but Cornell's action was a business commitment. The article doesn't mention a philanthropic project by Cornell, so answer N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The nonprofit that received Target's LGBTQ data before they stopped. The article says Target will no longer participate in external diversity surveys including "sharing data with the Human Rights Campaign". So the answer is Human Rights Campaign.
