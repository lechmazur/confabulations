Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and answer exactly what's asked. Let me start with the first question.

1. What was the total value of the artworks Mr. Geffen provided in exchange for the Giacometti sculpture, excluding the cash payment?

The article says Mr. Geffen turned over two artworks worth $55 million together plus $10.5 million cash. So excluding the cash, the artworks total $55 million. Answer is 55 million.

2. Which law firm represented Ms. Xiong in defending against the allegations of forged signatures?

Looking through the text, there's mention of Mr. Geffen's lawyer, Tibor L. Nagy, but nothing about a law firm for Ms. Xiong. The article doesn't state this, so N/A.

3. How many months passed between the unauthorized sale of the sculpture and Mr. Sun's discovery of the scheme through the fake deposit arrangement?

The suit says he discovered in December when he questioned the adviser about the lack of progress. The sale was part of the scheme Ms. Xiong did, but the exact sale date isn't given. The article mentions the sale was unauthorized and he found out "many months after." The exact number isn't provided, so N/A.

4. What was the name of the fictitious lawyer whose Gmail account was used in communications regarding the sale?

The article mentions a supposed lawyer who communicated via a Gmail account but doesn't provide the name. So N/A.

5. At which auction house did Mr. Sun originally purchase the Giacometti sculpture in 2021?

The article states he bought it at auction in 2021 with help from Ms. Xiong, but the auction house isn't named. So N/A.

6. What was the intended selling price that Mr. Sun communicated to his adviser for the Giacometti sculpture in 2023?

He expressed interest in finding a buyer for over $80 million. The exact intended price isn't specified beyond "more than $80 million." So the answer is over 80 million.

7. How many previous transactions had Ms. Xiong handled for the APENFT Foundation before the Giacometti sale?

The article mentions she suggested the sculpture would be part of APENFT's collection but doesn't state how many prior transactions. So N/A.

8. What was the installation location specified for the Giacometti sculpture in the metaverse platform mentioned by Ms. Xiong?

The article says the APENFT Foundation aimed to bridge art and the metaverse, but no specific location is given. So N/A.

9. Which art dealer first introduced Mr. Geffen to the possibility of acquiring the Giacometti sculpture?

No mention of a specific dealer introducing Geffen. The article talks about his representatives but not the dealer's name. N/A.

10. What was the duration of the warranty period provided in the sale agreement between Ms. Xiong and Mr. Geffen's representatives?

No mention of warranty period. N/A.

11. What was the title of the second artwork, besides "Comedian," that Mr. Sun acquired, mentioned in connection with the APENFT Foundation?

The article only mentions "Comedian" as the banana artwork. No second title given. N/A.

12. How much did Mr. Geffen initially offer in cash for "Le Nez," before the final agreement involving artworks and a reduced cash sum was reached?

The final agreement had $10.5 million cash. The article doesn't state an initial cash offer. N/A.

13. What type of professional email address did the supposed lawyer use, raising a red flag?

The fabricated lawyer used a personal Gmail account instead of a professional one. The red flag was the Gmail, so the answer is Gmail.

14. What was the name of the auction house where Mr. Sun purchased the Giacometti in 2021?

Same as question 5. Not mentioned. N/A.

15. Combined estimated value of three artworks? Wait, the question says "three artworks," but the article says two artworks worth $55 million plus cash. So the question's premise is wrong (three instead of two). Therefore N/A.

16. Specific instructions beyond replacing the banana for "Comedian's" certificate?

The article says installation instructions include replacing the banana whenever it rots. No other instructions mentioned. So N/A.

17. In what month of 2022 did Mr. Sun uncover the fraud?

The article says he uncovered it last December. Assuming the article is current (e.g., 2023), December 2022 would be correct. But the article says "last December" when the lawsuit was filed in 2023, so December 2022. Answer: December.

18. What legal action did Mr. Nagy threaten against Mr. Sun?

The statement called it "seller's remorse" but didn't mention specific legal action. The answer is N/A since the text doesn't state a specific threat beyond the statement.

19. Name of the legal firm the fake lawyer purportedly represented?

The article doesn't mention the firm's name. N/A.

20. Minimum price for all-cash deal?

Mr. Sun wanted over $80 million all-cash. So the minimum would be over 80 million. The answer is over 80 million.
