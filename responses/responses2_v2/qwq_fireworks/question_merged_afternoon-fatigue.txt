Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then look back at the article for the answers.

1. The first question asks about the percentage of people experiencing their strongest circadian dip between 1pm and 3pm according to a neurologist at Northwestern. The article mentions Dr. Ian Katznelson from that hospital, but I don't see any specific percentage stated. The text says people tend to have a dip, but no exact number. So that's N/A.

2. Dr. Das talked about insulin. The article says when you eat refined carbs, insulin is secreted, leading to a crash. But the question is which hormone prevents the crash with complex carbs. Since complex carbs don't cause a spike, maybe insulin is the answer here, but the question is phrased as "responsible for preventing." Wait, insulin is released regardless, but complex carbs don't cause a spike. So maybe the hormone is insulin, but I need to check. The article says insulin is involved in the surge and then the slump. The prevention would be avoiding insulin spikes, so the hormone causing the problem is insulin, but the question is about preventing the crash. Hmm, maybe the answer is insulin, but the wording is tricky. Wait, the question says "preventing the afternoon energy crash when complex carbohydrates are consumed." Since complex carbs avoid the insulin spike, the hormone that's responsible for the crash is insulin, but preventing it would mean less insulin. The article says complex carbs are less likely to cause an insulin spike. So the hormone is insulin. So answer is insulin.

3. The question is about the average length of the slump for adults with regular sleep schedules from Michigan Neuroscience Institute research. The article mentions Dr. Allada there, but doesn't give a duration. So N/A.

4. The question asks for milligrams of sugar triggering insulin response. The article doesn't mention a specific amount, just talks about sugary foods and refined carbs. So N/A.

5. Dr. Avidan said neurotransmitters linked to alertness become less active. The article doesn't name a specific neurotransmitter. So N/A.

6. The Society of Behavioral Sleep Medicine recommended a temperature change? The article mentions napping, prioritizing tasks, movement, but not temperature. N/A.

7. Required minutes of outdoor walking? The article says to go for a walk but no specific time. N/A.

8. Country with highest productivity due to afternoon rest? The article mentions some places embrace rest but doesn't name a country. N/A.

9. Dr. Allada's studies on when "second wind" begins. The article says people get a second wind in the early evening. So answer is early evening.

10. Calories for lunch to minimize crash? The article doesn't specify a number. N/A.

11. Time period of natural resurgence in alertness. The article mentions "second wind" in early evening. So early evening.

12. Time when people feel compelled to nap. The article mentions the clock striking 2 p.m., so 2 p.m.

13. Activity implicitly recommended? The article suggests a power nap, but the question says integrating cultural practices and rest. The example given is napping, so "taking a nap" or "rest period". But the question asks for an activity recommended. The article says "take a power nap" and "go outside for a walk". But the cultural practice is taking a rest, so maybe "napping" or "rest period".

Wait, the first paragraph mentions that some places have rest periods. The article says "some places... temporarily closing businesses or setting aside time to relax". The implicit recommendation would be taking a nap or resting. The direct recommendation given is "take a power nap". The question says "implicitly recommended for counteracting temporary sleepiness", so maybe "taking a nap" is the answer. The answer should be "power nap" but the question says integrating cultural practices. Hmm. The question says "single afternoon activity implicitly recommended". The article mentions "take a power nap" as a method. So maybe "power nap".

14. Healthier breakfast item: the article says replace doughnuts with eggs or whole-grain oatmeal. So eggs or whole-grain oatmeal. The question says "which breakfast item", so either. The example given in the article is "eggs or whole-grain oatmeal". The answer could be either, but the question is asking for one. Since the question says "which breakfast item", probably the first one mentioned, "eggs".

15. Breathing-related sleep condition exacerbating slump: the article mentions sleep apnea. Yes, under sleep disorders, "sleep apnea" is listed. So answer is sleep apnea.

16. The metaphor for the body being fully charged: the article says "the body is like a battery that is fully charged from getting a good night's sleep". So "battery".

17. Electronic device for masking sounds: the article mentions white noise machines in the recommendations. Yes, the last part says "White noise machines have the power to mask... Consider buying one." So answer is white noise machine.

18. Maximum power nap duration: the article says "keep it to 20 minutes or less". So 20 minutes.

19. Task type to prioritize during slump: "doing something that requires less focus", like sorting email or routine tasks. The answer is easy tasks.

20. Internal conflict causing the slump: the article says "sleep pressure and circadian rhythms... fighting each other". So "sleep pressure and circadian rhythms fighting each other".

Let me go through each again:

1. N/A (no percentage mentioned)
2. Insulin (since it's the hormone involved, and complex carbs avoid spikes)
3. N/A (no duration given)
4. N/A (no milligrams)
5. N/A (no specific neurotransmitter named)
6. N/A (no temp change)
7. N/A (no minutes)
8. N/A (no country named)
9. Early evening
10. N/A
11. Early evening
12. 2 p.m.
13. Power nap (since that's explicitly mentioned; cultural aspect is rest periods but the explicit recommendation is power nap)
14. Eggs or whole-grain oatmeal. The question asks for "which breakfast item", so either. Since the example says "eggs or whole-grain oatmeal", but the answer expects one, perhaps the first one. Alternatively, maybe "whole-grain oatmeal" is better as a complex carb. The article says "replacing breakfast foods like doughnuts and "sugar-spiked" coffee with more healthful alternatives like eggs or whole-grain oatmeal". So the answer could be "eggs" or "whole-grain oatmeal". The question says "which", so maybe either is acceptable, but the article lists both. Since the question says "which", perhaps either is okay. But maybe the answer is "whole-grain oatmeal" as a complex carb. Hmm. The question is about replacing sugary foods, so the healthier option is either. Since the user wants a direct answer, perhaps the first one. But the article lists both. Maybe the answer is "eggs" or "whole-grain oatmeal". Let me check the exact text again. The article says "consider replacing... with more healthful alternatives like eggs or whole-grain oatmeal". Since the question asks "which breakfast item", maybe the answer is "eggs" (the first one listed). Alternatively, maybe "whole-grain oatmeal" because it's a complex carb. The article says complex carbs are better, so perhaps "whole-grain oatmeal". The answer should be either, but the user might expect one. Let me check the article again. The article says "replacing breakfast foods like doughnuts... with more healthful alternatives like eggs or whole-grain oatmeal". The options are eggs or oatmeal. Since both are correct, but the question asks for "which", maybe the answer is "eggs or whole-grain oatmeal", but the instructions say to answer with a sentence fragment or words. Since the user wants a direct answer, perhaps "eggs" is acceptable. Alternatively, maybe "whole-grain oatmeal" because it's a complex carb explicitly mentioned. Hmm, the article says "complex carbs take longer to digest", so oatmeal is a complex carb. The question is about preventing the dip, so the correct answer is the complex carb, which is oatmeal. So maybe "whole-grain oatmeal". But the question is about the breakfast item, so either is correct. Since the article lists both, but the question says "which", perhaps either is acceptable. But I'll go with "whole-grain oatmeal" as the complex carb example.

15. Sleep apnea
16. Battery
17. White noise machine
18. 20 minutes
19. Easy tasks
20. Sleep pressure and circadian rhythms fighting each other (or "fighting each other")

Now, let me verify each answer again against the article text.

2. Dr. Das says complex carbs avoid insulin spike. The hormone responsible for the crash is insulin, so the prevention is less insulin spike. The question asks which hormone is responsible for preventing the crash when complex carbs are consumed. Since insulin is the hormone involved, but complex carbs prevent its spike, the answer is insulin. So yes, insulin.

14. The article says "eggs or whole-grain oatmeal" so the answer is either. Since the question asks "which breakfast item", I'll pick the first one mentioned, "eggs".

20. The article says "the pressure to sleep is winning the fight" between sleep pressure and circadian rhythms. So the conflict is sleep pressure vs. circadian rhythms. The answer is "sleep pressure and circadian rhythms fighting each other".

Okay, I think that's all. Now, time to write the answers in the required format.
