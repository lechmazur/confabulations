Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks about the operating system of the smartphone Dr. Lembke got due to Duo Security. The article mentions she got a smartphone in 2019 for work. In medical settings, especially for security like Duo, Android is commonly used. But the article doesn’t specify. Wait, maybe the article just says she got a smartphone, but doesn't mention the OS. Hmm, so maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "smartphone" but doesn't specify OS. So answer is N/A? Or maybe assuming it's common, but the article doesn't say. So N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The timeline mentions before social media (which started around 2015-2016) but after internet pornography (early 2000s). The article says around 2012-2013, teenage boys had gaming disorders. The question asks about teenage girls. The article doesn't mention girls specifically here. So maybe N/A? Or is there something else? The article says "primarily men" for porn and gaming. The next was social media, shopping, gambling in 2015-16. The question is about something before social media affecting girls. Not mentioned. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The specific betting platform mentioned? The article says online sports betting has exploded. It doesn't name a platform. So N/A. Unless "online sports betting" is considered the answer, but the question asks for a specific platform. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The plenty paradox and shift to digital drugs might reduce a physical ailment like liver failure (since the sister died of liver failure from alcoholism). If people turn to digital instead of alcohol, that could reduce liver issues. So answer: liver failure.

5. **Question 5**: The young woman was prescribed an antidepressant. She nodded off. Common antidepressants for mood disorders in her time (early in Dr. Lembke's career, which would be around 2000s?) might be SSRIs like Prozac, Zoloft, or maybe tricyclics. The article says "antidepressant" without specifics. But nodding off could be from something like mirtazapine (which causes sedation) or maybe an SSRI. But the article doesn't specify. So N/A? Or maybe the article mentions "antidepressant" but not which class. So N/A.

Wait, the article says "prescribing an antidepressant" but doesn't specify. So answer N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The question asks for a brand other than Ozempic or Mounjaro. The article mentions those two, but doesn't list another. GLP-1 agonists include drugs like Wegovy, but the article doesn't mention it. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The philosophical school contrasting self-focus. The article mentions narcissism and therapy-speak. The antidote might be something like Stoicism, which emphasizes self-discipline and not self-absorption. But the article doesn't name a school. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The alcoholic beverage associated with celebrations that Gen Z might drink less. The article says Gen Z spends time scrolling instead of drinking. Maybe champagne or beer? The article doesn't specify a beverage. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Architectural feature from Yosemite. The article mentions Yosemite Valley's natural beauty, so maybe a natural setting like a wooden structure or open spaces. The question is about a feature to encourage lingering. Maybe "open spaces" or "fire pits"? The article says they played board games, but the feature would be something like a natural amphitheater? Not specified. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The profession of Dr. Lembke's father was a surgeon. If isolation increases, maybe surgeons might have more issues? Or the profession needing emotional support replaced by tech? The article says "profession" related to his father's alcoholism. The question asks which profession might have surge in demand due to tech replacing human interaction. Maybe therapists? But the father was a surgeon. The question says "specific profession mentioned in context of his father's alcoholism" – the father was a surgeon. So maybe surgeons? But the question is about a profession that will see surge. The article doesn't say. N/A?

Wait, the question is asking what profession might experience a surge in demand due to tech replacing human interaction. The father was a surgeon, but the answer might be surgeons? Not sure. The article doesn't link surgeons to future demand. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The first behavior was internet pornography and masturbation in early 2000s, then gaming in 2012-13, then social media/shopping/gambling later. The first indicator was internet pornography. So answer: internet pornography addiction.

12. **Question 12**: The author used Ozempic for food issues, and it's noted for helping alcohol addiction. So answer: Ozempic.

13. **Question 13**: The household policy was no devices until high school. The article says they didn't have internet or smartphone until the daughter needed it for high school. So answer: no home internet or smartphones until high school.

14. **Question 14**: The paradox is the plenty paradox, which is the more we have, the worse off. So answer: plenty paradox.

15. **Question 15**: The pivotal family member was her father's alcoholism. The article says her father's alcoholism was a major factor in her childhood. So answer: father.

16. **Question 16**: The period when online gaming became evident was 2012-2013. The question asks when clinical concerns over gaming emerged. Answer: 2012-2013.

17. **Question 17**: Emerging device mentioned is wearable like glasses or implants. The article mentions glasses and implants. So answer: wearable glasses or "wearable devices like glasses". But the question asks for a specific one mentioned, which is glasses.

18. **Question 18**: The class is GLP-1 agonists, as per the article. Answer: GLP-1 agonists.

19. **Question 19**: The author managed compulsive eating with Ozempic but still had online shopping. So answer: compulsive relationship with food.

20. **Question 20**: Yosemite Valley. The family went there. Answer: Yosemite Valley.
