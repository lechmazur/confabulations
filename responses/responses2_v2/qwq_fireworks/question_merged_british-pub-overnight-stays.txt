Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each question precisely. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question is about the Swan Hotel's specific avian-related regulation similar to the 1786 "Rules of the Inn" at the Exhibition. The article mentions the Swan's name relates to swan upping, a royal tradition. However, the article doesn't mention any specific rules implemented by the Swan Hotel like the Exhibition's historical flyer. So, I think this is N/A because there's no info on their rules.

2. The second question asks about an innovative brewing technique the Exhibition adopted, similar to Fuller's sale to Asahi. The Exhibition's regulars talked about fresh beer (path of foam), but the article doesn't mention any specific brewing technique. The only brewing mention is about Fuller's selling to Asahi. So, N/A here too.

3. The Bell in Ticehurst has bowler hat lampshades. The question asks which pub with a complementary aesthetic (maybe quirky decor) would collaborate. The Swan has a sloping floor from its age. The article says the Swan's room had a sloping floor. So maybe the Swan? But need to check if it's listed on Stay in a Pub. Yes, the Swan is part of Fuller's, which is listed. So answer: Swan Hotel on the River Thames.

4. The Exhibition's complimentary breakfast includes a plant-based option besides the full English. The article says the Swan has a plant-based version, but for the Exhibition's breakfast, it's described as "generous complimentary breakfast" with avocado toast and poached eggs. Are those vegetarian? Eggs are not vegan, but the question asks besides the plant-based option. Wait, the Exhibition's breakfast isn't specified beyond that. The article doesn't mention other vegetarian options except the plant-based breakfast. So maybe N/A?

Wait, the question says "besides the plant-based full English breakfast" â€” but the Exhibition's breakfast isn't stated to have a plant-based option. The Swan's includes it, but the question is about the Exhibition. The article says the Swan has a plant-based version, but the Exhibition's breakfast isn't detailed beyond the example of avocado and eggs. So the answer would be N/A because the text doesn't mention other vegetarian options at the Exhibition.

5. The Cask Marque certification by Paul Nunny. The Exhibition's Victoria room has soundproofing, but what else? The room had a bed with pillows, espresso machine, etc. Cask Marque is about beer quality. The room's features might not relate. Maybe the beer's freshness? But the question is about the room's feature. Since Cask Marque is for beer, perhaps N/A because the room's features aren't related to beer certification. So answer N/A.

6. Pub golf attire includes tams and argyle. The question asks for another mandatory item for the Swan's guests. The Manchester couple mentioned the golf attire but no specific items beyond tams and argyle. So N/A.

7. The Exhibition was a private home with stables. Queen Elizabeth I's survey categorized into inns, taverns, alehouses. Since it had stables, maybe it's an inn. So answer: inns.

8. The Exhibition's ghost moved paintings. The Swan's spirits? The article only mentions the Exhibition's ghost story. The Swan's manager didn't mention any. So the question asks about the Swan's spirit action leading to a complaint, but there's no info. So N/A.

9. Stay in a Pub's unique amenity related to the Exhibition's 1702 history. The Exhibition's history as a private home with stables. The Swan has a river view. The article doesn't mention Stay in a Pub introducing an amenity based on that. Maybe N/A.

10. Nearby medieval structure to Exhibition in York. The article says York has medieval walls. So answer: York's medieval walls.

11. The Bell in Ticehurst is noted by Rae Barnes as remote with bowler hats. Yes, that's directly stated. So answer: The Bell in Ticehurst.

12. The York pub with the ghost story is the Exhibition. The guest fled with towel, paintings moved. Answer: The Exhibition.

13. Three-story whitewashed, near Thames, chicken dish. That's the Swan. Answer: The Swan Hotel.

14. The monarch who categorized pubs was Queen Elizabeth I. Answer: Queen Elizabeth I.

15. The platform with 1,600 pubs is Stay in a Pub. Answer: Stay in a Pub.

16. The term for everyday drinking places evolving into pubs was alehouses. Answer: alehouses.

17. Chicken with tarragon risotto at PS16.50 is at the Swan. Answer: The Swan Hotel.

18. Refurbished rooms with modern amenities and sloping floor: the Swan's room had that. Answer: The Swan Hotel.

19. Cask Marque was founded by Paul Nunny. Answer: Paul Nunny.

20. Lager at the Swan is Fuller's Frontier, even after sold to Asahi. Answer: Fuller's Frontier lager.
