Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks about the percentage decrease in sexual frequency for Generation X compared to the 78% drop in the teenage birthrate between 1991 and 2022, according to Jean Twenge. The article mentions that Gen X had a 9% drop in sexual frequency. The 78% figure is about the teenage birthrate, but the question is asking for the Gen X sexual frequency decrease, which is 9%. So the answer is 9%.

2. The second question is about the specific establishment where the author got a morning-after pill. The article says she went to a clinic for the pill. The question also mentions clitoral stimulators in pharmacies today, but the answer here is "clinic".

3. The third question asks about the clothing item the editor wore as "Rape Man" at Halloween. The article states the editor showed up in tight white underwear and a cape. The specific item is "tight white underwear".

4. The author's vogueing house had five members, and two died from AIDS by 1992. The question is how many were alive when the editor was sitting on her lap. The editor's actions are mentioned after 1992, so three remained. But the article doesn't explicitly state when the editor was sitting on her lap, but since the deaths were in 1992, and the editor's action is mentioned after college (1992), so 3?

Wait, the article says two out of five were dead by 1992, so three were alive. The answer should be 3.

5. The author's divorce ended a 20-year relationship, and the iPhone was introduced in 2007. The author was born in 1973, so divorce in 2019 (46-24=1973, so divorce in 2019). The iPhone came in 2007, so that's the year. The answer is 2007.

6. The question is about the beauty treatment the author's mother had. The article mentions Botox, fillers, etc., but the author's mother is described as being in a time when she was a single parent, but there's no mention of specific treatments. The author herself talks about vaginal rejuvenation, but the mother's treatment isn't mentioned. So N/A.

7. The median age for first divorce in 1980 was 30, and the author lost her virginity at 15 (born 1973, so 15 in 1988). The question asks for the median age in the year she lost her virginity (1988). The article says in 1980 it was 30, but doesn't give 1988's data. So N/A.

8. The specific alcoholic beverage mentioned in the author's new frills after divorce is Japanese whiskey. The question mentions Kathleen Hanna and the glass ceiling. The article says the author had Japanese whiskey. The answer is Japanese whiskey.

9. The band is Bikini Kill, as mentioned with Kathleen Hanna. The year two members died was 1992. The quote by David Friend is from the same year. So the band is Bikini Kill.

10. The household chore that was a faraway dream is taking a shower. The article mentions "a shower seems like a faraway dream".

11. The digital turning point is the iPhone in 2007. The article says the spiral began when the iPhone was introduced in 2007.

12. The generational cohort with 9% decline is Generation X.

13. The first perimenopausal novel is "All Fours" by Miranda July.

14. The tech innovation is the iPhone, introduced in 2007, which marked the digital era's impact.

15. The botanical metaphor is "perennials" or "hardy garden perennials".

16. The actress is Nicole Kidman (57) mentioned in two movies with younger men.

17. The decline in young adults' sexual frequency is 30% as per the article.

18. The author's hometown is Montreal.

19. The Montreal event is the first vogue ball they won in 1991.

20. The survey is the General Social Survey from 1989-2022.
