Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not assume anything beyond that.

1. **Question 1:** The article says Kendrick Lamar won five Grammys for "Not Like Us," including song and record of the year. But the question asks about a collaboration with SZA. The article mentions SZA as a guest star this year but doesn't link her to the Grammy wins. So the answer should be N/A because the Grammy wins are for a different track.

2. **Question 2:** The article mentions "Inspire Change" donates tens of millions but doesn't specify the amount or time frame (2019-2023). Since the exact figure isn't given, N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The article states Maroon 5 underwhelmed nearly 100 million viewers, and the 2022 show had Snoop Dogg etc. But there's no viewership percentage decline mentioned between those two events. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The text says Roc Nation hasn't brought country stars like Carrie Underwood or Morgan Wallen. It doesn't say they approached any before choosing The Weeknd. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The Jennifer Lopez performance controversy is mentioned, but the HBCU band performing with her isn't named. The article mentions Southern University's band this year, but not for her show. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The article says NFL officials were displeased with parts of Lopez's show but doesn't mention how many minutes were cut. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Rihanna declined the invite in solidarity with Kaepernick but the article doesn't say where she redirected her fee. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The timeline mentions R&B in the 1990s with artists like Michael Jackson, but no percentage given. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Before Roc Nation (started post-2019?), the last classic rock performer was Tom Petty or Bruce Springsteen. The article lists them as part of the classic rock phase before Roc Nation. The latest mentioned would be Tom Petty or Springsteen. The exact last one isn't specified, but the article says after 2004 pivot to classic rock, so maybe the last one before Roc Nation (which started in 2022?) would be someone like Bruce Springsteen. Wait, the Roc Nation era started after 2019. The last classic rock headliner mentioned is Tom Petty (2017?) but the article doesn't specify exact years. The article says "Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen" as part of the classic rock era, but the exact last one isn't stated. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Kyle Smith's role is NFL's fashion editor, not involved in selecting performers. The article says his job is using fashion to reach audiences through media. So answer N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The article says "Inspire Change" donates tens of millions, but exact millions not specified. N/A.

12. **Question 12:** The Netflix documentary is mentioned with Lopez's manager discussing NFL's concerns. The title isn't given, so N/A.

13. **Question 13:** The article says Kyle Smith has a role using fashion to reach new audiences, but no specific item named. N/A.

14. **Question 14:** The ESPN doc is with Jemele Hill and director Spike Lee. The article says "with the director Spike Lee," so Spike Lee.

15. **Question 15:** The 2019 halftime show was Maroon 5, as mentioned in the first part. The question asks for the pop band in 2019, so Maroon 5.

16. **Question 16:** The coach who sued is mentioned three years ago from the article's context (assuming current year is 2024, so 2021). The article doesn't name the coach, just mentions the lawsuit. So N/A.
