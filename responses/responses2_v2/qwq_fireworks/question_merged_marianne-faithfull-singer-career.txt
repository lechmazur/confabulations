Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I'm only using the information from the provided article. Let me start by reading through the questions again and then cross-referencing them with the article.

1. **Ailment related to Tennyson's poem and palliative care sign**: The article mentions Faithfull had hepatitis, breast cancer, and a recent bout of Covid-19. The palliative care sign is linked to her recovery from that recent illness. The poem referenced is "Lady of Shalott" by Tennyson. But the question asks for the ailment that mirrored the poem's narrative. Since the article says her brushes with death influenced her art, maybe the specific ailment mentioned when talking about the spoken-word project is Covid-19. But the article says "most recently a bout of Covid-19" led to the sign. However, the question is about the ailment that mirrored the poem's narrative. The poem's narrative is about someone who dies tragically. The article says she survived, so maybe it's the one that put her in a coma again. But the question is about the ailment that matches the poem's arc. The article says "she allowed a glimpse of the other side to inform her art" after surviving, so perhaps the recent illness (Covid-19) is the answer here. The question is a bit tricky, but the article says "most recently a bout of Covid-19 that put her, once again, in a coma. The sign on the foot of her bed read 'Palliative care only.' But she upended expectations once more, surviving..." So the answer is likely Covid-19. But wait, the question says "mirrored the narrative arc of a Tennyson poem". The Tennyson poem mentioned is "Lady of Shalott". The article says she did a spoken-word album of Romantic poems, including Tennyson's. The article says "the sign on the foot of her bed read 'Palliative care only.' But she upended expectations once more, surviving and soon returning to a passion project... a spoken-word album of recitations of classic Romantic poems." The ailment linked to that would be the recent one causing the coma, which is Covid-19. So the answer is Covid-19. But the question says "the narrative arc of a Tennyson poem she recited". The Tennyson poem she recited was "Lady of Shalott", so the ailment that led to the coma and the palliative sign was Covid-19. So answer: Covid-19.

2. **Year Australia permitted uncensored release of Heathcote Williams' piece**: The article states that "Why D'Ya Do It" by Heathcote Williams was deemed too obscene for Australia until 1988. So the answer is 1988.

3. **Literary work recommended by the person who introduced Jagger to Ginsberg, inspiring a song about Satan**: Faithfull introduced Jagger to Allen Ginsberg and "The Master and Margarita". The article says "Faithfull made more of a mark on Jagger by exposing him to art, literature and theater... She was the one who told him to read Mikhail Bulgakov's novel 'The Master and Margarita'... the result was 'Sympathy for the Devil'." The question asks for the literary work recommended by the person who introduced Jagger to Ginsberg (Faithfull introduced him to Ginsberg). So the answer is "The Master and Margarita".

4. **Title of the ballet with Rudolf Nureyev that influenced a Rolling Stones song**: The article mentions "Paradise Lost" as the ballet Faithfull took Jagger to, which ended with Nureyev leaping into a crimson mouth. The article says this had an impact, leading to "Sympathy for the Devil" (since that's the song inspired by the novel). So the ballet's title is "Paradise Lost".

5. **Substance that prompted Faithfull's first songwriting credit on a Rolling Stones album**: The article states that her heroin use led her to write lyrics for "Sister Morphine", which was on the Stones' 1971 album "Sticky Fingers". So the substance is heroin.

6. **Name of the record label executive who sent her a telegram after a party**: Andrew Loog Oldham, the Stones' manager, saw her at a party and sent the telegram. The article says "Andrew Loog Oldham, the brash young manager of the Rolling Stones... sent Faithfull a telegram telling her to come to Olympic Studios".

7. **University Faithfull planned to attend**: The article says she planned to study at Oxford, carrying literature on her first tour. Answer: Oxford.

8. **Title of the first song by Jagger/Richards, which Faithfull had a hit with**: The first original Jagger/Richards song she had a hit with is "As Tears Go By". The question is phrased as "the first song written by the duo who composed 'As Tears Go By'...", but "As Tears Go By" itself is their first song. So the answer is "As Tears Go By".

9. **Profession of Faithfull's first husband**: Her first husband was John Dunbar, an artist. The article says "then-husband, the artist John Dunbar".

10. **Studio where she was summoned by Oldham**: Olympic Studios. The article says "sent Faithfull a telegram telling her to come to Olympic Studios for a session".

11. **Ballet with Rudolf Nureyev that influenced Stones song**: Same as question 4, "Paradise Lost".

12. **Controversial poem by Allen Ginsberg on *Broken English***: The article mentions Faithfull recorded her own version of "Sister Morphine" but the question is about a poem by Ginsberg. Wait, the article says she introduced Jagger to Ginsberg but doesn't mention a specific poem by Ginsberg on the album. Wait, the article says "Why D'Ya Do It" by Heathcote Williams was on "Broken English". The question says "controversial poem by Allen Ginsberg" but the article doesn't mention Ginsberg's poem on the album. So maybe this is a trick. The article only mentions Ginsberg as someone she introduced Jagger to, not a poem on her album. So the answer would be N/A. Wait, but the article says "the poet Heathcote Williams". The question says "poem by Allen Ginsberg" but the answer might be N/A. Wait the question says "the controversial poem by Allen Ginsberg that Faithfull recorded for *Broken English*", but the article doesn't mention Ginsberg's poem on that album. The only poem mentioned is Heathcote Williams'. So this would be N/A. Wait the question says "the controversial poem by Allen Ginsberg"â€”so answer N/A.

Wait, the article says "Why D'Ya Do It" by Heathcote Williams. So the answer is N/A because it's not Ginsberg's poem. So answer N/A.

13. **Years between debut hit and gothic cabaret phase**: Her debut hit was "As Tears Go By" in 1964. The gothic cabaret phase started in the last several decades of her career. The article says "in the last several decades of her improbably long career, she channeled her voice's rich smokiness into a third act as a kind of gothic cabaret singer, personalizing expert interpretations of Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen and Nick Cave, among others." The article also mentions "starting with her corrosive 1979 masterpiece 'Broken English'". So the transition into gothic cabaret started after 1979? The article says "the last several decades" so maybe from the 1990s onwards? The question is how many years after 1964 was that. If the gothic phase started in the 90s, that's about 25-30 years. But the article says "starting with her 1979 album... but in the last several decades...". Wait, maybe the transition into gothic cabaret started after 1979. The exact question is "how many years after her debut hit did Faithfull begin her transition into gothic cabaret by covering Nick Cave and Leonard Cohen?" The debut hit was 1964, and the transition into gothic cabaret (as a third act) is mentioned after her 1979 album. The article says "in the last several decades of her improbably long career, she channeled her voice... into a third act as a kind of gothic cabaret singer". The last several decades from when? She died in 2025, so "last several decades" would mean from the 1990s onwards. The difference between 1964 and 1990 is 26 years. But the article says "starting with her 1979 masterpiece... years of substance abuse had transformed her voice... eventually, in the last several decades..." So maybe the transition into gothic cabaret started around the time of "Broken English" (1979), which is 15 years after 1964. But the question specifies "by covering Nick Cave and Leonard Cohen". The article says she did that in her third act, which started in the last several decades. The exact number isn't given, so maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, if the transition began with "Broken English" in 1979, that's 15 years after 1964. The question says "transition into gothic cabaret by covering..." so maybe 15 years. But the article says "starting with her corrosive 1979 masterpiece 'Broken English'... eventually, in the last several decades...". The exact years aren't specified. Since the question asks for the number of years, and it's not explicitly stated, the answer would be N/A. But wait the article says "starting with her 1979 masterpiece... years of substance abuse had transformed her voice into a punky survivor's croak. Eventually, in the last several decades of her improbably long career, she channeled her voice's rich smokiness into a third act as a kind of gothic cabaret singer..." So "Eventually" after 1979. The "last several decades" would mean from, say, 1990s. So 1990-1964=26. But the exact number isn't there, so N/A.

14. **Romantic poet excluded from her final spoken-word project**: The article mentions her final project was a spoken-word album of Romantic poems, including Tennyson's "Lady of Shalott". It doesn't mention any excluded poets. So the answer is N/A.

15. **Film where Faithfull first used the F-word in a major movie**: The article says she was the first person to say the F-word in a major motion picture. The name of the film isn't provided. So answer N/A.

16. **Literary genre Faithfull studied at Oxford**: The article says she was planning to study at Oxford, carrying classic British literature. But it doesn't specify the genre. The question asks for the genre. Since she carried British literature, maybe the genre is "British literature", but the article doesn't specify the genre as a field of study. So answer N/A.

17. **Artist who painted *Broken English* cover**: The article doesn't mention the cover artwork's artist. So N/A.

18. **Original title of the Rolling Stones song named by Faithfull upon waking from coma**: The song is "Wild Horses", as she said "wild horses couldn't drag me away" when she awoke. The article says "the origin myth of this song has been long debated and will probably never be settled for sure, but still, what a story!" The song in question is "Wild Horses", but the article doesn't say if that was its original title. The question asks for the original title. Since the song's original title is "Wild Horses", but maybe the question is implying that the original title was different. However, the article doesn't mention any other title. So answer: Wild Horses.

19. **Label that refused her *Sister Morphine* due to image concerns**: The article says her label pulled it. The label's name isn't mentioned, so N/A.
