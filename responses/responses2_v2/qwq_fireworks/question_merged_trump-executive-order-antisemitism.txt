Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and answer strictly based on that. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. The first question asks how many agencies besides the State and Education Departments were directed by the executive order. The article says the order directed "several agencies, including the State and Education Departments". Since it includes those two but doesn't specify others, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question is how many besides those two. The article doesn't list others, so the answer is N/A.

2. The second question is about Columbia's disciplinary action against the student involved in the antisemitic fliers. The article says "three of the protesters have been identified; one, a Columbia student, was suspended." So the answer is suspension.

3. NYU's policy says excluding Zionists from an open event is discriminatory. The question asks what type of event, so the answer is an open event.

4. The Pakistani student is mentioned alongside another Rhodes scholar. The article says "two Rhodes scholars. One of the Rhodes scholars was an international student from Pakistan." The other must be the other Rhodes scholar, but their nationality isn't stated. Wait, the question asks the nationality of the other Rhodes scholar (since the Pakistani is one). The article doesn't specify, so N/A?

Wait, the question says "the Rhodes scholar, mentioned alongside the Pakistani international student, who faced punishment..." So maybe the other Rhodes scholar is the one not from Pakistan. But the article says "two Rhodes scholars. One of the Rhodes scholars was an international student from Pakistan." So the other is not Pakistani, but their nationality isn't given. So answer N/A.

5. The December 2024 report questioned Mayorkas about revoking visas for students advocating for elimination of Israel. The report's reason is that the Biden admin didn't answer whether to revoke visas for such advocacy. So the primary reason cited was the refusal to clarify visa revocation for students advocating the elimination of Israel and attacks on Jewish individuals.

6. Mayorkas cited legal interpretation as the reason. The article says he said it was a matter of legal interpretation. So the answer is legal interpretation.

7. Momodou Taal was suspended for shutting down a recruitment event and maybe another action. The article mentions he was suspended twice for pro-Palestinian activism. The other action isn't specified beyond the recruitment event shutdown. The question asks besides the recruitment event, so maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "shut down a recruitment event last fall that included weapons manufacturers. Suspended twice by the university for his pro-Palestinian activism." The second suspension's reason isn't stated, so N/A.

8. The Columbia course was "History of Modern Israel".

9. The Cornell event was a recruitment event involving weapons manufacturers.

10. The president who said international students are a source of pride is Claudine Gay of Harvard. The article says "Claudine Gay, then the president of Harvard... replied that international students were a source of pride..."

11. The university that suspended a student and barred others after the executive order's directive is Columbia, as mentioned in the article's example about the History of Modern Israel class disruption.

12. NYU's policy mentions "code words, like 'Zionist'" as potential discriminatory speech.

13. The university that barred the Pakistani Rhodes scholar is Harvard, as mentioned in the Harvard commencement example.

14. The federal department that confirmed no visas revoked is the State Department, mentioned in May the State Department told the committee no visas revoked.

15. The congressional committee's report in December 2024 was from the House Judiciary Committee, as the report says the Biden admin rebuffed requests from the House Judiciary for documents on students' nationalities supporting Hamas.

16. The university allowing Momodou Taal to stay enrolled despite a ban is Cornell, as the provost allowed him to remain enrolled but banned from campus.

17. The Jewish organization supporting enforcement while emphasizing due process is the Anti-Defamation League, via Jonathan Greenblatt.

18. The university with the student activist fearing deportation is UCLA, as the student there was considering leaving after graduation.

19. The university with the walkout at commencement is Harvard, where hundreds walked out over barring 13 seniors, including the Rhodes scholar.

Now, let me check each answer again against the text.

1. The question is how many agencies besides State and Education. The article says "directed several agencies, including the State and Education Departments"â€”so the total number isn't given, so the number besides is not stated. So answer N/A.

2. Columbia suspended one student, so answer suspension.

3. The example given is excluding Zionists from an open event.

4. The other Rhodes scholar's nationality isn't mentioned. So N/A.

5. The report's primary reason was the refusal to clarify visa revocation for students advocating elimination of Israel.

6. Legal interpretation.

7. The other action besides the recruitment event isn't specified. The article only mentions the recruitment event as the action leading to suspension. Since the question asks for another action besides that, maybe N/A.

8. History of Modern Israel.

9. Recruitment event with weapons manufacturers.

10. Claudine Gay, Harvard's president.

11. Columbia.

12. Zionist.

13. Harvard.

14. State Department.

15. House Judiciary Committee's report.

16. Cornell.

17. Anti-Defamation League.

18. UCLA.

19. Harvard.
