Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked without adding any extra info or assumptions. Let me start from the first question.

1. **Question 1:** Which European countries saw the greatest reduction in obesity rates after implementing front-of-package warning labels similar to the FDA's proposed design?

Looking through the article, there's a part mentioning Chile was first in 2016, and then over a dozen countries like Canada, Australia, Ecuador, and the UK. But the question asks for European countries with the greatest reduction. The UK is European. However, the article doesn't mention specific countries with the "greatest reduction" in obesity rates. It just lists some countries that adopted similar labels. So the answer here is N/A because the article doesn't state which European countries had the most reduction.

2. **Question 2:** How many focus group participants specifically indicated that the black-and-white box design would influence their purchasing decisions at grocery stores?

The article says the proposed labels scored highest among 10,000 participants. But it doesn't specify how many of them said it influenced purchasing. The exact number isn't given, so N/A.

3. **Question 3:** What percentage decrease in Type 2 diabetes cases did the FDA project would result from the new labeling system within the first year of implementation?

The article mentions the FDA's figures on healthcare costs and prevalence of chronic illnesses but doesn't provide projected percentage decreases for specific diseases like Type 2 diabetes. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Which major food manufacturer was the first to voluntarily adopt the Facts up Front labeling system in 2011?

The article states that "Facts up Front" was introduced in 2011 by the industry, but no specific company is named as the first adopter. The Consumer Brands Association represents companies using it, but no individual manufacturer is mentioned. Therefore, N/A.

5. **Question 5:** What was the average time savings for shoppers reading the new front-of-package labels compared to reviewing the traditional Nutrition Facts panel?

The article discusses the new labels being easier to comprehend quickly but doesn't mention specific time savings. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** How many different front-of-package label designs did the FDA test before selecting the final black-and-white box format?

The article says they tested prospective designs with focus groups and the proposed labels scored highest, but the exact number of designs tested isn't stated. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** What threshold level of added sugar triggers a "high" rating on the proposed front-of-package label?

The article mentions the labels rank sugar, fat, and salt as high, medium, or low based on F.D.A. daily values, but specific numerical thresholds aren't provided. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Which demographic group showed the strongest comprehension of the percentage daily value information on existing nutrition labels according to the FDA's research?

The article states that lower education levels found the existing labels confusing, implying higher education groups might understand better. But the text doesn't explicitly name a demographic group with the strongest comprehension. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** How many months did food manufacturers request to extend the proposed four-year compliance timeline?

The article mentions companies criticized the rule but doesn't state they requested an extension. The compliance time is up to four years, but no info on requested extensions. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** What percentage of products currently using the voluntary Facts up Front system would receive a "high" rating for at least one nutrient under the new FDA criteria?

The article doesn't provide this percentage. It only contrasts the two systems but no overlap data. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** What percentage of annual U.S. healthcare costs are attributed to chronic illnesses linked to sugar, salt, and saturated fat, according to the F.D.A. commissioner's statement?

The article says "More than 60 percent of American adults suffer from those three chronic illnesses, which are estimated to account for $4.5 trillion in annual health care costs, according to the F.D.A." The percentage of costs isn't given, but the $4.5 trillion is the total. Since the question asks for a percentage of annual U.S. healthcare costs, but the article only provides the dollar amount, not the percentage, this is N/A. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The exact quote is: "More than 60 percent of American adults suffer from those three chronic illnesses, which are estimated to account for $4.5 trillion in annual health care costs, according to the F.D.A." So the $4.5 trillion is the cost attributed, but the question asks for the percentage of total healthcare costs. Since the article doesn't state the total, can't compute the percentage. So N/A.

Wait, but maybe the question is asking for the $4.5 trillion as the total, but the question is phrased as "what percentage of annual U.S. healthcare costs are attributed..." which would require knowing the total healthcare spending. Since the article doesn't give the total, can't answer. So N/A.

12. **Question 12:** What artificial sweetener did Xaq Frohlich suggest food manufacturers might use to avoid a "high sugar" label under the new F.D.A. rules, despite potential health concerns?

The article mentions Xaq Frohlich's example where manufacturers might replace sugar with an artificial sweetener, but doesn't name which one. So N/A.

13. **Question 13:** What nutrient did Senator Bernie Sanders criticize the F.D.A. for excluding from the front-of-package labels despite its association with ultra-processed foods?

The article says Sanders criticized the labels as "pathetically weak" because they didn't clearly convey health risks of ultra-processed foods. The excluded nutrient isn't specified. The labels include sugar, salt, and saturated fat. Maybe he wanted more, like calories? The question is about a nutrient. Since the article doesn't mention a specific nutrient, N/A.

14. **Question 14:** What is the name of the industry-backed labeling scheme that the Consumer Brands Association claims outperforms the F.D.A.'s proposed design in conveying calorie information?

The article states that the industry prefers "Facts up Front," which includes calorie counts. The Consumer Brands Association's statement mentions the FDA's labels lack calorie info, so the industry's scheme is Facts up Front. So answer: Facts up Front.

15. **Question 15:** Which chronic illness mentioned in the article is directly linked to excessive sodium intake but was not explicitly listed as a reason for the front-of-package salt warnings?

The article lists Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure as linked to the three nutrients. High blood pressure is from salt. The FDA's warnings are for those three, so maybe another illness? The article mentions "high blood pressure" as one of the listed reasons. Wait, the question is asking for a chronic illness linked to sodium that wasn't listed. The three mentioned are Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. The salt warnings are for those. So maybe there's another one? The article doesn't mention another. So N/A.

Wait, the salt's role is in high blood pressure, which is listed. So the answer would be N/A because all sodium-related issues mentioned are included.

16. **Question 16:** What is the total number of countries cited in the article that have adopted front-of-package warning labels similar to Chile's system since 2016?

The article says "more than a dozen countries have adopted similar labels" since 2016, including Canada, Australia, Ecuador, and the UK. "More than a dozen" is vague, but the exact number isn't given. The question asks for the total number cited, but the text only lists four examples. Since the article doesn't state the exact number, N/A.

17. **Question 17:** Which F.D.A. initiative from August, mentioned alongside the front-of-package labels, specifically targeted reducing a nutrient not covered by the new labeling rules?

The article mentions in August, FDA issued voluntary guidelines to lower sodium in processed foods. The new labels cover salt (sodium), so maybe that's covered. Wait, the new labels do include salt. Wait the question says "a nutrient not covered by the new labeling rules". The labels cover sugar, salt, and saturated fat. The August initiative was about sodium, which is covered. Hmm, maybe the answer is the sodium reduction? But since sodium is covered, maybe another nutrient? Wait, the article says "the agency updated the definitions of the term 'healthy' for labeling on foods, which tightened limits on saturated fat, sugar and salt in food. In August, the F.D.A. issued voluntary guidelines aimed at pressing food manufacturers to lower the amount of sodium in processed and packaged goods." So the August initiative was about sodium. Since sodium is already covered in the labels, maybe the answer is sodium, but the question says a nutrient not covered. Hmm, perhaps the answer is N/A because the August initiative was about sodium, which is covered. Wait, maybe the question is a trick. The August initiative is about sodium, which is covered, so it's covered. Then maybe another? The article doesn't mention another nutrient. So N/A.

Wait, the question says "targeted reducing a nutrient not covered by the new labeling rules". The new labels do cover salt (sodium), so the August initiative's target (sodium) is covered. Therefore, there's no such nutrient. So answer N/A.

18. **Question 18:** What is the name of the artificial sweetener that Dr. Lauren Fiechtner identified as a common replacement for sugar in reformulated products, based on her analysis of label comprehension challenges?

The article quotes Dr. Fiechtner talking about label comprehension, but doesn't mention any specific artificial sweetener. The mention of sweeteners comes from Xaq Frohlich's example, not Dr. Fiechtner. So N/A.
