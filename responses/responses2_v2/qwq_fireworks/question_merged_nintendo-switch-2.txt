Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information given in the article and answer each question exactly as specified. Let's start with the first question.

1. **Resolution of the Switch 2's screen in pixels?** The article mentions a "larger hand-held display" but doesn't specify the resolution. So, that's N/A.

2. **Battery life in portable mode?** The article doesn't mention battery life details. N/A again.

3. **First Universal Studios location with Nintendo attractions?** The article says Nintendo opened theme parks with Universal Studios but doesn't name the first one. N/A.

4. **Retail price of Switch 2?** No price is mentioned. N/A.

5. **Director of Legend of Zelda movie?** The article mentions an upcoming adaptation but doesn't name the director. N/A.

6. **Percentage of compatible original Switch games?** It says "backward compatibility" but not the exact percentage. Since it's backward compatible, maybe 100%, but the article doesn't state it. So N/A.

7. **Magnetic controller color options?** No info on colors or options. N/A.

8. **Development cost of the new Mario Kart game?** The article doesn't mention costs. N/A.

9. **Release month in 2024?** The article says it will arrive "sometime this year" (assuming 2024) but not the exact month. N/A unless April is the release? Wait, April is when they'll hold demonstrations, not the release. So still N/A.

10. **Storage capacity of base model?** No info on storage. N/A.

11. **Drivers in the new Mario Kart track?** The article says "24 drivers on a dusty desert course." That's exactly what's asked. So 24.

12. **Feature to surpass original Switch sales?** The article doesn't state which feature will do that. It mentions larger display and magnetic controllers, but no direct claim about surpassing sales. N/A.

13. **Type of clock Nintendo produced?** The article mentions "produced an alarm clock." So alarm clock.

14. **Primary reason analysts wanted Nintendo to exit console business after Virtual Boy?** The article says "failures like the 1995 Virtual Boy and the 2012 Wii U, which led some industry analysts to recommend that Nintendo exit the console business." The reason is the failures of those consoles, specifically the Virtual Boy's failure. So the primary reason is the failure of the Virtual Boy and Wii U leading to financial or market issues.

15. **Game similar to Ender Magnolia with creative bosses in the reveal?** The article mentions Ender Magnolia but doesn't link it to the Switch 2 reveal. The new Mario Kart is shown, but not another game. So N/A.

16. **Financial strategy similar to NES for Switch 2?** The article mentions companies often take losses on hardware. The NES was sold at a loss to promote software. The Switch 2 might do the same, but the article doesn't explicitly state this. So N/A.

17. **Aspect of The Sims influencing Mario Kart track?** The article says The Sims allowed players to be landlords, but no link to Mario Kart's track design. N/A.

18. **Design element from Wii U for backward compatibility?** The Wii U's failure is mentioned, but the article doesn't say the Switch 2 uses any of its design elements. N/A.

19. **Global event in April?** The article says Nintendo will hold demonstrations in April. The event is the demonstrations around the world. So the answer is the demonstrations.

20. **Voice actor channeling Harrison Ford?** The article mentions Troy Baker voices a character like Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. But that's for Indiana Jones, not the new Mario Kart. So N/A.
