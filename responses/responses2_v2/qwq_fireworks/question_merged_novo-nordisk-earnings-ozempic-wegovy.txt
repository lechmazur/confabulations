Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and answer strictly based on that. Let me start with the first question.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks for the percentage of Novo Nordisk's total revenue from obesity drug sales in the U.S. during the second half of 2024. The article mentions that revenue increased by 25% to $40.6 billion, driven by growing sales in the U.S. However, it doesn't specify the exact percentage from obesity drugs in the U.S. market specifically for the second half. Since the total revenue figure is annual, and the question is about the second half, I can't split it without more data. So, answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The question is about how many consecutive quarters Novo Nordisk held as Europe's most valuable company before the share price drop in June. The article states they "retains its title" but doesn't mention the number of quarters prior to June's decline. No data here, so N/A.

3. **Question 3:** It asks which European countries besides Denmark manufacture semaglutide. The article says Novo Nordisk manufactures some drugs in the U.S. but imports semaglutide from Denmark. It doesn't mention other European countries doing this. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Market cap at peak June 2024 isn't provided. The article only notes the share price dropped 40% since the peak, but no exact figure. Answer N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The late-stage CagriSema trial that caused the stock drop in December—number of patients isn't stated. The article mentions the trial "slightly missed expectations" but no patient count. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Emily Field's prediction for 2030 revenue target? The article says the industry expects a market over $100 billion but doesn't attribute a specific number from Field. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Number of U.S. manufacturing facilities for injectables? The article says they manufacture some in the U.S. but doesn't specify the count. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Percentage of prescriptions by primary care vs. specialists during the slowdown. The article mentions prescriptions grew slowly but doesn't break down by physician type. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Value of Danish exports affected by tariffs. The article discusses tariffs on Denmark but doesn't give a dollar value. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Duration of the early-stage amycretin trial. The article says it was an early-stage trial with positive results but doesn't mention months. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Conversion rate of DKK to USD. The article states 290 billion DKK equals $40.6 billion. To find the rate, divide $40.6B by 290B DKK. That's approximately 0.14 USD per DKK (since 40.6/290 ≈ 0.14). So the rate is 1 DKK ≈ $0.14, so answer 0.14 or 14 cents per kroner. The question asks for the implied rate, so 0.14 USD/DKK or similar. The exact calculation: 40.6 / 290 = 0.14. So the conversion rate is 1 DKK = $0.14. So answer 0.14.

12. **Question 12:** The next-gen drug with a trial causing a drop but CEO still confident. The article mentions CagriSema's trial missed, leading to a 20% drop, but CEO remains confident. So answer CagriSema.

13. **Question 13:** Major political event contributing to uncertainty in sales. The article says President Trump's election weighed on pharma companies, and mentions Kennedy's nomination as health secretary. The question asks which event is cited. The answer is President Trump's election.

14. **Question 14:** Which country is implicated by tariffs over Greenland? The article states Trump's tariffs on Denmark due to Greenland issues. So Denmark.

15. **Question 15:** Lowest 2025 growth forecast. The article says 16-24% growth expected, so the lowest is 16%.

16. **Question 16:** Percentage decline from peak June to December plunge. The share dropped 20% in December, but the peak was in June with a 40% drop from there. Wait, the article says the share price dropped about 40% since June's peak. Then in December, after the trial, it plunged 20% on a single day. So total from June peak to December's low would be more than 40%? But the question is asking for the recorded percentage decline from the June peak. The article says "its share price has dropped about 40 percent since it peaked last June" and then "plunged 20 percent on a single day in late December." Wait, but the 40% drop is cumulative from June to the current point, but the December drop was an additional 20% from wherever it was then. However, the question is asking for the recorded percentage decline from the peak (June) to the December drop. The article says the peak was in June, then the December drop was an extra 20% from that day's price. But the 40% is the total from June to before December. The question might be referring to the total decline from peak to the December drop. But the article doesn't explicitly state the total, just the 20% drop in December. Since the 40% is up to the time of the article (which is when the 20% drop happened?), perhaps the total is more than 40%, but the question is about the "recorded percentage decline from its peak last June"—the article's main figure is the 40% drop, and the December drop was an additional 20% on that day. But since the question is about the decline from the peak (June) to the December plunge, it's unclear. However, the article states "the company's share price plunged 20 percent on a single day in late December." But the total drop from the June peak would be the 40% plus the 20%? Not sure. Wait, the initial drop to June is 40% from the peak. Then on Dec 20%, which would be an additional 20% from the already lowered price. So total would be more than 40%, but the article doesn't specify. However, the question is asking for the "recorded percentage decline from its peak last June" which the article says "its share price has dropped about 40 percent since it peaked last June" — that's the total up to the time of the article. The December plunge was a further drop, but the 40% is the figure given. Since the question refers to the plunge in late December, perhaps the total from June would be higher, but the article doesn't give that number. The question might be referring to the 20% drop in December, but that's from the previous day's close, not the peak. So the correct answer is the 40% mentioned in the article as the total from the peak. Wait, the question says "recorded percentage decline from its peak last June" after the significant drop in December. The article states that the peak was in June, and as of the article's time (when they reported the 25% increase), the drop was 40%. The December drop was an extra 20%, but the total from June would be 40% plus the 20%? Not exactly. Let me recheck the text: "Novo Nordisk's share price has dropped about 40 percent since it peaked last June as analysts have worried..." Then later, "the company's share price plunged 20 percent on a single day in late December." So the 40% is up to the present (the article's time, which is after December?), so the 20% is part of that 40%? Or was the 40% before December? The article structure is a bit unclear. Since the question is about the "recorded percentage decline from its peak last June" after the December plunge, but the article says the total drop since June is 40%, so that includes any drops after, including December. Therefore, the answer is 40%.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "recorded percentage decline from its peak last June?" The article says "its share price has dropped about 40 percent since it peaked last June"—so that is the total decline up to the time of the article, which includes the December plunge. Therefore, the answer is 40%.

17. **Question 17:** Number of obesity drugs named. The article mentions Ozempic, Wegovy, and CagriSema, amycretin. Wait, Ozempic and Wegovy are their main drugs. CagriSema is a next-gen, and amycretin is another trial. Are they all considered obesity drugs? The article says "obesity drugs" for Ozempic and Wegovy. CagriSema is a weight loss drug. Amycretin's trial was for obesity? The article says "new drug, amycretin, performed well in an early-stage trial, pushing up the company's shares." The context is obesity treatments, so maybe. The question is how many are explicitly named. The article explicitly names Ozempic and Wegovy as their drugs, and mentions CagriSema and amycretin as other drugs in development. So the explicitly named obesity drugs in the article are Ozempic and Wegovy. The others are in trials but not stated as currently marketed. So the answer is 2.

18. **Question 18:** Primary drive for revenue jump. The article says "driven by growing sales in the United States." So the answer is the United States market.

19. **Question 19:** The economic bloc warned after China. The article says "tariffs on Chinese goods and warned that tariffs on the European Union would 'definitely happen.'" So EU.

20. **Question 20:** Overarching factor identified as volatile. The CFO mentions "Geopolitics is probably more volatile..." So geopolitics.
