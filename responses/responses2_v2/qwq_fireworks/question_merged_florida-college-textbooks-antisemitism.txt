Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information given and don't infer beyond what's stated. 

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about a university-wide policy change implemented by the adjunct professor (Mario Reyes) after the test questions were posted. The article mentions that Reyes didn't write the test questions, and the policy change (like vetting panels) was done by Rodrigues. Since Reyes is just the instructor, the answer is N/A because he didn't implement any policy change.

2. **Question 2**: The "Hebrew Hammer" (Randy Fine) took legislative action beyond the 2024 statute. The article says he pushed for the textbook removal and the vetting effort, but didn't mention a specific new law. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The primary author (White) said the test questions were created by a third-party vendor. The publisher, Cengage, used a third-party, so the answer is the third-party vendor.

4. **Question 4**: The article states Rodrigues removed the textbook but doesn't mention a replacement. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The punitive measure beyond expelling students was tightening protest rules. The article says universities tightened rules governing protests and scrutinized classes. The author here is the textbook's author? Wait, the question says "as directly ordered by the author of the textbook". The author is White, but the article doesn't say he ordered anything. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The third-party vendor's name isn't mentioned. Cengage used one, but its name isn't given. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The Association of Jewish Studies' recommendation isn't specified. They criticized the process but didn't mention the panel composition. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The percentage of students involved in protests isn't provided. Martha Schoolman's quote doesn't mention numbers. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The journal title isn't mentioned. The test questions were from the textbook's publisher's vendor. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The disciplinary action against the university president isn't stated. The article doesn't mention any action against FIU's president. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Ray Rodrigues wasn't endorsed by a president for his chancellor role. The article says Trump endorsed Fine, not Rodrigues. So N/A.

12. **Question 12**: The total number of students is given as over 430,000 in the system. So that's the answer.

13. **Question 13**: The instructor served in the Marines. So the branch is the Marine Corps.

14. **Question 14**: The keywords listed include "Israel", "Palestinian", etc. The question asks for one beyond those listed. The article explicitly lists those, so maybe there's none. The answer is N/A.

15. **Question 15**: The American Association of University Professors criticized it as thought policing and authoritarian. So that's the answer.

16. **Question 16**: The author became a pastor after retiring. So his religious affiliation is pastor (or Christianity, but the text says pastor).

17. **Question 17**: Randy Fine was endorsed for the seat Mike Waltz resigned. The seat is Congress, specifically Waltz's former seat.

18. **Question 18**: The test question misrepresents Palestine as a country before Israel. The historical event's terminology is the creation of Israel and Palestine's status. The answer is Palestine being called a country before Israel.

19. **Question 19**: The author was at Grand Valley State University in Michigan.

20. **Question 20**: The professor who compared to "thought policing" is Laura Leibman, president of the Association of Jewish Studies. Her discipline isn't stated, but the article mentions she's in Jewish Studies. Wait, the question asks for her initial academic discipline. The article says she's president of the Association of Jewish Studies, but her own discipline isn't specified. N/A.
