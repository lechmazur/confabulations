merged_toyota-hino-epa-diesel-emissions-settlement.txt
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not infer anything beyond what's written.

1. The first question asks which Toyota executive was personally charged. The article mentions Hino Motors pleading guilty but doesn't name any specific executive. So N/A.

2. The second question is about deaths from nitrogen oxides. The article talks about health issues linked to the emissions but doesn't mention specific deaths. So N/A.

3. The third question asks for the percentage of Hino's global production affected. The article says 110,000 motors were involved in the US from 2010-2022, but there's no global production data. N/A.

4. Fourth question: Which European body found the violations? The article says the EPA discovered it after their own checks. No European body mentioned. N/A.

5. Fifth question: Fuel economy overstatement in MPG. The article states they exaggerated fuel economy but doesn't specify the amount. N/A.

6. Sixth question: Competitor that provided evidence. The text doesn't mention any other company helping expose Hino. N/A.

7. Seventh question: Compensation per truck owner. The settlement details don't mention individual payouts. N/A.

8. Eighth question: Technological modification to hide emissions. The article doesn't describe the specific tech used. N/A.

9. Ninth question: Environmental group's lawsuit prompting disclosure. The article says Hino voluntarily disclosed, not due to a lawsuit. N/A.

10. Tenth question: Monetary value of competitive advantage. The article doesn't mention this figure. N/A.

11. Eleventh question: The criminal fine mentioned as largest since 2016. The article states $522 million as the criminal portion, referencing VW's $15B. So $522 million.

12. Twelfth question: Jurisdiction with stricter standards getting part of the penalties. California gets $237 million. So California.

13. Thirteenth question: Time period for installing the 110k motors. The article says from 2010 to 2022. So 2010-2022.

14. Fourteenth question: Recall model years. The article mentions 2017 to 2019 model years. So 2017-2019.

15. Fifteenth question: Toyota subsidiary's name. The article starts by naming Hino Motors as the subsidiary. So Hino Motors.

16. Sixteenth question: Equivalent trucks removed. The EPA says it's equivalent to 110,000 trucks. So 110,000.

17. Seventeenth question: Company mentioned with tech research. The article mentions Hino in the context of the diesel engines, but the tech research part refers to DeepSeek. Wait, the question says "implicated in using deceptive data" so it's Hino, but the mention of tech research is a different part. Wait, the question says "which company... is implicated... mentioned alongside references to unrelated tech research initiatives later in the text". The article ends with other topics like DeepSeek's Rise. So the company implicated is Hino, but the tech research is about DeepSeek. But the question is asking for the company implicated in the emissions case that's mentioned alongside those other tech topics. The Hino article is in the same text as those other headlines, so the answer is Hino Motors. Wait, the question is tricky. The article's main topic is Hino, and the other paragraphs are separate stories. But the question says "mentioned alongside references to unrelated tech research initiatives later in the text". Since the article includes a section about DeepSeek's tech research after the Hino story, but Hino is the one implicated in the emissions case. The question might be looking for Hino, but the "alongside" part is confusing. Wait, the question is phrased: "which company... is implicated in using deceptive data... mentioned alongside...". The Hino case is in the main article, and the other parts are separate. So maybe the answer is Hino. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick, but the article says "Hino... sold in the United States" and the tech research part is separate. So the answer is Hino Motors.

18. Eighteenth question: Internal measure to prevent recurrence. The article says "improve its internal controls". So improving internal controls.

19. Nineteenth question: Prohibited import duration. The article states a 5-year ban. So five years.

20. Twentieth question: Industry segment focus. The dispute is about diesel engines in heavy trucks. So heavy trucks/diesel engines in heavy trucks.

Wait, let me double-check each answer again quickly.

1. N/A (no executive named)
2. N/A (no deaths stated)
3. N/A (no global production figure)
4. N/A (EPA found it, no European body)
5. N/A (no MPG number)
6. N/A (no competitor mentioned)
7. N/A (no individual compensation)
8. N/A (no tech detail)
9. N/A (voluntary disclosure, not lawsuit)
10. N/A (no figure given)
11. $522 million (criminal portion)
12. California
13. 2010-2022
14. 2017-2019
15. Hino Motors
16. 110,000
17. Hino Motors (since the question links the company mentioned in the emissions part alongside other tech topics in the text)
18. internal controls
19. five years
20. heavy trucks (or diesel engines in heavy trucks)
