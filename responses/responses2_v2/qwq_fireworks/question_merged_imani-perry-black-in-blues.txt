Okay, let me start by going through each question one by one and see what the article says. 

1. The first question asks about a fellowship Perry received that recognized her ability to connect cultural elements like RC Cola and rhythm and blues. The article mentions she got a MacArthur Fellowship, often called the genius grant. The citation says her work connects individual experiences with cultural expressions, which fits the question. So the answer should be MacArthur Fellowship.

2. The second question is about the color she uses in exploring the African American intellectual tradition, which she co-taught with Eddie S. Glaude Jr. The article says her new book uses the color blue to examine Blackness. Since she co-taught that class, the color is blue.

3. Third question: her audiobook's ailment inspired by people with invisible disabilities during the pandemic. The audiobook is "A Dangerously High Threshold for Pain" about lupus and Graves' disease. The time is during the pandemic when she saw people with long Covid. So the answer is lupus and Graves' disease.

4. Fourth question: legal project from her experiences with mutual aid and segregated schools. The article mentions she's working on a legal history project using her law degrees. The question links mutual aid and segregated schools, which she's writing a book about. The answer is the legal history or jurisprudence project.

5. Fifth question: award for "South to America" where she mentions Alabama's recognition. The article states it won the National Book Award for nonfiction. So the answer is National Book Award.

6. Sixth question: university she joined with a joint appointment related to her travelogue. She joined Harvard with appointments in women/gender studies and African/African American studies. The answer is Harvard University.

7. Seventh question: genre of her book on children's lives in segregated schools. The article says it's a middle grade book for Norton Young Readers. So the genre is middle grade.

8. Eighth question: title of her work exploring Blackness with a hue (blue) and indigo trade. That's "Black in Blues: How a Color Tells the Story of My People".

9. Ninth question: book challenging misconceptions about the South, reflecting community engagement. That's "South to America: A Journey Below the Mason-Dixon to Understand the Soul of a Nation".

10. Tenth question: playwright analyzed whose experiences mirror her body struggles. The article mentions Lorraine Hansberry in "Looking for Lorraine". Hansberry's play was "Raisin in the Sun", so the answer is Lorraine Hansberry.
