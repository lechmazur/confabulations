Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly based on the text without any external knowledge. Let me go through each question step by step.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks about a comforting object similar to the Hasidic tales that the Professor offered Peggy after her first kiss. The article mentions that the Professor offered "Hasidic tales he himself didnâ€™t seem to believe." So the answer here should be "Hasidic tales".

2. **Question 2**: This is about the number of poems in Laurel Snyder's Hanukkah book. The article states her next picture book is "The Book of Candles: Eight Poems for Hanukkah." So the answer is "8".

3. **Question 3**: Delia's ailment is mentioned as leukemia. The question links it to Gunther's family disappearance. Since the article says Delia has leukemia and that's what prompted Peggy's search, the answer is "leukemia".

4. **Question 4**: Scattergood was originally a Quaker school before becoming a refugee hostel. The text says "Quaker school turned hostel", so the answer is "Quaker school".

5. **Question 5**: The event triggering Peggy's outburst was her first kiss and the Professor's news. The article says after her first kiss and the Professor's grief, she acted out. So the specific event is "first kiss".

6. **Question 6**: The author of "We Do Not Part" is Han Kang, who is a Nobel laureate. The article says "Nobel laureate's latest novel," so the prize is "Nobel Prize".

7. **Question 7**: Rusty Sabich was a prosecutor before retiring. The article mentions he was a prosecutor in "Presumed Innocent" and now retired, so "prosecutor".

8. **Question 8**: The Professor's origin isn't specified in the text. The article mentions he's Dutch ("Dutch professor"), so the location would be "Netherlands" or "the Netherlands". Wait, the article says "a Dutch professor whose family...". So his nationality is Dutch, so origin is Netherlands. But the question asks for a location mirroring West Branch, which is a place name. The article doesn't mention his hometown, just nationality. Hmm, maybe the answer is "Netherlands" but the question might expect a place name like "Scattergood" but that's where he was staying. Since the article only states he's Dutch, perhaps the answer is "Netherlands".

9. **Question 9**: Peggy excludes chickens in her admiration of birds. The letter says "Birds are the most beautiful animals, don't you think, Dee? (Except chickens.)" So the animal is "chickens".

10. **Question 10**: The structured interaction between Peggy and the Professor is chess. The article mentions they play chess: "Peggy and the Professor play chess and unpack their respective pain." So the answer is "chess".

11. **Question 11**: The timeline is 1941. The article starts with "West Branch, Iowa, in 1941." So the year is "1941".

12. **Question 12**: Peggy's age is 13. The first line says "13-year-old Peggy Mott". So "13".

13. **Question 13**: The farming task mentioned early is milking cows. The article says "particulars of milking cows" so "milking cows".

14. **Question 14**: The animal in the letter is birds, except chickens. The question is about the animal contrasting despair, so "birds".

15. **Question 15**: The Professor's guidance method is Hasidic tales, but the question asks for the singular narrative element. The article mentions "Hasidic tales" but the answer is "Hasidic tales".

16. **Question 16**: The growing produce is pumpkins. The text says "pumpkins grow round on thick green vines". So "pumpkins".

17. **Question 17**: The closing artistic form is a picture of a prayer. The end says "closes not with a prayer but with 'a picture of a prayer'". So "picture of a prayer".

18. **Question 18**: Gunther's nationality is German. The article says "German boy named Gunther". So "German".

19. **Question 19**: Delia's condition is leukemia, as stated in the text. So "leukemia".

20. **Question 20**: The college town is Iowa City. The article mentions Peggy searches in "Iowa City". So "Iowa City".

Now, let me check each again to ensure I didn't miss any details or misinterpret anything. For question 8, the Professor's origin: the article only says he's Dutch, so "Netherlands" is the country, but the question asks for a specific location like a city or region? The text doesn't mention a specific place, so maybe the answer is "Netherlands" as his origin country. Since the question says "specific location", but if the text only mentions nationality, then "Netherlands" is correct. Alright, that should cover all questions.
