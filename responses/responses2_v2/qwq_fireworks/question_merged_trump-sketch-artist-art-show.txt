Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each question exactly as asked.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which prominent art collector from Trump's inner circle bought the largest piece for $7,250. The article mentions the prices of the sketches ranging up to $7,250 but doesn't name who bought it, especially not someone from Trump's inner circle. So, N/A.

2. **Question 2:** It asks how many total sketches Brourman did during the criminal trial before shifting to the civil case. The article doesn't provide a number for her sketches, just mentions she sketched both trials. No specific count, so N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The name of the Times Square performer who appeared throughout. The article says she tried to recruit a Statute of Liberty impersonator, but he canceled. The question implies he was there throughout, which he wasn't. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Which institution offered to house her collection. The text mentions the Met's director, but doesn't say they offered to keep her work. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The significance of red ink for Trump's gestures. The article doesn't mention color choices or their meaning. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** European diplomat who commissioned portraits. The article talks about approval to paint Senate hearings but doesn't mention a European diplomat commissioning portraits. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Unique technique developed at Mar-a-Lago. The article states she sketched there but doesn't describe a specific technique from that session. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Mentor before Trump trials. The article doesn't mention any mentor. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Attendance figure. The article doesn't give numbers, so N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Evolution of style after Mar-a-Lago. The article says her work is expressive and different from typical court sketches, but doesn't link that to the portrait session. However, after the session, she continued her style, so maybe no change. The article doesn't specify an evolution here. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Contradiction between her criticism and Trump's approval. The text says she voted for Harris but her work was praised by both sides, including Trump approving her portrait. So the contradiction is her political stance vs. Trump's approval. That's directly stated, so the answer is that her political opinions (supporting Harris) contrasted with Trump's approval.
