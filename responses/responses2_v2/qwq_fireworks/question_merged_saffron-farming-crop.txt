Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks about the percentage of imported saffron that could be replaced by Pennsylvania Dutch region's saffron. The article mentions that the Pennsylvania Dutch used to grow saffron but doesn't provide current yields or data. The 2023 import was 175 metric tons, but without knowing the Pennsylvania region's production, this can't be calculated. So, N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Calabash's best seller is a saffron tincture. Peace and Plenty's peak was 700,000 flowers (yielding 3.5 kg). If Calabash matched that, how much tincture? The article doesn't specify conversion rates from saffron to tincture volume. N/A.

3. **Question 3**: $20k invested at colonial Philadelphia's saffron price (same as gold). The article says saffron was traded at the same price as gold. But without knowing gold's price then or current saffron's price, can't compute. N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Peace and Plenty's peak was 700k flowers vs. the Philipps' 60k corms. The question is how many more flowers than corms. 700,000 - 60,000 = 640,000 more. Answer is 640000.

5. **Question 5**: Linear growth in corms. Starting with 12 corms, needing to reach 120k (Calabash's initial 120k). The article says corms multiply 4x per year (1000 to 4000). So each year x4. Let's see: Year 0:12, Year1:48, Y2:192, Y3:768, Y4:3072, Y5:12,288, Y6:49,152, Y7:196,608. So by year 7, it's over 120k. So 7 years? Wait, but the question says "initial planting quantity of Calabash Gardens" which was 120,000 corms in 2020. Starting from 12, how many years? Let's calculate steps: 12*4^y ≥120,000. 4^y = 10,000. 4^7 is 16384, 4^8 is 65536. Wait, maybe miscalculation. Let's see:

12 * 4^y = 120,000 → 4^y = 10,000 → y = log4(10000). Since 4^6=4096, 4^7=16384. So 7 years. But maybe the initial question is about starting with a dozen (12) and needing to reach 120,000. So 12 *4^y = 120,000 → 4^y=10,000. Since 4^6 is 4096, 4^7 is ~16,384. Not enough. 4^8 is ~65,536. Still under. 4^9 is ~262,144. So 9 years? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question states "assuming linear growth in corm replication". Wait, the article says corms replicate underground, so each year they multiply. The example was 1000 to 4000 next year. So that's 4x per year. So exponential, not linear. The question says "linear growth", which might be a trick. If it's linear (constant addition?), but the article says replication (exponential). Since the question specifies linear, perhaps they want a different approach. But since the article's example is exponential, maybe the question is wrong. But the user wants to follow strictly. Since the question says linear growth, perhaps assuming each year the corms increase by a fixed amount. But the article says "corms replicate themselves underground. A farmer who plants 1,000 corms may have 4,000 the next year." So that's 3000 increase, then next year maybe 12,000? Not linear. Since the question says linear, perhaps it's a trick and the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe "linear growth" here refers to the multiplier being the same each year (exponential). But the user might expect to use the 4x per year. Let me check the question again. It says "assuming a linear growth in saffron corm replication". Hmm. If it's linear, then each year adds a fixed number. But the article's example is 1000 to 4000, so +3000. Next year would be 4000 +3000=7000, but that's not how it's described. The article says they multiply, so exponential. Since the question says linear, maybe it's impossible. But maybe the question expects using the 4x per year. Let me see. The problem is the question's assumption of linear growth might conflict with the article's exponential. Since the question says to assume linear, but the article's example is exponential, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake, but I have to follow. Since the question specifies linear growth, but the article's example is exponential, the answer can't be determined. So N/A.

Wait, the question says "assuming linear growth". The article says "corms replicate themselves underground. A farmer who plants 1,000 corms may have 4,000 the next year." So that's a 300% increase. If it's linear, maybe the increase per year is the same number. But since the question says linear growth, perhaps they mean the rate is linear (i.e., same number added each year). But the example is 1000 to 4000, so increase of 3000. If linear, next year would be 7000, etc. So starting with 12 corms, to reach 120,000:

Each year, the increase would be 3000 (from 1000 to 4000). But that's based on 1000 to 4000. If starting at 12, maybe the increase is 36 (since 12 is 1.2% of 1000, so 3000 * 0.012 = 36). That seems too small. Alternatively, maybe the multiplier is 4x per year, so exponential. Since the question says linear, but the example is exponential, perhaps it's impossible. So answer N/A.

Hmm, maybe the user intended to use the exponential growth. Since the question mentions "linear growth", but the article's example is exponential, so answer N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick, but I'll have to go with N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Difference between Peace and Plenty's peak flowers (700,000) and Philipps' customers (24,000). 700,000 -24,000 = 676,000. So answer 676000.

7. **Question 7**: Workshop attendees charged 1 gram of Philipps' saffron ($100/gram). The first workshop in 2017 had farmers from around the country. The article mentions "Farmers from around the country traveled to Burlington". But how many? The article doesn't state the number of attendees. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The couple who invested $20k in corms are the Philipps. The surname is Philipp. Answer: Philipp.

9. **Question 9**: Calabash Gardens' best seller after low yields was a medicinal tincture. The article says "A saffron tincture, used for medicinal purposes, is her best seller." Answer: saffron tincture.

10. **Question 10**: The university is the University of Vermont. The North American Center is there. Answer: University of Vermont.

11. **Question 11**: The fastest pace was 5 seconds per flower (Melinda Price said "one flower per five seconds"). Answer: 5.

12. **Question 12**: Iran is the largest producer despite the US resurgence. Answer: Iran.

13. **Question 13**: The retired musician living 75 miles from traffic is Paul Miller. Answer: Paul.

14. **Question 14**: The cultural group is the Pennsylvania Dutch. Answer: Pennsylvania Dutch.

15. **Question 15**: The Philipps sold saffron at $100/gram. Answer: $100.

16. **Question 16**: The increase from 1000 to 4000 is 4x. Answer: 4000 (but the question asks for the number representing the increase, which is 4 times, so 4000 is the result. The question says "potential increase", so 4x. So answer 4000? Wait the question says "what number represents the potential increase in corms". The example is 1,000 to 4,000, so the increase is 3,000, but the multiplier is 4x. The question might be asking the multiple (4x) or the total (4,000). The article says "a farmer who plants 1,000 corms may have 4,000 the next year." The number representing the increase is 4,000. So answer 4000.

17. **Question 17**: The flavor characteristic is "sweet, musky" or "intense", but the repeated terms are "fragrant", "intense", "golden color and subtle bass note". The question asks the characteristic attributed to saffron enhancing dishes like paella. The article mentions "sweet, musky flavor" (from the Philipps' experience), "intense", and "subtle bass note". The most repeated might be "fragrant" and "intense". But the question says "repeatedly attributed". The first mention: "sweet, musky flavor". Later: "smells and tastes so much more intense". Also "fragrant, crimson threads". The key terms are "fragrant" and "intense". The answer might be "sweet, musky" or "intense". Wait the question says "flavor characteristic... enhancing dishes like paella and bouillabaisse with both color and aroma". The article says "adds a golden color and subtle bass note". The flavor is described as sweet, musky, and intense. The "subtle bass note" might refer to flavor. The answer is likely "sweet, musky" but need to check. Alternatively, the article states "fragrant, crimson threads have played a key role... subtle bass note". So the flavor is sweet, musky, and subtle. The question asks what is "repeatedly attributed". The first mention is sweet, musky. Later, "smells and tastes so much more intense". So maybe "intense" is the answer. But the question might be looking for "fragrant" or "sweet, musky". Let me check again. The question is asking for the flavor characteristic that enhances dishes with color and aroma. The article says "adds a golden color and subtle bass note to Indian sweets..." so the flavor note is "subtle bass note". The aroma is fragrant. The taste is sweet and musky. The most repeated might be "sweet, musky" as in the first paragraph. Alternatively, the key phrase in the answer might be "sweet, musky flavor" from the first paragraph. So answer: sweet, musky.
