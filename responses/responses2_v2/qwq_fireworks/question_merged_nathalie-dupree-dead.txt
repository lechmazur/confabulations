Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article and answer exactly what's asked. Let's start with the first question.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks which French culinary school Nathalie Dupree established in Atlanta that attracted chefs like Jacques Pepin. Scanning the article, I remember she went to Le Cordon Bleu in London, but the cooking school mentioned is at Rich's department store. The article says she established a cooking school at Rich's in 1975 and cajoled Julia Child, Jacques Pepin, and Paul Prudhomme into teaching there. So the school itself isn't a French school she established, but the Rich's cooking school. The question mentions a French culinary school, so maybe that's a trick. The answer is N/A because she didn't establish a French school there, just the Rich's school.

2. **Question 2:** How many episodes did she film with the AIDS ribbon? The article mentions she pinned the ribbon to her apron on episodes of her TV show in the 1980s. But the exact number isn't given. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The cookbook co-authored with Pat Conroy. The article says Pat Conroy wrote "The Pat Conroy Cookbook: Recipes and Stories of My Life" in 2009, after taking her class. The title is stated directly here. So the answer is "The Pat Conroy Cookbook: Recipes and Stories of My Life".

4. **Question 4:** Presidential administration when she served as a culinary advisor after her restaurant. The article mentions her restaurant opened in 1971. But there's no mention of her being a culinary advisor to any administration. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Selling price of her Charleston home when she moved to Raleigh. The article states she had a home in Charleston, but there's no info on selling it when moving. She died in Raleigh's nursing home, but the house's sale isn't mentioned. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The Southern chef she mentored who later hosted their own Food Network show. The article mentions Virginia Willis as one of her mentees, but it doesn't say if Willis had her own show. Paul Prudhomme is mentioned as a collaborator, but he was already a chef. Paula Deen is mentioned, but the article says Nathalie felt Paula got more fame. However, there's no direct mention of her mentoring someone who later had a Food Network show. So maybe N/A unless there's an implied answer. Wait, the article says she mentored a group called her chickens, including Virginia Willis. But unless Willis had a Food Network show, this might not be answerable. The article doesn't say, so N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Annual revenue of Nathalie's restaurant at peak. The article doesn't provide any financial figures for the restaurant. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Number of teenage girls she fostered while running the cooking school. The article says she fostered teenage girls but doesn't specify the number. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The PAC name during her Senate campaign. She ran as a write-in candidate against Jim DeMint in 2010 with a slogan "Cream DeMint." The article doesn't mention a PAC name. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Culinary award for promoting sobriety. The article says she helped others get sober and founded Les Dames d'Escoffier chapters. But no specific award is named. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The cookbook co-authored with Paul Prudhomme. The article says she cajoled him into teaching at Rich's and later teamed up with him and others for the International Association. But the specific cookbook title isn't mentioned. N/A.

12. **Question 12:** The dish she burned in 1958 leading to tuna a la king. The article says she made tuna casserole that turned into layers of grease and tuna, which she called tuna a la king. So the answer is tuna casserole.
