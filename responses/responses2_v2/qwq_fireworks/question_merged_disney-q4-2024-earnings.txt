merged_disney-q4-2024-earnings.txt
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly what's asked. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Q1: Percentage increase in Disney's international theme park revenue contributing to seven new cruise ships.**
   - The article mentions that the seven more ships are on order, but the reason given is expansion and hurricanes affecting cruises. The international parks' operating income soared 28%, but that's not directly linked to the cruise order. The question asks for the percentage increase that directly caused the order. Since the text doesn't explicitly connect the 28% to the cruise ships, maybe it's N/A? Wait, the article says "Disney Cruise Line expansion" contributed to a decline in domestic parks, but the order of ships is part of expansion. The international parks' 28% growth might be a separate factor. The question is about the percentage that caused the cruise ships. Since the article doesn't state that the international parks' revenue increase led to the cruise order, answer is N/A.

2. **Q2: Oscar nominations for "Moana 2".**
   - The article says "A Complete Unknown" got eight nominations. "Moana 2" isn't mentioned for Oscars. So answer is 0 or N/A? Since the question is about "Moana 2", which didn't get any, so N/A.

3. **Q3: Streaming competitor mentioned by Iger for needing better tech.**
   - The article says Netflix has higher market cap, but Iger's statement was about needing better tech. The text says "Disney needs better streaming technology" but doesn't name a competitor. So N/A.

4. **Q4: Streaming revenue excluding ads.**
   - The article states streaming revenue totaled $6B, with higher sub prices and ad sales contributing. But it doesn't break down ad vs subscription. Can't subtract, so N/A.

5. **Q5: Stock price increase between Treasure announcement and quarter end.**
   - The article says shares closed at $113 on Tuesday (before the quarter ended?), and the Treasure was unveiled in December. The quarter's stock closed at $113? The question is about the period between the announcement and quarter end. The article says Disney shares closed at $113 on Tuesday (the day before the earnings?), and after, they dipped. But the exact increase isn't given. So N/A.

6. **Q6: Percentage of subscribers citing price increases.**
   - The article says analysts expected a decline due to price hikes, but Disney limited it to 700k. It doesn't say what % cited prices. So N/A.

7. **Q7: Division compensating for ESPN's decline in summer.**
   - The movie division had a profit swing. "Moana 2" and others helped. The article says "other engines" offset ESPN's issues. The streaming swung to profit, but the question is about the division that compensated for ESPN's summer slowdown. The text says when one engine struggles, others pick up. The movie division's profit (from the films) likely offset ESPN. The movie division's name is "Disney's movie division", but the article says "Disney's movie division swung to a profit of $312M". So the answer is the movie division? The question asks which division. The article mentions "Disney's movie division" as the one that turned profit. So answer is "movie division".

Wait, the question says "compensated for the decline in ESPN revenue during the summer vacation slowdown?" The summer slowdown in vacation spending affected parks, but ESPN's decline was due to higher programming costs. The text says "other engines" but specifically mentions streaming and movies. The article states "blockbusters like 'Moana 2' and improved streaming financials offset lower ESPN and theme park results." So the movie division and streaming. But the question asks for the division that compensated for ESPN's decline. The answer would be the movie division and streaming. But the options might be "streaming operation" or "movie division". The article says "improved streaming financials offset lower ESPN". So maybe the streaming division? Wait, the exact sentence: "blockbusters like 'Moana 2' and improved streaming financials offset lower ESPN and theme park results." So both movie and streaming. But the question is which division? The "movie division" and "streaming operation". The question asks for the division that compensated for ESPN's decline. Since the answer options need to be specific, the article mentions both, but the question might expect one. Let me check again. The division that offset ESPN's decline would be the movie division (since their profit increased) and streaming. The question says "compensated for the decline in ESPN revenue during the summer vacation slowdown?" The summer slowdown was for parks, but ESPN's decline is separate. The text says that the movie and streaming helped offset the lower ESPN results. The division for streaming is "streaming operation", and the movie is part of the movie division. The question is which division? The answer would be "streaming operation" and "movie division", but since the question asks for one, maybe the article specifies. The exact text: "blockbusters like 'Moana 2' and improved streaming financials offset lower ESPN and theme park results." So the two divisions are movie and streaming. Since the question asks for the division, perhaps the answer is "streaming operation" or "movie division". But the question is phrased as "which division... compensated". Since both are mentioned, but the question might require one. Wait, the question is about the division that compensated for ESPN's decline. Since ESPN is part of the cable division, the other divisions that offset it are movie and streaming. Since the question is singular, maybe the answer is "movie division" or "streaming operation". The article says "improved streaming financials" so the streaming division's profit helped. The movie division's profit also helped. The question might accept either, but since the article lists both, but the answer must be exact. The question is which division? The article doesn't specify one, so maybe N/A? Wait, no. The question is about the division that compensated for ESPN's decline. Since the text says both, but the question asks for one, perhaps it's N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "streaming operation" because it's mentioned as part of the offset. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is "movie division". Hmm, tricky. The exact wording: "blockbusters like 'Moana 2' (movie division) and improved streaming financials (streaming division) offset lower ESPN and theme park results." So both divisions are the answer. Since the question asks for which division, and the answer must be one, perhaps it's N/A? Or maybe the question is expecting "movie division" because the movie's success is highlighted. Wait, the question says "compensated for the decline in ESPN revenue during the summer vacation slowdown?" The summer slowdown might refer to the parks' summer dip, but ESPN's decline is separate. The question is specifically about the division that offset ESPN's decline. The answer would be the movie and streaming divisions. Since the question is singular, but the article mentions two, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, the text says "other engines can pick up the slack", but the exact divisions are movie and streaming. Since the question requires one division, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question might have an exact answer. Let me check the article again. The movie division's profit was $312M vs loss before. The streaming swung to profit. The question asks which division compensated for ESPN's decline. Since both are involved, but the question is singular, perhaps the answer is "streaming operation" because the article says "improved streaming financials offset". So I'll go with "streaming operation".

8. **Q8: Passengers lost due to hurricanes.**
   - The article mentions hurricanes affected cruises and attendance, leading to a 5% decline in domestic parks. But it doesn't specify how many passengers were lost. So N/A.

9. **Q9: Combined operating income of streaming and traditional networks.**
   - Streaming profit was $293M, traditional networks had $837M. Combined is 293+837=1,130M. So answer is $1,130 million.

10. **Q10: Additional revenue from "A Complete Unknown" after Oscar nominations.**
    - The film had $88M and continues to play. The article doesn't mention any increase after nominations, so N/A.

11. **Q11: Per-share profit increase signaling turnaround.**
    - The first paragraph says "per-share quarterly profit rose 44 percent". So 44%.

12. **Q12: Passenger capacity of the Treasure.**
    - "4,000-passenger Treasure" so 4,000.

13. **Q13: Profit swing for streaming (from loss to profit).**
    - The article states streaming swung to $293M profit from a $138M loss. The swing is 293+138=431M? Or just the profit figure. The question asks for the profit figure after the swing: $293M.

14. **Q14: Title of the billion-dollar film.**
    - "Moana 2" collected over $1B.

15. **Q15: Percentage increase in international parks.**
    - "international parks soared 28 percent".

16. **Q16: Business unit with a decline just below double digits.**
    - ESPN's domestic income fell 9%, which is one unit below 10 (double-digit). So ESPN.

17. **Q17: Disney's closing stock price.**
    - "$113" as per the article.

18. **Q18: Terminology for internal struggles.**
    - "culture war spats, whipsawing operating strategies, layoffs, proxy campaigns by activist investors for board seats and strikes in Hollywood" are listed. The term used in the first paragraph is "period of turmoil".

19. **Q19: Legacy media segment with unchanged income.**
    - "traditional entertainment networks... managed to avoid losses. Operating income was flat at $837 million". So traditional entertainment networks (or "traditional networks").

20. **Q20: Total streaming revenue.**
    - "$6 billion".

Now, let me verify each:

1. N/A (no direct link between international parks' 28% and cruise order)
2. 0 (but article says "A Complete Unknown" got 8, so "Moana 2" had none. So answer is 0? Or N/A? The question is about "Moana 2", so since no mention, N/A)
Wait, the question is asking how many Oscar nominations did "Moana 2" get. Since the article says "A Complete Unknown" got 8, "Moana 2" isn't mentioned for Oscars. So answer is N/A.

3. N/A (Iger didn't name a competitor when talking about tech needs)
4. N/A (can't exclude ad sales)
5. N/A (no specific timeframe given between announcement and quarter end)
6. N/A (no % given)
7. "streaming operation" (since the article says "improved streaming financials offset")
8. N/A
9. 1,130 (293+837)
10. N/A
11. 44%
12. 4,000
13. 293 (profit figure)
14. "Moana 2"
15. 28%
16. ESPN
17. $113
18. "turmoil"
19. traditional entertainment networks
20. $6 billion
