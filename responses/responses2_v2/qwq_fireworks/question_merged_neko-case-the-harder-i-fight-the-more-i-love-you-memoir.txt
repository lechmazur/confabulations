Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I don't use any outside knowledge and only rely on the text. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks how many musicians beyond the orchestra Case employed for her upcoming album to combat digital dehumanization. The article mentions she used "more musicians than usual" and that some tracks have an orchestra. But the exact number isn't given. So I should answer N/A.

2. The Grand Ole Opry cut power because Case stripped to her bra due to heat. The article states she was on the brink of heatstroke. The reason was her stripping, not Tomato-gate, which is mentioned later as a separate example. So the answer is her stripping down to her bra.

3. The major label that courted her after "The Virginian" is compared to a fairy tale character. The text says it was like a "knock at the door, a fascinating stranger... grant you all your wishes!" which sounds like a fairy godmother. So the answer is fairy tale character: a fascinating stranger (but maybe the specific term is "fairy tale" from the quote? Wait, the question asks for a specific fairy tale character. The text doesn't name one, just describes the scenario. So maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "specific fairy tale character". The text uses "fairy tale" in the quote but doesn't name a character. So N/A?

Wait, the question says "specific fairy tale character did the major label remind her of, mirroring the horses". The horses were her childhood wish. The label's approach was like a fairy tale scenario (knock at the door, etc.), but there's no specific character mentioned. So answer is N/A.

4. The doo-wop song she sang at the wedding was "I'm So Young" by The Students. The article says she sang this at a friend's wedding, which impressed Newman. So the answer is "I'm So Young".

5. The station wagon was her mother's pale-green one. The article says "her mother's pale-green station wagon looks like a nauseous basking shark". So the color is pale-green.

6. The city where her mother moved in with her was Tucson. The text says "when Case was in her late 30s -- her mother moved in with her when she was living in Tucson and suddenly left without a word". So the answer is Tucson.

7. The instrument was the tenor guitar. The article states "Learning tenor guitar... unlocked a unique sound... leading to 'Middle Cyclone'". So tenor guitar.

8. The natural disaster she wrote a song from is a tornado. The article mentions "written songs from the perspective of killer whales and tornadoes". So tornado.

9. The backing band for her debut was "Her Boyfriends". The article says "recorded with a rotating backing band she cheekily dubbed Her Boyfriends". The emotional state part: she now describes her debut as "terrified", which matches the Grand Ole Opry incident's emotional reaction (she felt it was unfair). So the band name is Her Boyfriends.

10. The breakfast food admired was a pancake. The article says "That's a good-looking pancake" when she commented on the neighboring table's order at the Cosmic Diner.

11. The exact age she joined Maow isn't given. The article says she was in the punk trio Maow in the mid-90s, but no age. So N/A.

12. The track from "Middle Cyclone" that inspired the memoir's title isn't mentioned. The title "The Harder I Fight the More I Love You" is the memoir's title, but the article doesn't link it to a specific track. So N/A.

13. The timeline: The Opry incident was in 2001, and the musical with Callie Khouri is mentioned as current (article is from 2023, but the memoir is recent). The article says "in the next year or two" for the musical. The interview with Khouri is in the present, but the article doesn't specify when Khouri first reached out. So N/A.

14. The major label's name isn't mentioned. The article says "a major label came courting" but doesn't name it. So N/A.

15. The jazz standard taught by Paul Rigby isn't specified. The article mentions Rigby collaborated since 2006 but doesn't name the song. So N/A.

16. The medical diagnosis was cancer. The father told her mother had died of cancer, but later it was a lie. So the alleged diagnosis was cancer.

17. The number of orchestra members isn't stated. The article says "some tracks feature an entire orchestra", but how many? N/A.

18. The feminist icon comparison isn't mentioned. She compares her experience to sexism in country music, but no specific icon named. N/A.

19. The exact date of the class trip with the cheese lunch isn't given. Only the anecdote exists without a date. N/A.

20. The metaphor for her mother's absence is a deer. The text says "like a deer, always just out of reach". So deer.
