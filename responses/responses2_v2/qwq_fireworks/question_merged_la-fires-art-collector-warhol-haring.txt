Okay, I need to go through each question and answer them based solely on the given article. Let me start with the first one.

1. What was the total insurance payout Ron Rivlin received for his lost Warhol collection according to his gallery manager?

The article mentions Rivlin made an insurance claim but doesn't state the payout amount. The gallery manager Melanie Breitman talks about the fire's speed, not the payout. So answer is N/A.

2. Which surviving artwork in Rivlin's basement vault demonstrated the effectiveness of his sprinkler system?

The article says the sprinklers were in every room, but the Warhols weren't protected. The only surviving piece was Benisty's sculpture, but it's not in a basement vault. The question mentions a basement vault, which isn't in the text. So N/A.

3. How many Campbell's soup can prints did Rivlin manage to save when evacuating with his three Warhols?

He took three Warhols but the question is about Campbell's soup cans. The article doesn't mention saving any Campbell prints. Answer 0? Wait, the article says he took three Warhols but doesn't specify which ones. Since Campbell's were in the living room, maybe he didn't take them. So 0, but the article doesn't explicitly say. Hmm. Since it's not stated, N/A.

4. What was the selling price of the "Andy Mouse" Haring print at Rivlin's last gallery showing before the fire?

No info on selling prices of specific works. N/A.

5. Which former music industry colleague convinced Rivlin to start collecting Warhol pieces in 2011?

The article says Rivlin came into the art world after a music career and bought his first Warhol in 2011, but no colleague mentioned. N/A.

6. What security measures did Rivlin implement at his gallery after losing his home collection?

The article says he has handlers on standby to load art into trucks if needed. That's a security measure post-fire. So "handlers on standby ready to load art into trucks".

7. How many forgeries did Rivlin help the FBI identify during his consulting work?

The article mentions he consulted with FBI on identifying forgeries but doesn't give a number. N/A.

8. What was the attendance at Rivlin's last over-40 nightclub event before the fire?

No attendance numbers mentioned. N/A.

9. When did Rivlin establish his fire evacuation protocol for the Sunset Boulevard gallery?

The article mentions handlers are on standby now, but no date. N/A.

10. What was the appraised value of the Queen Elizabeth Warhol print that hung behind Rivlin's desk?

No value given for specific works. N/A.

11. Which structural element of the Getty Center's fire protection system was explicitly noted as absent from Rivlin's home design despite its art-focused architecture?

The Getty has fire-resistant stone, concrete, and protected steel. Rivlin's home was built with art in mind but didn't have those materials. The article says his home was "specially designed with his art collection in mind" but didn't mention using fire-resistant materials like the Getty. The answer would be "fire-resistant stone, concrete, and protected steel".

12. What age restriction did Rivlin impose on his "nightclub" events that indirectly mirrored his professional background prior to entering the art world?

The nightclub was for people 40 and over. His prior background was in music industry. The age restriction mirrors his background? The question says it's indirect. The answer is "40".

13. Which artwork by Damien Hirst was erroneously reported to have been salvaged by Rivlin during evacuation alongside the three Warhols?

The article says he lost works by Hirst but only the Benisty sculpture survived. No Hirst was saved. The question asks which Hirst was erroneously reported as salvaged, but the text doesn't mention any such report. So N/A.

14. How did Rivlin's collaboration with the FBI on forgery identification influence the post-fire evaluation of the surviving Benisty sculpture’s authenticity?

The article doesn't link his FBI work to the Benisty sculpture's authenticity. N/A.

15. Which piece from Warhol’s "Myths" portfolio was incorrectly cited as being displayed in Rivlin’s living room instead of the basement?

The "Myths" were in the basement, but the article says Campbell's soup was in living room. The question asks which "Myths" piece was incorrectly cited as in the living room. The article states that "Myths" were in the basement, so maybe the question refers to an error in the text? Wait, the article says "Myths" were in the basement, so if a piece from that set was said to be in the living room, that's incorrect. But the text doesn't mention any such error. The article says the "Myths" were in the basement, so there's no incorrect citation here. So N/A.

Wait, maybe the question is implying that a specific piece from "Myths" was mentioned as in the living room? The article says the "Myths" were in the basement. The Campbell's soup was in the living room. The question's premise might be wrong, so answer N/A.

16. What material characteristic of Keith Haring’s "Totem" sculpture directly contributed to its complete destruction in the fire?

The sculpture is carved plywood. The article says the "Totem" was lost. Plywood might burn easily. The question asks for the material contributing to destruction. Since it's carved plywood, that's the answer.

17. How many other homes in Pacific Palisades were confirmed by Max Abadian to have been destroyed alongside Rivlin’s property?

Max Abadian also lost his home, so at least one. The article says "my neighbors' as well" but the exact number from Max? The article says Max confirmed he lost his, so answer is "1".

18. Which cartoon figure appears in both the title of Haring’s "Andy Mouse" and the description of Warhol’s "Myths" portfolio?

"Andy Mouse" refers to Mickey Mouse-esque. The "Myths" include Mickey Mouse. So answer is "Mickey Mouse".

19. Which fire-prevention measure used by the Getty’s landscaping team was notably missing from Rivlin’s property, according to the article?

The Getty had "well-irrigated landscaping". The article says Rivlin's didn't have that. So answer is "well-irrigated landscaping".
