Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which Native American tribes formed an alliance with Jim Bridger's outpost to protect settlers from marauding French trappers. The article mentions Shoshone and Paiute characters but doesn't specify an alliance with Bridger. It says the French are marauding, but no tribes are mentioned as allies here. So N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many days Sara and Devin spent at Bridger's outpost before finding Isaac. The article says they ride into Bridger's outpost seeking a guide, but there's no mention of days. N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Temperature during the wolf attack. The article mentions a winter scene with wolves, but no specific temperature. N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Army lieutenant who found Two Moons. The article mentions an Army captain (Lucas Neff's character) but not a lieutenant discovering Two Moons. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Medical condition preventing Sara from continuing. The article says Sara has issues from Pennsylvania, but not a medical condition. It calls her clueless, not physically unable. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Original Mormon settlement the Rowells planned to reach. The article mentions the Utah War context but doesn't name a specific settlement. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Message Brigham Young sent to Bridger. The article says Brigham Young has a large role but doesn't mention a specific message. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Number of men in the French trapping party. The article mentions encounters with Frenchmen but no numbers. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Childhood trauma causing Two Moons' muteness. The article says she's mute but doesn't state the trauma. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Name of the military fort where Captain Neff wrote his observations. The article quotes the captain but doesn't name a fort. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Character with a wolf trauma in Pennsylvania. The article says Sara's issues from PA put them in danger. So Sara Rowell.

12. **Question 12:** Historical conflict linked to Isaac's decision. The Utah War is mentioned as the basis, so Utah War of 1857-58.

13. **Question 13:** Role of French in escalating violence. The article mentions "Grand Guignol Frenchmen" adding weird elements, but not their role in violence escalation. Maybe their presence as "crazed and arrogant" contributes? The article says "the Frenchmen" are part of the violence, but the question is about escalating between settlers and Shoshone. The text says Frenchmen are marauding, but the direct link isn't stated. Hmm, maybe N/A?

Wait, the article says "encounters with crazed and arrogant Frenchmen" and later mentions "breaking with the historical record in ways... with those Frenchmen." The question is about the French escalating violence between settlers and Shoshone. The article doesn't explicitly say they did that. So N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Actor's previous work with Peter Berg. Taylor Kitsch starred in "Friday Night Lights" directed by Berg. The article mentions this as why he was cast, despite his character being criticized. So Taylor Kitsch.

15. **Question 15:** Visual technique in aerial shots. The article says "aerial shots of wintry mountain vistas are monotonous yet unfailingly pleasing" and mentions the washed-out, blue-gray look. The technique might be the washed-out color, but the question is about a specific technique during aerial shots. The article says "washed-out, blue-gray look" provided by Jouffret. The technique is the color palette. But the question asks for a technique contrasting monotony with brutality. The article says the visuals are handsome but not distinctive, and the brutality is separate. Maybe the "washed-out, blue-gray aesthetic" is the answer. The question is about the technique used in aerials to contrast with brutality. So the answer would be the washed-out, blue-gray look.

Wait, the question is asking for a visual technique during aerial mountain shots that contrasts the monotony with the theme of brutality. The article says the aerial shots are "monotonous yet unfailingly pleasing" and the cinematographer used that look. The contrast is between the pleasing visuals and the brutal content. So the technique is the "washed-out, blue-gray aesthetic" as per the article's description. So answer is "washed-out, blue-gray aesthetic".

16. **Question 16:** Historical figure clashing with Bridger. The article mentions Brigham Young as a historical figure with a large role, and Bridger is an entrepreneur. The article says "settlors, displaced tribes and the US Army skirmished... and Smith wants to use it as a stage..." but doesn't explicitly state a clash between Bridger and Young. However, since Bridger is an entrepreneur and Young is a leader, maybe they clash. The article says "Jim Bridger... was also a prominent character in The Revenant, and the Latter-day Saints leader Brigham Young (Kim Coates) have large roles. It's a period when settlers (Mormons) and Bridger's group... perhaps their ambitions conflict. The article says "Bridger's entrepreneurial ambitions" and Brigham Young's leadership, so answer is Brigham Young.

17. **Question 17:** Flaw in Sara's portrayal. The article says her script makes her seem like an "exasperating and dangerously clueless Karen." So the answer is "Karen stereotype".

18. **Question 18:** Connection between animal carcasses and Indigenous impact. The article mentions the fixation on animal carcasses as part of the brutality but doesn't directly link it to Indigenous communities' erasure. However, the question's phrasing might imply that the article does make this connection. The article says "the series’ fixation on animal carcasses... serves as a stark reminder of the brutality of frontier life." But the broader critique about Indigenous impact isn't explicitly stated. Maybe N/A?

Wait, the article's last part says "the series’ fixation on animal carcasses... the manifold formulas of the western." The question asks how the article connects this to a critique of frontier life's impact on Indigenous communities. Since the article mentions "displaced tribes" in the Utah War context, perhaps the carcasses symbolize exploitation, but the article doesn't explicitly state this connection. So N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Mute character representing erasure of Native voices. The article says Two Moons is mute and the most expressive, and the Shoshone/Paiute are "solemnly noble or dangerously impassioned but humorless." The muteness might symbolize erasure. The article says her muteness is part of her role, so answer is Two Moons.

20. **Question 20:** Narrative device failing to mirror "The Searchers." The article mentions "Isaac Reed's internal monologues" but actually says the captain's narration is "I have come to believe..." The question refers to Isaac's internal monologues. The article criticizes the lack of poetic vision like in "The Searchers," so the device is Isaac's internal monologues. Wait, the article says the captain (Lucas Neff) has the narration. The article says "the series apes but can't echo" works like "The Searchers." The failed device is the poetic narration (the captain's lines), but the question is about Isaac's monologues. The article doesn't mention Isaac's monologues. It says "the story is overstuffed... circling back and forth from the fugitives' flight..." Maybe the non-focused narrative is the device. Alternatively, the article says "the poetic narration by the captain" is the device that fails. The question says "narrative device... involving Isaac Reed’s internal monologues." Since the article doesn't mention Isaac's monologues, perhaps N/A. Wait, the article says "the story is overstuffed and overcomplicated, circling back and forth from the fugitives' flight to the jockeyings of the settlers and the Army to the plight of the Shoshone." So the narrative device criticized is the overcomplicated structure. But the question specifies Isaac's internal monologues. Since the article doesn't mention that, answer N/A?

Wait, the question says "narrative device... involving Isaac Reed’s internal monologues about civilization." The article says the captain's line is the poetic statement. So Isaac's monologues aren't mentioned. Therefore N/A.

21. **Question 21:** Credit for the washed-out aesthetic. The article says "the cinematographer Jacques Jouffret... provided a washed-out, blue-gray look." So Jouffret.

22. **Question 22:** Director of gunfights and trail rides. The article says "director Peter Berg manages the gunfights and trail rides proficiently." So Peter Berg.

23. **Question 23:** Mid-19th-century conflict as basis. The Utah War of 1857-58 is mentioned as the basis. So Utah War.

24. **Question 24:** Actor portraying Jim Bridger. The article says Jim Bridger is played by Shea Whigham.

25. **Question 25:** Creator of the series. Mark L. Smith, who also worked on The Revenant.

26. **Question 26:** Mute Native American character. Two Moons.

27. **Question 27:** Pennsylvania character criticized. Sara Rowell.

28. **Question 28:** Philosophical statement by the captain. The quote given is "I have come to believe that these lands possess forces that we civilized are not able to defend against."

29. **Question 29:** Actor playing Isaac Reed. Taylor Kitsch, who was in "Friday Night Lights."

30. **Question 30:** Recurring visual element. Hanging, skinning, draining, boiling of animal carcasses, as mentioned in the first paragraph.
