Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question asks which specific foreign aid programs Vought eliminated during his first term as OMB director according to his testimony. The article mentions he froze military aid for Ukraine but doesn't specify any other programs he eliminated. The answer might be just Ukraine military aid, but the question says "successfully eliminate"â€”since freezing isn't eliminating, maybe N/A?

Wait, the article says "froze military aid for Ukraine". The question is about "eliminated", so maybe the answer is N/A because freezing isn't the same as eliminating. The testimony part says he testified about his qualifications but the article doesn't list eliminated programs beyond the freeze. So answer N/A.

2. How many civil servants converted to Schedule F? The article says he was involved in Project 2025 and Schedule F, but the exact number isn't given. So N/A.

3. Total dollar amount of military aid frozen in 2019? The article mentions he froze aid to Ukraine but doesn't specify the amount. So N/A.

4. Regulatory review procedures established by the Department of Government Efficiency with Vought? The article says Vought would work closely with the Department of Government Efficiency but doesn't mention specific procedures they established. N/A.

5. Percentage reduction in federal workforce via Schedule F? The article doesn't state a specific percentage for Project 2025's mandate. N/A.

6. How did the budget blueprint restructure Medicare provider payments? The article mentions cutting Medicare payments to providers as part of the $9 trillion plan. So answer: cutting Medicare payments to health care providers.

7. Criteria for determining who works during shutdowns? The article says he expanded the number required to work but doesn't specify criteria. N/A.

8. Timeline for Project 2025 implementation? The article doesn't mention a specific timeline. N/A.

9. Additional authority under unitary executive theory? The article states Vought believes in impoundment authority against the 1974 act. The answer would be impoundment authority.

10. Oversight mechanisms proposed for the Department of Government Efficiency? The article doesn't mention any proposed oversight. N/A.

11. Percentage increase in military spending? The blueprint's $9 trillion reduction includes military cuts. The question asks for an increase proposed by the Center, but the article says their plan had cuts. So N/A.

12. Which law did Blumenthal cite? The article says Blumenthal referenced the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. That's the answer.

13. Number of civil servants to be "traumatically affected"? The article says "tens of thousands" under Schedule F but the exact number isn't given. However, the ProPublica report quote says "tens of thousands" could be converted. But the question asks how many Vought stated, so the exact number isn't there. N/A? Wait, the article says "convert tens of thousands of civil servants" so maybe the answer is N/A because it's an estimate, not a specific number.

14. Year Koskinen oversaw the transition? The article says the Bureau became OMB in 1970. Koskinen was deputy director in the 1990s, so he didn't oversee the 1970 transition. So N/A.

15. Specific Medicare payment type besides providers? The article mentions Medicare payments to providers and cuts to disability insurance payments. So disability insurance payments.

16. Which group founded by Vought drafted Schedule F? The article says Vought founded the Center for Renewing America, which was part of Project 2025. But Schedule F was an executive order by Trump. The article says Project 2025 was an effort by conservative groups including his think tank. So answer: Center for Renewing America.

17. Corruption investigation tied to Zelensky? The article states the investigation was into Joe Biden. So answer: corruption investigation into Joseph R. Biden Jr.

18. Advisory group with Musk focused on veteran disability? The article mentions the Department of Government Efficiency with Musk and Ramaswamy, and Vought's plan includes cutting veteran disability payments. The group's name is Department of Government Efficiency.

19. Which agency criticized for foreign aid? The article says Vought criticized the OMB (formerly Bureau of the Budget in Treasury). The specific agency before redesignation in 1970 was the Bureau of the Budget. So answer: Bureau of the Budget.

20. How many times was Trump impeached? The article mentions his first impeachment related to Vought's actions. It doesn't say a second one. So answer: 1.
