Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. I need to be careful to only use the information given and avoid any assumptions.

1. The first question asks about the credential the Navy SEAL had. The article mentions he was an equipment manager for the lacrosse team and had graduated from Tufts. It says he lacked credentials, so maybe the credential was being an equipment manager? Wait, the question is about a credential deemed insufficient. The article states he didn't have credentials for leading workouts, so the answer might be "equipment manager" but I need to check the exact wording. The article says "he had recently graduated from Tufts and was an equipment manager..." so his role was equipment manager, which isn't a qualification for leading workouts. So the credential he had was being an equipment manager, which was insufficient. But the question says "possess that was later deemed insufficient", so answer: equipment manager.

2. The second question is about an NCAA policy on hydration violated. The article mentions NCAA guidelines on transition periods but not hydration. It says the NCAA recommends gradual increase in intensity. So maybe there's no mention of hydration protocols specifically. Answer: N/A.

3. The third question asks how many required kidney dialysis, comparing to Iowa's case. The Iowa incident had 13 hospitalized, but the article doesn't say how many needed dialysis. The Texas case had one hospitalized. The Tufts article doesn't mention dialysis numbers. Answer: N/A.

4. The Naval Special Warfare Command's disciplinary action: the article says they didn't respond to the request for comment and that the SEAL wasn't part of a Navy event. They didn't confirm any action. Answer: N/A.

5. Modified workout's muscle group exercises replacing burpees. The article says students modified the routine due to difficulty but doesn't specify which exercises replaced burpees. Answer: N/A.

6. The Texas soccer team's precedent: The review cited failure to implement acclimatization, which is mentioned in the article. The Texas case is mentioned as another instance of rhabdo, so the precedent is their failure to acclimatize. Answer: failure to implement proper acclimatization principles (but the question asks for the precedent cited, which is the Texas case's failure, so maybe the answer is the Texas case itself? Wait the question says "cited as a failure to implement proper acclimatization principles"—the review's own finding, so maybe N/A? Wait the article says the investigators found the SEAL didn't follow acclimatization principles, and the Texas case is mentioned as another example. The question asks what precedent was cited. The article says the Texas case had rhabdo but doesn't say the review cited it as a precedent for acclimatization. So maybe N/A? Hmm. The article says "the review also faulted the university for... no policies... direction of care..." but not linking Texas to acclimatization. So answer N/A.

7. Which third-party medical institution's guidelines were disregarded? The article mentions NCAA guidelines but no specific medical institution. Answer: N/A.

8. The sports performance director's prior experience leading military-style workouts: The article doesn't mention his experience, only that he approved the plan same day. Answer: N/A.

9. Total push-ups: The session had 250 burpees, which include a push-up each. So 250 push-ups? But the question is about push-ups specifically. The article says "about 250 burpees" which involve a push-up each, so total push-ups would be 250. Answer: 250.

10. Other official who apologized: The article says president and athletics director issued a statement. No other official mentioned. Answer: N/A.

11. Muscle condition developed: The article mentions rhabdomyolysis. The question asks what condition, so answer: rhabdomyolysis.

12. Exercise associated with military and injury: Burpees are mentioned as used in military and CrossFit, linked to injuries. Answer: burpees.

13. When did symptoms first appear? The article says "by the next morning, students began experiencing adverse effects". So next morning after the session. Answer: next morning.

14. Command body that didn't respond: Naval Special Warfare Command. Answer: Naval Special Warfare Command.

15. Training principle neglected: Acclimatization principles, as stated in the article. Answer: acclimatization.

16. Number with rhabdo: The article says 24 of 61 developed rhabdo. Answer: 24.

17. Official who celebrated success and apologized: The president and athletics director. The article says they acknowledged the championship and apologized. Answer: Sunil Kumar and John Morris (but the question asks for another official besides them? Wait the question says "besides the president and athletics director"—so answer N/A? Wait the question says "which university official besides..." so if only those two apologized, then N/A. Answer: N/A.

18. Lack in emergency response: The review faulted the university for no policies on transportation or medical direction. Answer: transportation of students to hospitals and medical care direction.

19. Deficiency in leader's background: Lack of credentials, familiarity with NCAA policies, and acclimatization knowledge. The article specifically says he didn't have credentials and lacked NCAA policy knowledge. The main deficiency highlighted is lacking credentials. Answer: lacked credentials.
