Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to go through each question and check the article for the exact information needed. Remember, I can only use the given text and must answer directly, using N/A if the info isn't there.

1. **Question 1**: The research by the kinesiology instructor (Ian Bonder) mentions using a trap bar allows lifting heavier weights leading to greater improvements in power and force, but the article doesn't state a specific percentage increase in grip strength. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The get-up is said to date back to 18th-century wrestlers, but the article doesn't mention a specific school or group that standardized it. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The text says hill training improves proprioception but doesn't give a measured percentage after 8 weeks. N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The landmine press angle for maximizing shoulder activation isn't specified. The article mentions the position but not the exact degrees. N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The farmer's walk's weight for bone density isn't quantified in pounds. The article says "more than you can easily hoist over your head" but no exact number. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The hexagonal trap bar deadlift vs barbell—does the article mention which muscle group had the greatest increase? It says trap bar targets quads and legs more, but no specific muscle group's percentage increase. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Heart rate zone for downhill portion? The text mentions downhill challenges quads and improves proprioception but no specific zone. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Thoracic rotation degrees gained from get-up exercise? The article doesn't provide numerical data on degrees. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Core engagement increase with single-arm presses? The physical therapist (Dr. Kallasy) says it challenges core, but no percentage given. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The exercise that improves proprioception with uphill/downhill is hill training. The text says both parts help proprioception. So the answer is "climbing a moderate hill" but the exercise name given in the article is "hill climbs and descents" under the third exercise. The article's third exercise is the hill training. The question asks which exercise recommended is noted for that. The answer is "climbing a moderate hill" but the exact name from the article's five highlighted exercises would be the third one: "Adding climbs and descents to your regular cardio routine -- like running or walking..." So the answer is "hill training" but the exact title in the article is the third exercise's main move, which is the hill climbs. Wait, the article's third exercise is called "Climbing and descending hills". The exact name from the article's five exercises: The third one starts with "Adding climbs and descents..." so the exercise is "hill climbs and descents". But the question asks for the name of the exercise recommended. The article's third exercise's name is probably "hill training" but the exact phrasing is "climbing a moderate hill with a 7 percent grade..." but the exercise's title isn't explicitly named. Alternatively, the exercise is "hill repeats" or "hill sprints", but the article says the third move is "climbing and descending hills". The exact answer is "the exercise recommended by the experts that improves proprioception with uphill and downhill is the third one, which is the hill climbs and descents. The question asks for the name of the exercise. Looking back: The third exercise is introduced with "Adding climbs and descents to your regular cardio routine..." so the exercise is "climbing and descending hills" or "hill training". The answer should be the third exercise's title. The article's third exercise is called "Hill Workouts" but the exact name isn't given, but the question asks which one is noted for that. The answer is "hill climbs and descents" but the article might refer to it as "hill training". Wait, the article's third section starts with a bold title. Let me check again. The third exercise is under the heading "Adding climbs and descents to your regular cardio routine -- like running or walking -- can turn it into a fitness superfood." The exercise's name here is "hill training" or "hill climbs and descents". The question asks for the name of the exercise. Since the article doesn't name it specifically, but the exercise is the one involving hills, the answer is "climbing and descending hills" but the exact term from the text is "climbing a moderate hill with a 7 percent grade". Alternatively, the exercise is called "hill repeats" as per the instructions to do 30 seconds uphill then downhill. The answer is "climbing and descending hills" but the exact answer might be "hill climbs and descents" as per the article's description. The question asks for the exercise recommended, so the answer is "climbing a moderate hill with a 7 percent grade" but the exercise's title isn't explicitly named. Wait, the article's five exercises are listed as: 

1. Trap bar deadlift

2. The get-up (described in the second section)

3. Climbing and descending hills (third section)

4. Single-arm landmine press (fourth)

5. Farmer's carry (fifth)

So the third exercise is "Adding climbs and descents to your regular cardio routine". So the exercise is "climbing and descending hills" or "hill training". The answer is "hill climbs and descents".

11. **Question 11**: The starting position for the get-up is described as lying on the floor with right knee bent, foot on floor, left arm on ground, left leg at 30 degrees, and right hand holding weight overhead. The question asks which movement's starting position is lying on the floor with left knee bent and weight in right hand. Wait, the description says "right knee bent" and left leg out. The question says "left knee bent"—so maybe a typo? Let me check the article again. The get-up description says: "Lie on the floor with your right knee bent and your foot on the floor. Place your left arm on the ground and your left leg out to the side at about a 30-degree angle. Hold a kettlebell or dumbbell in your right hand straight over your chest." So the starting position has the right knee bent, not left. The question says "left knee bent"—so maybe it's a trick question? The answer would be N/A because the question's description doesn't match. Wait, the question says "left knee bent and a weight held in the right hand". According to the article, the right knee is bent, left leg is out at 30 degrees. So the left knee is straight? The question's description doesn't match, so the answer is N/A. Wait, maybe I misread. The starting position is right knee bent, left leg at 30 degrees. So the left knee is not bent. Therefore, the question's scenario isn't in the article. So answer is N/A? But the question is about the get-up movement. The get-up's starting position is as described, so the answer is the get-up exercise. The question's wording: "lying on the floor with the left knee bent and a weight held in the right hand"—but in the article, the left leg is out at 30 degrees (so not bent), right knee is bent. So the left knee isn't bent. Therefore, the answer is N/A. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the question, but I have to go by the text. Since the article's get-up starts with right knee bent, the answer is N/A.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the other side? Like if you do the get-up on the other side, but the article describes starting with right knee bent. The question's scenario doesn't match exactly, so answer is N/A.

12. **Question 12**: The article states a 7% grade increases heart rate by 15%, not 25%. The question asks for a 25% increase, so the answer is N/A.

13. **Question 13**: The landmine press is performed kneeling on one knee (half-kneeling), using a landmine hinge. The exercise is the single-arm landmine press (fourth section). So the answer is "single-arm landmine press".

14. **Question 14**: The article mentions "a corner with a towel" as an alternative to a landmine hinge. The household item is a towel. But the question is about the Pilates routine. Wait, the last part says: "Want to try Pilates at home but don't have the equipment? This simple routine requires nothing more than a mat." So the household item is a mat. The question asks what's suggested as an alternative for Pilates, which is a mat. The answer is "a mat".

15. **Question 15**: The exercise cautioned against was burpees due to injury risk when done quickly in demanding workouts. The article says: "Burpees hit a lot of muscles, but can cause injury, especially when done quickly or tacked onto a demanding workout." So the answer is "burpees".

16. **Question 16**: The text says "it takes eight muscles to move and stabilize your shoulders" so the answer is "eight".

17. **Question 17**: The farmer's carry starting distance is 50 feet. The article says "50 feet is a good starting distance".

18. **Question 18**: The hexagonal-shaped trap bar is specified. The answer is "trap bar".
