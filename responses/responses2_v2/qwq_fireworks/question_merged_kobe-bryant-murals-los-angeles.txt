Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks which NBA team Kobe played for before joining the Lakers. The article says he entered the NBA in 1996 and spent his entire 20-season career with the Lakers. Since he started with the Lakers, there's no prior team mentioned. So the answer is N/A.

2. The petition to save the Venice Beach mural isn't mentioned. The petition mentioned was for the downtown gym mural, which had over 90,000 signatures. The Venice Beach one isn't linked to a petition in the text. So N/A here.

3. The gym owner's name isn't provided in the article. It just says the gym owner was hesitant but allowed Palsino. Since there's no name, answer is N/A.

4. The photo for Jonas Never's mural was from a playoff game, but the specific game isn't named. The article mentions it's a playoff game during his final season, 2015-16, but not which one. So N/A.

5. Vanessa Bryant shared the petition with over 90k signatures, but the exact message she posted isn't stated. The article doesn't quote her social media post, so N/A.

6. The donation by 2K is described as "an undisclosed donation". Since the amount isn't given, answer N/A.

7. The Venice Beach mural's jerseys are noted as Lakers colors, with a purple backsplash. The article says their jerseys are on a purple background, so the jerseys themselves might be the Lakers' colors, which are purple and gold. But the question is about the jersey colors. Wait, the text says "their basketball jerseys on a purple backsplash". The jerseys' colors aren't specified beyond the backsplash color. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A because the jersey colors aren't stated. Wait, but Lakers' primary colors are purple and gold. Since it's a Lakers mural, maybe they're wearing Lakers jerseys, so the colors would be purple and gold. But the article doesn't explicitly state the jersey colors, only the backsplash is purple. The question is about the jerseys' color. Since it's not directly stated, maybe N/A. Wait, let me check again. The exact line: "She depicted Kobe, 41, and Gianna, 13, in their basketball jerseys on a purple backsplash, a nod to the Lakers' color scheme." The Lakers' colors are purple and gold, so their jerseys are those colors. Since the article says "a nod to the Lakers' color scheme," the jerseys would be purple and gold. But the question is specifically about the color of the jerseys. Since the text says "their basketball jerseys on a purple backsplash," maybe the jerseys are the Lakers' colors, so the answer would be purple and gold. But the question asks "what color were..." so maybe the answer is "purple and gold." Wait, but the article says the backsplash is purple, which is a nod to Lakers' colors. The jerseys themselves might be the team colors. Since it's a mural of Lakers players, the jerseys are likely purple and gold. However, the article doesn't explicitly state the jersey colors, so maybe it's inferred. The question requires a direct answer. Since the text doesn't explicitly say the jersey colors, perhaps N/A. Hmm, conflicting here. Let me think again. The article says "their basketball jerseys on a purple backsplash, a nod to the Lakers' color scheme." The Lakers' color scheme includes purple and gold, so the jerseys are probably those colors. Since the question is about the color of the jerseys, and the article implies that the mural uses the Lakers' colors, maybe the answer is "purple and gold." But the question might expect just the color mentioned in the text. Wait, the backsplash is purple, but the jerseys could be a combination. Since the question is about the jerseys, and the text says "a nod to the Lakers' color scheme," which is purple and gold, maybe the answer is that color. But the question might require the exact wording from the article. Since the article doesn't explicitly state the jersey colors, just the backsplash's color, maybe it's N/A. I'll have to go with N/A here because the jersey colors aren't directly mentioned.

8. The question asks which other celebrities' murals have remained untouched like Bryant's. The article only mentions Bryant's murals being respected, not others. So N/A.

9. The completion date of Palsino's first mural isn't given. The article mentions he painted it after Bryant's death in 2020 but no exact date. So N/A.

10. The number of Nike signature shoes Kobe released isn't specified. The article says he developed a signature shoe with Nike, but not how many. So N/A.

11. The question is how many murals Jonas Never painted after the 2015-16 season. The article mentions he did one mural then, but not the total. So N/A.

12. The material Kay Luz used isn't mentioned. The article refers to a "large canvas" at a pizza shop. The material (like paint type) isn't stated. So N/A.

13. The warning message on the gym mural is in "faded white script." The article says "the words 'Do not touch this mural' are sprayed in a faded white script." So the answer is white.

14. The alleyway's name isn't provided. It's described as a few blocks from Staples Center but no specific name. So N/A.

15. The year the gym owner allowed Palsino to paint was when Bryant died, which was 2020. The article states "the overcast January morning that Bryant died," so the year is 2020.

16. The question asks which team Jonas Never worked for before the mural. The article says he worked on projects for LA sports teams but doesn't specify which. So N/A.

17. The video game franchise is NBA 2K, as mentioned by 2K's donation. The franchise is NBA 2K.

18. The petition had over 90,000 signatures, as stated in the article.

19. Kay Luz's mural was on a pizza shop. The question asks where the shop was located before the pandemic. The text says "a pizza shop on the Venice Beach boardwalk," so the answer is a pizza shop.
