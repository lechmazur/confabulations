Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and don't infer anything beyond what's written. Let me start with the first question.

1. **Which African nation reported the highest percentage increase in clinic wait times following the PEPFAR funding freeze?**  
The article mentions that in South Africa, clinics had larger crowds leading to longer waits, but it doesn't specify percentages or which country had the highest increase. So, N/A.

2. **How many medical professionals in Botswana lost their positions during the first 48 hours of the Trump administration's aid freeze?**  
The text says PEPFAR employs around 13,000 in South Africa but doesn't mention Botswana's numbers. So, N/A.

3. **Total monetary value of expired antiretroviral medications due to distribution delays?**  
No information on expired meds or their value. N/A.

4. **Which regional health minister first announced the emergency contingency plan?**  
The article doesn't name any specific minister who made such an announcement. N/A.

5. **How many additional HIV testing centers did South Africa establish to compensate?**  
No mention of new testing centers being set up. N/A.

6. **What percentage of HealthPlus's rural outreach programs remained operational under the waiver?**  
The article states their programs were put on hold but doesn't give a percentage. N/A.

7. **How many days of advance notice did clinic admins receive before the freeze?**  
No info on the notice period. N/A.

8. **Alternative funding source Stanley Monageng secured?**  
The text says his organization relies mostly on PEPFAR and he's worried about funding, but no alternative source is mentioned. N/A.

9. **Number of mobile clinic units in Eswatini permanently closed?**  
It says all were put on hold, but not permanently closed. N/A.

10. **Average reduction in medication supply in Johannesburg clinics before the freeze?**  
The student got a 3-month supply instead of 6, but that's an individual case, not an average reduction. N/A.

11. **Number of clinics beyond HealthPlus withholding meds despite the waiver?**  
The article says HealthPlus is continuing to withhold but doesn't mention others. N/A.

12. **Percentage of South Africa's HIV budget beyond the 17% affected?**  
The 17% is what they rely on PEPFAR for, so the rest (83%) isn't directly affected. But the question asks what percentage was affected beyond the 17%. Since the freeze only affected PEPFAR's 17%, the rest wasn't directly affected. So maybe 0%, but the question says "leading to extended wait times." The staff shortages caused the waits, so maybe the 17% is the part causing the issue. The question is confusing. The answer might be N/A because it's not stated.

13. **Projected deaths in Botswana over a decade if PEPFAR ends, similar to South Africa's 600k?**  
The study mentions South Africa's 600k, but no number for Botswana. N/A.

14. **Other individuals born with HIV getting 3-month supply instead of 6?**  
Only the 19-year-old student is mentioned. N/A.

15. **Other clinics in Eswatini serving gay men closed besides HealthPlus?**  
The article only mentions HealthPlus being closed. N/A.

16. **Number of medical professionals in other countries ordered to stop then resume?**  
The 13k are in South Africa. The article doesn't specify numbers elsewhere. N/A.

17. **Duration of the PEPFAR pause before partial reversal?**  
The freeze was for three months as per the admin's announcement, but the backtracking happened quickly (within a week). The exact duration before the reversal isn't stated. N/A.

18. **Number of children beyond Monageng's supported in Botswana at risk?**  
The article only mentions Monageng's organization's children. N/A.

19. **Average wait time increase beyond 10 hours?**  
It says some waited 10 hours but doesn't give an average increase. N/A.

20. **Organizations besides the International Treatment Preparedness Coalition criticizing?**  
Only that coalition is quoted. N/A.
