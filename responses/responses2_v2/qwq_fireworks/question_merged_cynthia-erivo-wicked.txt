Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the strict format. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks which character, celebrated with a Tony Award and later featured on Sardi’s celebrity wall, was central to Cynthia Erivo’s Broadway revival that set the stage for her film career. The article mentions that Erivo won a Tony for her performance as Celie in "The Color Purple" revival. It also states that her caricature at Sardi's was received after that Tony win. So the answer should be Celie.

2. The next question is about the fellowship she had to decline. The article says she was accepted into Harvard's Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in 2021 but declined due to her busy schedule. The focus was on studying how everyday experiences affect voices, including singing. So the fellowship is the Radcliffe Institute fellowship.

3. For the third question, when students reach a belting note, Erivo observed that the note and sound are there but disappear when put into a song. The exact phrase is "they put it in a song. It disappears." So the answer is "it disappears" or "the note disappears." But since the question asks what happens, the answer is "It disappears."

4. The director hesitant about her age for a youthful role was Jon M. Chu. He was the director of "Wicked" and mentioned uncertainty about casting someone her age (35) for Elphaba's innocence. The answer is Jon M. Chu.

5. The mirror scene in the film where the skin changes color is from "The Wizard and I" number. The article describes that scene where Elphaba's skin turns brown then back green. So the answer is "The Wizard and I."

6. The London institution where she studied and taught is the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). The text states she taught at her alma mater, RADA in London. So RADA is the answer.

7. The biopic where she played an abolitionist is "Harriet," portraying Harriet Tubman. The director Kasi Lemmons praised her performance, mentioning the run scene. So the answer is "Harriet."

8. The character from the Broadway revival that influenced her commitment is again Celie from "The Color Purple," as that role earned her the Tony and Sardi's recognition. The question is similar to the first but phrased differently, so Celie again.

9. The $114 million opening refers to "Wicked," and the nomination mentioned after is the SAG Award. The article states she was nominated for SAG after the film's release. So SAG Award.

10. The publication with Dana Scruggs' photography is The New York Times, as the credit line says "Credit...Dana Scruggs for The New York Times." The ensemble description is part of that section. So The New York Times.

Now, I'll check each answer again to ensure they're all directly from the text and in the correct format.
