Alright, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. I need to be careful and make sure I only use the information given.

1. **Question 1:** The venture capital firm before Green Bay Ventures. The article mentions he started Green Bay Ventures after retiring from NEA in 2012. So the firm before that would be NEA. Answer: New Enterprise Associates (NEA).

2. **Question 2:** Number of lightbulbs. The article says he bought "half a train car worth of lightbulbs from Sylvania Corporation." But no exact number is given. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Sale price of the house. It says he listed it for $19.5 million. The question asks the final sale price, but the article only mentions the listing price, not the final sale. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Who introduced him to Jobs and Wozniak. The article states during the fundraising period for NEA, he met the two Steves but doesn't mention who introduced them. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Return percentage on PowerPoint. The article says Microsoft bought Forethought (PowerPoint) for $14 million. But without initial investment amount, can't calculate percentage. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Wife responsible for art collection. The article mentions Pamela Kay Palmer (his wife since 1981) and they collected new media art. So her name. Answer: Pamela Kay Kramlich.

7. **Question 7:** Financial Engines' IPO value. The article states it took 18 years to go public but doesn't give the value. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Employees in father's chain. The article says father had 25 stores bought by Kroger, but not employees. N/A.

18. **Question 18:** Where he learned investing after Harvard. A firm in Boston before Arthur Rock? The article says after Kroger, he worked for a firm in Boston. Answer: The Boston investment firm (exact name not given, so N/A? Wait, the article says "a firm in Boston" but doesn't name it. So N/A. Wait, no, the next sentence says he joined Arthur Rock & Co. in 1969. The prior firm was unnamed. So the answer is N/A? Or the Boston firm? The question asks where he learned the ropes after Harvard. The article says "learned the ropes of investing while working for a firm in Boston." Since the name isn't given, N/A. Wait, but the question is phrased as "where did Kramlich begin to learn the ropes..." so the answer is the firm in Boston, but since it's not named, N/A. Hmm, tricky. The question says "distinguishing consumer electronics from software..." but the actual question is 18: "where did he begin to learn the ropes of high-risk investing after earning his masterâ€™s degree?" The article says after Harvard, he worked for Kroger, then a firm in Boston. The answer is the Boston firm, but since it's not named, the answer is N/A. Wait, but the exact question is about the firm's name. Since it's not provided, N/A. But maybe I missed it. Let me check again: "After receiving a master's degree from Harvard Business School, he went to work for Kroger, and then learned the ropes of investing while working for a firm in Boston." So the firm is unnamed. So answer N/A. Wait, but the question is asking for the name of the firm. Since it's not given, N/A. So the answer is N/A.

20. **Question 20:** Grocery chain that bought father's stores. Kroger. Answer: Kroger.
