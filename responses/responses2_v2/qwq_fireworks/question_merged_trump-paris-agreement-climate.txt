Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start with question 1.

1. The first question asks which former EPA administrator criticized Trump's withdrawal for impacting Detroit autoworkers. The article mentions Gina McCarthy, former White House climate adviser and former EPA head. She said something about not handing clean-car keys to China. That must be the one. So answer is Gina McCarthy.

2. The second question is about the percentage points needed annually between 2024-2035 for Biden's target. The article states that emissions need to decline nearly 10 times as fast as the past decade. Past decade's drop was 20% since 2005, over 19 years (2005-2024?), but the question is about 2024-2035. Wait, the article says "to meet its climate goals, U.S. emissions would need to decline nearly 10 times as fast each year as they've fallen over the past decade." The past decade's annual rate: 20% over ~20 years (from 2005 to 2024?), so maybe 1% per year? If they need 10x that, that's 10% per year? But the exact numbers might be different. Wait, the article says "the United States is even further off-track from hitting Mr. Biden's goal... of slashing greenhouse gases 61 percent below 2005 levels by 2035." The needed annual drop would be (61% - current 20% reduction) over the remaining years? Hmm, maybe the article says "need to decline nearly 10 times as fast each year as they've fallen over the past decade." The past decade's rate: since 2005, 20% over ~20 years, so 1% per year. 10x that is 10% per year. But the question is how many percentage points annually? So 10? But the answer might be "N/A" if exact numbers aren't given. Wait, the article says "need to decline nearly 10 times as fast each year as they've fallen over the past decade." The past decade's rate would be (20% over 20 years?) or 1% per year. So 10x that is 10% per year. But the question asks for the required annual percentage points. The answer would be 10? But the article doesn't state the exact number, just a factor. The question might need an exact figure, so maybe N/A? Wait, let me check again. The exact quote is: "U.S. emissions would need to decline nearly 10 times as fast each year as they've fallen over the past decade." So the required rate is 10x the past decade's rate. The past decade's rate: from 2005 to 2024 (assuming 2024 is the current year in the article), that's 19 years. 20% over 19 years is roughly 1.05% per year. So 10x that is ~10.5% per year. But the question asks for percentage points. The answer might be 10 (approximate). But since the article doesn't give exact numbers, maybe it's N/A? Hmm, tricky. Wait, the question is about the "Paris Agreement targets outlined in the Biden administration's latest pledge". The target is 61% by 2035. From 2024 to 2035 is 11 years. Current emissions are 20% below 2005. So needed drop is 61-20=41% over 11 years. That's about 3.7% per year. But the article says they need to decline 10x the past rate. The past rate (since 2005) is 20% over 19 years (approx 1% per year). 10x that would be 10% per year. The question is asking the required annual percentage points to achieve the target. Since the article says "nearly 10 times as fast", maybe the answer is 10. But the exact number might not be given. Alternatively, the article might not state the exact percentage points needed each year, just the multiple. So maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "how many percentage points did U.S. emissions need to drop annually... to achieve the Paris Agreement targets..." So the answer must be derived from the info given. The article says they need to decline nearly 10 times as fast as the past decade. The past decade's rate is 1% per year, so 10x is 10% per year. So the answer is 10? Or the exact calculation from the target? Let me see: 61% by 2035. From 2024, 11 years. Current is 20% below 2005. Need to go from 20% to 61%, so 41% over 11 years. 41/11 â‰ˆ3.7% per year. The article says they need to decline 10x the past rate. The past rate (over the past decade) would be (20% over 20 years?), but perhaps the past decade's rate is 1% per year. 10x is 10% per year, but the required is 3.7? Maybe the question is wrong, but according to the article's phrasing, the answer is 10 times the past rate, so the required rate is 10x the past. Since the article doesn't give the exact number of percentage points, maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, but the question might expect the 10x figure. Let me check again. The article says "to meet its climate goals, U.S. emissions would need to decline nearly 10 times as fast each year as they've fallen over the past decade." So the required annual decrease is 10 times the past decade's annual rate. The past decade's rate is (20% over 20 years?) but the past decade would be from 2014 to 2024 (10 years). The total drop since 2005 is 20%, but over 19 years. Maybe the past decade's rate is (20% over 19 years) is about 1% per year. So 10x would be 10% per year. But the needed is 3.7% to reach the target. The question is asking what they need to drop annually to meet the target, so the correct answer would be 3.7, but the article doesn't state that number. Alternatively, the article says they need to decline 10x as fast, so the answer is 10 times the past rate. Since the question is about the required percentage points, and the article doesn't give the exact figure, maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, I'm confused here. Let me see the exact wording again. The question is "how many percentage points did U.S. emissions need to drop annually between 2024-2035 to achieve the Paris Agreement targets outlined in the Biden administration's latest pledge?" The article says "need to decline nearly 10 times as fast each year as they've fallen over the past decade." The past decade's rate is (20% over 20 years?), so 1% per year. 10 times that is 10% per year. So the answer would be 10. Even though the actual needed for the target is 3.7, the article's phrasing says they need to decline 10x the past rate. So maybe the answer is 10. Let me go with 10.

3. The third question asks the primary reason for emissions staying flat despite renewable growth in 2023. The article says "emissions levels stayed relatively flat last year because demand for electricity surged nationwide, which led to a spike in the amount of natural gas burned by power plants." So the reason is increased electricity demand leading to more natural gas use. The answer is electricity demand surge leading to increased natural gas burning.

4. Question 4: According to Climate Action Tracker, by what year would global temps exceed the Paris Agreement's original 1.5C target if current pledges are met? The article states that if all pledges are followed, temps would rise 2.6C by end of century, which is above 1.5. The original target was 1.5C, so exceeding that would happen by the end of the century. So the answer is 2100, but the question says "by what year" when they exceed. Since the study says "by the end of the century", the answer is 2100.

5. Question 5: Which Middle Eastern nation joined Paris after Trump's withdrawal? The article says the US will join Iran, Libya, and Yemen as the only non-parties. So the US is leaving, so the other countries not in are Iran, Libya, Yemen. The question is asking which Middle Eastern nation joined immediately after Trump's withdrawal. Wait, the article says that the US is withdrawing, so the four countries not in are Iran, Libya, Yemen, and the US. The question is asking which Middle Eastern nation joined immediately after Trump's withdrawal? The answer must be that none, but the question might be a trick. Wait, the article says the US withdrawal would make it join those three, so the other three are already not in. So the answer might be N/A, but maybe the question is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is N/A because the question is about a country that joined after the withdrawal, but the article doesn't mention any Middle Eastern country joining. The three non-parties are Iran, Libya, Yemen. The US is leaving, so the answer is the US is joining them, but the question is about a Middle Eastern nation that joined. Iran is Middle Eastern. So maybe the answer is N/A, because the article doesn't say any Middle Eastern country joined after Trump's withdrawal. The US is leaving, so the three existing non-Middle Eastern? Wait, Iran is Middle Eastern. The US is joining Iran, Libya (North African?), Yemen (Middle Eastern). The question says "Middle Eastern nation joined immediately after", but the article doesn't mention any new countries joining. The existing non-parties include Iran and Yemen. So the answer is N/A. Wait, the question is phrased as "joined immediately after Trump's withdrawal announcement?" So maybe the answer is N/A, because the article states that the US is joining those three, so those three were already not part of the agreement before the withdrawal. Therefore, no Middle Eastern country joined after. Hence N/A.

6. Question 6: What percentage of global oil production did US exports represent when Trump signed the withdrawal? The article says "the United States is now producing more crude oil and natural gas than any nation in history. Mr. Trump has vowed to further ramp up production and exports." But it doesn't give a specific percentage. So answer is N/A.

7. Question 7: How many months before Brazil COP did Biden announce the 61% target? The article says "Biden's goal announced last month under the Paris Agreement... This year's COP will be held in Brazil in November." If the announcement was last month before the article's writing, but the article's date isn't clear. Assuming the article is written in 2024, and the COP is in November 2024, and the announcement was "last month" (say, October), then it's 1 month before. But the article doesn't specify exact months. The article says "last month", so if the COP is in November, then the announcement was in October, so 1 month before. So answer is 1 month? But the question says "how many months before the Brazil COP meeting did Biden announce the revised 61% target?" The article says the goal was announced "last month", and the COP is in November. Assuming "last month" is October, then it's 1 month. But without exact dates, maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "last month under the auspices of the Paris Agreement" and "This year's COP will be held in Brazil in November". So if the announcement was last month before the article's publication, and the COP is in November, then it depends. If the article is written in October, then it's 1 month. If in September, 2 months. Since we don't know, the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "announced last month under the auspices of the Paris Agreement". The COP is in November. Assuming "last month" is the month before the article's publication, but without knowing the article's date, can't determine. So N/A.

8. Question 8: What role did Christiana Figueres play in implementing the Framework Convention's enforcement? The article says she was an architect of the Paris Agreement in 2015. The Framework Convention is the UNFCCC, which hosts COPs. So her role was as an architect of the Paris Agreement, which is under the Convention. The question is about her role in implementing enforcement mechanisms. The article doesn't specify her role beyond being an architect, so maybe N/A. The answer might be "architect of the Paris Agreement" but the question asks about the enforcement mechanisms. Since the article doesn't say, N/A.

9. Question 9: Which state had the largest increase in natural gas for electricity? The article doesn't mention any specific states, so N/A.

10. Question 10: Total reduction in US emissions during Trump's first term. The article mentions that during his first term, he withdrew from Paris, but Biden rejoined. The article states "since 2005, U.S. emissions have fallen roughly 20 percent". Trump's first term was 2017-2021. The article says "emissions dropped just a fraction last year, 0.2 percent, compared with the year earlier" in 2024. But the total reduction since 2005 is 20%. The question is about the reduction during Trump's first term. The article doesn't provide data for that specific period, only the overall since 2005. So N/A.

11. Question 11: What percentage reduction by 2035 if Trump rolled back policies? The article says Rhodium Group found that under rollback, emissions might fall 24-40% below 2005 by 2030. The question is asking for 2035, but the article says 2030. So N/A, since the question is about 2035 but the article gives 2030.

12. Question 12: Besides Iran, Libya, Yemen, what other Middle Eastern country is not in? The article lists the four as US, Iran, Libya, Yemen. The question asks for another Middle Eastern nation besides those three. Since Iran and Yemen are Middle Eastern, the only other is the US, which is not Middle Eastern. So the answer is none, so N/A. Wait, the question says "other Middle Eastern nation", so maybe the answer is N/A because the other countries are not Middle Eastern. The three non-US countries are Iran (Middle East), Libya (North Africa), Yemen (Middle East). So the US is the fourth, but it's not Middle Eastern. So the answer is N/A.

13. Question 13: What Celsius target did Paris set? The article says the original goal was 1.5 degrees Celsius. The question asks what the Paris Agreement originally set as a goal, which is 1.5C. The Climate Action Tracker study says if current pledges are followed, temps would rise to 2.6C, exceeding 1.5. So the answer is 1.5.

14. Question 14: Where is COP29 held? The article says "This year's COP will be held in Brazil in November". Assuming this is COP29, but the article doesn't state the number, just "this year's COP". So answer is N/A unless the article mentions the number. The article doesn't specify COP29, just "annual climate negotiations known as COPs" and "this year's COP". So N/A.

15. Question 15: Gina McCarthy's role before White House adviser? The article says she was former head of the EPA. So before becoming White House climate adviser, she was EPA Administrator.

16. Question 16: What was the percentage decrease in emissions between 2005 and the executive order signing? The article states "since 2005, U.S. emissions have fallen roughly 20 percent". Assuming the executive order was signed in 2025 (since the article mentions 2024 emissions data), the answer is 20%.

17. Question 17: What international body administers Paris besides UN? The article says "the United Nations, which administers the pact". So the answer is N/A, since the question asks for another body besides UN, but the article only mentions UN.

18. Question 18: Other clean-energy tech besides EVs and wind that Trump's measures moved away from? The article says "clean-energy technologies like electric vehicles and power-generating wind turbines". The question asks for another type. The article doesn't mention another, so N/A.

19. Question 19: By what year would emissions fall 24-40% under rollback? The article says "by 2030" if Trump rolled back policies. So the answer is 2030.

20. Question 20: Which president set the 61% by 2035 target? The article says "announced last month under the auspices of the Paris Agreement" by Biden. So Biden.

21. Question 21: How many countries not in the Paris Agreement after withdrawal? The article says the US will be one of four: Iran, Libya, Yemen, and the US. So total is 4. The question says "one of only four countries", so the answer is 4.

22. Question 22: Highest percentage drop by 2030 under rollbacks? The Rhodium Group says 24-40%, so the highest is 40%.

23. Question 23: Which international organization received the withdrawal letter? The UN, as the article says "notifying the world body of the withdrawal" (UN administers the pact).

24. Question 24: By how many points does the projected fall short of Biden's 2030 target? The article says Biden's 2030 target was 50% (but corrected to 61% by 2035). Wait, the article's correction says "An earlier version... The goal was to cut emissions by 61% below 2005 levels by 2035, not by 2030." So the original target was 50% by 2030, but the corrected says 61 by 2035. The question is about the 2030 target. The article says under rollback, 24-40% by 2030. The original target (before correction) was 50% by 2030. The question asks how much the optimistic 40% falls short of the target (50). 50-40=10. But since the corrected target is 61 by 2035, but the question might refer to the original 2030 target. Since the article mentions the correction, the actual 2030 target is not specified. Wait, the article says "the goal was to cut greenhouse gases 61 percent below 2005 levels by 2035, not by 2030." So the Biden's target for 2030 isn't stated. The question might be based on the initial incorrect info, but the user instructions say to use the article's facts. Since the article clarifies that the 61% is by 2035, the 2030 target is not mentioned. Hence N/A. Alternatively, if the question refers to the 2035 target, but the rollback is for 2030. The question says "under reduced climate protections" the Rhodium's projection is 24-40 by 2030, but Biden's 2035 target is 61. The question says "considering the goals mentioned for greenhouse gas reductions and the projections provided for 2030 under policy rollbacks", so the target for 2030 is not specified. Thus N/A.

25. Question 25: Which act spurred solar/wind growth? The article mentions "the Inflation Reduction Act".

26. Question 26: Last year's emissions decline percentage? The article says "emissions dropped just a fraction last year, 0.2 percent".

27. Question 27: How many drastic shifts in participation between Trump and Biden? The article says Trump withdrew, then Biden rejoined, then Trump withdrew again. So two shifts (Biden rejoining and Trump leaving again). The article says "Mr. Trump withdrew from the Paris accord, but then President Biden quickly rejoined in 2020... the move [Trump's current withdrawal] is yet another about-face". So three changes? Wait, initial US participation under Obama, then Trump withdrew (1), Biden rejoined (2), Trump withdrew again (3). But the article's current context is Trump's second term? Assuming the article is in 2025, so two shifts between Trump and Biden: Trump's first withdrawal, then Biden's rejoining, then Trump's second withdrawal. So three total, but between the two administrations, it's two shifts (withdraw and rejoin, then withdraw again). The question asks "between the Trump and Biden administrations", so from Trump's first withdrawal to Biden's rejoining, then Trump's second withdrawal. So two shifts? The article says "one of several energy-related announcements... withdrawal from the pact signals his administration's determination..." implying this is the second withdrawal. So total shifts are three, but between the two administrations, it's two: Trump's withdrawal, then Biden's rejoining, then Trump's second. So the answer is 2 shifts between the two administrations? The question is "how many drastic shifts in participation status have occurred between the Trump and Biden administrations mentioned throughout the article?" The article mentions Trump withdrew, Biden rejoined, then Trump withdrew again. So that's three changes, but between the two administrations, it's two: when Trump left, Biden came back, then Trump left again. So two shifts between their administrations. The answer is 2.

28. Question 28: What billion-dollar figure is mentioned for COP planning? The article says "trillions of dollars in financial investments". So the figure is trillions, but the question asks for a single billion-dollar figure. Since it's trillions, the answer is N/A.

29. Question 29: Which major climate conference in Brazil? The article says "this year's COP will be held in Brazil in November".

30. Question 30: By what factor must annual decline increase compared to past decade? The article says "need to decline nearly 10 times as fast each year as they've fallen over the past decade". So the factor is 10 times.
