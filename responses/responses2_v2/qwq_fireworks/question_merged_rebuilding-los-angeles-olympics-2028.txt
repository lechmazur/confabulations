Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict format. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks for the percentage increase in budget LA28 proposed compared to Paris's successful outcome. The article mentions Paris had a surplus, but LA28's budget is $7 billion. However, there's no info on the percentage increase. So maybe N/A? Wait, the article says LA28's budget is roughly $7 billion, but the Paris surplus was $28 million. But the question is about LA28's proposed increase. Wait, actually, the article doesn't compare the budgets between Paris and LA28 in terms of percentage. The article only states LA28's budget as $7 billion. Since there's no percentage increase mentioned, the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The professor from Penn State suggested if LA can't host, they might go back to Paris. The article says Mark Dyreson suggested "They could go back to Paris." So the answer is Paris.

3. **Question 3**: Ackman made billions via a financial instrument. The article mentions he made billions with "profitable bets on hedging against the pandemic and inflation." The question asks which instrument he used, which he now leverages through Howard Hughes. The answer is hedging, but the question specifies the instrument. Alternatively, the article says he used a "closed-end fund" in London. The question mentions a real estate company (Howard Hughes) facing a stock decline (down 10% in a year). The instrument is hedging against pandemic and inflation. But the exact term? The answer might be "hedge funds" or "closed-end fund." Wait, the question says "what specific financial instrument did Ackman utilize to make billions..." The article says "profitable bets on hedging against the pandemic and inflation." So the instrument is hedging. But the answer needs to be specific. Alternatively, "closed-end fund" since he raised permanent capital via that. Hmm, the question also mentions "which he now intends to leverage through a real estate company..." The answer might be "closed-end fund" but the article says he used Pershing's permanent capital. Wait, the article says: "he has focused on raising what he calls 'permanent capital' via a closed-end fund..." So the instrument is the closed-end fund. The real estate company is Howard Hughes, which has a stock decline. So the answer is "closed-end fund."

4. **Question 4**: RBC's worst-case scenario for S&P 500. The article states that RBC's worst-case is corporate profit growth peaked, leading to S&P 500 ending around 6,200 (6% below base). But the question asks about interest rate cuts. The futures market now sees just one cut this year. The answer is 1? The question says "projected number of interest rate cuts anticipated by futures market..." The article says "the futures market this morning sees just one cut this year." So the answer is 1.

5. **Question 5**: Specific asset and commodity. The question mentions Scott Bessent's conflict of interest mitigation (he's selling assets). The article says Scott Bessent, Treasury pick, will sell assets. The question also mentions an asset "experiencing a surge in value alongside a commodity used in a sector facing increased demand from AI companies." The article says "power demand from AI companies is helping to drive up the cost of uranium." The commodity is uranium. The asset linked to Bessent selling? The article mentions "the dollar is soaring again, as is oil." Wait, the question says "what specific type of asset... is experiencing a surge in value alongside a commodity..." So the commodity is uranium, and the asset is the dollar (since dollar is soaring). So the answer is "dollar" and "uranium." But the question asks for the specific asset type (like currency, etc.). The answer should be "the dollar" and "uranium," but the question wants the asset type. Wait, the question says "what specific type of asset... is experiencing a surge in value alongside a commodity..." So the asset type is the dollar (currency), and the commodity is uranium. The question asks for the asset's name. The answer is "the dollar" and "uranium." But the question might want just the asset, so "dollar" and "uranium." But the question says "what specific type of asset... alongside a commodity..." So the answer is "dollar" and "uranium." The question's phrasing might expect two answers but the format requires one answer. Wait the question says "what specific type of asset... alongside a commodity..." So the asset is the dollar, and the commodity is uranium. Since the question asks for the asset, the answer is "the dollar."

6. **Question 6**: Company spinoff by a billionaire, now positioned as modern Berkshire Hathaway. The article says Ackman's bid for Howard Hughes, and he wrote "HHH would become a modern-day Berkshire Hathaway." The spinoff was Howard Hughes from General Growth Properties. The question asks the name of the company whose spinoff is now being positioned as a modern Berkshire. The answer is Howard Hughes Holdings. The question says "the company whose spinoff, orchestrated by a billionaire..." So the spinoff is Howard Hughes, which was orchestrated by Ackman? Wait, the article says Ackman orchestrated its creation via spinoff 15 years ago. Wait, the article says: "Ackman said he didn't plan to change the company's management or business plans. By many measures, the economy looks strong... Unusually, Ackman said he didn't plan to change the company's management or business plans. By many measures, the economy looks strong... (Wait, the exact line: "He orchestrated its creation via a spinoff from the bankrupt real estate giant General Growth Properties 15 years ago." So the company is Howard Hughes Holdings, orchestrated by Ackman? Wait, "he" refers to Ackman? The article says "Ackman said he didn't plan to change... By many measures, the economy looks strong..." Wait, the paragraph says: "Unusually, Ackman said he didn't plan to change the company's management or business plans. By many measures, the economy looks strong..." Wait, the previous sentence: "He orchestrated its creation via a spinoff from the bankrupt real estate giant General Growth Properties 15 years ago." "He" here refers to Ackman. So the company's spinoff is Howard Hughes Holdings, orchestrated by Ackman. So the answer is Howard Hughes Holdings.

7. **Question 7**: S&P 500's decline from post-Election high and the real estate company's stock performance. The S&P is down over 4% from its post-Election high. The real estate company (Howard Hughes) has a stock down 10% in the past 12 months. The question asks for the percentage decline of S&P (which is over 4%) mirroring the real estate's stock (10%). But the question says "mirroring the approximate annual stock performance." The answer is 4% for S&P, but the real estate's is 10%. The question asks "what specific percentage decline from its post-Election Day high has the S&P 500 experienced, mirroring the approximate annual stock performance of a real estate company..." So the answer is "over 4 percent" (from the article: "The S&P 500 is down more than 4 percent from its post-Election Day high"). The real estate's is 10%, but the question wants the S&P's, so 4% (but the exact wording is "more than 4 percent", but the question says "specific percentage decline"—maybe just 4%? But the article says "more than 4 percent"—so the answer is "more than 4 percent" but the question might want the exact number. Since the article uses "more than 4 percent", the answer is "more than 4 percent", but the question says "what percentage decline"—maybe 4% is the closest, but it's stated as "more than". Hmm, maybe the answer is "over 4 percent".

8. **Question 8**: The departing chair of the regulatory body (FCC?) that aligned with Musk despite prior clashes. The article mentions the FTC's departing chair Lina Khan, and Hoffman (a Democratic donor) pushed for her ouster. The question asks the name of the departing chair. The answer is Lina Khan. The regulatory body is FTC. So the name is Lina Khan.

9. **Question 9**: Japanese company whose acquisition is facing scrutiny, deal expiration on June 18. The article says "President Biden delays enforcing an order blocking Nippon Steel's deal for U.S. Steel. The move sets June 18 as the expiration date..." So the Japanese company is Nippon Steel.

10. **Question 10**: How did Newsom tackle reconstruction delays and price gouging? The article says he signed an executive order to speed up reconstruction and safeguard against price gouging. The answer is "executive order to speed up reconstruction and safeguard against price gouging" but the question says "hinting at a plan reminiscent of post-war recovery" (Marshall Plan). The answer is "executive order" but the question's phrasing might need "Marshall Plan" as part of it. Wait the article says Newsom's executive order is part of a "Marshall Plan" to rebuild. The question asks how he tackled both issues, so the answer is "executive order" or "Marshall Plan". The exact answer is the executive order to speed up reconstruction and price gouging, but the question mentions Marshall Plan as the plan he invoked, so the answer is "Marshall Plan".

11. **Question 11**: Transformation strategy modeled after Berkshire Hathaway. The article says Ackman wants HHH to be "a modern-day Berkshire Hathaway". So the strategy is "Berkshire Hathaway model".

12. **Question 12**: Financial risk for taxpayers in Olympics debate. The article states "Taxpayers would be on the hook for any cost overruns." So the answer is "taxpayers on the hook for cost overruns".

13. **Question 13**: Vulnerable Olympic venue near wildfires. The article mentions University of California campus (Olympic Village) and Riviera Country Club (golf) near Pacific Palisades fire. So the venues are the University of California campus and Riviera Country Club. The question asks for one, so either. The answer is "University of California campus" or "Riviera Country Club". The question says "planned Olympic venue", both are mentioned. The first one mentioned is UC campus. So answer is "University of California campus".

14. **Question 14**: Argument by Charlie Kirk against LA Olympics despite 1984 success. The article says Charlie Kirk called to bow out because the Games have a history of being an economic drag. The historical evidence is 1984 Olympics being a model. So the argument is "economic drag on the host city".

15. **Question 15**: Company with delayed rocket launch due to subsystem issue. The article mentions Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket had a "vehicle subsystem issue". The competitor is SpaceX. So the company is Blue Origin.

16. **Question 16**: Legal dispute relationship defended by DOJ/FTC. The issue is interlocking board roles between OpenAI and Microsoft via Reid Hoffman and Dee Templeton. The argument is about the illegality of shared directors. The answer is "interlocking board roles".

17. **Question 17**: Market indicator mentioned with S&P drop and oil rise. The article says "the dollar is soaring again, as is oil." The market indicator is the dollar's surge. The question asks for the indicator that might influence policy. The answer is "dollar" (soaring) or "10-year Treasury yield" (since the article mentions "the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds... influencing rates"). Wait the question says "market indicator mentioned alongside a drop in the S&P 500 and rising oil prices"—the S&P is down, dollar and oil up. The indicators are dollar and oil, but the question wants the one that's a signal for future policy. The article mentions the dollar and oil rising, but the key indicator for Fed might be the 10-year yield. Wait the article says: "market watchers are nervously watching the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds..." So the answer is "10-year Treasury yield".

18. **Question 18**: Percentage stake targeted in bid for Howard Hughes. The article says Pershing Square would bid up to 69.2% of Howard Hughes. So the answer is 69.2%.

19. **Question 19**: Recovery blueprint mentioned by Newsom. The article says Newsom mentioned a "Marshall Plan" to rebuild. So the answer is "Marshall Plan".
