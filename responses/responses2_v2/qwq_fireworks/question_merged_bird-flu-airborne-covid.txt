Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks: What percentage of ferrets in Dr. Coleman's hotel experiment developed infections after being sprayed with airborne droplets carrying the Texas virus? Hmm, the article mentions Dr. Coleman's experiment in a hotel in Baltimore where they had sick and healthy volunteers. But in the section discussing the Texas virus, it says when Dr. Herfst and his colleagues sprayed ferrets with the Texas virus, 30% developed infections. Wait, but the question specifies Dr. Coleman's experiment. The hotel experiment by Coleman didn't result in infections because none of the healthy volunteers got sick. The Texas virus part was mentioned in a different context with Dr. Herfst's experiment. Since the question is about Dr. Coleman's experiment, the answer might be N/A because the text says none of the uninfected volunteers got sick. But wait, the Texas virus experiment is with Dr. Herfst, not Coleman. So the answer here should be N/A because the question is about Dr. Coleman's experiment, which didn't have the Texas virus part. Got it.

2. The second question: How many mutations did Dr. Morawska and her colleague Junji Cao discover were needed for H5N1 to become airborne in ferrets, leading to the 2012 debate? Wait, looking back, the article mentions that Dr. Herfst and his colleagues discovered that a few mutations allowed H5N1 to become airborne. The 2012 debate was about their research. The question mentions Dr. Morawska and Junji Cao, but they were the ones who wrote the commentary about airborne Covid in 2020. The mutations were found by Herfst's team, not Morawska. So the question is incorrect in attributing the mutations to Morawska and Cao. Therefore, since the article doesn't say Morawska and Cao discovered the mutations, the answer is N/A.

3. Third question: In what year did the WHO acknowledge that H1N1 (1918 strain) spread through the air? The article mentions the 1918 H1N1 pandemic but doesn't state when WHO acknowledged its airborne transmission. The only WHO mention is about Covid in 2022. So this is N/A.

4. Fourth question: The name of the horn-shaped air sampler used in 2018. The article says "horn-shaped air sampler" but doesn't give a specific name. So the answer is N/A because no name is provided.

5. Fifth question: Besides cats, what other domestic animal was infected with H5N1 through contaminated raw products? The article mentions cows were infected, possibly passing to humans via milking machinery. Later it says even cats are getting infected, possibly from raw milk or pet food. So the other animal is cows. So answer: cows.

6. Sixth question: What preventative measure from 1918 was rejected by journals in 2020? The 1918 measures included masks and opening windows. The article says in early 2020, Morawska's warning was rejected. The question asks what was initially rejected by journals in 2020. The commentary by Morawska and Cao was about airborne spread, so the answer is acknowledging airborne transmission. But the question says "preventative measure implemented in some American cities during the 1918 pandemic." The 1918 measures included masks and opening windows. The journals rejected the idea of airborne transmission (so the preventative measures like masks might have been part of that). But the question is phrased as the measure that was rejected by journals in 2020. The commentary's warning was about airborne spread, so the preventative measure they were advocating might be similar to the 1918 ones. But the question is a bit tricky. The answer should be the measures like masks and opening windows, but the exact wording? The article says "ignoring the airborne spread... would lead to more infections." The journals rejected their commentary on airborne spread, so the preventative measure they were advocating was probably measures for airborne transmission like masks. But the question says "what was implemented in 1918 that was rejected in 2020." Wait, no. The question is asking what was the preventative measure from 1918 that was "initially rejected by medical journals in early 2020". The journals in 2020 rejected the idea that the new coronavirus (Covid) was airborne, which would require measures like masks and ventilation. The 1918 measures included masks and opening windows. So the answer is the measures like masks and opening windows, but the question asks for the specific one. The article says "some American cities treated it as an airborne disease, requiring masks in public and opening windows in schools." The rejected commentary was about airborne spread of Covid, so the preventative measure would be those 1918 measures (masks and ventilation). The question asks for the name of the measure, but the article doesn't name it as a specific term. The exact wording in the question is "preventative measure implemented in some American cities during the 1918 pandemic" that was rejected by journals in 2020. Since the journals rejected the idea of airborne spread (so the measures for that), the answer would be masks in public and opening windows. But the question wants the name of the measure. Since the article doesn't give a specific name, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "what was the name of the preventative measure". Since the article doesn't name a specific term for the measure beyond "masks in public and opening windows", perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "masks and opening windows", but the question might expect "masks" as the answer. Wait, the exact wording in the article: "requiring masks in public and opening windows in schools." Since the question is asking for the name of the measure, perhaps it's "masks" or "opening windows", but the question says "what was the name of the preventative measure", implying a single term. Since the article doesn't specify a name, maybe N/A. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "airborne transmission prevention measures" but that's inferred. Since the question is tricky, perhaps N/A is safer.

7. Seventh question: The title of the rejected commentary by the University of Maryland expert (Kristen K. Coleman)? The article says Dr. Morawska and Junji Cao wrote the commentary that was rejected. The question refers to Kristen Coleman, but she's a different person. The article states: "Kristen K. Coleman, an infectious-disease expert at the University of Maryland." The commentary was written by Morawska and Cao, not Coleman. So the answer is N/A because the question is about a commentary co-authored by Coleman, but she wasn't part of that.

8. Eighth question: What organization locked down 50 million in early 2020 to hinder H5N1? Wait, the article says in early February 2020, China locked down over 50 million people hoping to hinder the spread of a new coronavirus (Covid), not H5N1. The question mentions H5N1, which is incorrect. Since the lockdown was for Covid, not H5N1, the answer is N/A because the question has an incorrect premise (H5N1 instead of Covid).

9. Ninth question: Distance in cm between ferret cages in Emory University's experiment? The article mentions Dr. Herfst at Erasmus University in Netherlands did an experiment with cages 4 inches apart. The question says Emory University's experiment. The Emory virologist mentioned is Seema Lakdawala, but the experiment with cages was by Herfst. Since the question is about Emory, which isn't mentioned in that context, the answer is N/A.

10. Tenth question: Location where Dr. Herfst and colleagues did the experiment with volunteers playing games? The article says Dr. Coleman did the hotel experiment in Baltimore. The question mentions Herfst and colleagues. The Herfst experiments were in the Netherlands with ferrets. The Baltimore hotel was part of Coleman's study. So the answer here would be N/A because the question is about Herfst, but the location was Baltimore for Coleman's study. So since the question mixes up the researchers, answer is N/A.

11. Eleventh question: Number of mutations Junji Cao identified in Texas H5N1 that correlate with replication speed? The article mentions a mutation in the Texas virus that may speed up replication, but it doesn't specify how many mutations Junji Cao identified. The question says "mutations" plural but the text refers to "a mutation". So answer is 1? But the question says Junji Cao identified them. Wait, the mutation in Texas virus was mentioned in the context of Dr. Herfst's experiment, not Junji Cao. The article says "a mutation that may speed up its replication in airways, for example. When Dr. Herfst and his colleagues sprayed..." So Junji Cao isn't linked to that. So the answer is N/A.

12. Twelfth question: Two animal species besides cows and ferrets with confirmed H5N1 infections linked to airborne risks? The article mentions cows and ferrets. The other animals mentioned are cats (infected possibly from raw milk or pet food) and humans. The question asks for two besides cows and ferrets. The answer would be cats and humans? But the article says "even cats are getting infected" and mentions humans. But the question specifies "confirmed H5N1 infections linked to airborne transmission risks". The article states cows can pass to humans, and cats via raw products. The airborne transmission is a risk if the virus becomes airborne, but the confirmed infections in cats and possibly humans via other routes. The question wants two species besides cows and ferrets. So cats and maybe another? The article says "the bird flu is infecting more and more animals across the United States. Even cats are getting infected..." So cats are one, and humans are another, but humans are not domestic animals. The question might be looking for cats and cows? But cows are already mentioned. Wait, the question says besides cows and ferrets, so the two would be cats and maybe another? The article mentions "cows" and "cats" as domestic animals infected. So the answer is cats and... perhaps another? Wait, the article says "cows that were also infected with H5N1, and that the animals could pass the virus to people" and "even cats are getting infected". So the two besides cows and ferrets are cats and possibly humans? But humans aren't animals in the context here. The article also mentions "wild birds in China" but those are wild, not domestic. So the answer is cats and... maybe not. The question says "animal species", so cats are one. The other might be... maybe the dairy worker is human, but not an animal. The article doesn't mention another domestic animal besides cows and cats. So the answer is cats and... N/A? Wait, the question says "two animal species" besides cows and ferrets. The only other one is cats. So maybe N/A? Or is there another? The article says "other farmed birds" but those are chickens, which are birds, but the question is about domestic animals. Hmm. The article mentions "cows", "ferrets (in experiments)", "cats", and "birds". So the two besides cows and ferrets would be cats and birds (but birds are wild/farmed, not domestic in the context). Maybe the answer is cats and cows? But cows are already excluded. Wait the question says "besides cows and ferrets", so the two are cats and maybe another domestic animal? The article says "cows" and "cats", so the two are cats and... maybe not. Since the question asks for two, but only one is mentioned (cats), the answer is N/A? Or maybe the answer is cats and humans? But humans aren't animals in this context. Hmm, tricky. The article states "even cats are getting infected, possibly by drinking raw milk or eating raw pet food." So cats are one. The other might be cows, but the question excludes cows. So perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, maybe "cows" are included in the 66 cases in the US, but the question is besides cows and ferrets, so only cats. Since the question requires two, and only one is given, answer is N/A.

13. Thirteenth question: Number of countries that acknowledged airborne Covid before WHO's 2022 declaration, per Morawska's research? The article says "It took more than two years for the WHO to officially acknowledge that Covid spread through the air." But it doesn't mention how many countries did so beforehand. So N/A.

14. Fourteenth question: Numerical threshold of H5N1 mutations required for airborne transmission as per Emory's Lakdawala? The article says "It would be impossible to predict when -- or even if -- the bird flu viruses will gain the additional mutations necessary..." and "the odds of airborne evolution are growing." But there's no specific number given. So N/A.
