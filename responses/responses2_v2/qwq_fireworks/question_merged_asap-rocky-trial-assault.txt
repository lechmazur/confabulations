Okay, I need to tackle these questions based solely on the provided article. Let me go through each one step by step.

1. **Question 1**: The legal strategy similar to 2019 Stockholm trial. The article mentions that in Stockholm, Rocky claimed self-defense. In the current case, his lawyer argued the gun was a prop. Wait, the self-defense was used in Stockholm, but here the defense is about the prop gun. Hmm, maybe the question is referring to the self-defense claim again? Wait, no, the current defense is the prop gun. Wait, the 2019 case used self-defense, but the current case uses a prop gun. The question says "similar to the one in Stockholm". Since the Stockholm case used self-defense, but the current uses prop gun, maybe there's a similarity? The article says Tacopina's defense here is the prop gun. The Stockholm case's strategy was self-defense. So maybe the answer is "self-defense"? Wait, but the question is about the current case's strategy similar to Stockholm. Wait, the question says "similar to the one employed during his 2019 Stockholm trial, did Tacopina use..." So in Stockholm, they claimed self-defense. In the current case, the defense is the gun was a prop. So maybe the answer is "self-defense" again? Wait no, the current defense is different. Wait the article says Tacopina argued the weapon was a prop gun. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait the question is asking for a similar strategy. The only similarity is that both involve defense arguments, but the specific strategy here is different. Wait the question might be a trick. Wait the article says in Stockholm he was found guilty but released because the assault wasn't serious. But the defense there was self-defense, so Tacopina's current strategy is different. So the answer would be N/A? Or maybe the question is referring to the prop gun as similar? Maybe not. Wait the user might think that the defense in both is claiming that the weapon wasn't a real threat? Like in Stockholm, they said self-defense, here prop gun. Maybe the answer is "self-defense" but that's not the current strategy. Hmm. Let me check again. The article says "his lawyer, Joe Tacopina, has argued that the weapon used was a 'prop gun' incapable of firing real ammunition." So the strategy here is that the gun wasn't real. The 2019 case's defense was self-defense. So they are different strategies. So the answer would be N/A. But maybe I'm missing something. Wait the question says "similar to the one employed during his 2019 Stockholm trial". The 2019 defense was self-defense, so if the current case's defense is also self-defense, then yes, but the article says the current defense is prop gun. So no, so answer N/A.

Wait, but maybe the question is referring to the self-defense again? The user might have a mistake here. But according to the article, the current defense is prop gun. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Legal document to clarify marital status. The judge asked about their marital status, and the lawyer called her "common-law wife". To clarify, maybe a marriage certificate or a legal affidavit? Since they aren't married, perhaps a common-law marriage affidavit? But the article says "common-law wife" but the prosecution objected. Maybe Tacopina needed to provide proof of common-law marriage, so a legal document like an affidavit or declaration of common-law marriage. The answer would be "common-law marriage affidavit" or similar. The article mentions the lawyer said she was his "common-law wife" or "just wife", so maybe the document needed is a marriage certificate, but since they aren't officially married, perhaps a legal document to establish common-law status. The answer is "common-law marriage affidavit" or "affidavit of marital status". The article doesn't specify the exact document, so maybe N/A? Wait the question asks what type of legal document was needed to clarify their relationship. Since they are in a common-law marriage, perhaps a common-law marriage affidavit. But the article doesn't mention this, so maybe N/A? Wait the judge asked for clarification, so Tacopina might need to present evidence of their relationship. Maybe a sworn statement or affidavit. The answer is "affidavit" but the exact term? The article says Tacopina called her "common-law wife" but the prosecution objected. To clarify, perhaps a legal document proving common-law marriage. Since the question is about the type, the answer might be "common-law marriage affidavit". Since the article doesn't explicitly name the document, but the term "common-law" is used, maybe the answer is "common-law marriage affidavit".

3. **Question 3**: Bond amount mirroring the rejected plea's suspended sentence. The rejected plea was 6 months jail with 7 years suspended and 3 years probation. The question asks the bond amount he had to post, mirroring the suspended sentence. Wait, bond is usually a monetary amount, not tied to the sentence terms. The article says he was released on bond after arrest but doesn't mention the amount. So the answer is N/A because the article doesn't state the bond amount.

4. **Question 4**: Number of discharges according to prosecution. The prosecution claims Rocky fired at Relli, grazing his knuckles. The surveillance video shows him holding a gun before the shooting. The article says "later fired at Relli, grazing his knuckles". So once. The answer is 1.

5. **Question 5**: Other celebrity present during Relli's testimony besides Rihanna. The article mentions that during Relli's testimony, Rihanna was present. It also mentions Denzel Washington in the context of a movie role, but that's future. The only other mention is Kendrick Lamar winning the Grammy, but he wasn't in the courtroom. The article says "Kendrick Lamar hosted a Juneteenth concert..." but not present in court. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Grammy-nominated video by Rocky, lost to Lamar. The article says Rocky was nominated for best music video, which was won by Kendrick Lamar. The question asks the title of the award-winning video (Lamar's?), but the question is about Rocky's nominated video. Wait, the question is phrased as "the title of the award-winning music video for which ASAP Rocky received a Grammy nomination". Wait, the Grammy was won by Lamar, so Rocky's nomination was for his own video. The article doesn't name the title of Rocky's video. So answer N/A.

7. **Question 7**: European city for March festival, mirroring Stockholm. The article mentions he was scheduled to be a headliner at Rolling Loud in Los Angeles in March, but the question asks a European city. Wait, the article says the trial was postponed to allow him to host Rolling Loud in Thailand. So Thailand is the location for the festival he hosted. But the question asks for a European city "mirroring the location of his 2019 legal troubles" (Stockholm). So the answer is Stockholm? But the March festival is in LA. Wait, the question says "mirroring the location of his 2019 legal troubles", so the 2019 was in Stockholm. The article says he hosted Rolling Loud in Thailand, but the March festival is in LA. The question might be a trick. Wait, the question says "scheduled to perform at a major music festival in March?" The article says "he is scheduled to be one of the headliners of the Los Angeles stop of the Rolling Loud festival in March". So LA is in the US. The other event was in Thailand. So the European city would be N/A, since the article doesn't mention another European city except Stockholm for 2019. The question might be a trick, but the answer is N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Fashion house that designed Rihanna's suit. The article says Rihanna wore a dark-colored suit jacket, but doesn't mention the fashion house. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Specific injury beyond grazing, per civil lawsuit. The article says Relli's injury was described as superficial (knuckles). The lawsuit is for damages, but the article doesn't mention another injury. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Artist with Grammy nom, involved in felony trial. The article mentions Rocky received a Grammy nomination. The answer is ASAP Rocky.

11. **Question 11**: Defendant in assault case, member of NY rap collective. The article says Rocky is part of ASAP Mob, the NY-based group. So ASAP Rocky.

12. **Question 12**: Individual referenced as defendant. The defendant is ASAP Rocky.

13. **Question 13**: Rapper at center of trial with fashion campaigns. The article mentions Rocky's fashion campaigns. So ASAP Rocky.

14. **Question 14**: Artist linked to W Hotel incident and Spike Lee film. The article mentions Rocky's case and his role in the Spike Lee movie. So ASAP Rocky.

15. **Question 15**: Musician facing 24 years. The article says if convicted, he could face up to 24 years. That's Rocky.

16. **Question 16**: Central figure with Rihanna's role. The defendant is Rocky.

17. **Question 17**: Performer balancing legal scrutiny and career. Rocky.

18. **Question 18**: Artist controversially portrayed. Rocky.

19. **Question 19**: Individual in legal and entertainment events. Rocky.

Now, let me go through each again with the answers:

1. The defense strategy in Stockholm was self-defense. Current case is prop gun. No similarity, so N/A.

2. The document to clarify marital status as common-law might be an affidavit, but article doesn't specify. N/A? Wait, the question says "what type of legal document did Tacopina likely need to prepare to clarify their relationship for the court?" Since the judge asked about their marital status and the lawyer called her common-law wife, maybe a sworn statement or affidavit to establish common-law marriage. The answer is "affidavit of common-law marriage" but the exact term might be "common-law marriage affidavit". Since the article mentions "common-law wife" but the exact document isn't named, maybe N/A? Wait, the question is about the type, not the name. So "common-law marriage affidavit" is the type, so answer that.

3. Bond amount isn't mentioned. N/A.

4. Prosecution says he fired once (grazed knuckles). Answer: 1.

5. No other celebrity mentioned in court besides Rihanna. N/A.

6. Title of Rocky's Grammy-nominated video not given. N/A.

7. European city mirroring Stockholm? The festival in March is in LA, so N/A.

8. Fashion house not mentioned. N/A.

9. Injury beyond knuckles? Article says "superficial" but no other injury. N/A.

10. ASAP Rocky.

11. ASAP Rocky.

12. ASAP Rocky.

13. ASAP Rocky.

14. ASAP Rocky.

15. ASAP Rocky.

16. ASAP Rocky.

17. ASAP Rocky.

18. ASAP Rocky.

19. ASAP Rocky.
