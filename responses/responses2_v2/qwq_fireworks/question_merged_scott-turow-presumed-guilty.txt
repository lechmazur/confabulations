Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly as per the instructions. Let's go step by step.

1. **First question:** "In which year did Turow's first wife Adriane begin volunteering at the Humane Society shelter after their divorce?" The article mentions that Adriane is now retired from her corporate job and volunteering at the local Humane Society shelter, but it doesn't specify the year she started. The divorce happened in 2008, and they remarried eight years later (2016). The article doesn't give a specific year for her volunteering, so maybe N/A?

Wait, the article says: "Adriane, now retired from her corporate job, was volunteering at the local Humane Society shelter". But "was" might indicate it's current, but no year is given. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Second question:** "How many members were in the Rock Bottom Remainders band when they performed 'Wild Thing' at Turow's wedding ceremony?" The article mentions the band includes Turow and Dave Barry, but it says "the writers' rock group the Rock Bottom Remainders" and that Turow is part of it. However, the exact number of members isn't stated. Since it's a band, maybe it's a group with multiple members, but the question asks for the number. Since the text doesn't specify, answer N/A.

3. **Third question:** "What was the name of the judge Turow successfully prosecuted in Cook County while working at the Chicago law firm?" The article states he prosecuted a Cook County judge charged with mail fraud and extortion. But no name is given for the judge. So N/A.

4. **Fourth question:** "Which character from Turow's earlier novels introduces Rusty Sabich to his future fiancée in the rural Midwestern community?" The article says in "Presumed Guilty", Rusty is defending the son of his fiancée in a rural Midwestern community. But there's no mention of which character introduced him to her. So N/A.

5. **Fifth question:** "What was the title of Turow's unpublished novel about housing law that inspired him to attend Harvard Law School?" The article mentions an unpublished novel about a tenants' rent strike, which led him to housing law. The title isn't provided, so N/A.

6. **Sixth question:** "How many copies did 'One L' sell in its first year of publication while Turow was still a law student?" The article says "One L" was an instant classic but doesn't mention sales numbers. So N/A.

7. **Seventh question:** "What role did Turow's father play in helping him secure his position at the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago?" The article says Turow's father was verbally abusive, but there's no mention of his role in securing the job. So N/A.

8. **Eighth question:** "Which Canadian winter residents first introduced Turow to the Naples, Florida community where he now lives part-time?" The article mentions that in Naples, many of their friends are Canadians fleeing south for winter, but there's no mention of who introduced him. So N/A.

9. **Ninth question:** "What was the name of the murder victim in the case where Turow had the memorable conversation with the defendant's mother?" The article refers to the mother's conversation where her son was guilty, but the victim's name isn't given. The case that inspired "Presumed Guilty" involved a college dropout accused of murdering his girlfriend named Gabby, but that's from the Petito case. Wait, the question is about the case Turow had in real life. The article says "the mother of a young man charged with murder" but doesn't name the victim. So N/A.

10. **Tenth question:** "How many hours per week did Turow dedicate to writing while working part-time at the Chicago law firm?" The article mentions he switched to part-time to have more time to write, but no specific hours. N/A.

11. **Eleventh question:** "How many years did it take Turow to complete 'The Burden of Proof,' the book that followed his commute-written novel?" The article says "Presumed Innocent" took 8 years (written during commute), then "The Burden of Proof" was next. But the time taken for "The Burden of Proof" isn't mentioned. So N/A.

12. **Twelfth question:** "What legal position did Rusty Sabich hold immediately before defending his fiancée's son in Kindle County?" The article states Rusty is a former prosecutor and former judge. In "Presumed Guilty," he's retired but takes on the case. The last position before that was judge, so answer: judge.

13. **Thirteenth question:** "What instrument does the verbally abused Belarusian immigrant play in the Rock Bottom Remainders?" The Belarusian immigrant is Turow's father, but the article doesn't mention him playing an instrument. The band includes Turow and Dave Barry, but no info on the father's role. N/A.

14. **Fourteenth question:** "Besides mail fraud and extortion, what other crime did Turow successfully prosecute the Cook County judge for, leading Julian Solotorovsky to admire his panoptic attention?" The article says "charged with mail fraud and extortion, among other cases" but doesn't list another specific crime. The "among other cases" might refer to other cases, not the same judge. So N/A.

15. **Fifteenth question:** "In what city did Dave Barry officiate Turow's wedding, incorporating lyrics from 'Presumed Innocent'?" The article says Dave Barry officiated, but the location isn't specified. The wedding might be in Naples or elsewhere. The article mentions Turow's part-time home in Naples, but the wedding's location isn't stated. So N/A.

16. **Sixteenth question:** "What was the name of the girlfriend murdered by the college dropout in 'Presumed Guilty,' a plot point inspired by a shattering experience for a parent?" The article mentions the murder was inspired by Gabby Petito's case, so the name is Gabby. The victim in the novel is named similarly? Wait, the article says "inspired by the 2021 murder of Gabby Petito, killed by a boyfriend whose parents closed ranks to protect him." So the novel's victim's name isn't explicitly given, but the real case's victim was Gabby. The question asks the name in the book. The article says "troubled college dropout accused of murdering his girlfriend on a camping trip." The name isn't provided. The question might be a trick here, but the article doesn't state the name in the book. So N/A.

Wait, but the article says "the 2021 murder of Gabby Petito" inspired the plot, so maybe the character's name is Gabby? The article says "the son of his fiancée in a twisty murder trial -- this time in the rural Midwestern community to which he's retired." The girlfriend's name isn't given, so answer N/A.

17. **Seventeenth question:** "What legal concept, central to 'One L,' did Turow find unexpectedly exciting while working on his unpublished novel about a doctor's explosive anger?" The article says working on the unpublished novel about a tenants' rent strike led him to housing law, which felt curative. "One L" is about law school. The legal concept in "One L" is the experience of first-year law students, but the question links it to the unpublished novel's theme. Wait, the article says his understanding of law came from the novel on housing law. The question is about the concept in "One L" that he found exciting while working on the unpublished novel. Maybe "housing law"? But "One L" is about law school. The article says "he found himself excited by housing law" while working on the novel. The legal concept from "One L" might be the Socratic method or legal education, but the question is about what he found exciting from the novel. The article doesn't link "One L" to the housing law concept. So maybe N/A.

Wait, the article says: "Working on a (never published) novel about a tenants' rent strike, he unexpectedly found himself excited by housing law—and by law itself, which felt like a curative to the emotional chaos of his childhood. He enrolled in Harvard Law School and distinguished himself while still a student by publishing the nonfiction book 'One L,' an instant classic..." So the legal concept he found exciting was housing law. But the question asks what concept in "One L" that he found exciting while working on the novel (the unpublished one). The answer might be housing law, but "One L" is about law school, not housing law. So perhaps the answer is N/A.

18. **Eighteenth question:** "What is the title of the 1990 film adaptation of Turow's novel featuring Rusty Sabich, played by an actor later replaced by Jake Gyllenhaal?" The article mentions the 1990 movie and 2024 mini-series with Harrison Ford and Jake Gyllenhaal. The 1990 film's title is "Presumed Innocent," which is the first novel's title. So answer: Presumed Innocent.

19. **Nineteenth question:** "What breed of dog, other than the English cream golden retriever, does Turow own, reflecting his preference for non-human names?" The article mentions two dogs: Doug and Brian (English cream golden retriever and another one). The other dog's breed isn't specified. The names are human names, but the question asks the breed. The article says "the family's second retriever was out..." implying both are retrievers. So maybe N/A.

Wait, the article states: "a large English cream golden retriever lying companionably in the living room. [...] the family's second retriever was out getting some exercise." So the second is also a retriever. So the breed is the same. The question asks for another breed, so N/A.

20. **Twentieth question:** "What is the central theme of the new book Turow is working on, featuring a lawyer startled by an obituary related to a case from the time Turow was commuting and writing 'Presumed Innocent'?" The article says the new book is about a lawyer startled to read an obituary for a man believed his client had murdered 50 years earlier. The central theme would be confronting past mistakes or unresolved cases. The question asks for the central theme. The article states the premise, but the theme isn't explicitly named. The question might expect the premise as the answer. Since the theme isn't stated, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, the central theme is about unresolved past cases or confronting the past. But the article doesn't name it, so N/A.

Wait, the article says: "he's working on a new book that begins when an old lawyer is startled to read an obituary for a man he believed his client had murdered 50 years earlier." The central theme would revolve around that scenario. The question asks for the central theme. Since it's not explicitly stated beyond the premise, the answer might be N/A.

Wait, the question says "central theme," but the article doesn't state the theme, just the plot. So N/A.
