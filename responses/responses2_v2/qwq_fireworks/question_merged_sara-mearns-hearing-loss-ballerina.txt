Okay, let me start by going through each question one by one, making sure I only use the information from the provided article. 

1. The first question asks about the brand of pointe shoes Mearns switched to manage sound sensitivity. The article mentions she could hear the pointe shoes like cymbals, but there's no mention of changing brands. So answer N/A.

2. The second question is about the orchestra's adjustment. The article says she mentioned not having to ask the pianist to play louder or monitors turned up. But it doesn't say the orchestra made any specific adjustment. Maybe the monitors were adjusted, but the question is about the orchestra's action. So N/A.

3. The third question asks about another technological aid by Marquerite Mehler. The text says Mehler knew about her hearing loss, but no specific tech aid is mentioned besides hearing aids. So N/A.

4. Fourth question: After Brazil, did she consult another specialist besides an audiologist for psychological impact? The article mentions she dealt with mental health struggles but doesn't name a specific specialist. So N/A.

5. The fifth question is about an off-Broadway show where she first tested the aids. The article only mentions her testing them in "The Nutcracker" so N/A.

6. Sixth question: The Brazil event's year. The article says it happened 10 years before her announcement. Since the article is from 2023 (her return was Dec 2023?), 2023 minus 10 would be 2013. But the article doesn't state the exact year, just that it was 10 years prior. Since the exact year isn't given, N/A.

7. Seventh question: Type of therapy for mental health. The article mentions she was open about mental health struggles but doesn't specify the therapy type. N/A.

8. Eighth question: Charity event where she first performed. The article mentions her Instagram stories about performances but doesn't name a charity event. N/A.

9. Ninth question: Car make she drove when she heard birds. The article doesn't mention her driving, just walking to her dressing room. N/A.

10. Tenth question: Restaurant with Tyler Angle. No mention of a celebratory restaurant. N/A.

11. Eleventh question: Balanchine ballet for Maria Tallchief. The article mentions Maria Tallchief being celebrated but doesn't link it to Mearns' reference. N/A.

12. Twelfth question: Number of drummers in Brazil. The article says around 100 drummers. Wait, yes! It says "around 100 drummers played for an hour." So the answer is 100.

13. Thirteenth question: Alvin Ailey production. The article mentions "Grace" by Ronald K. Brown celebrating 25th anniversary but doesn't say she collaborated on it. N/A.

14. Fourteenth question: Tyler Angle's breathing techniques in "Swan Lake" for her hearing loss. The article mentions "Goldberg Variations" with hand squeezes, not "Swan Lake". So N/A.

15. Fifteenth question: Lighting designer who confirmed her hearing issues. The article mentions Marquerite Mehler as director of production, but not lighting. N/A.

16. Sixteenth question: Specialist diagnosed vestibular nerve damage. The article says she had nerve hearing loss but doesn't mention a vestibular specialist. N/A.

17. Seventeenth question: Robbins ballet with piano and foot stomps in 2018. The article mentions "Goldberg Variations" by Robbins with hand cues. Wait, the question says "foot-stomping cues instead of musical timing". The article says Angle would squeeze her hand to know when to start. So maybe "Goldberg Variations"? But the article doesn't specify 2018. The question says "in 2018" but the article's context is current events. Since the article doesn't mention 2018 specifically for that ballet, N/A.

18. Eighteenth question: Decibel level in Brazil. The article doesn't provide exact decibel numbers. N/A.

19. Nineteenth question: Fashion designer for discreet accessories. The article mentions she became a symbol of diverse France and a fashion darling, but no specific designer for hearing aid accessories. N/A.

20. Twentieth question: Number of "Goldberg Variations" cancellations in 2020. The article says she returned in 2023 and mentions pandemic issues but no specific number of cancellations. N/A.

Wait, let me check again for question 12. The article says "around 100 drummers played for an hour." So the answer is 100. The rest are N/A. I need to ensure all questions are addressed with correct tags.
