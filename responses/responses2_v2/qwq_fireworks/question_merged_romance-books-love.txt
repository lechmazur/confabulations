Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks for a novel that combines a cross-dressing spy plot with a gender-swapped Pygmalion dynamic and is linked to an author who also wrote about psychic photographers in the 19th century. Looking through the article, the mention of psychic photographers battling supernatural foes points to Amanda Quick's series starting with "Venetia." The gender-swapped Pygmalion dynamic is described in Judith Ivory's "My Fair Lady" take, where Lady Edwina and Mick Tremore are the characters. Wait, but the question also mentions a cross-dressing spy plot. Wait, the cross-dressing part is in the entry about Kit Brantley and the Earl of Everton. That entry mentions Lisa Kleypas, Julie Anne Long, or Erica Ridley as similar authors. Wait, no—the gender-swapped My Fair Lady is Judith Ivory's book. The cross-dressing part is a separate entry. The question combines both elements. Wait, maybe I need to check again. Let me re-read the entries.

Looking at the Judith Ivory entry: "gender-swapped 'My Fair Lady'..." and the cross-dressing part is in another entry. Wait, the cross-dressing entry is the one about Kit Brantley: "Cross-dressing heroines are something historical romance pilfered from Shakespeare... Kit Brantley is disguised as a man..." The author there isn't named, but the "if you read it and love it, try..." includes Lisa Kleypas, etc. The question is asking for a novel that combines both a cross-dressing spy plot and a gender-swapped Pygmalion. Wait, maybe the answer is Judith Ivory's book? Wait, no, because the cross-dressing in that entry is separate. The Judith Ivory book is the gender-swapped My Fair Lady, which is the Pygmalion dynamic. The cross-dressing spy plot might be another book. Wait, the question is combining both elements. Hmm. Wait, the entry about Kit Brantley's cross-dressing is a spy plot (spying on the Earl) and that's the cross-dressing part. But the gender-swapped My Fair Lady is Judith Ivory's. The question wants a novel that has both cross-dressing spy and gender-swapped Pygmalion. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, the author associated with psychic photographers is Amanda Quick, whose series is mentioned in the paranormal romance section. So the question is asking for a novel that has both elements, and the author also has the psychic series. Wait, Judith Ivory's book is the gender-swapped one, and the cross-dressing spy might be another book. But the question says "combines a cross-dressing spy plot with a gender-swapped Pygmalion dynamic"—so maybe the answer is Judith Ivory's book? Wait no, the cross-dressing part isn't there. Wait, the cross-dressing entry's author isn't mentioned, but the author of the gender-swapped one is Judith Ivory. The psychic photographer is Amanda Quick. Wait, the question says the author's other works include psychic photographers. So the answer must be Amanda Quick's book? Wait, but the gender-swapped Pygmalion is Judith Ivory's. So perhaps the question is mixing up. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me recheck the entries again.

Wait the entry for the gender-swapped My Fair Lady is Judith Ivory's book. The cross-dressing spy is Kit Brantley's story, but the author isn't named there. The author who also has psychic photographers is Amanda Quick, whose series starts with Venetia Jones. So the question is looking for a book that has both cross-dressing spy and Pygmalion, but perhaps the answer is Judith Ivory's? Or maybe the question is combining two different books? Wait the question says "combines a cross-dressing spy plot with a gender-swapped Pygmalion dynamic"—so maybe the cross-dressing spy is part of the same book? Let me look again. The cross-dressing entry says Kit Brantley is sent to spy on the Earl, and the Earl buys her a wardrobe. That's a spy plot with cross-dressing. The gender-swapped My Fair Lady is a separate book. So the question must be asking for Judith Ivory's book? But that's not a spy plot. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "N/A" because no book combines both. Wait, the question is tricky. Wait, perhaps the answer is the Judith Ivory book? Wait, no, because the spy element isn't there. Alternatively, maybe the cross-dressing spy's book (Kit Brantley) is the one, but it doesn't have the Pygmalion. Hmm. I might have to look again. Wait the question says "combines a cross-dressing spy plot with a gender-swapped Pygmalion dynamic"—so maybe it's Judith Ivory's book? Wait, no. Wait, the gender-swapped Pygmalion is the My Fair Lady version. The cross-dressing spy is another book. The question is asking for a novel that has both elements? Or is the author linked to both? The author of the gender-swapped is Judith Ivory. The cross-dressing's author isn't mentioned, but the psychic photographers are Amanda Quick. So perhaps the question's answer is Judith Ivory's book but the author also has other works? Wait, the question says "associated with an author whose other works include a series about psychic photographers..." So the author must be the one who has both. Therefore, the answer must be Amanda Quick's book? Wait no, because Amanda Quick's book is the psychic photographer one. The gender-swapped Pygmalion is Judith Ivory's. So the question is mixing up. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Wait the question says "combines a cross-dressing spy plot with a gender-swapped Pygmalion dynamic"—so the book must have both elements. Let me check the Judith Ivory entry again. It says "gender-swapped 'My Fair Lady'..." so that's the Pygmalion part. The cross-dressing isn't there. The cross-dressing is in another entry. So perhaps the answer is "N/A"? But the question must have an answer. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check the cross-dressing entry again. The cross-dressing entry's story is about Kit Brantley spying, and the Earl. The author isn't named, but the "if you love it, try..." includes Lisa Kleypas, etc. The psychic photographers are Amanda Quick's series. So the question is asking for a novel that has both cross-dressing spy and gender-swapped Pygmalion, and the author also has psychic photographer series. So perhaps the answer is Judith Ivory's book? No, because the author's other works would need to include psychic photographers. Since Judith Ivory isn't linked to that, maybe the answer is "N/A". Alternatively, maybe the question is combining two different books. Wait, the question is tricky. Maybe I need to think again. The author of the gender-swapped My Fair Lady is Judith Ivory. The author of the psychic photographer series is Amanda Quick. So the question is asking for a book that combines cross-dressing spy and Pygmalion, and the author has psychic photographer series. Since those are separate authors, maybe the answer is N/A. But the question must have an answer. Alternatively, perhaps the cross-dressing entry's author has both? No, the cross-dressing entry doesn't mention the psychic part. Wait, the question is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me skip to the next question and come back.

2. **Question 2**: The book with the linguist negotiating a bet involving transforming a Cornish-Cockney into a viscount. The article mentions Judith Ivory's book where Winnie offers to show legs if he shaves his mustache, over three chapters. The linguist is Lady Edwina Bollash. So the answer is Judith Ivory's book, but the name of the book isn't given. Wait the article says "Judith Ivory's prose... where the linguist Lady Edwina Bollash... accepts an aristocrat's bet to pass off the Cornish-Cockney rat-catcher Mick Tremore... as a viscount at her cousin's ball." So the book's title isn't given here. The question asks for the novel's name. Since the article doesn't specify the title, the answer would be N/A? Wait the question says "which book mentioned in the article" — maybe the author is Judith Ivory, but the title isn't provided. The article doesn't give the title of that book. So the answer is N/A? But the question is asking for the book, so maybe the answer is Judith Ivory's unnamed book? But since the title isn't provided, the answer would be N/A. Wait but the question might be expecting the author's name? No, the question asks for the novel's title. Since it's not mentioned, answer N/A.

Wait, but the user's instructions say to use only the article. The article does mention the author and the plot, but not the title. So the answer is N/A for question 2?

Wait, let me check again. The article says: "Judith Ivory's prose... This is a gender-swapped 'My Fair Lady,' where the linguist Lady Edwina Bollash... accepts an aristocrat's bet to pass off the Cornish-Cockney rat-catcher Mick Tremore... as a viscount at her cousin's ball." The actual title isn't given here. So the answer would be N/A because the title isn't specified. 

3. **Question 3**: The journey with Ruck and the princess. The article mentions Laura Kinsale's "this is the one I'd suggest. We meet Ruck in all his medieval splendor: a self-denying itinerant knight compelled to serve the coldhearted Princess Melanthe... their epic road trip bristles with bandits, birds of prey, plagues and assassins..." So the book is Laura Kinsale's, but the title isn't given. The question asks for the book's title. Since it's not provided, answer N/A? Or maybe the title is "Ruck and Melanthe's Journey"? No, the article doesn't say. So N/A? Wait, but the question is about the journey, so maybe the answer is Laura Kinsale's "something", but without the title, it's N/A. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is "Shamrocks and Swordplay" or another, but since it's not given, N/A.

Wait, the user instructions say to answer based solely on the text. Since the title isn't mentioned, answer N/A. 

4. **Question 4**: Heroine disguises as a man and later charms an Earl with a bespoke wardrobe. This is the cross-dressing entry with Kit Brantley. The article says "Kit Brantley is disguised as a man... the earl immediately discovers the ruse -- and then buys her a bespoke masculine wardrobe so she can swan about London..." The book's title isn't mentioned here. So the answer is N/A? The question asks for the heroine's name? No, the question asks for the book's title. Since it's not given, N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The photographer with psychic abilities and a mistaken marriage. That's Amanda Quick's "Venetia" (from the paranormal romance section: "Venetia Jones, a photographer who sees auras... her 'husband,' Gabriel Jones, is alive... coming for Venetia"). The book's title is "Venetia Jones" or the series starts with "Venetia." So the title is likely "Venetia" or "Venetia Jones." The article doesn't specify the exact title, but the first book is "Venetia." So the answer is "Venetia" or "Venetia Jones"? Since the article says "Venetia Jones" as the photographer, perhaps the title is "Venetia" or the series is called "Venetia." But the exact title isn't given. The question asks for the book's name. Since it's not given, N/A? Wait, the article says "Amanda Quick's series about psychics and magic-users in Victorian London begins with Venetia Jones..." So the first book is "Venetia Jones," so the title is "Venetia Jones." So answer: Venetia Jones.

6. **Question 6**: The celebrated adventurer in a slim historical romance who survived a shipwreck by eating shipmates. The article mentions "a slim book... Our hero is haunted by them. Why? Because he survived by eating his shipmates." The book is the slim one, so the answer is that the hero's horrific act was eating shipmates. The question asks "what horrific act," so the answer is "eating his shipmates."

7. **Question 7**: The heroine in the early Beverly Jenkins book has a distinctive physical mark. The article says "Hester Wyatt, a formerly enslaved woman whose hands are permanently stained by indigo dye." So the mark is "indigo-stained hands."

8. **Question 8**: During Napoleonic Wars, a character with covert intelligence and psychological depth. The "Spymaster's Lady" entry says "two agents of enormous intelligence and power against a backdrop of more than the usual amount of peril. Rich and dark, with... lush psychological characterization." The characters are the two agents in that book. The question asks for which character is highlighted. The article mentions "the Spymaster's Lady" as the book, so the main characters are likely the protagonists. Since it's a spymaster's lady, probably the female protagonist. But the question says "which character"—maybe the spymaster? The article doesn't name specific characters, just mentions the two agents. Since the question asks for the character's name, but it's not given, the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says "two agents of enormous intelligence and power", but no names. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The publisher linked to Radclyffe Hall and the vampire sorority book. The article mentions "Bold Strokes Books, whose founder took the name Radclyffe as a nod to the trailblazing lesbian author Radclyffe Hall." The book in question is the vampire one: "vampire sorority" is in the entry about Radclyffe's publisher. So the publisher is Bold Strokes Books.

10. **Question 10**: The Tang-dynasty courtesan celebrated as the most renowned. The article mentions Julie Garwood's "The Bride" and another entry: "Mingyu is the most celebrated courtesan in Tang-dynasty China..." The book is Julie Garwood's "The Bride"? Wait, no, the last entry says "The most recent romance on the list is an absolute stunner. Mingyu is the most celebrated courtesan..." That's Julie Garwood's book? Wait, the last entry is about Julie Garwood's "The Bride" but then another entry? Wait, let me check the end. The last entry before the "designed and produced..." section is about Julie Garwood's "The Bride" but then there's another entry: "The most recent romance on the list is an absolute stunner. Mingyu is the most celebrated courtesan..." That must be a different book, perhaps by Julie Garwood again? The article says "Garwood's 'The Bride' has a 20-year head start." Wait, the entry before that is about Julie Garwood's "The Bride" being her favorite, but the entry after says "The most recent romance... Mingyu..." which is by Julie Garwood? Wait, no, the last entry says "If you read it and love it, try ... Julie Garwood's 'The Bride'..." Wait, the entry before the end is about "The most recent romance on the list is an absolute stunner. Mingyu..." and that's attributed to Julie Garwood? Wait the last entry says "Constable Wu Kaifeng... If you read it and love it, try ... Julie Garwood's 'The Bride'..." So the Mingyu entry is a different book. Wait the text says: "The most recent romance on the list is an absolute stunner. Mingyu is the most celebrated courtesan in Tang-dynasty China..." So the book featuring Mingyu is the most recent one. The author isn't named here, but the previous entry mentions Julie Garwood's "The Bride." Wait, perhaps the Mingyu book is by another author. Wait, the article's last entry before the "designed and produced..." section is titled "Scotland as Julie Garwood presents it..." but the Mingyu entry is a separate one. Let me parse again.

Looking at the article's end entries:

- The entry before the end mentions "The most recent romance on the list is an absolute stunner. Mingyu..." and the author here is Julie Garwood? Wait, no. The previous entry about Scotland is Julie Garwood's "The Bride," but the Mingyu entry is a separate one. The article's last entry says "The most recent romance on the list is an absolute stunner. Mingyu is the most celebrated courtesan... Constable Wu Kaifeng..." and the author isn't named here. But the "if you read it..." says "Julie Garwood's 'The Bride' has a 20-year head start." So the Mingyu book is a different one. Wait, the Mingyu entry is attributed to Julie Garwood? Or another author? The text doesn't specify the author for the Mingyu story. Wait, the last entry's first sentence is "The most recent romance on the list is an absolute stunner. Mingyu is the most celebrated courtesan..." so this is part of the list entries, but the author isn't mentioned here. The previous entry about Scotland is Julie Garwood's "The Bride." The Mingyu entry is a separate entry. Since the question asks for the protagonist's name, which is Mingyu, the answer is Mingyu. The question is asking for the character's name, so Mingyu is correct. The book's title isn't needed here; the question is about the character, so answer is Mingyu.

11. **Question 11**: The Waterloo veteran struggling with trauma from the short-lived author's backlist. The article mentions "Grant's four books dazzled when they first appeared... Will Blackshear is a Waterloo veteran grappling with trauma..." So the character is Will Blackshear, and the author is Grant.

Now, compiling the answers based on this analysis.
