Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and don't infer anything beyond what's written. Let's go step by step.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks which French president invited Bashar al-Assad to Bastille Day, influencing Sattouf leaving Charlie Hebdo. The article mentions Nicolas Sarkozy did this in 2008. So the answer is Nicolas Sarkozy.

2. **Question 2:** The question is about how many volumes of Sattouf's work the imam who threatened Kamel Daoud criticized. The article says the imam threatened Daoud, not Sattouf, and doesn't mention any specific volumes criticized. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The reason Sattouf chose a child's perspective. The article states he says his books are his memory and viewpoint as a child. The primary reason given is to tell his personal memory from that perspective. So the answer is "to tell his memory from a child's perspective."

4. **Question 4:** Which Seinfeld character helped him learn English? The text says he learned from bingeing Seinfeld but doesn't mention a specific character. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Robert Crumb's influence on Sattouf's Charlie Hebdo strips. The article says Crumb influenced his work but his strips at Charlie Hebdo were about daily life, not directly linked to Crumb's style. The question asks for the role Crumb played in that decision. Since the article doesn't connect Crumb to the focus on street life, it's N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Year in Ter Maaleh when he developed his drawing style. The article mentions he moved there in the 1980s during grade school and drawing was a refuge. No specific year given. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Viewership rating of his TV appearance. The article doesn't provide any numbers for the viewership. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Scene highlighted by Prix Goncourt committee. The committee discussed Kamel Daoud's work, not Sattouf's. The question is about Sattouf, so N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Percentage of sales from translations vs French. The article says 3 million copies sold in 23 languages but no breakdown. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Mother's teaching experience influencing Syrian education portrayal. The article doesn't mention her teaching in Ter Maaleh affecting his portrayal. It talks about her being part of the family's move but not her teaching role. So N/A.
