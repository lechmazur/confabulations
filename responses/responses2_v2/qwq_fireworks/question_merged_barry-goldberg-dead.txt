Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I'm only using the information from the provided article. Let me start by reading through the questions again and then cross-check each with the article's content.

1. **Question 1:** The member of Electric Flag who later worked with Jimi Hendrix. The article mentions the drummer Buddy Miles in the Electric Flag, and later Buddy Miles worked with Hendrix. So the answer is Buddy Miles.

2. **Question 2:** The song co-written by Goldberg and Gram Parsons. The article states they collaborated on "Do You Know How It Feels to Be Lonesome?" for the Flying Burrito Brothers. The question asks for the song title, so that's the answer.

3. **Question 3:** The instrument Goldberg played during Dylan's set. The correction says he played piano on two songs and organ on "Like a Rolling Stone," with Kooper on bass for that song. So he didn't play exclusively one instrument. The answer would be N/A because the question says "exclusively," which isn't true.

4. **Question 4:** The Yiddish theater performer influencing Goldberg's piano. His mother Nettie Goldberg was a pianist in Yiddish theaters. So her name is Nettie (Spencer) Goldberg.

5. **Question 5:** Musicians excluded from Dylan's set due to producer's decision. The article says Paul Rothchild didn't want a keyboardist (Goldberg), but the question asks for two. Wait, maybe others? Wait, the Electric Flag? Wait, the question refers to the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. Wait, the article mentions that when the Paul Butterfield Blues Band was at Newport, Rothchild (the producer) told Goldberg he didn't want a keyboardist. But the question is about two musicians from that band excluded. The text only mentions Goldberg being excluded. Maybe another? The text says "other Butterfield sidemen" but not names. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A since only Goldberg is mentioned. Wait, but the question says "explicitly excluded due to disagreements with the producer." The article says Rothchild told Goldberg he wasn't wanted, so maybe only him. Since the question asks for two, it's N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Health complication leading to hospitalization. The obit says cause was complications of lymphoma. So the answer is complications of lymphoma.

7. **Question 7:** The dance craze Robby and the Troubadours were associated with. The article says they were "cashing in on the twist craze." So the answer is the twist.

8. **Question 8:** Elijah Wald's reason for audience's reaction. The article says Wald's view is that the audience represented youth and hope, and Dylan was shutting himself off with noise. The primary reason cited is that the audience symbolized youth and hope, contrasting with Dylan's move. So the answer is that the audience represented youth and hope while Dylan turned to a citadel of wealth/power.

9. **Question 9:** The Flying Burrito Brothers member incorrectly credited. The article mentions the song by Flying Burrito Brothers was written by Goldberg and Parsons. The question asks which member was incorrectly credited. Wait, the error was in a picture caption where Elvin Bishop was misidentified as part of the Dylan rehearsal when it was Al Kooper. But the question is about a collaboration with Gladys Knight? Wait, no. The question refers to a collaboration with Gladys Knight's song. The article says Goldberg and Gerry Goffin wrote "I've Got to Use My Imagination" for Gladys Knight. The question asks which member of the Flying Burrito Brothers was incorrectly credited. The Flying Burrito Brothers are mentioned as releasing the song with Goldberg and Parsons. But the error in the article was in a picture caption where Elvin Bishop was misidentified instead of Al Kooper. So maybe the answer is Elvin Bishop, but the question is about the Gladys Knight song. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. The question is about a member of the Flying Burrito Brothers being incorrectly credited in the article. The article's correction says a picture caption misidentified a musician as Elvin Bishop instead of Al Kooper. Since the Flying Burrito Brothers are not mentioned in that caption error, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the question might be a trick. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Al Kooper? Wait, no. The error was the caption said Elvin Bishop was part of Dylan's rehearsal when it was Al Kooper. The question is about the Flying Burrito Brothers member being incorrectly credited in the article. Since the article's error was about the picture caption for Dylan's rehearsal, not the Flying Burrito Brothers, maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me re-read. The last paragraph correction says an earlier version of the picture caption misidentified the musician as Elvin Bishop instead of Al Kooper. The Flying Burrito Brothers are a separate group. The question is asking which member of the Flying Burrito Brothers was incorrectly credited in the article. Since the error was about a different context (Dylan's rehearsal), maybe there's no such error regarding the Flying Burrito Brothers. Therefore, N/A?

Wait, the question says "which member of the Flying Burrito Brothers was incorrectly credited in the article as collaborating with Barry Goldberg on a song later covered by Gladys Knight & the Pips?" Wait no, the song with Gladys Knight was co-written by Goldberg and Gerry Goffin, not the Flying Burrito Brothers. The Flying Burrito song was with Parsons. The question is about a member of the Flying Burrito Brothers being incorrectly credited as collaborating on the Gladys Knight song. Since that song was with Goffin, not a member of the Flying Burrito Brothers, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick. Maybe the article's error was about the Flying Burrito Brothers? Wait the correction says the article had an error where the picture caption misidentified Elvin Bishop as part of Dylan's rehearsal when it was Al Kooper. The Flying Burrito Brothers are mentioned in the songwriting with Parsons. There's no mention of any error regarding their members. So the answer is N/A. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again. The question is about the Flying Burrito Brothers member being incorrectly credited in the article as collaborating on the Gladys Knight song. Since the Gladys Knight song was with Goffin, not a member of the Flying Burrito, the answer is N/A. Alternatively, if the question is about another collaboration, but the article says the Flying Burrito Brothers song was with Parsons. So the answer is N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The film featuring Dylan's Newport performance that had the incorrect credit. The article mentions "A Complete Unknown" as the film, and the error was in the picture caption where Elvin Bishop was named instead of Al Kooper. So the film is "A Complete Unknown."

11. **Question 11:** Instrument Goldberg played during "Like a Rolling Stone." The correction says he played organ on that song, with Kooper on bass. So organ.

12. **Question 12:** The musical transition described by Goldberg. The article says Dylan was moving away from folk to rock. The transition is from folk to rock.

13. **Question 13:** Childhood experience with his mother boosting confidence. The article states he played for strangers at 8-9 because his mother forced him, which gave him confidence despite jitters. So the answer is his mother forcing him to play for strangers when 8 or 9.

14. **Question 14:** The Gladys Knight song co-written with lyricist Gerry Goffin. The article says "I've Got to Use My Imagination."

15. **Question 15:** Effect on Goldberg when Rothchild excluded him. The article says "In one minute I went from having the greatest time to being completely alone and having no gig. It just destroyed me." So the effect was he was devastated/destroyed.

16. **Question 16:** The festival with the soundcheck incident involving Peter Yarrow. The Newport Folk Festival.

17. **Question 17:** Midwestern city where Goldberg listened to blues on radio. Chicago.

18. **Question 18:** Blues-rock band with psychedelic performance at Monterey Pop. The Electric Flag.

19. **Question 19:** Artist whose electric set at Newport featured Goldberg. Bob Dylan.

20. **Question 20:** Shared cultural background with fellow musicians. The article says they were three Jewish guys from the Midwest with similar backgrounds, attitudes, clothes. So Jewish background.
