Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article provided and follow the strict format. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks which Met manager rejected Plishka for dramatic roles before 1970. The article mentions Rudolf Bing, the longtime Met manager, who offered him buffo roles when he auditioned. But later, by 1970, the Met decided his voice was suitable for dramatic roles. So the manager who initially rejected him was Rudolf Bing.
