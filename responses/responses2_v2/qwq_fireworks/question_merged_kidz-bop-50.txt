Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked and avoid any assumptions beyond the text. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question asks which former Kidz Bop performer became a music history professor at George Washington University. Scanning through the article, I remember a part where Loren Kajikawa is mentioned as a music historian there. Wait, the article says: "Loren Kajikawa, a music historian at George Washington University." But does it say he was a former Kidz Bop performer? The text states his affiliation but not that he was a performer. So maybe this is a trick question. The answer would be N/A because there's no mention of him being a performer.

2. Next, how much revenue did Kidz Bop generate from Chuck E. Cheese in 2022? The article mentions partnerships with Lego and Chuck E. Cheese but doesn't provide specific figures or years. So N/A here.

3. The first album's original song that hit number one on Billboard Kids chart in 2001. The article says the first albums included "Bye Bye Bye" and "All the Small Things," but those are covers. The question specifies an original song, so since they're covers, there's no original song listed here. Answer N/A.

4. The Congressional committee that approved lyric guidelines in 1994. The text mentions Congress held hearings on rap music in 1994, but it doesn't name a specific committee. So N/A.

5. The streaming platform that exclusively hosted Kidz Bop before expansion. The article says streaming era affected chart success but doesn't name a specific platform. N/A.

6. Percentage of performers in entertainment per internal studies. The article doesn't mention any studies or percentages, so N/A.

7. Executive producer responsible for the "sunshine and rainbows" aesthetic. Cooper Hounshell mentioned that phrase, but the article doesn't name the executive. N/A.

8. Educational curriculum with Lego. The article states partnerships with Lego but no specifics on a curriculum. N/A.

9. Pop star who sued then became ambassador. No mention of any lawsuits in the text. N/A.

10. Average age during peak 2005-2010. The article doesn't provide age statistics for that period. N/A.

11. The album with 38 tracks including Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, and Tommy Richman. The first paragraph mentions Kidz Bop 50 has those tracks, so the answer is Kidz Bop 50.

12. Former performer in Meghan Trainor cover who later appeared on Idol with her. The article mentions Jayna Elise did the Trainor track and later was on American Idol with Trainor as a mentor. So Jayna Elise.

13. The two who started Razor & Tie before Kidz Bop. The article says Cliff Chenfeld and Craig Balsam formed Razor & Tie, leading to Kidz Bop. So their names.

14. Alumnus with 12 albums and 162 shows. The text mentions Grant Knoche with those numbers, so his name.

15. Genre that caused Congress concern, leading to Kidz Bop's approach. The article says Congress was concerned about rap music leading to violence. So rap.

16. What aspect did Kidz Bop modify in Psy's and Trainor's lyrics? The examples given show they changed references to sex, violence, drugs. The common aspect is removing explicit content, so explicit language or themes.

17. Venture that took Kidz Bop on the road a decade ago. The article mentions a touring act debuted about a decade ago. So the touring act.

18. Gaga's line changed to eating grub. The article says "sippin' that bub" became "eating that grub." So that line.

19. Who said the appeal is kids singing for kids? Sasha Junk, the president, stated "It's fun. And kids love to hear other kids sing."

20. Scholar from prominent university commenting on censorship. Loren Kajikawa from GWU discussed cultural anxieties around Black music's influence. So his name.
