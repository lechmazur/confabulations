Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict instructions. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **How many millions of dollars did the A.F.L.-C.I.O. lose in annual dues revenue when the service employees union initially left the federation in 2005?**
   - The article says the schism cost the AFL-CIO roughly four million members and "millions of dollars in dues." But it doesn't specify an exact amount in millions of dollars. So the answer is N/A because the exact figure isn't given.

2. **Which Republican senator did Ms. Verrett specifically identify as posing the greatest threat to union organizing efforts under the Trump administration?**
   - The article mentions Ms. Verrett and Ms. Shuler cited concerns like mass deportations, Medicaid cuts, etc., but doesn't name a specific Republican senator. So N/A.

3. **What percentage of union households voted for Trump in the 2024 election according to the exit polling data mentioned?**
   - The exit poll showed Trump expanded his margins among working-class voters but "not among union members specifically." The percentage isn't provided. N/A.

4. **How much did the Service Employees International Union contribute to phone banking operations for Kamala Harris's presidential campaign?**
   - The article states unions spent over $40M on Harris's campaign, excluding operational costs like phone banks. So the SEIU's specific contribution isn't mentioned. N/A.

5. **What was the total membership of the rival federation formed by Andy Stern at its peak?**
   - The SEIU and others left, costing AFL-CIO 4M members out of 13.5M. The rival federation's peak membership would be around 4M, but the article doesn't explicitly state this. Wait, actually, the article says "roughly four million of its 13.5 million members at the time." So the rival federation had 4M? Maybe that's the total. But the question is about the rival federation's total membership. Since the split took 4M from AFL-CIO, that's likely the rival's peak. But the article says "the schism cost the A.F.L.-C.I.O. roughly four million of its 13.5 million members at the time, and millions of dollars in dues." So the rival federation's peak membership would be 4 million. So answer is 4 million.

6. **Which three specific industries did Sean O'Brien cite when explaining the Teamsters' decision not to endorse a candidate?**
   - The article mentions the Teamsters president addressed the RNC and didn't endorse, but no specific industries cited. N/A.

7. **What annual budget did Ms. Shuler propose for expanding the Center for Transformational Organizing in response to Trump's election?**
   - The Center was opened in 2022 with a $10M annual budget. The question is about a proposal by Shuler in response to Trump's election. The article says the center had a $10M budget, but it's unclear if that's Shuler's proposal post-Trump. The timing might not align. The article doesn't explicitly link the budget proposal to Trump's election, so N/A.

8. **How many of the original unions that left with SEIU in 2005 have now returned to the A.F.L.-C.I.O.?**
   - The article says some dissident unions returned over the next few years after Trumka took over. But exact number not given. N/A.

9. **What minimum wage requirement did Trump's proposed tip tax elimination policy include according to union leaders?**
   - The article mentions Trump courted union members with pledges to eliminate tip taxes and impose new tariffs. No details on minimum wage. N/A.

10. **Which state's organizing campaign did Ms. Verrett highlight as the model for future "multiunion, multisector" efforts?**
    - The article doesn't mention a specific state. N/A.

11. **Considering the rift over strategy that led to the 2005 schism, how many members did the AFL-CIO have after the Teamsters rejoined following Andy Stern's departure?**
    - The AFL-CIO had 13.5M before losing 4M, then some returned. But the exact number after Teamsters rejoined isn't stated. The current membership is over 12.5M now, but that's after the SEIU rejoined in 2024. The question is about after Teamsters came back. Not enough info. N/A.

12. **Given the AFL-CIO's Center for Transformational Organizing's budget and the total spending on Kamala Harris's campaign, what percentage of the AFL-CIO's overall budget went towards legislative efforts in 2022?**
    - The center's budget is $10M, total AFL-CIO budget over $100M. But legislative efforts might include other spending. The article says the center is part of organizing efforts. The question is about legislative efforts. Not enough info to calculate percentage. N/A.

13. **If the AFL-CIO had successfully enacted its top priority legislation during Biden's first two years, what specific impact would this have had on the number of undocumented workers facing deportation under the Trump administration's concerns?**
    - The top priority was easier unionization. The question links this to deportations. The article says the legislation wasn't enacted, and their concerns included mass deportations. But there's no direct link stated between the legislation and deportation numbers. N/A.

14. **Based on the concerns voiced by April Verrett and Liz Shuler about the Trump administration, what action did the leader of the service employees take in 2005 to address the threat of mass deportations?**
    - The 2005 split was about strategy, not deportations. The current leaders are addressing Trump's threats now. The question asks what Andy Stern (then leader) did in 2005 regarding deportations. The article doesn't mention that. N/A.

15. **Taking into account Sean O'Brien's address to the Republican National Convention and the Teamsters' subsequent endorsement decision, what was the total amount spent by unions on Vice President Harris's campaign, excluding operational costs?**
    - The article states unions spent over $40M on Harris's campaign, excluding operational costs. So the answer is over $40 million. The exact figure isn't given, but the question says "total amount spent... excluding operational costs" which is the $40M. So answer: over $40 million. Wait, the exact wording is "more than $40 million... not including costs..." So the answer is "over $40 million".

16. **Considering the AFL-CIO's efforts to enact the green energy bill and the subsequent incentives for clean energy projects, what percentage of the workforce was unionized when Richard Trumka took over the AFL-CIO?**
    - The article says union membership was about 10% now, down from 20% in early 1980s. But Trumka took over after 2005. The exact percentage when he took over isn't given. N/A.

17. **In light of the stated goals of the newly formed partnership between the SEIU and the AFL-CIO, what specific changes to federal rules did Andy Stern propose before the 2005 split regarding contributions to multisector organizing campaigns?**
    - Stern wanted unions to scale back contributions to AFL-CIO to invest in organizing. The question is about changes to federal rules. The article says the rift was over strategy, not federal rules. So N/A.

18. **Given the timeline of discussions between the SEIU and the AFL-CIO, how many years after the formation of the rival federation did Liz Shuler and April Verrett accelerate talks about rejoining, considering the rival federation's struggles?**
    - The rival federation formed in 2005. Discussions accelerated early last year (assuming the article is 2024, so 2023). So from 2005 to 2023 is 18 years. But the article says Verrett started discussions almost two years ago (from 2024, that's 2022). The acceleration was early 2023 (assuming article is 2024). The time since 2005 would be 18 years, but the question is about how many years after the rival's formation did they accelerate talks. If discussions accelerated in 2023 (18 years later), but the article says Verrett started discussions two years before the article (say 2022-2024?), but exact years need to be precise. The article says "discussions... accelerated early last year". If the article is 2024, "last year" is 2023, so 2023-2005=18. So answer is 18?

Wait the article says "the service employees' president, April Verrett, said in an interview that the union had begun discussing the possibility of joining the A.F.L.-C.I.O. almost two years ago, and that discussions with the federation and its president, Liz Shuler, accelerated early last year." If the article was written in 2024, then "two years ago" would be 2022 and "early last year" 2023. The rival federation was formed in 2005. So from 2005 to 2023 is 18 years. So the answer is 18 years.

19. **With the Trump administration's focus on government spending cuts, what percentage of the AFL-CIO's budget was allocated to the Center for Transformational Organizing before the SEIU rejoined?**
    - The center had a $10M annual budget. The AFL-CIO's budget is over $100M. So 10/100=10%. But the question is before SEIU rejoined. The center was opened in 2022, and SEIU rejoined in 2024. So before SEIU's return, the center's budget was $10M. The total budget was over $100M, so 10%? The exact percentage would be 10% if $10M is part of the $100M. So answer 10%.

20. **Considering the number of workers represented by the SEIU and the AFL-CIO, and the decline in union membership since the 1980s, how many more unions were part of the AFL-CIO umbrella group when the schism occurred in 2005?**
    - The article states the AFL-CIO has over 50 unions now. The schism in 2005 led to some leaving, but the number of unions isn't specified before and after. The article says "more than 50 unions" now, but before 2005, it might have been more. However, the exact number isn't given. So N/A.
