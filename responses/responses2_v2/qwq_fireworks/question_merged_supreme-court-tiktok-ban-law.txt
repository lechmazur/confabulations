Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and cross-referencing the article for answers.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks about a legal precedent cited by a justice who mentioned historical analogues to justify actions against CBS News. Wait, the article says Justice Kavanaugh referenced historical analogues about preventing foreign ownership of media. But the question mentions CBS News. Hmm, the article's last paragraph talks about Trump's lawsuits against CBS News and The Des Moines Register. However, the legal precedent part—did the article mention a specific one related to CBS? The question might be a trick because the precedent was about foreign ownership, but the CBS part is separate. Since the article doesn't link a precedent to CBS specifically, maybe it's N/A. Wait, no—Kavanaugh's point was about foreign ownership, but the question says "against CBS News". The article says the lawsuits against CBS lack merit, but the precedent part was about foreign media ownership. Since the question mixes the two, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe the precedent was the one about foreign ownership, but the question is about CBS. I think this is N/A because the precedent was about foreign ownership, not CBS specifically.

2. **Question 2:** The law allows the president to extend the deadline for 90 days if there's significant progress toward a sale with binding agreements. The question asks how many days after the shutdown the president can extend, assuming certification. The article says the deadline is Jan. 19, and the extension is 90 days. The question is phrased as "how many days after the potential TikTok shutdown could the president extend..." So the extension period is 90 days, but the question is about the days after the shutdown. The answer is 90.

3. **Question 3:** The justice who acknowledged TikTok's First Amendment rights but questioned their relevance in a divestiture context. The article mentions Justice Kagan saying, "How are those First Amendment rights really being implicated here?" if ByteDance divests. So that's Kagan.

4. **Question 4:** The Trump admin action at West Point related to foreign influence. The DEI section says West Point ended clubs to comply with Trump's D.E.I. ban, which critics say contradicts diversity efforts. The question links this to Chief Justice Roberts' concern about foreign ownership (China). The action was ending clubs, but the question asks what mirrored the foreign influence concern. Since the D.E.I. ban isn't directly about foreign influence, maybe N/A? Wait, the question's context is about foreign control (like TikTok). The West Point action was about D.E.I., not foreign. So maybe N/A. But the answer might be "ended a dozen student clubs" but the question is about mirroring foreign influence concerns. Hmm, perhaps the answer is N/A because the West Point action is about diversity, not foreign influence. 

5. **Question 5:** The concurring opinion mentioned financial consequences similar to the monetization coach. The concurring judge Srinivasan said many Americans might lose access to an income source. The monetization coach's case is about losing income. So the answer is "means of income".

6. **Question 6:** Facility mentioned in the same context as TikTok's censorship. The last paragraph mentions a tent city for migrants and also the part about TikTok acceding to Beijing's censorship. The answer is "tent city".

7. **Question 7:** Entity Trump opposed similarly to TikTok, related to combating disinformation. The U.S.A.I.D. part says Trump called for its closure, similar to opposing the TikTok ban. Wait the question says "in a manner similar to his opposition to the TikTok ban"—so opposing U.S.A.I.D. closure is the opposite? Wait the question says "criticized by Trump... similar to his opposition to the Tiktok ban". Since Trump opposed the TikTok ban, the entity he opposed similarly would be U.S.A.I.D. because he wanted to close it? Wait the question says "criticized by Trump in a manner similar to his opposition to the TikTok ban". The TikTok opposition was against the ban, so maybe the entity he opposed closing? Or the answer is U.S.A.I.D. since he wanted to close it, but the question is about opposing a ban. Hmm, maybe the answer is U.S.A.I.D. because he wanted to close it, similar to opposing a ban (but not sure). The article says "Trump directly called for the closure of the U.S. Agency for International Development". So that's the entity: USAID.

8. **Question 8:** Justice concerned about data collection aligned with Trump's action against USAID. The action against USAID is closing it. The question links the justice's concern with data collection to that action. The government's action against USAID was closing it, so which justice was concerned about data? Justice Alito expressed concerns about data collection. The article says "Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. expressed concerns about... gathering an arsenal of information...". The action against USAID was closing it, so maybe Alito's concern aligns with Trump's action against USAID? Not sure, but the answer might be Alito.

9. **Question 9:** Temperature when the three-judge panel rejected the challenge. The three-judge panel's ruling was in early December. The creators outside the court were in 20-degree weather. The question is asking if the temperature mentioned (20 degrees) was when the panel rejected the challenge. The panel's decision was in early December, and the event outside the court (with 20 degrees) was during the Supreme Court arguments. The article mentions the temperature in the context of the creators outside the court, not the panel's ruling. So the answer is 20 degrees, but the question is about the temperature when the panel rejected the challenge. Since the panel's action was in early December, and the temperature is mentioned during the SCOTUS arguments (which happened later?), maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "Outside the court, some TikTok creators streamed the live audio from arguments to their followers, answering questions, expressing fear at the looming ban and holding onto small hand warmers in the 20-degree weather." The panel's rejection was in early December, but the temperature is mentioned during the Supreme Court arguments (probably later, but the article doesn't specify dates). Since the question asks for the temperature when the panel rejected, but the temp is at a different event, answer is N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Chinese cybersecurity law cited by the government. The article says the government claimed TikTok acceded to Beijing's demands to censor content outside China. It doesn't mention a specific law. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Number of American users who would lose income. The article says TikTok has 170 million users. The concurring opinion mentioned "many Americans may lose access... means of income." But the exact number isn't given. So N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Justice who compared data harvesting to FBI blackmail. The article says Justice Kavanaugh mentioned using data to develop spies, blackmail, etc. So Kavanaugh.

13. **Question 13:** Percentage of ByteDance investors in U.S. allies. The article says "more than half of the company is owned by global institutional investors" but doesn't specify which countries. So N/A.

14. **Question 14:** 1930s law referenced by Kavanaugh. The article says Kavanaugh mentioned a long tradition of preventing foreign ownership. The exact law isn't named. N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Algorithm feature China threatened to block. ByteDance's legal team said China would bar export of their algorithm. The specific technical feature isn't named. So N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Creator who testified before Congress. The article mentions Andrea Celeste Olde and Sarah Baus, but no testimony mentioned. N/A.

17. **Question 17:** Days for presidential extension after Jan.19. The law allows a 90-day extension under certain conditions. The question is days after the deadline (Jan.19), so 90 days.

18. **Question 18:** Judge who said data rationale insufficient without evidence. The concurring opinion was by Srinivasan, but the majority was Ginsburg. The question is about a judge who argued the data rationale was insufficient. The article says Srinivasan's concurrence acknowledged the risk but said Congress's decision was considered. No judge is mentioned as saying it was insufficient without evidence. N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Previous executive order under IEEPA. The Solicitor General's brief might reference an EO, but the article doesn't mention a specific one. N/A.
