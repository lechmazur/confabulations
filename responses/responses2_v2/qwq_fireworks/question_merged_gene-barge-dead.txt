Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. The first question asks about a song Gary U.S. Bonds adapted by adding lyrics to Barge's instrumental, creating a hit that rivaled "Bristol Stomp". The article mentions "Quarter to Three" was created by adding lyrics to "A Night With Daddy G". "Bristol Stomp" itself refers to Barge in its lyrics, so the answer is "Quarter to Three".

2. The second question is about the position Barge took at Jesse Jackson's organization after leaving Legrand. The article states he directed the musical ensemble of Operation Breadbasket under Jesse Jackson. So the answer is "director of the musical ensemble".

3. The third question asks for the film where Barge was in a non-musical role, released the same year "Sophisticated Lady" won a Grammy. The article says he was in "Stony Island" (1978) and later in "Under Siege" (1992) and "The Fugitive" (1993). "Sophisticated Lady" was Natalie Cole's 1991 Grammy winner. Wait, the article mentions Natalie Cole's Grammy-winning single "Sophisticated Lady (She's a Different Lady)" so the year would be around 1991. But "Stony Island" was 1978. Hmm, maybe I missed something. Wait, the user might have confused the film's release with the Grammy year. The article says he made his screen debut in "Stony Island" in 1978. The Grammy-winning track was in the late 80s/early 90s. But the question says "released in the same year that 'Sophisticated Lady...' won a Grammy". The Grammy for "Sophisticated Lady" was in 1991. The film "Under Siege" is 1992, "The Fugitive" 1993. So maybe the answer is "Under Siege" or "The Fugitive", but the article says he worked on "Sophisticated Lady" as a producer. Wait, the question says "showcasing the breadth... beyond music" so maybe the film in the same year as the Grammy? The article doesn't specify the exact year, but "Sophisticated Lady" was released in 1991. The film "Under Siege" is 1992, "The Fugitive" 1993. So perhaps the answer is "N/A" because the article doesn't link a film to the Grammy year. Wait, the article says he worked on "Sophisticated Lady" and later took roles in those films. Since the question asks for the film released the same year as the Grammy win, but without exact dates, maybe the answer is "N/A". Wait, but the article mentions he made his screen debut in "Stony Island" (1978) and later roles in the 90s. The Grammy for "Sophisticated Lady" was 1992 (I think). Let me check the article again. The article says "Natalie Cole's Grammy-winning single 'Sophisticated Lady (She's a Different Lady)'". The actual Grammy for that song was in 1991. The film "Under Siege" is 1992. So maybe the answer is "Under Siege" but the timing might not match. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to another film. Hmm, perhaps the answer is "Under Siege" or "The Fugitive", but the article doesn't explicitly state it's the same year. So maybe "N/A". Wait, the article says "In the late 1970s he took a detour into acting... made his screen debut... before eventually landing roles in Hollywood action thrillers like 'Under Siege' (1992) and 'The Fugitive' (1993)." So the Grammy for "Sophisticated Lady" was in 1991. The films listed are from 1992 and 1993. So the answer would be "N/A" because there's no film mentioned released the same year as the Grammy. Wait, but the question might be a trick. Let me re-read the question: "the same year that 'Sophisticated Lady...' won a Grammy, showcasing the breadth..." The article says he worked on "Sophisticated Lady" but doesn't mention when he acted in a film that year. Since the films listed are later, the answer is "N/A".

4. The fourth question asks about the instrument Barge played before the tenor sax. The article says he played clarinet in high school before taking up sax after his father found a waterlogged tenor. So the answer is "clarinet".

5. The fifth question is about the avant-garde jazz trumpeter he collaborated with, mentioned alongside Chuck D. The article states he worked with Malachi Thompson and Chuck D of Public Enemy is quoted. So the answer is "Malachi Thompson".

6. The sixth question asks for the organization whose theme song was "A Night With Daddy G", later absorbed into Record Mirror. The article says Hy Lit used it as the theme for his radio show, and the magazine "Disc" was absorbed into Record Mirror. The organization here is Hy Lit's radio show. But the question asks for the name of the organization. The article says "the Philadelphia disc jockey Hy Lit adopted 'A Night With Daddy G' as the theme song for his radio show." So the answer is "Hy Lit's radio show" but maybe the name of the radio show? The article doesn't give a name, so perhaps just "Hy Lit's radio show". Alternatively, the magazine that absorbed Disc was Record Mirror, but the question is about the organization for which the song was a theme. The answer is Hy Lit's radio show. Since the question asks for the name, maybe it's "Hy Lit's radio show".

7. The seventh question is about the doo-wop group that paid tribute to Hy Lit in their song. The article mentions the Dovells did "Bristol Stomp" with "We ponied and twisted and we rocked with Daddy G". Wait, the question says "incorporated a lyrical tribute to Hy Lit". The article says the Dovells' "Bristol Stomp" refers to "Daddy G". But Hy Lit is the disc jockey who used the song as his theme. The question might be confused. The Dovells' song mentions "Daddy G", not Hy Lit. The question might have an error, so the answer is "N/A". Wait, the question says "incorporated a lyrical tribute to Hy Lit". The article doesn't mention the Dovells referring to Hy Lit, only to Daddy G. So the answer is "N/A".

8. The eighth question asks for the label founded by Frank Guida that released "Country". The article says Frank Guida's Legrand label released "A Night With Daddy G" and Bonds' singles. "Country" was Barge's first single for Checker, a Chess subsidiary. Wait, the article says: "The first recordings Mr. Barge made under his own name were a pair of instrumentals for Checker, a subsidiary of Chess Records, in 1956. 'Country,' his first single, was a hit..." So the label was Checker, not Legrand. The Legrand label was under Frank Guida. The question is about the label that first recognized Barge's talent leading to "Country". Since Checker was the first, but the question says Frank Guida's label, maybe the answer is "Legrand" but that's conflicting. Wait, the article says around 1960 he worked with Frank Guida at Legrand. So "Country" was on Checker (Chess subsidiary) before that. The question's premise might be wrong. The answer is "Checker", but the question says "founded by Frank Guida" which is Legrand. Since the article says Frank Guida's Legrand released "A Night With Daddy G", but "Country" was on Checker. So the question is incorrect, so answer "N/A".

9. The ninth question asks for the Chi-Lites' song Barge produced. The article mentions he produced albums, including Buddy Guy's, and "Grits Ain't Groceries" by Little Milton, "Wang Dang Doodle" by Koko Taylor. The Chi-Lites aren't mentioned. So "N/A".

10. The tenth question is about the band with Clarence Clemons that performed Barge's song. The article says the E Street Band (with Clemons and Springsteen) performed "Quarter to Three". So the answer is "The E Street Band".

11. Eleventh question: his screen debut film was "Stony Island" as stated. So "Stony Island".

12. Twelfth question: the hip-hop group with Malachi Thompson. The article mentions Public Enemy on a track with Malachi Thompson. Wait, the article says "Public Enemy's 'Superman's Black in the Building'" and "Malachi Thompson". So the group is "Public Enemy".

13. Thirteenth question: his first single on Chess? Wait, the article says "Country" was on Checker, a Chess subsidiary. So "Country" is the answer. The article says Chess heard it and coined "funk". So even though it's a subsidiary, the label under Chess is Checker. The question says Chess Records, so maybe "N/A" but the article says Checker is a subsidiary. The question might accept "Country" as the answer.

14. Fourteenth question: the civil rights organization was Operation Breadbasket under Jesse Jackson. So "Operation Breadbasket".

15. Fifteenth question: the Beatles song inspired by "Quarter to Three". The article states it inspired the Beatles' "big-beat rock 'n' roll". The specific song isn't named, so "N/A".

16. Sixteenth question: the PBS documentary was "The Blues" by Scorsese. So "The Blues".

17. Seventeenth question: the 1967 album produced by Barge at Chess was Buddy Guy's "Left My Blues in San Francisco". So that's the title.
