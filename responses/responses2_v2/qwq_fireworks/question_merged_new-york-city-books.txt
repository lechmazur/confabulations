Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer strictly based on that. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The author of "Trust" is Hernan Diaz. The article mentions he won the Pulitzer Prize. The novel about the misfit and Samaritan is "Bartleby, the Scrivener," but the Pulitzer was for his own novels. Wait, the article says Hernan Diaz has won the Pulitzer for his own works like "In the Distance" and "Trust." So the answer is Pulitzer Prize.

2. **Question 2:** The author of "Chelsea Girls" is Eileen Myles. The question mentions they met a woman at the TKTS booth in 1980. TKTS is in Times Square. So the neighborhood is Times Square, but the article says "TKTS booth in 1980" without specifying neighborhood, but TKTS is in Times Square. Answer: Times Square.

3. **Question 3:** "Trading Up" protagonist is Janey Wilcox, a narcissistic career woman. The author is Candace Bushnell, who mentions "Harriet the Spy" inspired her. The protagonist's profession? The question asks what she shares with a character from a novel by the author (Candace) who was inspired by "Harriet". Candace's books include career women. The character in "Harriet the Spy" is a spy, but maybe the protagonist's profession is similar to Undine Spragg from Wharton's "Custom of the Country," which Candace references. The answer might be "social climber" but the question is about profession. Alternatively, since Janey is a social climber in high society, maybe "social climber" but the question might need a specific job. Wait, the article says Janey is a certain type who strives to the top, similar to Undine. The profession isn't directly stated, but Candace's novels focus on career women in NYC. Maybe the answer is "career woman" but the question says "profession," so perhaps "businesswoman" or "social climber isn't a profession. Hmm. The article says "boldfaced names, wannabes and busy bees" so maybe "social climber" isn't a job. Alternatively, "career woman" is the closest. But the exact profession isn't specified. Wait, the question says "protagonist of Trading Up" shares profession with a character from a novel by the author (Candace) who was inspired by "Harriet the Spy." The author here is Candace Bushnell, and her inspiration is from "Harriet the Spy." The protagonist of "Harriet the Spy" is a girl aspiring to be a writer. But the question is about the protagonist of Trading Up and a character from a novel by Candace. Wait, Candace's own novels include "Trading Up" and "Lipstick Jungle." The protagonist of "Trading Up" is Janey Wilcox, a social climber. The other character would be Undine Spragg from Wharton, which Candace references. Undine's profession isn't clear, but she's a social climber. So maybe "social climber" is the profession? But the question might be looking for "socialite" or "career woman." Alternatively, maybe the answer is "social climber," but the article doesn't explicitly state profession. Hmm. Wait, the question says "protagonist of Trading Up" shares profession with a character from a novel by Candace's inspiration. Wait, the question might be a bit tricky. Candace's inspiration includes "Harriet the Spy," but the protagonist of "Harriet" is a spy (aspiration), but the actual job isn't the focus. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "N/A" because the professions aren't directly stated. Wait, the article says "Janey Wilcox, a narcissistic borderline personality type and a certain kind of woman who comes to New York to strive to the top, after Undine Spragg, from Wharton's 'The Custom of the Country.'" Undine's profession isn't stated, but she's a social climber. The question asks for the profession shared between Janey and a character from a novel by the author (Candace's) who was inspired by Harriet. Wait, maybe the character from Wharton's novel is the one? The question says "a character from a novel by the author who found inspiration..." The author here is Candace, so the novel by Candace that's inspired by Harriet's themes? Not sure. Maybe the answer is "social climber" but since it's a profession, perhaps "N/A" because it's not explicitly stated. Alternatively, maybe "social climber" is acceptable. Hmm, but I'll need to check the exact text. The article says Candace's protagonist is like Undine Spragg, so maybe their shared trait is being a social climber, but that's not a profession. Maybe the answer is "N/A."

4. **Question 4:** The author of "Homeland Elegies" is Ayad Akhtar. The article mentions that in his childhood apartment, his mother had to cover her stove with a board when the Con Edison inspector came over. So the object is "stove."

5. **Question 5:** The author of "In the Distance" is Hernan Diaz. He mentions "Man's Country," a bathhouse where the New York Dolls performed. The fictional bar in Casey McQuiston's novel is "Scissors" from "Just as You Are." Wait, the question says "establishment mentioned by Hernan that hosted NY Dolls and inspired a fictional bar in a novel praised by Casey." The bathhouse Man's Country is the real place, and the fictional bar is Scissors. So the answer is "bathhouse."

6. **Question 6:** The chef who opened Red Rooster is Marcus Samuelsson. The book he praises that has a character who "would prefer not to" is "Bartleby, the Scrivener" by Melville. The question asks for the title of the book. The full title is "Bartleby, the Scrivener: A Story of Wall-Street," but often referred to as just "Bartleby, the Scrivener." The article says Hernan Diaz mentions it, but Marcus Samuelsson's section? Wait, no. Marcus Samuelsson's section mentions "A Rage in Harlem" and others, but the book with Bartleby is mentioned by Hernan Diaz. Wait, the question says the chef (Marcus) praises the book. Wait, looking back, Marcus Samuelsson's section mentions "Go Tell It on the Mountain" and "Harlem, U.S.A." by Dawoud Bey. The book with Bartleby is mentioned by Hernan Diaz. Wait, the question says "praised by the chef who opened Red Rooster." That would be Marcus, but the book in question is "Bartleby..." but Hernan is the one who wrote about it. Wait, the question might be a trick. Wait, the question says the chef (Marcus) praises the book. But the article doesn't mention Marcus praising Melville. Wait, Hernan Diaz wrote about Bartleby. The question is asking for the book that the chef (Marcus) praises. Since Marcus didn't mention it, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again. The article's section on Marcus Samuelsson says he mentions "Go Tell It on the Mountain" and others, but the book with Bartleby is from Hernan's section. So the question might be incorrect, but according to the text, the answer would be "Bartleby, the Scrivener" even if the chef didn't mention it. Wait, the question says "praised by the chef who opened Red Rooster." Since the chef didn't mention it, the answer is N/A. Wait, but the article says Hernan Diaz discusses it, so maybe the question has a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to Hernan, but the question specifies the chef (Marcus). So the correct answer would be N/A. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, the question says "the chef who opened Red Rooster" is Marcus. The book he praises that has the character is not mentioned in his section. Therefore, the answer is N/A. But wait, the question might be mixing authors. Wait, the question says "the book that the chef... praises" but Marcus didn't mention that book. Therefore, the answer is N/A. Wait, but Hernan Diaz is the one who mentioned Bartleby, so perhaps the question is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I missed something. Let me recheck. Marcus's section: he mentions "Go Tell It on the Mountain" and "Harlem, U.S.A." by Dawoud Bey. The book with Bartleby is in Hernan's section. So the answer should be N/A. But the question is asking for the title of the book praised by the chef, which Marcus didn't mention. So answer N/A? Or maybe the question is wrong, but I have to go with the text. Therefore, answer N/A.

Wait, but the question says "the chef who opened Red Rooster" (Marcus) and the book he praises. Since he didn't mention Bartleby, the answer is N/A. But maybe I missed it. Let me recheck Marcus's section again. Marcus Samuelsson's section: he mentions "Go Tell It on the Mountain" by James Baldwin and "Harlem, U.S.A." by Dawoud Bey. No mention of Melville or Bartleby. So the answer is N/A. But the question might be referring to Hernan's section, but the question specifies the chef. So answer N/A.

Wait, the question is phrased as "the book, praised by the chef who opened Red Rooster, that features a character who 'would prefer not to'..." Since the chef didn't praise that book, the answer must be N/A. So I think the correct answer is N/A here. But let me check again. Wait, the user might have a mistake in the question, but I have to follow strictly.

7. **Question 7:** The author who admires "Time and Again" is Dan Gutman. The book mentioned with star-crossed teens is "Camilla Dickinson" by Madeleine L'Engle. The landmark is Central Park, since the book is set there. The question asks for the NYC landmark where the book was set, which is Central Park. The answer is Central Park.

8. **Question 8:** The author mentioned in connection with "Brightness Falls" is Jennifer Egan. She mentions Jay McInerney's "Brightness Falls," which includes a character Jeff Pierce. The book set in 1930s Harlem that affected Marcus Samuelsson is "Go Tell It on the Mountain" by James Baldwin. The question asks for the Pulitzer winner, which is Baldwin, but the question says "Pulitzer Prize-winning author" connected to "Brightness Falls." Wait, the article says Jennifer Egan mentions "Brightness Falls" by Jay McInerney. The question is asking which Pulitzer winner wrote the Harlem book. James Baldwin won a Pulitzer for "Go Tell It on the Mountain"? Wait, James Baldwin didn't win a Pulitzer for that. The article says Jennifer Egan mentions "Brightness Falls," but the Harlem book is by Baldwin, who didn't win the Pulitzer for that. Wait, maybe the question is referring to another author. Let me check. The question says "mentioned in connection with 'Brightness Falls,' wrote a book set in 1930s Harlem..." The connection is that Jennifer Egan mentions "Brightness Falls," and the Harlem book is by Baldwin. But the question asks for the Pulitzer winner. Since Baldwin didn't win for that book, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is mixing up. Wait, the question says "Pulitzer Prize-winning author" who wrote the Harlem book. James Baldwin didn't win a Pulitzer for "Go Tell It on the Mountain." So the answer is N/A? Or maybe the question refers to another author. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "James Baldwin" even if he didn't win it for that specific book. The question says "Pulitzer Prize-winning author," so if Baldwin won a Pulitzer in his career, then yes. But "Go Tell It on the Mountain" didn't win. Baldwin won the National Book Award, not Pulitzer. So the answer is N/A. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the author of "Brightness Falls," which is Jay McInerney, but he didn't win a Pulitzer. The question is confusing. Wait, the question says the author is mentioned in connection with "Brightness Falls" (so Jennifer Egan mentions McInerney) and the author of the Harlem book. The Harlem book is by Baldwin, who is not Pulitzer-winning for that. So answer N/A.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The article says Jennifer Egan mentions "Brightness Falls" by Jay McInerney. The question is asking for the Pulitzer winner who wrote the Harlem book. Since the Harlem book is by James Baldwin, and he didn't win a Pulitzer for it, the answer is N/A. But the question might have a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "James Baldwin" even without Pulitzer for that book. But the question specifies the author must be a Pulitzer winner. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The author of "One Last Stop" is Casey McQuiston. She mentions Dawoud Bey's "Harlem, U.S.A." The photographer is Dawoud Bey. The book is "Harlem, U.S.A." by him. So the answer is "Harlem, U.S.A."

10. **Question 10:** The author of "Disgraced" is Ayad Akhtar. The question asks for a play by him inspired by a book about siblings hiding in the Met. The book mentioned is "From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler" by E.L. Konigsburg. The play is "Disgraced"? No, the book's premise inspired his novels, but the question is about a play. Wait, the article says Ayad Akhtar wrote "Homeland Elegies" and plays like "Disgraced." The book "Mixed-Up Files" inspired Dan Gutman's novels, not Akhtar's plays. The question might be a mix-up. Wait, the question says "play by the author of 'Disgraced'... inspired by a book about siblings..." The author is Akhtar, but his plays are "Disgraced," "Junk," etc. The book about siblings in the Met is "Mixed-Up Files," which inspired Dan Gutman. So the question is incorrect, so answer N/A. Wait, but the question says "the author of 'Disgraced,' who found Saul Bellow's depiction..." The author is Ayad Akhtar. The book about siblings is Konigsburg's, which inspired Dan Gutman's novels. The question is asking for a play by Akhtar inspired by that book, which doesn't exist. So answer N/A.

Wait, maybe the question is mixing up authors. The book in question is "Mixed-Up Files," which Dan Gutman says inspired his novels. The question says the play by Akhtar was inspired by it. Since Akhtar didn't write a play about that, answer N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The author who depicted the 1990s publishing milieu in "Brightness Falls" is Jay McInerney. The character Jeff Pierce's success mirrors a real-life Pulitzer winner mentioned elsewhere. The article mentions Jennifer Egan's "A Visit From the Goon Squad" won the Pulitzer. Jeff's success (publishing a book of stories about his family) mirrors Egan's career? Or maybe another author. Wait, the article says Jeff published a collection of stories about his family, which made him famous. The real-life Pulitzer winner mentioned is Jennifer Egan for "Goon Squad." So the answer is Jennifer Egan.

12. **Question 12:** The Brooklyn Heights building connecting Hernan Diaz's residence, Truman Capote's essay, and the bathhouse. Hernan mentions 7 Middagh Street (Auden's house), Truman's "A House on the Heights," and the bathhouse Man's Country. The bathhouse was at The Pierrepont Hotel. The specific building is The Pierrepont Hotel, but the question asks for the specific building that is a nexus. The essay's house is Truman's on Willow Street. The bathhouse was at The Pierrepont. Hernan's residence is at 7 Middagh? Or across from Miller's. The question asks for the specific building that connects all three. The bathhouse was at The Pierrepont Hotel. So answer: The Pierrepont Hotel.

13. **Question 13:** Dan Gutman's sanctuary is the Great Hill in Central Park, which is also the setting for "From the Mixed-Up Files..." where the kids hide. The answer is Great Hill.
