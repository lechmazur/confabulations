Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the given article. Let me read through each question carefully and check the article for answers.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about a percentage increase in PM2.5 levels from Reid's research. The article mentions that PM2.5 can linger, but I don't see a specific percentage. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The homeowner with two hoses is Matthew Craig. The article says he used two garden hoses. The part about insurance not acknowledging damage is from Reid's comments. Since the question links the hoses to the insurance part, but the hoses are just part of his effort, the answer is 2.

3. **Question 3**: Kamala Harris toured Pacific Palisades, which is the neighborhood mentioned. The move in some states about insurance is linked to Reid's research. So the answer is Pacific Palisades.

4. **Question 4**: The person talking about N-95 masks and air quality is Dr. Yifang Zhu, who is a professor at UCLA in environmental health. So her profession is environmental health professor.

5. **Question 5**: The health conditions mentioned are asthma or respiratory/heart conditions. The question asks for the one alongside pregnancy. The answer is asthma or underlying respiratory or heart conditions. Since they list "asthma or underlying respiratory or heart conditions" together, I can pick "asthma" or the full phrase. The exact wording in the article is "people who are pregnant or who have asthma or underlying respiratory or heart conditions", so the answer is asthma.

6. **Question 6**: The article says California's insurance regulator wants carriers to pay full limits without requiring itemization. The action is wanting them to pay without itemizing. So the answer is wants insurance carriers to pay full policy limits without requiring victims to itemize every object.

7. **Question 7**: The pollutant not captured by AQI is volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The article mentions VOCs cause headaches, etc., and AQI doesn't capture them. So the answer is volatile organic compounds.

8. **Question 8**: The resident with chest pain is Matthew Craig, but the article doesn't say he's seeking medical attention. It says he and his family should seek help if they have symptoms, but it's hypothetical. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The article mentions a move in some states to force insurance companies, but doesn't name a specific legislative act. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: No mention of a pharmaceutical company partnering with UCLA. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: No exact AQI number given. N/A.

12. **Question 12**: No specific brand of air purifier is mentioned. The article says "activated carbon filters" but no brand. N/A.

13. **Question 13**: The article says "some states" but doesn't specify how many. So N/A.

14. **Question 14**: No federal grant program mentioned for lead pipes. N/A.

15. **Question 15**: No hospital named in collaboration with Kamala Harris. N/A.

16. **Question 16**: The article doesn't give a chemical formula for carcinogens from plastics. N/A.

17. **Question 17**: No nonprofit mentioned distributing HEPA filters. N/A.

18. **Question 18**: The study by Reid isn't cited with a journal name. N/A.

I need to make sure each answer is strictly from the text. Let me double-check each one quickly.
