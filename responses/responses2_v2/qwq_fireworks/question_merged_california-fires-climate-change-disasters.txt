Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and don't infer anything beyond what's written.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which California city had the most devastating mudslides in January 2024 following the LA wildfires. The article mentions Montecito in 2018, but the current fires are in 2024. Since the article says "in 2018, the wealthy enclave of Montecito, Calif., just north of Los Angeles, was devastated by mudslides after torrential downpours fell on hills that had recently burned," but the question is about 2024. The text doesn't mention a 2024 mudslide location, so answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Pilgrims died in Saudi Arabia during 2024 heat. The article states "pilgrims dying as temperatures soared in Saudi Arabia" but doesn't specify numbers. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Governor Newsom's primary factor in response to Trump's criticism. The article says Trump blamed Newsom for water shortages due to fish protections. The article doesn't state Newsom's response, so N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Mountain community in Appalachia hit by Hurricane Milton. The article mentions "Cyclones in Appalachia, where Hurricanes Helene and Milton shocked the country when they tore through mountain communities in October." It doesn't name specific communities, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Percentage of $100B losses from residential damage. The article says "losses could top $100 billion, according to AccuWeather" but doesn't break down percentages. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Hours for Team Rubicon's response. The article mentions Art delaCruz's house is safe, and he's preparing volunteers, but no time frame. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Wind speed in Altadena. The Santa Ana winds were "gusting at more than 100 mph, as fierce as a Category 2 Hurricane." But the question asks for measured speed in Altadena specifically. The article doesn't specify Altadena's exact speed, so N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Emergency protocol Kamala Harris praised. The article says she toured damage but didn't mention praising any specific protocol. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Temperature degrees above average. The article mentions "Temperatures in the region have also been higher than normal" but no exact degrees. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Acreage of vegetation growth from previous winter's rain. The article says "Southern California got huge amounts of rain that led to extensive vegetation growth" but no specific acreage. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Projected monetary figure for fires. The article states "losses could top $100 billion," so answer $100 billion.

12. **Question 12:** Political figure linking water shortages to fish protections. The article says Trump blamed Newsom for water shortages due to fish protections. Answer: Donald J. Trump.

13. **Question 13:** Hottest year on record. The article says "2024 was the hottest year in recorded history." Answer: 2024.

14. **Question 14:** Meteorological phenomenon not linked to climate change. The Santa Ana winds can't be directly linked to climate change. Answer: Santa Ana winds.

15. **Question 15:** Factor from last winter's weather providing fuel. The article states the previous winter's rain led to vegetation growth, which dried out. Answer: vegetation growth.

16. **Question 16:** Natural disaster in Appalachia in October. The hurricanes Helene and Milton hit mountain communities. The question specifies October, which matches. Answer: Hurricanes Helene and Milton.

17. **Question 17:** Physical property of warmer air. The article quotes delaCruz: "Warmer air holds more water." Answer: holds more water.

18. **Question 18:** Business leader defending slower climate change. Elon Musk said "climate change risk is real, just much slower..." Answer: Elon Musk.

19. **Question 19:** Subsequent hazard after rainfall. The article mentions mudslides like Montecito 2018, so debris flows. Answer: debris flows.
