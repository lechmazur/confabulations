Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I'll go through each question and check the article for the answer. If I can't find it, I'll put N/A. Let me start with the first question.

1. Which former Today show host called Hoda Kotb during the farewell episode to reminisce about their shared experiences covering breaking news stories?

Hmm, the article mentions guests like Simone Biles and Oprah Winfrey, but I don't see any former host reminiscing about breaking news. The video tribute from Savannah Guthrie and others is mentioned, but the question is about a former host. The article says Matt Lauer was fired but didn't get to say farewell. Ann Curry left in 2012 but her quote is included. Maybe no one from the former hosts did that, so N/A?

2. How many consecutive quarters did Today's ratings exceed Good Morning America before Hoda Kotb announced her departure?

The article says "the show has bested its rival, 'Good Morning America,' in total viewers and all the key ratings demographics for 10 consecutive weeks." Weeks, not quarters. So quarters aren't mentioned. Answer N/A.

3. What song did Hoda Kotb perform as a duet with Kermit the Frog during her final broadcast?

The article says Kermit sang "Rainbow Connection," which Hoda sings to her daughters. It says she mouthed the words but didn't say she performed a duet. Wait, the article says Kermit began serenading her. So she didn't perform a duet, just listened. So maybe N/A? Or the song is "Rainbow Connection." Wait the question says "perform as a duet," but the article says Kermit sang it and she mouthed words. Maybe she didn't perform, so answer N/A? Or the song is the answer regardless. The question is about the song, so "Rainbow Connection".

4. Which media executive arranged for all the surprise celebrity guests to appear on Hoda's farewell show?

The article doesn't mention who arranged the guests. It just lists the guests like Simone Biles, Oprah, etc. So N/A.

5. What was the total viewership increase percentage that Today achieved during the "Hoda-bration" week compared to their regular programming?

No percentage numbers are given in the article. It just says the week was called a "Hoda-bration" and mentions the show's ratings success over 10 weeks, but no specific percentage increase. So N/A.

6. Who will take over Hoda Kotb's position alongside Jenna Bush Hager in the 10 a.m. hour segment?

The article says Craig Melvin will replace her. The 10 a.m. hour is with Jenna, so Craig Melvin is the answer.

7. What personal story did Simone Biles share about how Hoda Kotb's coverage influenced her Olympic journey?

The article mentions Simone Biles was a guest but doesn't say she shared a personal story about Hoda's coverage. It only says she thanked Hoda for support. So N/A.

8. Which network executive made the decision to pause coverage of Trump's sentencing to focus entirely on Hoda's farewell?

The article states that the big stories like Trump's sentencing were put on pause, but doesn't mention who made that decision. So N/A.

9. What was the length of the video tribute package featuring memorable moments from Hoda's 26-year career at NBC?

No mention of the video's length. N/A.

10. How many of Hoda Kotb's former co-anchors returned to the studio for her final broadcast?

The article lists some guests like Kathie Lee Gifford, Oprah, Gayle King, Jimmy Fallon, Jamie Lee Curtis. But former co-anchors? Savannah Guthrie is her colleague, but not a former co-anchor. Ann Curry and Matt Lauer left, but it's not stated if they came. The article mentions Ann Curry's past exit quote, but she wasn't present. So maybe only some like Kathie Lee (former co-anchor?)? The article says "special guests including Simone Biles and Oprah Winfrey, offered tributes" but not sure about former co-anchors. The answer might be N/A because not specified.

11. In the farewell celebration, which colleague did Hoda Kotb refer to with a culinary metaphor, calling him the "secret sauce" of the show?

The article says she told Carson Daly he was the "secret sauce". So Carson Daly.

12. Which well-known figure, famed for groundbreaking television work, was honored with a heartfelt tribute alongside the numerous celebratory messages during Hoda Kotb’s final Today episode?

Ann Curry was mentioned as a groundbreaker but left in 2012. The article mentions Oprah Winfrey and others, but the question is about someone honored alongside Hoda. Maybe Ann Curry isn't there. The article says Hoda is the one being honored, so maybe N/A? Or perhaps someone else like Kathie Lee? The article doesn't mention a specific figure besides Hoda being honored. So N/A.

13. During the send-off, which guest merged a beloved family ritual of Hoda Kotb with a performance by singing a tune associated with a famous Muppet, thereby linking personal and professional legacies?

Kermit sang "Rainbow Connection," which she sings to her daughters. So Kermit the Frog, but he's a Muppet, not a guest. The guest who did it would be Kermit, but the question says "guest," so maybe N/A? Wait the article says Kermit popped up, so maybe it's Kermit, but he's a Muppet, not a human guest. The question might be expecting Kermit, but since the article mentions Kermit as the one performing, maybe the answer is Kermit the Frog. Wait the question says "guest," and Kermit is a guest. The article says "special guests, including Simone Biles and Oprah Winfrey, offered tributes... Kermit the Frog then popped above the couch..." So Kermit is a guest. So answer Kermit the Frog.

14. Reflecting on longstanding relationships, which co-host was repeatedly described in emotional farewell comments as "my person" by Hoda Kotb during her final moments on air?

The article says she told Savannah Guthrie, "My God, you're my person, you're my person." So Savannah Guthrie.

15. Considering the network’s rating success, how many consecutive weeks did Today lead its rival over critical demographics as mentioned during the farewell broadcast?

The article states "10 consecutive weeks" so 10.

16. Across the farewell messages and nostalgic recollections, over how many years did Hoda Kotb build her career at NBC as highlighted during her send-off?

The article says she's been part of the show for 17 years, but her career at NBC is 26 years. The question says "build her career at NBC" so 26.

17. In her departure announcement mentioned in the article, which personal milestone did Hoda Kotb cite as prompting her decision to step down from her longtime role?

Her 60th birthday.

18. Following Hoda Kotb’s departure, which colleague was named as her successor to continue anchoring the Tomorrow show’s legacy amid the celebratory tribute?

Wait the article says Craig Melvin will replace her. The question mentions "Tomorrow show" but the article says "Today" show. Maybe a typo? The article says "Today" so answer Craig Melvin.

19. During the intimate on-air exchange, which prominent athlete, known for her prowess, expressed gratitude towards Hoda Kotb by emphasizing their mutual support?

Simone Biles: "You showed up and supported me." So Simone Biles.

20. In contrast to the graceful farewell observed for Hoda Kotb, which former anchor—whose exit was marred by scandal and lacked a good-bye—was mentioned as an example of an abrupt departure?

Matt Lauer, who was fired after sexual misconduct accusations and didn't get to say farewell.
