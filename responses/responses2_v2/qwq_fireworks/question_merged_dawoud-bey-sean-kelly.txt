Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each question exactly as asked. Let's go step by step.

1. **Question 1**: The duration of the original unedited footage before slowing down. The article says the video is "10 minutes of black-and-white footage" but doesn't mention the original length. It mentions slow-motion but doesn't specify the original duration. So, N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The pioneering Black photographer influencing Bey's technique. The article mentions Ansel Adams and Edward Weston as pioneers of American photography whose style Bey's prints evoke. But it doesn't name a Black photographer. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Number of slave markets documented. The article states the trail extends through Richmond's markets but doesn't specify the count. Answer N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Petzval lens manufacturing date. The lens is described as "a century-old Petzval lens." If current year is 2023 (from the VMFA show in 2023), a century-old would be around 1923. But the article doesn't give the exact date, just "century-old." Since the exact year isn't provided, N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Steadicam height. The article says "at an adult's head-height." No specific feet measurement given. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Botanist who helped identify plants. The article doesn't mention any botanist assisting Bey. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Soundtrack's running time. The article says the video is 10 minutes, but the soundtrack's duration isn't specified. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Bird species in the audio. The article mentions birdcalls but not the number of species. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Largest photo dimensions. The prints are "almost a yard across." A yard is 36 inches, but the height isn't given. The question asks for dimensions in inches, but only width is mentioned. So N/A unless assuming square, but the text doesn't say. Answer N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Month in 1800 when European artists documented the trail. The article refers to "Europe's artistic culture, circa 1800," but no specific month. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Title of the video with Steadicam and Petzval lens. The video is titled "350,000." The question's description matches that. So "350,000".

12. **Question 12**: Numerical value linked to enslaved people in Richmond. The video is titled "350,000," which is the estimate. So 350,000.

13. **Question 13**: First mentioned photographer with velvety blacks. The article says "Ansel Adams and Edward Weston and other pioneers." Adams is first. So Ansel Adams.

14. **Question 14**: First sound in the audio collage. The soundtrack starts with "random footfalls and birdcalls" so footfalls.

15. **Question 15**: Hymn line for the journey. The quoted hymn ends with "Stony the road we trod/Bitter the chastening rod." The title comes from that line. So "Stony the road we trod/Bitter the chastening rod."

16. **Question 16**: Historical use of Petzval lens. The article says it was used for "dream sequences in silent movies." So "dream sequences in silent movies."

17. **Question 17**: Recording method for the video. The article mentions "single take, without edits" and "life scale." The answer is "single take, uncut, continuous shot at life scale" but the question asks for the method's name. The article says "single take, without edits, by a Steadicam held at an adult's head-height." The main technique is "uninterrupted, life-scale Steadicam shot" but the exact term used is "single take." However, the question specifies "recording method characterized by an uncut, continuous shot at life scale" so the answer is "single take."

Wait, the question says "recording method—characterized by an uncut, continuous shot at life scale—is identified as the main technique". The article says "captured in a single take, without edits, by a Steadicam..." So the term is "single take." The answer should be "single take."

18. **Question 18**: Spatial feature reinforcing immersion. The video's screen "reaches almost to its high ceiling." The description mentions the screen is "bisects a big space and reaches almost to its high ceiling." The spatial feature is the screen's size and placement. The answer is "two-sided video projection" or the screen's physical setup. Wait, the question says "spatial feature... noted for reinforcing the viewer’s physical immersion into the scale of the slave trail?" The article says "the screen reaches almost to its high ceiling" so the answer is "a screen that reaches almost to the high ceiling."

19. **Question 19**: Art institution with 'A Turn to the Cosmos'. The article's last paragraph mentions "Lorna Simpson's show at Hauser & Wirth in Chelsea." So Hauser & Wirth.
