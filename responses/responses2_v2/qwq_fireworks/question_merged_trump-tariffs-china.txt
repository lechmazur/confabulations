merged_trump-tariffs-china.txt
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the provided article.

1. **Which U.S. industries were directly impacted by retaliatory tariffs from China following Trump's February 1st announcement?**  
   The article mentions that Trump's new tariffs would result in retaliatory action against U.S. industries. However, it doesn't specify which industries. The only industries mentioned as affected by prior tariffs are those under Biden (electric vehicles, solar cells, etc.), but not the retaliatory ones from China's side. So answer N/A.

2. **How many billions of dollars in additional farm product purchases did Scott Bessent specify?**  
   The text says Bessent plans to press China to buy U.S. farm products as promised and to purchase additional products to make up for past shortfalls. However, no specific dollar amount is given. Answer N/A.

3. **What percentage increase in inflation did economists predict?**  
   Economists warned a trade war could cause inflation to rebound but didn't specify a percentage. "Rebound" is vague, so N/A.

4. **Which Canadian provinces were identified as transit routes?**  
   The article states Canada and Mexico as countries where fentanyl is sent, but no provinces or states are named. Answer N/A.

5. **Total value of Chinese electric vehicles affected by Biden's tariffs?**  
   The article mentions Biden imposed levies on Chinese electric vehicles, but the total monetary value isn't specified. N/A.

6. **What agreement did Xi and Trump make on fentanyl?**  
   They discussed fentanyl but there's no mention of a new agreement. The 2020 agreement unraveled. So N/A.

7. **Days given to China to comply before tariffs?**  
   The article doesn't mention a specific deadline. The tariffs are set for Feb 1, but compliance timeframe isn't stated. N/A.

8. **Role of Scott Bessent in 2020 agreement?**  
   Bessent is Trump's Treasury pick, but his role in the 2020 deal isn't mentioned. N/A.

9. **Mexican border states as entry points?**  
   Mexico is named as a transit country, but specific states aren't listed. N/A.

10. **Percentage of farm purchases China completed under 2020 agreement?**  
    The article states China failed to live up to agreements, including buying farm products, but no percentage is given. N/A.

11. **Percentage of tariff attributed to illegal immigration?**  
    Trump mentioned fentanyl and illegal immigrants as reasons for tariffs on Canada/Mexico. The 10% on China is for fentanyl. The question asks if part of the tariff was due to immigration, but the percentage isn't split. N/A.

12. **New trade deal finalized after pandemic?**  
    The article says relations unraveled during the pandemic and mentions the 2020 agreement, but no new deal after that is mentioned. N/A.

13. **Other product Biden added tariffs on?**  
    Biden imposed levies on electric vehicles, solar cells, semiconductors, batteries. The article says "additional levies on those and others?" Wait, the article says "imposed additional levies on Chinese electric vehicles, solar cells, semiconductors and advanced batteries." No other products listed. So N/A.

14. **Days after speech Trump signed the executive order?**  
    Trump gave a speech on Tuesday, signed the order on Monday. Wait, the article says "Mr. Trump signed an executive order on Monday directing various agencies..." The speech was on Tuesday? Wait, the article says: "President Trump said on Tuesday that he intended to impose..." and "signed an executive order on Monday". Wait, that can't be. Wait, the article says the tariff announcement was on Tuesday, and the executive order was signed on Monday. So the order was signed before the speech. The question asks how many days after his speech he signed it. Since the order was signed on Monday before the Tuesday speech, it would be -1 day, but since days can't be negative, maybe the dates are mixed. The article might have a typo? Or perhaps the executive order was signed the day after the announcement. Wait, the article says: "Mr. Trump said on Tuesday that he intended to impose a 10 percent tariff... Speaking at the White House, Mr. Trump said..." Then "Mr. Trump signed an executive order on Monday..." Wait, maybe the order was signed the day before the Tuesday speech. The question is how many days after the speech, which would be negative, but since that's impossible, the answer is N/A because the timeline isn't clear. Alternatively, maybe the order was signed the next day? The article isn't clear on the exact days. So N/A.

15. **Action Mao Ning said China would take?**  
    "We will safeguard our interests" is the response, so answer "safeguard its interests".

16. **Role of Scott Bessent when he stated about farm products?**  
    He is Trump's pick to be Treasury secretary. The question asks his role at the time of the statement, which was during his confirmation hearing. So his role was Treasury secretary nominee.

17. **Primary focus of limited trade pact with China before 2020?**  
    The limited pact was to reward American farmers. So the focus was on U.S. farm products.

18. **City where Alan Rappeport reported from?**  
    The article says Rappeport is based in Washington, and the report is from there. The article's byline says "Reporting from Washington".

19. **Mechanism other than tariffs to address fentanyl?**  
    The article mentions the executive order directing agencies to examine flows of migrants and drugs, but no specific mechanism other than tariffs is stated. N/A.

20. **Original tariff percentage on Canada/Mexico before 25%?**  
    The question is about the initial intended percentage. The article says Trump "planned to impose a 25 percent duty on imports from Canada and Mexico", so no prior percentage is mentioned. Wait, the question asks the original percentage before settling on 25. But the article says the 25% was his plan, so perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, let me check again: The article states "Mr. Trump said on Monday that he planned to impose a 25 percent duty on imports from Canada and Mexico as punishment for allowing fentanyl and illegal immigrants to cross into the United States." So the 25% was the original plan, so there's no prior percentage mentioned. Hence N/A.
