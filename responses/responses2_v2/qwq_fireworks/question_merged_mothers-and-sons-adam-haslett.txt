Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by going through each question and see what the article says.

1. **Question 1:** How does Clare’s role as co-founder of the Vermont women’s retreat directly conflict with Ann’s approach to reconciling with Peter during his mental health crisis?

Looking at the article, it mentions that Ann is living at the retreat she co-founded with Clare. The retreat's focus is on listening to women's stories. However, the article states that Ann has been unable to respond to Peter's angst. The conflict might be that Ann is focused on the retreat's work (with women) instead of her son. But does the article explicitly say there's a direct conflict between Clare's role and Ann's approach? The article says Ann is an escapee from traditional roles and that the retreat's specialty is listening to women. Since Clare is co-founder, maybe her role in the retreat's mission (focusing on women) distracts Ann from reconciling with Peter. But the article says "Ann has been unable to respond to Peter's obvious angst," possibly due to her being occupied with the retreat's work. So maybe the conflict is that the retreat's focus on women's issues (Clare's role as co-founder) means Ann is not present for Peter. The answer might be that Ann's commitment to the retreat (with Clare) takes priority over reconciling with Peter. The question asks how Clare's role directly conflicts with Ann's approach. Since Clare is a co-founder, maybe Ann's involvement with the retreat (due to Clare) takes her focus away. So answer: N/A? Wait, the article says Ann is at the retreat, but does it say Clare's role conflicts with Ann's approach? The article says Ann's inability to respond to Peter's angst is part of their estrangement. But the question is about how Clare's role as co-founder directly conflicts with Ann's approach. Maybe the retreat's focus on women's issues (which Clare co-founded) means Ann is focused there rather than on Peter. So maybe the answer is that Ann's focus on the retreat (with Clare) conflicts with her ability to reconcile. But the question is specifically about Clare's role conflicting. Since the retreat is co-founded by Ann and Clare, their shared role might mean Ann is too involved there. The article says Ann is "a former priest and a widow -- also an escapee, from the roles of wife and heterosexual -- who has long been praised for her openness to others. Listening, with patience and restraint, to women speaking about their lives is the retreat's specialty." So Ann's role there might mean she's more focused on others' stories rather than her son's. But the question is about Clare's role conflicting. Since Clare is a co-founder, perhaps their shared commitment to the retreat's mission (women's retreat) distracts Ann from her son. However, the article doesn't explicitly state that Clare's role is in conflict. The article just states that Ann is at the retreat. Maybe the answer is N/A because there's no direct conflict mentioned between Clare's role and Ann's approach. Hmm, tricky. The question might be expecting an answer like "Ann's focus on the retreat (co-founded with Clare) distracts her from Peter," but the article says Ann's inability to respond is part of their estrangement. The article doesn't explicitly say Clare's role is the reason. So maybe the answer is N/A.

Wait, the article says "Ann has been unable to respond to Peter's obvious angst." The retreat is her current place, so maybe her role there (as co-founder) keeps her from reconciling. But the question is about Clare's role conflicting with Ann's approach. Since Clare is a co-founder, perhaps their shared role in the retreat's mission (focusing on women) means Ann is too busy with that, hence conflicting. But the article doesn't state that Clare's role is the reason for Ann's inability. So maybe the answer is N/A. I'll note that and move on, but maybe I'm missing something.

2. **Question 2:** What financial risk-taking behavior from Doug’s past in "Union Atlantic" is mirrored in Peter’s professional decisions while handling Vasel Marku’s asylum case?

The article mentions Doug from "Union Atlantic" as a banker taking "insane risks in the early noughts" related to a military-civilian disaster in 1988. The question is about Peter's professional decisions mirroring that. Peter is an asylum lawyer. The article says he "subsists on casual sex" and his job is to help clients tell their stories. The article also states Peter is forced to take on Vasel's case, which stirs memories. It says "there's a lot of violence," but I don't see any financial risk-taking by Peter. Maybe the risk is taking on a case related to his own past (since Vasel's case is similar to Peter's own experience with Jared), which could be a personal risk. But the question is about financial risk-taking. The article doesn't mention Peter taking financial risks. The mirrored behavior would be risk-taking in professional decisions, but maybe Peter is taking a risk by handling a case related to his past, leading to his crisis. However, the question specifies financial risk-taking, like Doug's banking risks. Since Peter is a lawyer, maybe he's taking on a high-stakes case, but the article doesn't say that. The answer might be N/A.

Wait, the article says "Peter is a New York asylum lawyer... forced to take on Vasel Marku, a 21-year-old Albanian." Maybe "forced to take on" implies he's taking a case he shouldn't, but that's not financial. The financial risk in Doug's case was banking. Since the question is about financial risk-taking mirrored in Peter's decisions, but Peter isn't involved in finance, maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm.

3. **Question 3:** How does the structure of "Mothers and Sons" incorporate alternating timelines between Peter’s asylum cases and Ann’s experiences during the 1990s feminist movement in Vermont?

The article mentions that Haslett has wisely concentrated on Peter and Ann's perspectives. The structure is about their narratives. The article says "the narratives people tell to explain themselves the subject of the novel itself." It also mentions that Peter's job involves listening to clients' stories. Ann is in Vermont at the retreat, which was co-founded in the 1990s? The article says Ann is in Vermont now, but the retreat's founding time isn't specified. The question asks about alternating timelines between Peter's cases and Ann's experiences during the 1990s. The article states that "the past remains an accurate predictor of future ills," implying that past events are revisited. However, the article doesn't explicitly mention alternating timelines between Peter's asylum cases and Ann's 1990s experiences. The article mentions that Ann's experiences include her past as a former priest and widow, but the feminist movement timing isn't clear. The answer might be N/A because the structure's specific alternating timelines between the two timelines aren't detailed.

4. **Question 4:** Considering the narrative techniques in Haslett's work, which character's professional engagement with immigration cases and handling of violent past narratives becomes interwoven with a triggering personal crisis involving a 21‐year‐old Albanian?

The article states Peter is an asylum lawyer handling Vasel's case, which stirs his memories of Jared. Vasel is 21-year-old Albanian. So Peter's professional work (immigration cases) and handling Vasel's violent story (similar to his own past) triggers his crisis. The answer is Peter Fischer.

5. **Question 5:** In the review’s exploration of estranged family dynamics, which individual is described as having co-founded a remote women's retreat in Vermont with Clare while escaping conventional roles?

Ann is described as co-founder with Clare of the retreat, and she's an escapee from roles of wife and heterosexual. So answer: Ann.

6. **Question 6:** Which narrative element in Mothers and Sons is used to introduce the haunting event that connects Peter Fischer, his mother Ann, and a boy named Jared?

The article mentions the prologue informs us about Peter's haunting by an event involving Jared and his mother. The narrative element is the prologue. So answer: prologue.

7. **Question 7:** Which enduring narrative focus, underscored by recurring references to bygone tragedies like dead men and shattered familial roles, shapes Haslett's characters’ reliance on retrospective self‐explanations?

The article says "Haslett is a writer in thrall to retrospect" and mentions dead men (fathers), widows, children left behind, etc. The enduring focus is on the past or retrospect. The answer is the past (or retrospect), but the question asks for the focus term. The article says "back story" and "retrospect." The exact phrase might be "back story" or "retrospective self-explanations." The question asks what shapes their reliance on retrospective explanations. The answer is the past or the focus on the past. The article says "Haslett's stories are mainly back story." The enduring focus is the past or retrospection. The question might want "the past" or "retrospective narratives." The article says "the ways that our self-explanations... fail to encompass our lives" due to their focus on the past. The answer is the past (or perhaps "back story" as the term used). The question says "enduring narrative focus," so the article's term is "back story." The first paragraph says "Haslett's stories are mainly back story." So answer: back story.

8. **Question 8:** Which aspect of the author’s own training is noted as adding authenticity to Peter Fischer’s portrayal as an asylum lawyer transforming life stories into legal narratives?

The article mentions "Haslett, who has a law degree, is himself very convincing in his depiction of this work." So his law degree adds authenticity. Answer: law degree.

9. **Question 9:** In a comparison that casts shadows over familial bonds, which relationship—cited in connection with Alan Hollinghurst's work—is presented as a counterpoint to the dynamic between Peter and Ann?

The article mentions "their experience is shadowed by other mother-son relationships, including, from outside the book, the lesbian mother and gay son in Alan Hollinghurst's recent 'Our Evenings.'" So the relationship is lesbian mother and gay son. Answer: lesbian mother and gay son.

10. **Question 10:** What is the evocative phrase used by a character to describe the process of transforming lived experiences into legal narratives, reflecting an experience of disembodied closeness?

The article says Peter reflects on his job as "intimacy without intimacy." The exact phrase is "intimacy without intimacy." Answer: intimacy without intimacy.

11. **Question 11:** Which accolade associated with the contributing editor’s work is mentioned alongside the literary analysis, subtly emphasizing a politically charged context in the review?

The contributing editor is Tom Crewe, who wrote "The New Life," which won the 2023 Orwell Prize for political fiction. The accolade is Orwell Prize for political fiction. Answer: Orwell Prize for political fiction.

12. **Question 12:** Which style of narration, critiqued for inundating the reader with recollected events rather than unfolding immediate action, detracts from experiencing characters in the present?

The article says "the quantity of remembered events, all of them in the service of Haslett's main themes, undermines his argument... we tend to be told about the lives... rather than learning from their actions and speech. Constantly looking backward, we lose the pleasure... of living with them in the moment." The style is the heavy use of backstory or retrospection. The article refers to "Constantly looking backward" as the style. The exact term used might be "retrospective narration" or "reliance on remembered events." The question asks for the style's name. The article says "the past remains an accurate predictor of future ills" and "constantly looking backward." The style is "retrospective narration" or "back story-driven." The article says "the quantity of remembered events" is the problem. So the style is "reliance on remembered events" or "back story-driven narration." The answer might be "reliance on remembered events" but the article uses "constantly looking backward." The question asks for the style's name. The article says "the past remains an accurate predictor of future ills, leading characters to banal... realizations." The style is "retrospective narration" or "back story-heavy structure." The article says "constantly looking backward, we lose the pleasure... in the moment." So the style is the use of constant backstory. The answer is "back story" or "retrospective narration." The question says "style of narration," so perhaps "back story-driven narration." The article says "the quantity of remembered events, all of them in the service of Haslett's main themes, undermines... we tend to be told about the lives... rather than learning from their actions and speech. Constantly looking backward..." So the answer is "retrospective narration" or "reliance on back story." The article says "constantly looking backward" is the style. Maybe the answer is "reliance on remembered events" or "back story." The exact term in the article is "back story" as mentioned earlier. The question's answer is likely "back story" but the style is called "constantly looking backward." Hmm. The article's exact phrasing for the critique is: "the quantity of remembered events... undermines... we tend to be told about the lives... rather than learning from their actions and speech. Constantly looking backward, we lose the pleasure... in the moment." The style is "reliance on remembered events" or "back story-driven narration." The answer is "reliance on remembered events" but maybe the article's term is "back story." Alternatively, the style is called "retrospective narration." Since the question asks for the style name, and the article refers to "constantly looking backward," perhaps the answer is "retrospective narration" or "back story-driven." The article says "constantly looking backward" which is the style. The answer might be "back story-driven narration." Alternatively, the answer is "reliance on remembered events." Since the question asks for the style's name, perhaps the article uses "back story" as the term. The first paragraph says "Haslett's stories are mainly back story." So the style is "back story-driven." The answer is "back story."

13. **Question 13:** What is the monetary figure given in the book details that might mislead a reader into undervaluing the narrative depth of Haslett's latest work?

The book details mention "Little, Brown | 336 pp. | $29." The monetary figure is $29. The article says "Haslett has not escaped old problems; in some ways he has entrenched them. The past remains an accurate predictor of future ills... but the quantity of remembered events... undermines his argument..." The reviewer might suggest that despite the price, the book has issues. The figure is $29. Answer: $29.
