Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the given article. Let me start by reading through the questions and then cross-referencing each with the article content.

1. **Question 1**: The user is asking which streaming platform the creators worked on for "Rutherford Falls" before "St. Denis Medical". The article mentions that Justin Spitzer and Eric Ledgin created "St. Denis Medical" and their previous work includes "Rutherford Falls". Since "Rutherford Falls" is listed along with "Superstore" and "American Auto", I recall that "Rutherford Falls" was on NBC. Wait, the article says their previous work includes those shows, but the question is about the platform. Wait, the article doesn't specify the platforms for their previous shows. Hmm, the article says "Rutherford Falls" is one of their previous works, but the platform isn't stated here. The article mentions "St. Denis Medical" is on NBC, but the question is about where "Rutherford Falls" was. Since the article doesn't say, maybe it's not in here. So the answer would be N/A?

Wait, actually, maybe "Rutherford Falls" was on Peacock? Because the article mentions that "St. Denis Medical" is on Peacock. Wait, no, the article says "St. Denis Medical" has its first six episodes on Peacock, and returns to NBC in January. Wait, the article says "St. Denis Medical" is an NBC sitcom, so perhaps "Rutherford Falls" was also on NBC? But the question is about the streaming platform. If the article doesn't mention the platform for "Rutherford Falls", then I can't answer. The article only lists the previous works but not their platforms. So answer N/A here.

2. **Question 2**: The number of episodes before the midseason hiatus. The article says "the first six episodes are streaming on Peacock" and that Season 1 returns to NBC on Jan 14 after a short midseason break. So before the hiatus, they had already aired six episodes? Wait, the article says the first six are on Peacock, and then after the break, it returns. So the hiatus was in between the first six and the rest? The question is how many were produced before the hiatus. The article says "the first six episodes are streaming on Peacock" so that's the number before the hiatus. So answer is 6.

3. **Question 3**: Percentage increase in viewership after moving timeslots. The article doesn't mention anything about viewership numbers or timeslot changes. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Character's backstory about failed medical school attempts during the engagement ring incident. The article mentions the episode where they help a man with a ring stuck. The dialogue includes Bruce saying "Medicine isn't just science... jazz" and Matt agreeing. The article doesn't mention any backstory about failed attempts. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Medical procedure Bruce performs in Episode 5 leading to the unprintable joke. The article mentions the best joke is in Episode 5 but can't be printed. But the article doesn't specify the procedure. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Emmy nominations for first half-season. The article doesn't mention Emmy nominations. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Former "Abbott Elementary" cast member as a patient. The article doesn't mention guest appearances from that show. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Nielsen rating for premiere. The article doesn't provide Nielsen ratings. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Director of the pilot. The article doesn't mention the director. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The NBC sitcom returning on Jan 14 with mockumentary style, cozy vibe, and Alex played by Tolman. The article says "St. Denis Medical" returns on NBC on Jan 14, and describes it as a mockumentary with a cozy-endearing vibe, and Alex is played by Tolman. So the answer is "St. Denis Medical".

11. **Question 11**: The network comedy noted for avoiding ER intensity, quirky peccadilloes, and the engagement ring mishap, described as less antic than Scrubs, etc. The article describes "St. Denis Medical" as doing that, so the answer is "St. Denis Medical".

12. **Question 12**: Co-creators of the show, their previous works include Superstore, American Auto, Rutherford Falls. The article says Justin Spitzer and Eric Ledgin are the creators. So their names are the answer.

13. **Question 13**: Actor who plays the seen-it-all doctor, anchoring the realism. The article says David Alan Grier is Ron, the seen-it-all doctor, and "Tolman and Grier anchor the show's realism". So David Alan Grier.

14. **Question 14**: Character who says "Sometimes itâ€™s like jazz" during the ring incident. The article quotes Bruce saying "Medicine isn't just science... sometimes it's like jazz". So Bruce.

15. **Question 15**: Character who is an out-of-touch administrator. The article mentions Joyce, played by Wendi McLendon-Covey, as the out-of-touch administrator. So Joyce.

16. **Question 16**: The show described as rarely ha-ha funny with the best joke in Episode 5. The article refers to "St. Denis Medical" as such. So "St. Denis Medical".

17. **Question 17**: Actor providing seen-it-all perspective that grounds the show. Again, David Alan Grier as Ron is mentioned as anchoring the realism.

18. **Question 18**: Character who's a newbie nurse with ultra-religious background, enhancing quirky humor. The article says Mekki Leeper plays Matt, the newbie nurse with an ultrareligious background. So Matt.

Now, let me check each question again to make sure.

1. The creators' previous shows include Rutherford Falls, but the question is about the streaming platform they worked on for that series. The article doesn't mention where Rutherford Falls was aired or streamed. So N/A.

2. The first six episodes are on Peacock before the hiatus. The answer is 6.

3. No info on viewership percentage, so N/A.

4. No info on failed medical school attempts, so N/A.

5. No procedure mentioned, so N/A.

6. No Emmy mentions, N/A.

7. No mention of Abbott Elementary cast guest, N/A.

8. No Nielsen rating given, N/A.

9. No director of pilot mentioned, N/A.

10. The show is "St. Denis Medical".

11. Same as above, "St. Denis Medical".

12. Justin Spitzer and Eric Ledgin.

13. David Alan Grier.

14. Bruce (played by Josh Lawson).

15. Joyce (Wendi McLendon-Covey).

16. "St. Denis Medical".

17. David Alan Grier.

18. Matt (Mekki Leeper).

I think that's all. Let me ensure there are no typos in names. The article says "Bruce, the arrogant surgeon" so Bruce is the character who said the line. The question 14 asks for the character, so "Bruce".

For question 15, the role is the out-of-touch administrator, which is Joyce.

Alright, I think that's all.
