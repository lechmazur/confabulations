1. **Which Philadelphia neighborhood did Charlie Santore move to after establishing his successful illustration career near Rittenhouse Square?**  
The article mentions Charlie's studio was two blocks from Rittenhouse Square, but it doesn't say he moved elsewhere. The neighborhood Bella Vista is mentioned as his part of Philadelphia, but the question is about moving after establishing his career. Since there's no info on moving, answer N/A.

2. **How many Christmas cards did Charlie's father commission from his sons for neighborhood residents during their childhood years?**

6. **What was the total number of illustrations Charlie completed for Peter Rabbit before it became one of his bestselling works?**  
The article lists "Peter Rabbit" as one of his works but doesn't specify the number of illustrations. N/A.

8. **What was the name of the band Nicky performed with while taking a break from his visual arts career?**  
The text says he played in a band but doesn't name it. N/A.

9. **How many copies of The Night Before Christmas did Running Press initially print before it became one of Charlie's bestselling works?**

10. **What medium did Charlie's mother Nellie primarily use in her occasional artistic pursuits that influenced her sons?**  
The article says Nellie was known to draw a little but doesn't specify the medium. N/A.

11. **What medical condition led to Charles Santore's hospitalization and eventual death in August 2019?**  
The article states he felt weak and was hospitalized but doesn't mention the specific condition. N/A.

12. **Which Philadelphia public school that Charlie attended later became the institution where Joe Santore taught fine arts, based on their shared educational background in the city?**  
Charlie attended Edward Bok Technical High School. Joe teaches at New York Studio School, not a Philadelphia school. So N/A.

13. **How many completed watercolor paintings did Nicky contribute to "The Scroobious Pip" before the project was finalized, considering his father had already created three?**  
The article says Charlie had three watercolor paintings done. The total needed isn't stated, but Nicky finished the rest. The article mentions the book was completed with his contributions but doesn't specify numbers. N/A.

14. **What was the title of the first children's book illustrated by Charles Santore that established his reputation for detailed realism, preceding "The Night Before Christmas" and "Peter Rabbit"?**  
The article doesn't mention his first book. N/A.

15. **Which Philadelphia landmark designed by Henry Mercer directly inspired the architectural style of Nicky's upcoming project "The Three Witches" at Running Press?**  
The article says the project is inspired by Henry Mercer's Tile Works in Bucks County. So the answer is Henry Mercer's Tile Works.

16. **What specific type of antique furniture did Charles Santore write authoritative texts about, given his expertise in historical craftsmanship and design?**  
The article states he wrote definitive texts on Windsor chairs. So answer: Windsor chairs.

17. **Which of Charles Santore's brothers founded both the Saloon restaurant and the Free Library branch named after their father, combining family history with Philadelphia institutions?**  
The twins Bobby and Richie founded the Saloon. The library branch named after their father (Charles Santore Sr.) is mentioned, but the question is about which brother founded the Saloon and the library. Since the Saloon was founded by Bobby and Richie, and the library is named after their father, but the question's phrasing might be tricky. The answer is Bobby and Richie, but since it's a single answer, maybe N/A because the question says "brothers" but asks "which of Charles's brothers", so perhaps Bobby and Richie together. But the article says "the Saloon, a fabled Philadelphia restaurant (worth visiting for its decor alone, which was largely overseen by Charlie); and then came Joe, the contemporary artist." Wait, the article says Bobby and Richie founded the Saloon. The library branch named after their father is separate. The question asks which brother founded both the Saloon and the library. Since the library is named after their father, not founded by them, maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "the Free Library branch named after their father" was founded by the brothers? The article says "their father has a branch of the Free Library named in his honor." So the brothers didn't found the library branch, just that it's named after their father. The Saloon was founded by Bobby and Richie. So the question's phrasing is tricky. The answer is N/A because no brother founded both the Saloon and the library; the library is named after their father, not founded by the brothers. So answer N/A.

18. **What musical instrument did Nicky Santore play during his summer break from Yale, which became a point of contention with his father over artistic priorities?**  
The text says he played in a band. It doesn't specify the instrument. N/A.

19. **How many total illustrations were originally contracted between Running Press and Charles Santore for "The Scroobious Pip" before his death, given he left nine drawings incomplete?**  
The article says he had nine drawings and three watercolor paintings done, but doesn't state the total contracted. N/A.

20. **Which gallery exhibition featuring Nicky's geometric paintings led to his brief recognition in the art world before he abandoned visual art for carpentry?**  
The article mentions his work caught the attention of some gallerists but doesn't name a specific exhibition. N/A.
