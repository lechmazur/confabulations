Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and not any outside knowledge. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks which Italian city the Missonis moved their fashion shows to after being banned from Florence due to the scandalous see-through dresses. The article mentions that after the incident in Florence at Palazzo Pitti, they returned to showing in Milan. So the answer should be Milan.

2. **Question 2**: The second question is about the number of sub-brands Angela established. The text says Angela set up more than 20 sub-brands. The exact number isn't specified, but "more than 20" is mentioned. Since the question asks how many, and it's "more than 20", but they want an exact number, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "establishing more than 20 sub-brands". Since it's "more than", but the exact number isn't given, so the answer would be N/A because it's not a specific number.

3. **Question 3**: The architect who designed both the factory and the family's villa. The article states that architect Enrico Buzzi designed the factory and the house. The house is described as a "relatively modest stucco house" near the factory. The question mentions a Mediterranean-style villa, but the text doesn't specify "Mediterranean-style" for the house, just that the architect designed both. So the answer is Enrico Buzzi.

4. **Question 4**: Which American editor discovered Missoni at La Rinascente. The article says Diana Vreeland, editor of Vogue, featured them in a 1969 spread. But the question mentions "discovered" at La Rinascente. However, the text says that the first mention of La Rinascente is that five years after founding (1953 +5=1958), they were sold there. The breakthrough with Vreeland was in 1969. The question's premise might be mixing up the timeline. The article doesn't say Vreeland discovered them at La Rinascente, just that she featured them later. So the answer would be N/A because the discovery at La Rinascente isn't linked to an editor's action in the text.

5. **Question 5**: Percentage retained after Margherita took over. The article mentions that in 2018, the family sold a 41.2% stake, retaining control. So they kept 100 -41.2 =58.8%. The question is about the percentage retained after Margherita became creative director of the main line. The sale happened the same year she was named director. The answer is 58.8%, but the article says "retained control" but doesn't specify the exact percentage. Wait, it says they sold 41.2%, so they kept 58.8%. The answer should be 58.8%.

6. **Question 6**: Which Olympics did Ottavio design uniforms before meeting Rosita. The text says Ottavio was a hurdler in the 1948 Summer Olympics (when he met Rosita). Before that, he designed uniforms for the Italian team ahead of the 1952 Olympics. Wait, the article says Ottavio was a hurdler in the 1948 Olympics. Then, after meeting Rosita, they married in 1953. The text says Ottavio "graduated from athlete to designer, fashioning uniforms for the Italian team ahead of the 1952 Olympics". So the answer is 1952 Olympics.

7. **Question 7**: Annual revenue of home decor line in 1990s. The article doesn't mention any financial figures, so N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The artist who collaborated on the first runway show at Teatro Gerolamo. The text mentions Lucio Fontana, a spatial artist, assisted there. So the answer is Lucio Fontana.

9. **Question 9**: Years after marriage to first department store contract. They married in 1953, and five years after founding (1953) they were in La Rinascente by 1958. The marriage was the same year as founding, so five years after marriage would be 1958, so five years.

10. **Question 10**: Name of Rosita's boarding school on Ligurian coast. The article mentions she was sent to school on the Ligurian coast but doesn't name it. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Family member with ducktail braid and overseeing home decor. The text says Rosita Missoni continued to oversee the Missoni Home line and wore her hair in a ducktail braid. So the answer is Rosita Missoni.

12. **Question 12**: New York museum for the 1978 retrospective. The article says the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York hosted the exhibit the same year they introduced men's wear. So the answer is Whitney Museum of American Art.

13. **Question 13**: Upscale Milan store where Missoni dresses were available five years after founding. The company started in 1953, five years later is 1958. The text says "five years after the company's founding, Missoni dresses could be purchased at La Rinascente." So the answer is La Rinascente.

14. **Question 14**: Unintended feature of the dresses in Florence. The scandal was due to the see-through effect from stage lights making the thin fabric transparent. The answer is transparency or see-through.

15. **Question 15**: Ottavio's athletic role before designing patterns. He was a hurdler on the Italian team. The text says he was a hurdler in the 1948 Olympics and then designed uniforms. So his role was athlete/hurdler.

16. **Question 16**: Unconventional Milan venue with inflatable furniture. The text mentions Piscina Solari, a public pool, where models floated on inflatable furniture designed by Quasar Khanh. So the answer is Piscina Solari.

17. **Question 17**: Decade when leadership transition started. The article states that in the 1990s, the Missonis began transitioning leadership to their children, putting Vittorio and Luca in business roles and Angela as design head. So the answer is the 1990s.

18. **Question 18**: Signature design element from Rosita's early years. The article says Rosita's grandparents had colorful zigzags, which became a Missoni signature. So the answer is colorful zigzags.

19. **Question 19**: Tragic event after Ottavio's death. Ottavio died in 2013, and shortly after, their son Vittorio died in a plane crash. The article mentions "just a few months after their son Vittorio was killed in a plane crash." So the answer is Vittorio's death in a plane crash.

20. **Question 20**: Relative appointed in 2018 to lead the lower-priced line. Margherita Missoni, Angela's daughter, was named creative director of M Missoni (the lower-price label) in 2018. So the answer is Margherita Missoni.
