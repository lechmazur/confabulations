Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful and make sure each answer is directly from the text or logically inferred. Let's start with the first question.

1. The first question asks how many followers the TikTok star from Long Island had when he was a college freshman posting jokes. The article mentions Joe Mele, a 26-year-old from Long Island who started posting jokes as a college freshman and now has 30 million followers. But the question is about when he was a freshman. The article says he started then but doesn't specify his follower count at that time. So that's N/A.

2. The second question is about the projected growth of the creator economy by Goldman Sachs by the year Palette Media hired an employee for syndication. The article mentions Goldman Sachs projecting the creator economy to grow to $480 billion by 2027. Palette Media started syndication about nine months before the article, but the question links the year Palette hired to the projection. Since the projection is for 2027, but the hiring isn't tied to a specific year beyond "nine months ago" from when the article was written (which isn't given), this might be N/A. Wait, the question says "by the year Palette Media hired..." but the article says Palette hired someone nine months ago (assuming the article is current), but we don't know the exact year. So maybe N/A here as well.

3. The third question asks for the estimated U.S. ad sales including e-commerce, etc. The article states Brian Wieser estimated $8 billion excluding e-commerce, etc. So the answer would be N/A because the question includes those, but the estimate excludes them.

4. The Chinese-owned app in question is TikTok, owned by ByteDance. The article mentions this clearly. So answer is TikTok.

5. The communication method recommended is email addresses, as mentioned when creators are told to collect emails via Substack. So email addresses.

6. The major purchase advised to postpone is buying a house or car, as stated by talent agents telling stars to hit pause on those.

7. The rival network mentioned as an alternative is Instagram, specifically Instagram Reels are noted as a destination.

8. The historical comparison includes MySpace, Vine, Clubhouse, BeReal. The article explicitly mentions MySpace, so that's the answer.

9. The contractual provision is a "swapping of channels" as per the agency Shadow's contracts.

10. The governmental measure attributed to Trump is the closure of USAID, mentioned in the later part of the article under "U.S.A.I.D." section.

11. The agency chief urging to delay investments is Daniel Daks of Palette Media.

12. The projected total is $480 billion by 2027 from Goldman Sachs.

13. The law in question is the one signed by Biden in April, requiring ByteDance to sell TikTok or face a ban. The exact name isn't given, but the law is referred to as the one signed by Biden in April, so the answer is the law signed by Biden in April (but the question asks for the name? Wait the question says "what law—challenged up to the U.S. Supreme Court and signed in April—is forcing..." The article states "law, signed by President Biden in April". The name isn't provided, so the answer would be the law signed by Biden in April. Since the question asks for the name but it's not given, maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "what law... signed in April"—the answer is the law signed by Biden in April, even if the name isn't specified. The article doesn't name it beyond that, so perhaps the answer is the law signed by Biden in April. But the question might expect the name, but since it's not in the text, maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "law, signed by President Biden in April, that calls for ByteDance to sell the app to a non-Chinese company or face a ban..." So the answer is the law signed by Biden in April, but the exact name isn't provided. Since the question asks for the law's name, and it's not given, maybe N/A. Alternatively, the question might accept "the law signed by President Biden in April". But the user instructions say to answer directly from the text. Since the article refers to it as "the law" without a name, the answer would be N/A? Wait, the question says "what law—challenged up to the U.S. Supreme Court and signed in April—is forcing the Chinese-owned platform to consider a sale..." The answer is the law signed by Biden in April, but the name isn't provided. Since the question is asking for the name, and the text doesn't give it, the answer would be N/A. Wait, maybe not. The law is referred to as the one signed by Biden in April, so the answer is that law, even if unnamed. The question might expect that the answer is the law requiring sale or ban. But since the exact name isn't given, perhaps the answer is N/A. Hmm, tricky. Let me check again. The article says: "a law, signed by President Biden in April, that calls for ByteDance to sell the app to a non-Chinese company or face a ban in the United States on Jan. 19." So the law's name isn't provided, so the answer is N/A because the question asks for the name of the law, which isn't given. Wait, but the question might just want the description. The question says "what law...", so the answer is the one signed by Biden in April requiring sale or ban. Since the question allows the answer as the description, maybe the answer is the law signed by Biden in April. But the user instructions say to answer exactly from the text. Since the article doesn't name it, perhaps N/A? Or perhaps the answer is the law requiring ByteDance to sell TikTok. But the exact wording? The user might expect the answer as "the law signed by President Biden in April". Since the question is phrased as "what law...", the answer is that law, even if unnamed. So the answer is the law signed by President Biden in April. Since the user allows inferred answers, that's acceptable. So answer is the law signed by Biden in April.
