Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question is asking about Georgine Schenk's role at the coffee company before meeting Otto's father. The article mentions that Georgine was a saleswoman and store manager at Julius Meinl in Trieste. So the answer should be "saleswoman and store manager".

2. Next, how many times was Die Meistersinger revived after 1993? The article says that after his "Ring", Schenk directed Meistersinger in 1993. But there's no mention of how many times it was revived. The only info given is about Parsifal and Meistersinger being part of his work, but no numbers. So I think this is N/A because the article doesn't state the number of revivals for that specific production conducted by Levine. Wait, maybe check again. The article mentions the Met's revivals of Schenk's 16 productions became infrequent, but specifically for Meistersinger? The exact number isn't provided, so N/A.

3. The critical reception of Lepage's Ring compared to Schenk's. Alex Ross wrote that Lepage's was "the most witless and wasteful production". The article says Schenk's was "a lushly romantic and reverentially traditional staging". Ross's critique highlighted that Lepage's lacked the traditional aspects. The question asks what aspect of Schenk's was lacking in the new version. Ross's comment says Lepage's was tech-heavy and witless, so the aspect Schenk had that was missing is traditional or untrendy approach. The exact phrase might be "untrendy" from the quote by Donal Henahan, but Ross's comment says Lepage's was tech-heavy. The article states that Schenk's was "a brilliantly untrendy one" so the aspect Ross highlighted as lacking would be the traditional/untrendy approach. The question is phrased as what aspect of Schenk's was lacking in Lepage's. Wait, the question is what aspect of Schenk's earlier production did Ross highlight as lacking in the newer version. Since Ross called Lepage's "witless", perhaps the aspect Schenk's had (traditional) was what was missing. The article says Ross's review mentions Lepage's as "witless and wasteful", contrasting with Schenk's traditional approach. So the answer is "traditional staging" or "traditional approach". The exact quote from Ross doesn't specify, but the article says Schenk's was traditional and the Lepage's was tech-heavy. The question is about what was lacking in the new version that Schenk's had. The article says Schenk's was "reverentially traditional", so the answer is "traditional staging".

4. The year when the Met presented Die Walkure as the opening of the Ring cycle. The article states that in 1986, the Met inaugurated the cycle with Die Walkure as the second opera. Wait, the tetralogy's first is Rheingold, but the article says they started with Walkure as the second. Wait, the article says: "the Met inaugurated the cycle with 'Die Walkure', the second opera in the tetralogy; it was presented in full in the 1989-90 season." So the opening production of the full cycle (all four) was 1989-90. But the question is when Die Walkure was the opening production of the complete cycle. Wait, maybe I misread. The article says they started the cycle in 1986 with Walkure, which is the second in the tetralogy. But the full cycle was presented in 1989-90. The question is asking when Die Walkure was the opening of the complete cycle. Wait, no, the question says "as the opening production of the complete Der Ring des Nibelungen cycle". The article says "the Met inaugurated the cycle with 'Die Walkure', the second opera in the tetralogy". That seems contradictory because the first opera is Rheingold. Maybe the article means that the first part they did was Walkure, but the full cycle started later. The answer would be 1986, even though it's the second opera. The question is about when they presented it as the opening of the complete cycle? Hmm, perhaps the answer is 1986, even if it's not the first opera. The question might be tricky here. The article says the full cycle was in 1989-90. But the first time they started the cycle (maybe starting with Walkure?), the answer is 1986. The question's wording is a bit confusing, but according to the text, the answer is 1986.

5. The position Bogdan Roscic held. The article says Bogdan Roscic is the general director of the Vienna State Opera. So the position is "general director of the Vienna State Opera".

6. The Janacek opera that was both Schenk's debut and final at Vienna State Opera. The article states: "In 2014, half a century after his Vienna State Opera debut with Leos Janacek's 'Jenufa,' Mr. Schenk directed his final production there, of Janacek's 'The Cunning Little Vixen.'" Wait, no, the final was 'The Cunning Little Vixen', but the debut was 'Jenufa'. The question asks which opera was both the debut and final? Wait, the article says his debut was Jenufa and his final was The Cunning Little Vixen. So that's two different operas. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again: "half a century after his Vienna State Opera debut with Leos Janacek's 'Jenufa,' Mr. Schenk directed his final production there, of Janacek's 'The Cunning Little Vixen.'" So the debut was Jenufa and the final was The Cunning Little Vixen. Therefore, the answer would be N/A because they are different operas. Wait, the question says "the title of the Leos Janacek opera that marked both Otto Schenk's debut and final production..." So the same opera? The article says debut was Jenufa, final was The Cunning Little Vixen. Therefore, the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. The article says: "he directed his final production there, of Janacek's 'The Cunning Little Vixen.'" His debut was Jenufa. So they are different, so the answer is N/A. But the question says "the title of the Leos Janacek opera that marked both..." so there is no such opera. Therefore, N/A.

Wait, maybe I misread. The question says "the title of the Leos Janacek opera that marked both Otto Schenk's debut and final production at the Vienna State Opera, separated by a span of fifty years?" So the same opera? The article says debut was Jenufa, final was The Cunning Little Vixen. So different operas, so answer is N/A.

7. Which Wagner opera with Gunther's sets was last seen in 2023-24 and had climate protests. The article mentions Tannhauser: "Mr. Schenk's first Wagner outing at the Met came in 1978 with 'Tannhauser.' That production... was last seen during the 2023-24 season and was as notable for its formidable cast as for the climate-change protest in the balconies that erupted on opening night." So the answer is "Tannhauser".

8. What role did James Morris play in the 1990 broadcast? The article says: "Many of the featured singers, including James Morris, Hildegard Behrens, Jessye Norman and Siegfried Jerusalem, became identified with their roles; Mr. Levine... The broadcast... became a reference recording..." The question is James Morris's role. Since he's listed as one of the singers in the "Ring", his role would be, for example, Wotan in the Ring. But the article doesn't explicitly state his specific role in the broadcast. However, since he's known for his association with the Ring, and the question is asking his role in the 1990 broadcast, which was part of the Ring cycle, but the exact role isn't specified here. The article only mentions his name among others. Since the question is specific, but the article doesn't say his role, so answer N/A. Wait, but maybe the article says he was in the roles. Let me check again: "Many of the featured singers, including James Morris, Hildegard Behrens, Jessye Norman and Siegfried Jerusalem, became identified with their roles; Mr. Levine..." So they became identified with their roles, but which role for Morris? Since Morris is a bass, he likely sang Wotan. But the article doesn't specify, so the answer is N/A because the exact role isn't stated here.

Wait, but maybe the article mentions his role elsewhere? Let me scan. The article mentions James Morris in the context of the Ring's singers, but no specific role. So N/A.

9. The playhouse where Schenk was director during his Met years and where he did Firs. The article says: "During his most active years at the Met, between 1988 and 1997, he also led the Theater in der Josefstadt... He appeared in dozens of roles there... his last performance there was as Firs..." So the answer is "Theater in der Josefstadt".

10. The university he attended before Max Reinhardt. The article states: "After the war, Mr. Schenk spent two semesters at the University of Vienna studying law before switching to the prestigious Max Reinhardt Seminar..." So the answer is "University of Vienna".

Now let me go through each question again to confirm:

1. Georgine's role: "saleswoman and store manager".

2. Die Meistersinger revivals after 1993: The article doesn't mention how many times it was revived. The Met's revivals of his 16 productions became infrequent, but specifics on Meistersinger's count aren't given. So N/A.

3. Alex Ross highlighted that Lepage's lacked Schenk's traditional approach. The article says Ross called Lepage's "witless", and Schenk's was traditional. The question asks what aspect of Schenk's was lacking in Lepage's. The answer is "traditional staging" or "traditional approach". The exact quote from the article: "the Met's is a beauty" as a naturalistic staging. The article's quote from Henahan: "there ought to be room for a brilliantly untrendy one". Ross's comment on Lepage's being tech-heavy. So the aspect lacking is traditional/untrendy approach. The article says "Schenk's was a traditional staging". So answer: "traditional staging".

4. The year Die Walkure was the opening of the full cycle? The article says the Met started the cycle in 1986 with Walkure (which is the second opera), but the full cycle was presented in 1989-90. The question says "presented as the opening production of the complete cycle", but since the first part they did was Walkure in 1986, even though it's the second opera, the answer is 1986.

5. Bogdan Roscic's position: "general director of the Vienna State Opera".

6. Janacek opera for both debut and final: N/A, as they are different operas.

7. Tannhauser.

8. James Morris's role: N/A because not specified.

9. Theater in der Josefstadt.

10. University of Vienna.
