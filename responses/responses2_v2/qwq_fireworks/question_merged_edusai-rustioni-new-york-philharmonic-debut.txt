Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks which piece Marek Janowski conducted that was also in "2001: A Space Odyssey". The article mentions that the Philharmonic came knocking on Janowski, but the specific piece from the movie is Strauss's "Also Sprach Zarathustra" because the opening is used in the film. However, the article doesn't explicitly state that Janowski conducted that piece. Wait, actually, the article only says that Kevin John Edusei conducted "Also Sprach Zarathustra". The question about Janowski is in the article's last paragraph, but it doesn't mention the piece he conducted. Since the question links Janowski to the piece in the movie, but the text doesn't say he conducted it, the answer should be N/A. Hmm, but maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The article says "the renowned conductor Marek Janowski, 85, long ago gave up hope... Then the orchestra came knocking." But no piece is mentioned for him. So answer N/A.

2. The second question is about how many movements in Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony Rustioni conducted at a tempo initially perceived as slow. The article states "passages in the first movement that initially struck me as overly slow, but Rustioni... increased the tempo little by little." So only the first movement had this. Answer: 1.

3. The third question asks Edusei's previous role similar to Fred Armisen's drumming gig with Blue Man Group. The article says Edusei was principal guest conductor of the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra. The Blue Man Group's gig mentioned is Fred Armisen's drumming. The similarity is a role with a group. So the answer is "principal guest conductor".

4. The fourth question is the year the Philharmonic last performed the overture before the concert with Isabel Leonard. The overture in question here is Castelnuovo-Tedesco's "Merchant of Venice" overture, which hadn't been performed since 1941. But Isabel Leonard's performance was in Edusei's concert, which had Moussa's "Elysium". The Castelnuovo-Tedesco overture was in Rustioni's program. The question is about the overture in the concert with Isabel Leonard's performance. Wait, no. The overture mentioned for Rustioni's concert is the Castelnuovo-Tedesco, which was last performed in 1941. But the question is about the overture in the concert featuring Isabel Leonard. But Isabel Leonard was in Edusei's concert, which had Moussa's opener. The overture that was last performed in 1941 is Castelnuovo-Tedesco, which was in Rustioni's concert. So the question is mixing up the concerts. Since Isabel Leonard's concert was Edusei's, which didn't have the overture from 1941, the answer would be N/A. Wait, the question says "the overture that opened the concert featuring Isabel Leonard's performance of Berlioz's Les Nuits d'Ete". The opener for Edusei's concert was Samy Moussa's "Elysium". The Castelnuovo-Tedesco overture was in Rustioni's concert. Therefore, the answer is N/A because the overture in Isabel's concert was not the one from 1941.

Wait, the article says "Edusei's concert began with Samy Moussa's Elysium... There was an opener of the same length on Rustioni's program, which continues through Saturday, but it's a rarity from the past rather than something contemporary. Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco's... hadn't been performed by the orchestra since 1941." So the Castelnuovo-Tedesco overture was in Rustioni's program. The question is about the overture in the concert with Isabel Leonard (Edusei's concert), which was Moussa's piece. So the answer is N/A for the year because that overture wasn't the one from 1941. The correct overture that was last performed in 1941 is in Rustioni's concert, but the question is about Isabel's concert's overture. So answer N/A.

5. The fifth question asks besides "Redwood", what Broadway show mentioned in relation to Jimmy Fallon featured a mezzo-soprano. The article mentions Idina Menzel in "Redwood" and Jimmy Fallon's play "All In". The article doesn't mention a mezzo-soprano in Fallon's play. The only other Broadway mention is "Redwood" and "All In" for Fallon. Since the question asks for another show besides Redwood with a mezzo, but the text doesn't mention that, so N/A.

6. The sixth question asks what theatrical element Rustioni emphasized in Dvorak's concerto similar to Menzel's role in "Redwood". Menzel is climbing conifers, which is a physical, dramatic element. The article says Rustioni's Dvorak had "heated unanimity" in strings, "lively yet elegant", but the question links to theatrical elements like Menzel's physical act. The article mentions "nocturnal intimacy" in Berlioz, but for Dvorak, maybe "lyricism" or "heated unanimity". The question's similarity is unclear. The article says Rustioni's interpretation of Dvorak had "heated unanimity" in the second movement and "elegant" third movement. Maybe "lyricism" or "balanced transitions"? Alternatively, "nocturnal intimacy" was in Berlioz. Since the question is about theatrical element similar to Menzel's physical involvement, maybe "physicality" but the text doesn't say. Alternatively, the "celebration" part? Hmm, perhaps "balanced transitions" as part of operatic background. The article says Rustioni is known in opera and led transitions dramatically. So the answer might be "balanced transitions" but not sure. Alternatively, the question might refer to "nocturnal intimacy" but that was Berlioz. Wait, the question says "theatrical element similar to the one Idina Menzel is engaging with in 'Redwood', which is climbing conifers. So Menzel's element is physical/dramatic. The article mentions Rustioni's Dvorak had "Joshua Bell... blended well with the winds... strings played with heated unanimity". Maybe "heated unanimity" as a dramatic element. Alternatively, the article says "Rustioni's interpretation of Dvorak's Violin Concerto emphasized... celebration" but the question's similarity is unclear. Since the article doesn't explicitly state a theatrical element like that, answer N/A? Or maybe "lyricism" but not sure. Wait, the article says "Rustioni guided the transitions... dramatic without being overstated" which is an operatic trait. Maybe "dramatic transitions"? But the question asks for theatrical element similar to Menzel's. Since Menzel's is physical, perhaps "physical presence" isn't mentioned. Maybe N/A.

Wait, the question says "theatrical element, similar to the one Idina Menzel is engaging with in 'Redwood', did Rustioni emphasize..." Menzel is climbing conifers, which is a physical, visual element. Rustioni's Dvorak had "heated unanimity" in the strings, which is more about sound. Maybe the "celebration" in the third and fourth movements? The article says "celebration... honestly earned". Maybe "celebration" as a theatrical element. But not sure. Since the article doesn't explicitly link Rustioni's interpretation to a theatrical element similar to Menzel's physical act, maybe N/A.

7. The seventh question asks the six-song set by Berlioz after Moussa's piece. The article says Edusei's program had Samy Moussa's "Elysium" first, then Strauss's "Also Sprach Zarathustra", then Berlioz's "Les Nuits d'Ete" (which is six songs). So the answer is "Les Nuits d'Ete".

8. The eighth question asks which future music director after Dudamel will benefit from current relationships with conductors like the one who led "Also Sprach Zarathustra". The conductor who did Strauss was Edusei. The article's last paragraph says the Philharmonic is hoping relationships with artists like Edusei and Rustioni will continue and deepen. The next music director after Dudamel isn't named, but the article says "any orchestra's responsibility is to keep casting around for rising talent... who might even be an intriguing candidate for a hopefully well-in-the-future opening." Since Edusei and Rustioni are candidates, but the question asks for the name of the future director, the article doesn't mention a specific name. So answer N/A.

9. The ninth question asks what aspect of Joshua Bell's performance was notably absent despite polish, similar to multidimensional mothers on Broadway. The article says Bell's concerto was "polished and enjoyable" but had "a certain pretty emptiness at its center" and "odd lack of surprise despite surface liveliness". The multidimensional mothers are mentioned in another Broadway show, so the missing aspect is "surprise" or "depth". The answer is "lack of surprise" or "emptiness", but the question says "notably absent despite the overall polish". The article states "odd lack of surprise despite surface liveliness". So the answer is "surprise" or "surprise element". The exact phrase is "lack of surprise", so the answer is "surprise".

10. The tenth question asks which opera house's principal guest conductor led a symphony by a composer whose overture hadn't been played since before Pearl Harbor (1941). The overture in question is Castelnuovo-Tedesco's "Merchant of Venice" overture, which hadn't been played since 1941 (Pearl Harbor was 1941). The conductor here is Rustioni, who is the Met's principal guest conductor. So the answer is "Metropolitan Opera".

11. The eleventh question asks how Rustioni's operatic background influenced his Dvorak interpretation, balancing Bell with winds. The article says "Rustioni is an Italian conductor best known in opera... he blended especially well with the winds in the first movement". So his operatic experience helped in balancing, perhaps through attention to transitions or phrasing. The article states "he blended especially well with the winds in the first movement". So the answer is "balanced transitions" or "attention to phrasing". The article specifically mentions that in Dvorak's concerto, "he blended especially well with the winds in the first movement". So the answer is "blended with the winds effectively" or more precisely, the answer is "blended well with the winds".
