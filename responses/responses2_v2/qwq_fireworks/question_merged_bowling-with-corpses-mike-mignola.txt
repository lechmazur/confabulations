Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by reading through the questions again and then cross-referencing each with the article.

1. The first question asks about a 19th-century French illustrator known for "Paradise Lost" engravings compared to Mignola. The article mentions Gustave Doré in the context of illustrations for "Paradise Lost" and fairy tales. So the answer should be Gustave Doré.

2. The title of the ancient text quoted by the library ghost of Castle Yarg. The article says the ghost narrates using "ancient texts of this made-up world," but doesn't specify a title. So N/A.

3. Collaborator from Hellboy credited for color work in the Hamlet puppet story. The article mentions Dave Stewart as the colorist for Mignola's work, including that story. So Dave Stewart.

4. The magazine where Sidney Sime worked before illustrating "The Book of Wonder." The article says Sime had a "pedestrian day job" as a magazine editor and illustrator. But doesn't name the magazine. So N/A.

5. Russian folklore tale influencing a tertiary character. The article mentions "half of them to some obscure bit of Russian folklore," but no specific tale is named. So N/A.

6. Unstable architectural feature. The article says "every tower and parapet... staircase appears on the cusp of collapse." So staircases and towers? Wait, the question says "repeatedly emphasized as unstable across all stories" — the reviewer mentions "every tower and parapet" and "staircase." Maybe "staircases" or "towers and parapets." The answer is probably "staircases" since that's specifically mentioned as unstable.

7. Subterranean race with cows. The article says "a race of dwarves hidden beneath the earth who graze their tiny cows on subterranean plains." So dwarves.

8. Years between "Screw-On Head" and "Bowling With Corpses." The article says "The Amazing Screw-On Head and Other Curious Objects" is mentioned, and "Bowling" is more his own project. But no timeline given. So N/A.

9. Lovecraft's location referenced in the title story. The title story is "Bowling With Corpses," but the article mentions Lovecraft's influence on Hellboy's world, not the title story. The story about the puppet Hamlet references "Pickman's Model" but not a location. So N/A.

10. Literary award suggested. The article compares to Dunsany's work but doesn't mention an award. So N/A.

11. Early fantasy writer evoked through creation myth. The article mentions Dunsany's "The Book of Wonder" as a precedent, so Dunsany.

12. Monstrous adversaries in the bowling tale. The zombies with bad intentions are mentioned. So zombies.

13. Undrawn character part. The article says "characters don't even have faces" because of silhouettes. So faces.

14. Traditional fantasy accessory not reproduced. The article mentions maps in fantasy books, but Mignola's work doesn't have them. So maps.

15. Monetary value of the book. The end says "$24.95". So 24.95.

16. Cultural folklore source. The article mentions "Russian folklore, Christian apocrypha, or Poe poem" as references. So Russian folklore.

17. Spanish painter's style evoked. The article says Mignola evokes Goya without paint. So Francisco Goya.

18. Stylistic forerunner collection. "The Amazing Screw-On Head" is mentioned as a previous collection, so that's the answer.

19. Weird fiction writer shaping Hellboy's universe. The article says Hellboy's world is inspired by Lovecraft. So H.P. Lovecraft.

20. Century of graveyard poetry. The "Hellboy" story has a ghoul reciting 18th-century graveyard poetry. So 18th century.
