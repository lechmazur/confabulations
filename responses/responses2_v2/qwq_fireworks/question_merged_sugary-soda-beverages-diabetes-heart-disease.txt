3. **Question 3:** "What percentage increase in cardiovascular disease cases was observed among well-educated consumers in the Middle East compared to those with lower education levels?" The article states that in the Middle East, consumption is higher among lower-educated adults, but no percentage increase is given. Answer N/A.

11. **Question 11:** "In the findings around educational disparities in soda consumption, which region is noted for having higher intake among adults with lower educational attainment, distinguishing it from other regions highlighted in the article?" The Middle East and North Africa have higher consumption among lower-educated adults. So the answer is Middle East and North Africa.

12. **Question 12:** "Based on the article’s discussion of emerging health trends and policy measures, in which region is soda consumption reported to be declining due to interventions such as taxes and packaging warnings, despite earlier increases driven by soft drink companies expanding in new markets?"
