Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any external knowledge. Let me start with the first question.

1. **Which tech executive's company saw the largest percentage increase in stock value between Trump's election victory and his second inauguration?**  
The article mentions Elon Musk's Tesla shares rose more than 60%. The others aren't specified, so the answer is Elon Musk.

2. **What was the total number of emergency declarations made by Trump during his first day back in office?**  
The article states he declared "two states of emergency." So the number is 2.

The article doesn't mention specific interest rates from Bernstein. N/A.

5. **Which European countries did Trump specifically target with his new tariff proposals during the inauguration speech?**  
The speech mentioned tariffs on China, Mexico, Canada, and Europe. Europe is broad, but the article lists them as separate. So Canada and Europe? Wait, the exact countries are China, Mexico, Canada, and Europe. The question asks for European countries, so Canada is North American. The European ones would be "Europe" but that's not a country. Wait, maybe the answer is "Europe" but the question specifies countries. Hmm, the article says "Europe" as a region, so perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "European countries"—the text mentions "Europe" as a region, not specific countries. So maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but the article says "tariffs on China, Mexico, Canada and Europe"—so the European countries are grouped under "Europe." Since the question asks for countries, not regions, maybe N/A. But the question might accept "Europe" as an answer even though it's a region. The user instructions say to use the exact terms from the article. The article lists Europe as a target. The question asks for European countries, but the text just says Europe. Since the question requires specific countries and the article doesn't list them, the answer is N/A? Or maybe the user expects "Europe" but that's not a country. Hmm, tricky. Maybe the answer is N/A because the article doesn't specify which European countries, just the region. So I'll go with N/A.

The article mentions "most of its staff were expected to be suspended with pay or laid off." But there's no specific percentage, so N/A.

9. **What was the proposed capacity of the Guantanamo Bay facility for housing suspected gang members after the planned expansion?**  
The article says Guantanamo is holding 10 migrants, but expansion details aren't mentioned. The planned tent city is 30,000. The question is about Guantanamo's capacity after expansion, but the article only mentions 10 currently. So N/A.

16. **Which two countries did President Trump specifically link to his tariff policy during discussions about acquiring Greenland from Denmark?**  
The article mentions tariffs on Canada and Europe in the context of Greenland? Wait, the text says "seize the Panama Canal; buy Greenland from Denmark; impose tariffs on China, Mexico, Canada and Europe." The link between Greenland and tariffs on Canada and Europe? The question asks which two countries were linked to tariffs when discussing Greenland. The article doesn't explicitly link Greenland to specific countries' tariffs. So N/A.
