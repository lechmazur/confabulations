Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article provided. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks which two medical complications Dr. Chow observed that led him to call it "human experimentation." The article mentions Dr. Chow witnessed patients bleeding from catheter wounds and screaming in pain. So those are the two complications.

2. **Question 2:** John Preston claimed a mechanism where the filter removes tumor cells, freeing the immune system. The article states he said the filter eliminates CTCs, allowing the immune system to attack the tumor. The answer is that mechanism.

3. **Question 3:** The three patients mentioned in calls were the three in the Croatian study said to be cured. The article mentions "three patients in the study had been cured" and the marathon example. But the study's published data didn't confirm this. So the three are the ones Preston cited as cured.

4. **Question 4:** Sarah Mobbs saw catheter insertion without imaging or enough anesthesia. The text says the doctor made incisions without medical imaging or sufficient anesthesia.

5. **Question 5:** The Oklahoma patient had pain relief, while Kyle Chupp's cancer worsened after stopping chemo. Quadrant advised against chemo, but Chupp died. So the contradiction is that Oklahoma patient improved, Chupp died after pausing chemo.

6. **Question 6:** Antigua's regulations allowed it since FDA doesn't have jurisdiction there. The article states they bypassed FDA by operating in Antigua where FDA has no authority.

7. **Question 7:** John Bowen had tumor lysis syndrome, a metabolic issue from rapid tumor breakdown. Dr. Rosenberg hypothesized this might be linked.

8. **Question 8:** The Croatian study's paper said a 71% median decrease in CTCs.

9. **Question 9:** Each course used three filters. The article mentions Quadrant used three filters per treatment regimen.

10. **Question 10:** The filter's name is Seraph 100 Microbind Affinity Blood Filter.

11. **Question 11:** The FDA approved it for Covid but not cancer use in Antigua.

12. **Question 12:** Kim adjusted the oxygen tank's valve.

13. **Question 13:** Chow warned two months before the Hudlows' trip. The Hudlows went in April; Chow warned in February, so two months.

14. **Question 14:** The beads are coated with heparin.

15. **Question 15:** Quadrant paid $10 million to ExThera, which was several times their revenue.

16. **Question 16:** A dialysis machine was used with the filter.

17. **Question 17:** The Oklahoma trial had five pancreatic patients.

Let me check each again to ensure accuracy. For example, question 3's three patients are the three Preston mentioned as cured, which the study didn't support. The marathon runner is one, and the other two are implied. The answer should list those three. Wait, the article says Preston mentioned three patients cured, and Dr. Ilic mentioned the marathon case. The three would be the three "fully recovered" ones. Since the question asks for three patients referenced in calls, those three are the answer. The answer should state "three patients in the Croatian study (including the marathon runner)" but the exact names aren't given, so maybe just "three patients in the Croatian study presented as cured" but the question wants the three specific names? Wait, no, the article doesn't name them, just refers to them as three in the study. So the answer is the three patients from the study described as cured.

For question 15, the Oklahoma patient had relief, while Chupp died after stopping chemo. The contradiction is that Quadrant advised pausing chemo, but in Chupp's case, stopping led to worse outcome. The answer is that the Oklahoma patient improved, Chupp died after pausing chemo.

All others seem straightforward. Let me confirm numbers and specifics again. The answer for question 8 is 71%, from the published paper. The answer for 9 is three filters per course. The name for 10 is correct. FDA for 11. Valve on the tank for 12. Two months for 13. Heparin for 14. $10 million for 15. Dialysis machine for 16. Five patients in Oklahoma for 17. Okay, I think that's all.
