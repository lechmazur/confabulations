Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. The user provided an article about Sherman's March and the book "Somewhere Toward Freedom" by Bennett Parten. I need to answer each question strictly based on the information in the article. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **How many days did it take for Sherman's army to reach Port Royal after leaving Atlanta?**  
The article says Sherman's march from Atlanta to Savannah took 37 days. However, the question asks about Port Royal. The text mentions that after Savannah, the refugees were sent to Port Royal. Since the march itself was to Savannah in 37 days, the time to Port Royal isn't specified. The article doesn't give the duration from Atlanta to Port Royal directly. So, maybe N/A?

2. **What percentage of the land confiscated under Sherman's Special Field Order No. 15 was ultimately retained by freedmen families after President Johnson's intervention?**  
The article states President Johnson restored lands to original owners, so freedmen didn't retain any. But the question asks for a percentage. Since it's not stated, but Johnson returned all, maybe 0%?

3. **What ailment did most of the 1,000 refugees who died of exposure after arriving at Port Royal suffer from, according to General Saxton?**  
The text says "at least 1,000 of them died of exposure." Exposure itself is the cause, not an ailment. The question might be expecting a specific disease like pneumonia, but the article doesn't mention that. So N/A.

4. **What was the name of the Pennsylvania representative who championed the redistribution of wealth in the South, as mentioned by George Templeton Strong in his diary?**  
The article mentions Thaddeus Stevens as the Pennsylvania representative. But the question says "mentioned by George Templeton Strong in his diary." The diary part is key. The article says Strong called the march a "grand adagio movement," but the representative is from Stevens. Since the question links Strong's diary to the rep, but the text doesn't say Strong mentioned Stevens, maybe N/A?

5. **What was the name of the military tactic, employed by General Davis at Ebenezer Creek, directly responsible for the massacre, according to Scipio King's testimony?**  
The text says General Davis ordered the bridge burned before refugees could cross, leading to a massacre. The tactic was burning the pontoon bridge. The question asks for the tactic's name. The article doesn't name it, just describes it. So answer: burning the bridge. But the question specifies a "military tactic" name. Since it's not named, maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "according to Scipio King's testimony"—but the article only mentions a soldier's account. So N/A.

6. **What was the title of the influential chronicle by Willie Lee Rose praised by Parten?**  
The article says "Rehearsal for Reconstruction" by Willie Lee Rose. Yes, that's the title. So that's the answer.

7. **What was the primary crop Edward Philbrick intended to cultivate?**  
The article states Philbrick bought plantations to employ freed people, aiming for their "elevation." But the crop isn't mentioned. Since it's former plantations in the Sea Islands, maybe cotton or rice, but the text doesn't specify. So N/A.

8. **Besides shelter and food, what was the third essential provision Saxton was ordered to provide?**  
The text says Saxton was ordered to "feed, shelter and generally care for the formerly enslaved." "Care for" is vague, but the article later mentions "feed, shelter, and..." the third is "care," but maybe "clothing" or something else? Wait, the exact quote: "to feed, shelter and generally care for the formerly enslaved." The third is "care for," but the question asks for a specific provision. The article might not list a third item, so N/A? Or maybe "clothing"? The text says some had no blankets, but that's not part of the order. The answer is "care for," but the question wants a specific provision like medical aid? Since it's not explicitly stated, perhaps N/A.

9. **What was the name of the pastor who replaced Garrison Frazier in the meeting with Sherman and Stanton?**  
The article says Sherman met with Garrison Frazier, no mention of replacement. So N/A.

10. **What was the official designation of the peonage system Howard established?**  
The article mentions Howard's promise as a "sop" where ex-Confederates set aside land for freed people to work, which was a system of peonage. The official term isn't given. The text says "system of peonage" but doesn't name it officially. So N/A.

11. **Why did Howard's promise contradict Sherman's Order No. 15?**  
Sherman's order allowed settlement on land, but Howard's promise didn't grant ownership, and Johnson returned land. The contradiction is because Howard's offer didn't give legal ownership as the Order implied. The Order allowed settlement, but Howard's promise didn't ensure ownership. So the answer is that Howard's promise didn't grant legal ownership as per the Order.

12. **How did Davis's actions reflect broader logistical challenges?**  
The article states Davis ordered bridges burned, causing a massacre. The broader challenge was balancing military needs (speed) with refugee welfare. The answer is that Davis's actions showed the difficulty in managing refugees while pursuing military objectives.

Now, checking each against the text:

1. The article says the march to Savannah was 37 days. Port Royal is after Savannah. The time to Port Royal isn't given. So N/A.

2. Johnson restored land, so freedmen lost all. 0%? The article says "President Andrew Johnson... restored lands not already sold." So they didn't retain any. Answer: 0%?

Wait, the question is about land confiscated under Sherman's order. The Order was 40 acres and a mule. But Johnson returned the land to original owners. So freedmen didn't retain any. So percentage is 0. But the article says "stipulated that Black families legally owned the plots allotted to them" but then Johnson reversed. So the retention is 0. But the question says "after President Johnson's intervention" so answer 0%.

3. The cause was exposure, but the question asks for an ailment. Exposure isn't an ailment. So N/A.

4. George Templeton Strong's diary is mentioned in the first paragraph as calling the march a "grand adagio movement." The question links the rep to Strong's diary, but the rep is Thaddeus Stevens. Since the article doesn't say Strong mentioned Stevens, N/A.

5. Scipio King's testimony isn't mentioned here. The bridge burning was by Davis, but the question cites Scipio King's testimony. The article says a soldier called it disgraceful, but not Scipio. So N/A.

6. "Rehearsal for Reconstruction" is correct.

7. No crop specified. N/A.

8. The third provision: the order was to "feed, shelter and generally care for". The third is "care for," but the question wants a specific provision like "medical care" or "clothing." Since it's not listed, N/A.

9. No replacement mentioned. N/A.

10. The system was called peonage by the freed people, but the official name isn't given. N/A.

11. The contradiction is because Howard's promise didn't grant legal ownership as per the Order (since Order No. 15 didn't stipulate ownership, but Howard's promise was even worse, allowing only leasing). The article says "Sherman's field order didn't stipulate that Black families legally owned the plots allotted to them." So Howard's promise was even less, which contradicts the Order's intent. But the question asks why Howard's promise contradicted the Order. The Order allowed settlement, but Howard didn't offer ownership. However, the Order itself didn't grant ownership either. Wait, the article says Howard's promise was that ex-Confederates would set aside land for them to work as their own, but that was a betrayal. The contradiction is because Howard's promise didn't align with the Order's intent of allowing settlement, but the Order didn't guarantee ownership. However, the Order's stipulation was that they could settle, but Howard's promise didn't even allow that. The answer is that Howard's promise didn't grant legal ownership as the Order intended (even though the Order didn't explicitly do that, but the idea was to let them settle). Hmm. The article says "Sherman's field order didn't stipulate that Black families legally owned the plots allotted to them. Besides, President Andrew Johnson... restored lands..." So the contradiction is that Howard's promise went against the Order's intent by not ensuring any ownership, and Johnson's actions reversed it. But the question is why Howard's promise contradicted the Order. Since the Order allowed settlement but didn't grant ownership, Howard's promise (which offered less than that) might not contradict, but the article says Howard's promise was a betrayal. The key is that the Order allowed settlement, but Howard's promise didn't even offer that, just leasing. So the contradiction is that Howard's promise didn't uphold the Order's allocation, but the Order didn't legally grant ownership. The answer is "because Howard's promise did not grant legal ownership as stipulated in the Order" — but the Order didn't stipulate ownership. Wait, the article says "Sherman's Special Field Order No. 15 allowed freed men and women to settle on a strip of captured land... under a provision colloquially known as '40 acres and a mule.'" The Order allowed settlement, but didn't legally transfer ownership. Howard's promise was even worse, allowing them to work land but not own it. The contradiction is that Howard's promise didn't follow the Order's intent to let them settle (since the Order allowed it, but Howard's offer was less). Alternatively, the contradiction is because Howard's promise didn't provide the land ownership that the freed people expected from the Order. The article says "Sherman's field order didn't stipulate that Black families legally owned the plots allotted to them." So the contradiction is that Howard's promise didn't even allow them to settle, or offered less than the Order's allowance. Wait, the Order allowed settlement, but Howard's promise was that ex-Confederates would set aside land for them to work as their own, but that's not ownership. The Order's provision allowed settlement, so Howard's promise didn't contradict the Order's terms (since the Order didn't grant ownership), but contradicted the freed people's expectations. The question is about contradicting the Order's intention. Since the Order's intention was to provide land for them to settle, Howard's promise didn't fulfill that. But the Order didn't guarantee ownership. So the answer is "because Howard's promise did not grant legal ownership as the Order intended." But the Order didn't stipulate ownership. Hmm. Maybe the answer is that Howard's promise didn't ensure any ownership, contradicting the Order's allocation. The article says Howard "promised that these ex-Confederates would be setting aside lands for them to work as their own." So the promise was that ex-Confederates (former owners) would set aside land for them to work, which is peonage. The Order allowed them to settle on the land, but Howard's arrangement made them work for the former owners, which is the opposite. So the contradiction is that Howard's promise reversed the Order's allocation by putting them under ex-Confederates. The answer: "because Howard's promise returned land to ex-Confederates instead of giving it to freedmen as per the Order."

Wait, the article says: "Howard had to deliver the awful news in September 1865, but, as a sop to the freed people, he promised that these ex-Confederates would be setting aside lands for them to work as their own." So the ex-Confederates (former owners) would set aside land for freedmen to work, but that's under the control of the ex-owners, which is a system of peonage. The Order allowed the freedmen to settle on the land, but Howard's promise made them work on land controlled by the former owners. Thus, contradicting the Order's intent of letting them take the land. The answer is that Howard's promise allowed ex-Confederates to retain control of the land, reversing the Order's allocation.

So the answer is "because Howard's promise allowed ex-Confederates to retain land ownership instead of distributing it to freedmen as per the Order."

12. Davis's action of burning the bridge showed the challenge of managing refugees while moving troops. The article says Davis ordered the bridge burned before refugees could cross, leading to a massacre. This reflects the broader issue of balancing military movement (speed) with the need to protect refugees. The answer: "Davis's actions highlighted the difficulty of managing refugee welfare alongside military logistics, as he prioritized troop movement over ensuring refugee safety."

Wait, the question asks how Davis's actions reflect broader logistical challenges. The answer is that burning the bridge showed the problem of handling refugees while pursuing military objectives. So answer: "The burning of the pontoon bridge at Ebenezer Creek demonstrated the army's struggle to balance military objectives with the protection and movement of thousands of refugees, leading to tragic consequences."

But the answer should be concise. Maybe "Prioritizing military speed over refugee safety, reflecting the challenge of managing both."

So I'll structure each answer based on this.
