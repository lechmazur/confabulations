Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly what's asked. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks about the percentage tariff President Petro initially threatened before agreeing. The article mentions that Trump threatened Colombia with tariffs, and within hours, Petro said he would hit back with his own tariffs. But then the White House said Petro agreed, so the threat was held in reserve. However, the exact percentage Petro threatened isn't specified. The article says Trump's initial threat was 25%, then 50%, but Petro's retaliation percentage isn't given. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question is about Petro's initial threat. The article says "the Colombian president... said he would hit back with his own tariffs." But the percentage isn't mentioned. So N/A?

Wait, looking again: "Mr. Trump wrote on social media that he would impose 25 percent tariffs on Colombia and raise them to 50 percent in one week. Within a few hours, the Colombian president... said he would hit back with his own tariffs." The article doesn't state the percentage for Petro's retaliation. So answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The legal statute used by Nixon that Trump threatened to invoke. The article says Trump is using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977. Nixon used the Trading With the Enemy Act of 1917. The question is asking which statute Trump threatened to use for Denmark, which the article mentions in the context of Denmark not ceding Greenland. The answer is IEEPA.

3. **Question 3:** The other country besides Canada and Mexico with a 25% tariff on Feb 1. The article says "he threatened to punish Denmark... and to impose levies on Russia..." but then also mentions "Last week, Mr. Trump threatened to put a 25 percent tariff on products from Canada and Mexico and a 10 percent tariff on Chinese products on Feb. 1..." Wait, so the 25% on Feb 1 includes Canada, Mexico, and the 10% on China. Wait, the exact wording: "he threatened to put a 25 percent tariff on products from Canada and Mexico and a 10 percent tariff on Chinese products on Feb. 1..." So the 25% is for Canada and Mexico, 10% for China. So the third country with 25% is N/A? Or maybe the question is wrong. Wait, the question says "unless they increased efforts to stop drug and migrant flows?" The countries mentioned here are Canada, Mexico, and China? Wait the 10% is on China. The question asks besides Canada and Mexico, which other country had 25%? The answer is N/A because the 25% was for Canada and Mexico, and China had 10%. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.

The article says: "he threatened to put a 25 percent tariff on products from Canada and Mexico and a 10 percent tariff on Chinese products on Feb. 1 unless those countries did more to stop the flows of drugs and migrants into the United States." So the 25% is only Canada and Mexico, the 10% is China. So the answer to question 3 is China? Wait the question asks "unless they increased efforts to stop drug and migrant flows" and the 25% is Canada/Mexico, and the 10% is China. But the question is asking for the country with 25% besides Canada and Mexico? There isn't any. So answer N/A? Or maybe I missed another country. Wait the question says "unless those countries did more to stop..." so the countries are Canada, Mexico, and China? But the 25% is only on Canada/Mexico, and 10% on China. So the 25% tariff on Feb 1 is only for Canada and Mexico. Therefore, the answer is N/A?

Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again: "he threatened to put a 25 percent tariff on products from Canada and Mexico and a 10 percent tariff on Chinese products on Feb. 1..." So the 25% is Canada and Mexico, and 10% on China. The question asks besides Canada and Mexico, which country had 25%? None. So the answer is N/A. Hmm. But maybe the question is a trick. Wait the question says "unless they increased efforts to stop drug and migrant flows" so all three countries are under threat for that reason. But the tariffs are split into 25% (Canada/Mexico) and 10% (China). The question specifically asks which other country besides Canada and Mexico had a 25% tariff. Since China has 10%, the answer is N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Kaja Kallas said Europe needed to unite because of a shift in U.S. policy. The article says: "Kaja Kallas, the European Union's top diplomat, said Monday that Europe needed to unite as the Trump administration threatens to usher in an era of policy changes, including tariffs." The shift is "ushering in an era of policy changes, including tariffs." The question specifies the shift in U.S. policy that necessitates Europe's unity. The exact quote mentions "as the Trump administration threatens to usher in an era of policy changes, including tariffs." So the shift is a more transactional approach. The question says "type of shift in U.S. policy" that necessitates unity. The article says "As the United States shifts to a more transactional approach, Europe needs to close ranks." So the answer is a "more transactional approach".

5. **Question 5:** The White House official who suggested legal challenges. The article mentions Peter Harrell, who served in Biden's White House, noting that IEEPA had never been used for such tariffs before. He suggested that an expansive use could face legal challenges. The answer is Peter Harrell.

6. **Question 6:** The 2011 trade agreement with Colombia. The article says "Colombia signed such a deal with the United States in 2011" (the "such a deal" refers to a free-trade agreement). So the answer is the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement or US-Canada-Mexico? Wait the article says "Colombia signed such a deal with the United States in 2011, while Mr. Trump himself signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement in 2020." So the 2011 deal is the US-Colombia Free Trade Agreement. The exact name isn't given, but the article refers to it as "a free-trade agreement", so maybe just "Free Trade Agreement" or the specific name? The question says "specific trade agreement", so perhaps the answer is "United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement" or just "Free Trade Agreement". Since the article doesn't name it beyond "such a deal", maybe the answer is "Free Trade Agreement" as that's the term used.

7. **Question 7:** Nixon's condition on Japan for Okinawa. The article states that Nixon "conditioned the return of Okinawa to Japan on its agreeing to limit the amount of textiles it sent into the United States." So the condition was limiting textile exports.

8. **Question 8:** WTO exception used by administrations. The article says "the W.T.O. carves out exceptions for its members to act on issues of national security, and governments have used that exception more liberally in recent years..." So the exception is "national security".

9. **Question 9:** The amendment by Ford linking Jewish emigration to lower tariffs. The article mentions the Jackson-Vanik Amendment signed by Ford. So the answer is Jackson-Vanik Amendment.

10. **Question 10:** The time before escalating tariffs to 50% on Colombia. Trump's social media post said 25% initially, then 50% in one week. The question asks how long before escalating to 50%, which is one week. The answer is "one week".

11. **Question 11:** Nation referenced in the social media announcement about returned immigrant flights. The article says Trump threatened Colombia after its government turned back planes. The social media post on Sunday afternoon mentioned Colombia. So the answer is Colombia.

12. **Question 12:** The European diplomat urging unity. The article mentions Kaja Kallas as the EU's top diplomat making that statement. So Kaja Kallas.

13. **Question 13:** President who conditioned Okinawa's return on trade. Nixon, as mentioned earlier.

14. **Question 14:** Non-trade issue triggering tariffs. The article's main theme is using tariffs for non-trade issues like immigration, drugs, migrants. The specific trigger here is "the flow of migrants and drugs into the U.S." So the answer is "flow of migrants and drugs" but the question says "non-trade issue that involves border dynamics"—so "migrant flows" or "drug flows and migrant flows".

15. **Question 15:** Sector affected by Colombian tariffs. Ted Murphy said tariffs would be a blow to industries relying on Colombian imports. The article mentions Colombia's exports but doesn't specify. However, textiles are mentioned in the Nixon example, but that's separate. The article says "industries that rely on imports from Colombia", but no specifics. So maybe N/A? Or perhaps the question is inferring from the example with Nixon and textiles? The article says "industries that rely on imports from Colombia" but without more info, so N/A? Or maybe the answer is "textiles" but that's from the Nixon example. Wait the question is about Colombia's current situation. Since the article doesn't specify, maybe N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Who retaliated before compliance? The Colombian president Petro initially retaliated but then agreed. The answer is Petro.

17. **Question 17:** Country with 10% tariff on products. The article says China had 10% on Feb 1. So China.

18. **Question 18:** Trilateral trade agreement signed by Trump. The article mentions the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement) signed by Trump in 2020. So the answer is USMCA.

19. **Question 19:** Trait distinguishing the approach from earlier presidents. The article says it's "unusual" and "transactional", and the question mentions threats involving Colombia, Mexico, Russia. The trait is "transactional approach" or "using tariffs for non-trade issues". The article says "Trump is very overt and transactional in his approach". The answer is "transactional approach" or "unprecedented frequency". The question asks what distinguishes it from earlier presidents, so "unusual overt and transactional approach" but the exact phrasing from the article is "Trump is very overt and transactional in his approach".

Wait the question says "which trait... distinguishes the administration’s approach from that of earlier U.S. presidents?" The article states "Presidential use of trade-related measures for matters unrelated to trade isn't without precedent. ... Still, Mr. Irwin called Mr. Trump's approach 'unusual'. 'Trump is very overt and transactional in his approach', he said." So the trait is "transactional approach".

Now, compiling all answers:

1. N/A (Petro's retaliation percentage not given)
2. International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA)
3. China (Wait, no, the 25% was for Canada/Mexico, and 10% for China. The question asks besides Canada and Mexico, which other country had 25%? So answer N/A)
Wait, let me recheck question 3 again: "unless they increased efforts to stop drug and migrant flows?" The countries involved are Canada, Mexico, and China (since China had 10% for same reason). But the 25% is only Canada and Mexico, so the question's 25% tariff on Feb 1 besides Canada and Mexico: there is no such country, so N/A.

4. more transactional approach
5. Peter Harrell
6. Free Trade Agreement (or the specific name if known, but article says "such a deal", so probably "Free Trade Agreement")
7. limit the amount of textiles sent into the U.S.
8. national security exception
9. Jackson-Vanik Amendment
10. one week
11. Colombia
12. Kaja Kallas
13. Nixon
14. migrant flows (or "flow of migrants and drugs")
15. N/A (since specific sector not mentioned)
16. Gustavo Petro
17. China
18. United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement
19. transactional approach

Wait, for question 15, the article says "industries that rely on imports from Colombia" but doesn't name the sector. Since it's not specified, the answer is N/A.

Double-checking each question:

1. N/A
2. IEEPA
3. N/A
4. more transactional approach
5. Peter Harrell
6. Free Trade Agreement (maybe the exact name is US-Colombia FTA but article just says "free-trade agreement", so answer "Free Trade Agreement")
7. limit textiles
8. national security
9. Jackson-Vanik
10. one week
11. Colombia
12. Kaja Kallas
13. Nixon
14. migrant flows (or "flow of migrants and drugs")
15. N/A
16. Petro
17. China
18. USMCA
19. transactional approach

Looks good. Now format as per instructions.
