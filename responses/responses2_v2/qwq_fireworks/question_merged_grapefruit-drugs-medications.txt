Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and don't infer anything beyond that. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about the percentage of citrus plants showing intermediate levels of furanocoumarins when crossing mandarins and grapefruit. The article mentions that 50% had high levels and 50% had none. Since there's no mention of intermediate levels, the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2**: It asks which pharmaceutical company funded the research. The article doesn't mention any specific company funding, so N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Dr. Eyal estimated the time needed. The text says he was "afraid to approach it because it's very time-consuming and it takes many years," but no specific number is given. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Temperature conditions for growing the hybrids? The article doesn't discuss growing conditions, so N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The liver enzyme breaking down furanocoumarins. The article says furanocoumarins interfere with liver enzymes, but doesn't name a specific one. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The name of the ancient breeder. The article mentions an unknown breeder but doesn't name them. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Number of citrus varieties tested. The text states they checked all mandarin and orange varieties, but the exact number isn't given. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Concentration triggering warning labels. The article doesn't specify the exact concentration. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Country's regulatory agency. Not mentioned, so N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Year of molecular structure discovery. The article says "years ago" but no specific year. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Enzyme produced from the gene that's dysfunctional in mandarins. The article says the gene produces 2OGD, which is mutated in mandarins. So the answer is 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase or 2OGD.

12. **Question 12**: Citrus variety with the mutation. The article says mandarins have the mutated gene, so mandarins.

13. **Question 13**: Researcher who led the study and mentioned time. The lead author is Livnat Goldenberg, but the one who talked about time was Dr. Eyal. Wait, the question says "noted both for his professorial role and his remark..." The article says Dr. Eyal was the one who mentioned the time, and he's a professor. The lead author is Livnat, but the question asks who led the study. Wait, the study's lead author is Livnat, but the professor leading the study might be Dr. Eyal. Wait, the article says "Dr. Eyal suggests" and "Livnat Goldenberg, a Volcani Center researcher who is the lead author." So the lead researcher might be Dr. Eyal, but the question is about the one who led the study into the genetics. The article says the team included Eyal and Goldenberg, but the lead author is Livnat. The question asks who led the study, but the exact wording might be tricky. Wait, the question says "researcher from the Volcani Center, noted both for his professorial role and his remark on the extensive time necessary..." That's Dr. Eyal. So the answer is Yoram Eyal.

14. **Question 14**: Mode of inheritance implied by 50-50 split. The article states "that particular signature meant something very specific... only one gene that could have controlled it." So it's a single-gene (Mendelian) inheritance, likely dominant/recessive. The answer would be "single gene" or "simple Mendelian inheritance." The article says "only one gene," so the mode is single-gene or monogenic. The exact term used might be "single gene control" as per the text.

15. **Question 15**: Journal name. The article starts with "reported Wednesday in the journal The New Phytologist." So The New Phytologist.

16. **Question 16**: Anticipated advancement. The article mentions creating grapefruit without warnings, so "grapefruit that doesn’t require a warning label."

17. **Question 17**: Early selection that caused the mutation. The article says "some gene nearby on the genome must play an important role in a highly prized trait... selecting for some unknown quality." So the answer is the selection for an unknown quality or prized trait.

18. **Question 18**: Chemical group in grapefruit that interferes. The article mentions furanocoumarins.

19. **Question 19**: Research headline about extraterrestrial organic chemistry. The article mentions "Life's Building Blocks Inside an Asteroid" which is about Bennu samples, so that's the answer.

20. **Question 20**: Percentage of young plants with furanocoumarins. The article says 50% had high levels, so 50%.
