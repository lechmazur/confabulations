Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by going through each question and checking the text for answers.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which French monarch was ruling when Roberval began his expedition to New France. The article mentions that Marguerite was stranded in the 1540s. I know that in the 16th century, France was under the reign of kings like Francis I or Henry II. The article doesn't explicitly name the monarch, though. Since it's about New France, maybe Roberval was under Francis I? But the text doesn't say, so I should answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The specific type of birds that provided sustenance. The article says, "A flock of birds ensure they do not starve..." but doesn't name the species. So N/A here too.

3. **Question 3:** Roberval's military rank in the French navy. The text refers to him as a noble and guardian but doesn't mention his naval rank. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Which character is revealed to be plotting with Basque fishermen. The article states that Basque fishermen rescued them, but there's no mention of a character sabotaging the colony. Answer N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Years after rescue when Marguerite wrote her memoir. The article doesn't provide dates for her writing, only that she recounts her story. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The 16th-century French philosopher referenced by Auguste. The text doesn't mention any specific philosopher, so N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Damienne's medicinal practice for frostbite. The article mentions "massage bear tallow into your chilblains" but not Damienne specifically. Not sure, maybe N/A?

8. **Question 8:** The family member causing exile. The article says Roberval is the guardian who stranded them. So answer Roberval.

9. **Question 9:** The attendant who is Marguerite's comfort. The text mentions Auguste as gentle and her balm on the ship. So Auguste.

10. **Question 10:** Handmade item from natural element. The shelter and peat mattress are mentioned. The answer is a mattress made of peat.

11. **Question 11:** Tragic family incident in intro. The first line says Marguerite's mother died at birth. So that's the incident.

12. **Question 12:** Authority state ascribed to the couple. The quote says "rulers and our own subjects too." So rulers and subjects.

13. **Question 13:** Seasonal phenomenon as hope. The text mentions a New World autumn, so autumn's beauty.

14. **Question 14:** Weapon used in a fauna encounter. The article says arquebus was used to shoot a polar bear. So arquebus.

15. **Question 15:** Nautical group credited with rescue. Basque fishermen are mentioned. So Basque fishermen.

16. **Question 16:** Modern media platform. The article ends with The Book Review Podcast. So that's the answer.

17. **Question 17:** Discreet relationship on the island. Auguste and Marguerite's relationship is mentioned as furtive meetings. So their relationship.

Now, let me check each again to ensure accuracy based on the text.

For question 7, Damienne is the nurse, and the text says "massage bear tallow into your chilblains" but doesn't explicitly say Damienne did it. Maybe the answer is N/A since it's Marguerite's reflection, not Damienne's practice. Hmm. The question says Damienne's practice, so if the text doesn't specify her using it, then N/A.

Alright, proceeding with these answers.
