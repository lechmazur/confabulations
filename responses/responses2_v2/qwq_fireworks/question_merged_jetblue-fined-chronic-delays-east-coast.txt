Okay, I need to go through each question and answer them based strictly on the given article. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks which month in 2024 the Transportation Department first warned JetBlue about delays on the J.F.K. to Raleigh-Durham route before the penalty. The article mentions the penalty was announced on Friday (probably 2023 since the period given is June 2022 to November 2023). The warning is mentioned but the exact month in 2024 isn't provided. Since the penalty was in 2023 and the warning was before that, but the question is about 2024, the answer is N/A.

2. The four penalized routes: JFK-Raleigh, JFK-Ft. Lauderdale, JFK-Orlando, and Ft. Lauderdale-Bradley. Bradley is part of one route. So the answer is 1.

3. The $2M penalty's allocation: half to passengers, the other $1M to Treasury. The question asks about upgrading air traffic control in Florida with the penalty. The article doesn't mention using the fine for that, so N/A.

4. JetBlue was second to last in on-time performance, with Frontier last. So the one above them would be the 9th out of 10. The article doesn't name the one above, just says Frontier is last. So we can't know, so N/A.

5. The question is about consecutive months over 50% delays for Fort Lauderdale to Bradley. The article says the four routes had delays for five consecutive months. The specific months are mentioned as June 2022 to Nov 2023, but the exact count for that route's consecutive months isn't specified beyond the five months. So the answer is 5.

6. The routes cut by JetBlue include NY to Miami/Houston. The penalized routes are JFK-Raleigh, JFK-Ft. Lauderdale, JFK-Orlando, and Ft. Lauderdale-Bradley. None of the cut routes (NY-Miami/Houston) are in the penalized four. So N/A.

7. Derek's statement mentions investing in operational improvements but doesn't specify Orlando. The answer is N/A.

8. The 52 places are listed but not linked to JetBlue routes. So N/A.

9. The Turks and Caicos to Boston flight was delayed over 24 hours, but the Bureau stats don't give the average duration. The question asks for the duration of that specific delay, which was over 24 hours, but the exact average isn't stated. So N/A.

10. The article says over 70% of disruptions were airline's fault, but the highest percentage due to air traffic control isn't mentioned. The question asks for an airport not in the four routes with highest ATC-caused delays. Not enough info, N/A.

11. The 24-hour delay was Turks and Caicos to Boston. The penalized routes don't include that route (they're all East Coast ones like JFK to others). So the answer is Turks and Caicos-Boston.

12. The airline that invested despite issues is JetBlue, as per Dombrowski's statement.

13. The warning mentioned specifically JFK to Raleigh-Durham as the one they warned about, and it's repeatedly highlighted in the period given.

14. The period when flights were delayed five consecutive months is stated as "five consecutive months" but the exact period is from June 2022 to Nov 2023, but the five months in a row isn't specified. Wait, the article says "Between June 2022 and November 2023, the flights were chronically delayed five months in a row." So the period is five consecutive months within that span. But the question asks for the period, so the answer is five consecutive months (the question wants the duration, not the exact dates). Wait, the question is "what is the period during which flights on the affected routes were consistently delayed for five consecutive months?" The answer would be the five consecutive months, but the exact months aren't given. Wait, the article says "for five consecutive months" but not which months. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question is phrased as "the period during which flights... were consistently delayed for five consecutive months?" The answer is that it happened between June 2022 and November 2023, but the exact five months aren't specified. The question might be looking for the five months, but since it's not given, perhaps N/A. Wait the article says "between June 2022 and November 2023, the flights were chronically delayed five months in a row." So the period during which this occurred is that entire span, but the five months in a row are within that. The question is asking for the period (timeframe) of the five consecutive months. Since it's not specified beyond "five months in a row" during that time, maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, tricky. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "five consecutive months" but the question wants the actual time period like "June to October 2022" but that's not stated. So probably N/A.

Wait, the question says "the period during which flights on the affected routes were consistently delayed for five consecutive months?" The article states that the flights were chronically delayed five months in a row between June 2022 and November 2023. So the period is five consecutive months. But the actual dates aren't given. The question might want the duration (five months) but the answer is that the period is five consecutive months. However, the question asks for the period (like the start and end dates), which isn't provided. So answer N/A.

15. The compensation is at least $75 per customer, so the answer is $75.

16. The airline with post-pandemic struggles, route cuts, and failed merger is JetBlue.

17. The article says JetBlue was second to last with over 9% airline-caused delays. So the answer is JetBlue.

18. The airline responsible for the chronic delays is JetBlue.

19. The major airport repeatedly implicated as departure is JFK, since all four routes start there except the last one (Ft. Lauderdale to Bradley).

20. The agency is the Transportation Department (DOT).

Now I'll format the answers accordingly.
