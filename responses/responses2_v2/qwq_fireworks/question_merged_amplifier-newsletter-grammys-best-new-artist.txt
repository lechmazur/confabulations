Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. 

1. The first question asks which artist won a local talent show in 2012 and predicted their Grammy nomination. The article mentions Chappell Roan saying she manifested winning the award after winning a local talent show in 2012. So the answer is Chappell Roan.

2. The second question is about Sabrina Carpenter's "Please Please Please" and how many consecutive weeks it was #1. The article actually says Shaboozey's "A Bar Song (Tipsy)" had 19 weeks at #1. Sabrina's song isn't mentioned as the one with the record. So this must be N/A.

3. Teddy Swims' original name. The text says his real name is Jaten Dimsdale and "Swims" is an acronym for "someone who isn't me sometimes." It doesn't mention a previous stage name before "Swims," so the original name before the acronym isn't provided. N/A.

4. The nominee whose therapist is a featured artist on their single. Doechii's song "Denial Is a River" is described as a conversation between her and her therapist alter ego. The therapist isn't a featured artist but an alter ego. So maybe N/A since it's not a separate artist. Wait, the question says "therapist appears as a featured artist." Since it's her alter ego, not an actual person, so answer is N/A.

5. Khruangbin's inspiration was described as a lava lamp, but the article says "the sound you hear inside a lava lamp?" but doesn't specify color. So color isn't mentioned. N/A.

6. Benson Boone's backflips during American Idol. The article mentions he does backflips onstage and is an "American Idol dropout." But it doesn't say how many he did in his performance. N/A.

7. Raye's total streaming count for her six Brit Award songs. The article says she won six Brit Awards but doesn't give streaming numbers. N/A.

8. Shaboozey as lead vocalist on Beyonc√©'s "Cowboy Carter." The article states he was on "Cowboy Carter" but doesn't specify the track. The question asks for the track name. Since it's not mentioned, N/A.

9. The Missouri venue where Roan first performed "Good Luck, Babe!" The article mentions she won a local talent show there in 2012 but doesn't name the venue. N/A.

10. The nominee with the record for most weeks #1 on both country and pop charts. Shaboozey's song "Tipsy" was a country hit but the article doesn't mention pop chart data. The record for weeks at #1 was 19 weeks for "Tipsy" but it's not clear if that's country and pop. The question specifies both, so no info. N/A.
