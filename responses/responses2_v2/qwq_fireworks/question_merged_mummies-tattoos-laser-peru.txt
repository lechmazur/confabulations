Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. I need to be careful to only use the information in the text and not make any assumptions beyond that.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions Otzi's tattoos but doesn't specify the line width measured via LSF. The LSF details are about Chancay tattoos, so this must be N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The text doesn't mention any modern Peruvian artists using cactus needles. It only says Chancay possibly used them. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The article describes an amorphous animal with a curled tail but doesn't state the total number of animal designs. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The Chancay's motivations are called a mystery. No specific therapeutic benefits are mentioned, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The article says LSF was first applied to tattoos here, but when? The study was published in 2023, but the mummies were rediscovered in 1981. The technique's first use on tattoos is stated as "until now had never been applied to tattoos". The answer might be "N/A" because the exact year isn't given.

Wait, the study was published on Monday, but the article doesn't specify the current year. The article's date isn't given, so we can't infer the year. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The tattoos are preserved on mummified individuals. The preservation method is mummification, so "mummification".

7. **Question 7:** The article states the patterns are culturally loaded but doesn't specify the ritual meaning of vine-like designs. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The number of mummies at Cerro Colorado isn't mentioned. The article says "mummies featured... had been buried there" but no count. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The study connects Chancay tattoos to their craftsmanship in other areas. The quote from Deter-Wolf says Chancay had high craftsmanship across material culture. So the answer is "high levels of craftsmanship across material culture".

10. **Question 10:** No specific plants are named as sources for pigments. The article doesn't mention this. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The technique is laser-stimulated fluorescence (LSF), used in dinosaur studies. The question mentions therapeutic tattoos, but the study's focus is on Chancay's geometric designs. The answer is LSF.

12. **Question 12:** The mummies were rediscovered in 1981, but the LSF discovery (0.1mm lines) was recent. The question mentions multispectral imaging, but the article says LSF was used, not multispectral. Also, the excavation was 1981. The answer is 1981? Wait, the LSF was applied in the current study, which might be recent. The question asks when the remains were excavated, which is 1981. The multispectral part is a distractor since the article says LSF was used here. So answer is 1981.

Wait, the question says "leading to the discovery of 0.1mm lines through multispectral imaging?" But the article says LSF was used, not multispectral. So the excavation was 1981, but the imaging with multispectral (if that's what the question refers to) isn't mentioned here. Since the article states LSF was used, the multispectral is mentioned as an alternative by Deter-Wolf. So the answer here would be N/A because the imaging method in the question is multispectral, but the article says LSF was used. The excavation date is 1981, but the question is about when they were excavated leading to the discovery via multispectral. Since the article says LSF was used, the answer is N/A.

Hmm, tricky. The question asks when the mummies were excavated using multispectral imaging leading to the discovery. But the excavation was in 1981, and the LSF was done now. So the answer is N/A.

13. **Question 13:** The article mentions cactus needles as a possible tool, like Otzi's. The Chancay might have used cactus needles. The question asks what natural material, in the context of Otzi's therapeutic tattoos, did Chancay use. The answer would be "cactus needle" or "sharpened animal bone". The study suggests puncture tools like cactus needles, so answer is "cactus needle".

14. **Question 14:** The study mentions an amorphous animal with a curled tail. The number of species isn't given. So N/A.

15. **Question 15:** The article mentions a mass grave with cannibalism in England, but the Chancay are in Peru. No connection between Cerro Colorado and the mass grave. So N/A.

16. **Question 16:** The Egyptian mug's hallucinogens are for fertility rites. The article doesn't link it to Chancay's tattoos' purpose. So N/A.

17. **Question 17:** The Eastern Shoshone named a fossil, and the gladiator artifact is in England. The question asks which country has both? The Shoshone are in the US (Eastern Shoshone land), so the answer is "England" for the gladiator, but the fossil naming is in the US. Wait, the article says the gladiator artifact is in England, and the Eastern Shoshone are in the US. So no country has both. So N/A.

Wait, the question says "which indigenous Peruvian plants" but that's question 10. For question 17, the site with Chancay and cannibalism? No. The gladiator artifact is in England, the Shoshone are in the US. The article says "a 2000-year-old copper knife handle found in England shows Roman influence". So the answer is N/A because the Shoshone are in the US, not Peru. Wait, the question says "modern-day country referenced for gladiator artifacts and where Eastern Shoshone named a fossil". The Shoshone are in the US, the gladiator artifact is in England. So no overlap. So N/A.

18. **Question 18:** Deter-Wolf argues the tattoos were made with incisions, not punctures. The study says puncture. So the answer is "incisions, not punctures".

19. **Question 19:** The Kenyan footprints are from two extinct species. The Shoshone-named fossil is an amphibian. The question asks which extinct animal shares habitat with the Kenyan species. The article doesn't link them. N/A.

20. **Question 20:** The Chancay lasted until 1500. The Roman gladiatorial imagery in Peru isn't connected to their decline. The article mentions a Roman artifact in England. No timeframe given for decline correlating with Roman imagery. So N/A.
