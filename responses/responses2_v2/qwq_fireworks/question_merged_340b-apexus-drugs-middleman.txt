Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and follow the strict format.

1. **Virginia King's out-of-pocket cost**: The article says she had a bill over $2,500 but refused to pay, and later the hospital resolved it. She switched to another clinic where her responsibility was nothing. So combined, maybe $2,500? But the question is about "after insurance coverage" at both facilities. The second clinic's bill was $8,000, but her responsibility was $0. The first was $2,500, but she didn't pay. So total would be $2,500? But the article says "After The Times asked... the charge was resolved", so maybe she didn't pay anything. Hmm. The article says she refused and it went to collections, but then after the Times' inquiry, it was resolved. The answer might be $2,500, but maybe she didn't pay. Wait, the question says "after insurance coverage" at both. The first facility's bill was over $2,500 (after insurance paid $10k), but she didn't pay. The second had $0. So total is $2,500? Or N/A because it was resolved? The question says "had to pay", but she didn't. Maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "she refused to pay her $2,500 bill, and the hospital... sent it to collections in July. After The Times asked... it has been resolved." It doesn't say she paid anything, so maybe $0? But the question is about "after insurance coverage". The first bill was her responsibility after insurance, but she didn't pay. The second was $0. So total is $0? The article isn't clear if she paid anything. The answer might be $2,500 (the amount she was billed but didn't pay), but the question is what she had to pay. Since it was resolved, maybe $0? The article doesn't specify, so maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "after insurance coverage", so the $2,500 was her responsibility. Since she didn't pay, maybe the answer is $2,500 (the amount she had to pay, even if she didn't), but the problem is whether "had to pay" implies she actually paid. The article says she refused and it was resolved, so maybe she didn't pay. The answer might be N/A because it's unclear if she paid. Hmm, tricky. The article says "After The Times asked... the charge was resolved" but doesn't specify if she paid. So maybe N/A? Wait, the first part says "her responsibility was nothing" at the new clinic. The first bill was over $2,500, but she refused. The resolution might mean the hospital wrote it off. So she paid $0. So answer is $2,500 (the amount she had to pay) but she didn't. Wait, the question is asking for the total she had to pay, which would be $2,500 + $0 = $2,500. But maybe the resolution meant she didn't have to pay anything, so $0. The article isn't explicit, but the key is "after insurance coverage". The first bill was her responsibility (post-insurance), so she had to pay that, but didn't. The question is asking what she had to pay, not what she actually paid. So maybe $2,500. But the article says the hospital sent it to collections, implying she was supposed to pay but didn't. The answer would be $2,500. But the second clinic's bill had $0. So total is $2,500. So answer is $2,500.

2. **Apexus transition from nonprofit to for-profit**: The article states Apexus was established as a nonprofit in 2007 and became for-profit in 2014. So 2014-2007=7 years. Answer is 7.

3. **Pharmaceutical manufacturer in 2019**: The article mentions Baxter in 2021 wanted to sell non-340B drugs directly. The question is about 2019, which isn't mentioned. So N/A.

4. **Acentrus revenue percentage in 2022 memo**: The 2022 memo says Acentrus resulted in an additional $20 million within the 340B program. But the question is percentage of Apexus' revenue. The article says Apexus projected $227M in 2022. The $20M is part of that? If so, 20/227 â‰ˆ 8.8%, but the article doesn't state the percentage, only the $20M. So the answer is N/A because it's not given as a percentage. Wait, the question is "what percentage of Apexus' revenue came from Acentrus?" The memo says Acentrus added $20M. The total projected revenue was $227M. So 20/227 is approx 8.8%, but the article doesn't explicitly state the percentage, so the answer is N/A.

5. **Oncology drug price increase in NC report**: The article says hospitals in NC billed 85% more for certain cancer drugs. The question is the percentage increase. The answer is 85%.

6. **Duration of oversight after Pedley's reprimand**: The article says after the meeting, regulators reviewed communications for about a month. So answer is 1 month.

7. **Number of complaints between 2019-2022**: The article mentions two complaints: one in 2021 and another in 2022. So total 2. But the time frame is between 2019 and 2022. The complaints were 2021 and 2022, so 2. Answer is 2.

8. **Safety-net providers remaining in 2023**: The article says the program had exploded, now over half of nonprofit hospitals participate. But the initial target was safety-net providers. The question asks what percentage of the initially targeted remained. The article doesn't state the percentage remaining, only that the program has grown. So N/A.

9. **Months of patient records reviewed by Christus**: Apexus advised hospitals to mine records back 36 months. The question is about Christus St. Vincent, but the article says "two employees said" Apexus advised hospitals to mine 36 months. It doesn't specifically say Christus did that. So N/A unless it's a general guideline. The question says "according to Apexus guidelines", so the answer is 36.

10. **Minimum revenue for bonuses**: The 2022 PowerPoint showed bonuses for increased revenue each year, but the exact threshold isn't given. Answer is N/A.

11. **Hospital that misapplied the program**: The article mentions Christus St. Vincent sent the bill to collections but later resolved it, claiming charity care. So answer is Christus St. Vincent.

12. **Projected revenue when doubling**: The article says Apexus was on track to double from 2018 to 2022, projecting $227M in 2022. The doubling would mean from 2018's amount. The 2022 figure is $227M, so the answer is $227 million.

13. **Hosting 340B University and fee-earning**: The article says Apexus hosts 340B University and has fee-earning activities. So answer is Apexus.

14. **Company accused of sales-type employees and 36 months**: The company is Apexus, as per the complaints mentioned. The answer is Apexus.

15. **Year transition to for-profit coinciding with growth**: The transition was 2014, and the article says the program began to explode around the same time. So 2014.

16. **Rival organization suing the government**: The article mentions Premier sued the federal government. Answer is Premier.

17. **Former congressional staff member who criticized**: The article says Marsha Simon helped draft the program and later criticized. So Marsha Simon.

18. **New provider type**: The patient switched to a free-standing oncology clinic not in the program. Answer is free-standing oncology clinic.

19. **NY's 3-year cost increase**: The article states New York's costs increased by over 200% over three years. Answer is 200%.

20. **Business sold last year for specialty drugs**: Acentrus was sold last year. Answer is Acentrus.
