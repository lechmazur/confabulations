Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by going through each question and cross-referencing with the article.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions that the Suez Canal handled 10% of world trade and more than a fifth of container shipments before the attacks. But it doesn't specify which Middle Eastern port city had the largest decline. So, I'll have to say N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The article states that CMA CGM ran a weekly service through the Red Sea and Suez Canal while most vessels went around Africa. It doesn't mention the exact number of vessels allocated to that service. So, N/A again.

3. **Question 3**: The article doesn't provide a specific financial impact figure in billions from the UN. It mentions the Suez's share but not the total financial impact. N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The article says CMA CGM might be the first to return in earnest because they kept a weekly service. So the answer is CMA CGM? Wait, the question is asking which Asian company. CMA CGM is French, not Asian. Hmm, maybe there's another? The article mentions MSC (Swiss), Maersk (Danish), and CMA CGM (French). So maybe the answer is N/A because the Asian company isn't mentioned. Wait, the question specifies an Asian shipping company. The article doesn't name any Asian companies resuming operations first. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The article says some commercial vessels continued using the Red Sea, but most stayed away. It doesn't give a percentage for December 2023 specifically. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The alternative route mentioned is around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, which is 3,500 nautical miles longer than the Suez route. The question asks about the Panama Canal route compared to the African route. The article doesn't mention Panama's route length. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The article doesn't mention insurance premium increases. It talks about shipping costs rising but not insurance. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The article mentions congestion might occur but doesn't specify which European port had the highest. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The article says the Houthis' attacks started in late 2023, and ships diverted. But how many days to implement the transition? No specific number given. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The article states shipping rates rose and now are down 30% from last year's high, but still 200% above pre-attack levels. The question asks for the peak increase during the third quarter. The 200% is compared to pre-attack, not a specific quarter. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The article says CMA CGM ran a weekly service, so they are positioned as the most likely. The answer is CMA CGM. But wait, the question says "which company's weekly service" so yes, CMA CGM.

12. **Question 12**: The article says the average cost is down 30% from last year's high but still nearly 200% more than before the attacks. So the remaining increase is 200% compared to pre-attack levels. The question asks for the percentage that remains despite declines. The answer is 200%.

13. **Question 13**: The article states the Houthis used drones and missiles. The specific capability forcing avoidance is their use of drones and missiles. So the answer is drones and missiles.

14. **Question 14**: The article mentions President Trump's threat of tariffs could cause congestion. So the answer is President Trump.

15. **Question 15**: The article says the African route is 3,500 nautical miles longer. The question asks how many days longer, which is 10 days. The answer is 10.

16. **Question 16**: The analyst Salvatore Mercogliano predicted congestion from oversupply. The question asks who predicted that. The answer is Salvatore Mercogliano.

17. **Question 17**: The article mentions reduced crossings at the Panama Canal as a compounding factor. So the infrastructure is the Panama Canal.

18. **Question 18**: The Suez handled more than a fifth (over 20%) of container shipments. The exact figure is "more than a fifth". The question asks for the percentage. Since the article says "more than a fifth", the answer would be over 20%, but it's not exact. However, the question says "according to UN trade statistics", so maybe it's exactly 20% or more. But the article says "more than a fifth", so perhaps the answer is 20%? Wait, the exact quote is "more than a fifth of container shipments". The question asks for the percentage, so the answer is over 20%, but since the exact figure isn't given beyond "more than a fifth", maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question is asking for the percentage, and "more than a fifth" is a percentage. But the article might not give an exact number. Wait, the article says "more than a fifth of container shipments, according to the United Nations." So the answer is more than 20%, but the question requires a specific percentage. Since it's stated as "more than a fifth", perhaps the answer is N/A because it's not exact. Alternatively, the exact figure isn't given beyond that. Hmm. The question might expect "more than 20%", but the instructions say to use exact numbers if possible. Since it's "more than a fifth", maybe it's 20% as the lower bound, but the exact figure isn't there. So maybe N/A. Wait, but the question says "according to the UN data cited in the article". The article says "more than a fifth", so the UN's data is that it's over 20%. But the question is asking for the percentage. Since it's "more than a fifth", perhaps the answer is N/A because it's not an exact number. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 20%, but the article says "more than a fifth", so the exact figure isn't there. Therefore, N/A. Wait, but maybe the question is expecting the answer as "over 20%". But the instructions require a direct answer. Since the article states "more than a fifth", perhaps the answer is 20% as the minimum, but since it's not exact, maybe it's N/A. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 20% because "a fifth" is 20%, and "more than" just means over that. But the question asks for the percentage the Suez handled prior, so the UN's data would be "more than 20%", but the question wants the exact figure. Since it's not given, perhaps N/A. Wait, maybe the exact figure is "more than a fifth" which is over 20%, but the question wants the percentage. Since it's not a specific number, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 20% as the figure, even if it's stated as "more than". But the article says "more than a fifth", so the exact number isn't given. Therefore, N/A. Wait, but maybe the answer is 20% because it's stated as "a fifth", even though it's more. Hmm. I'm a bit confused here. Let me check again. The article says "the Suez Canal handled 10 percent of world trade and more than a fifth of container shipments, according to the United Nations." So the container shipments are more than 20%. But the question is asking for the percentage, so the exact number isn't provided. Therefore, the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting "more than 20%", but since the instructions require exact numbers, perhaps it's N/A. I'll go with N/A here.

Let me go through each again quickly:

1. N/A
