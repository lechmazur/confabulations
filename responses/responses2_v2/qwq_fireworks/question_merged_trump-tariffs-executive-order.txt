Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1:** Which three European countries did Trump specifically mention as targets for potential tariffs in his Oval Office remarks about trade policy?  
The article mentions Canada and Mexico, but they're North American. The third country mentioned in the context of trade is China. Wait, the question specifies European countries. The article says "Mexico and Canada" as the initial targets, and in the executive order, it mentions Canada, China, and Mexico when discussing migrant and drug flows. But China isn't European. The article doesn't mention three European countries. So maybe the answer is N/A because Canada and Mexico aren't European. Wait, the question says "three European countries," but Trump only mentions Canada and Mexico (which are North American) and China (Asia). So the answer is N/A. Wait, the first sentence says "America's neighbors," which are Canada and Mexico, but no third European country is mentioned. So Q1 answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many percentage points would the External Revenue Service increase tariff collection rates compared to the current Customs and Border Protection system?  
The article mentions the External Revenue Service (ERS) but doesn't provide any specific percentage increase in collection rates. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** What was the total dollar amount of revenue Trump projected the universal tariff would generate to offset his proposed tax cuts?  
The article states Trump praised tariffs for raising revenue to help pay for tax cuts, but no specific dollar amount is given. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Which Cabinet member did Trump task with leading the industrial base review mentioned in the executive order?  
The article says the executive order includes a review of the U.S. industrial and manufacturing base, but it doesn't name a specific Cabinet member. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** What deadline did Trump set for implementing the new External Revenue Service after the feasibility study's completion?  
The executive order asks officials to investigate the feasibility and recommend methods for designing the ERS, but no specific deadline is mentioned after the study. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** How many manufacturing sectors were identified as critical priorities in the national security tariff review portion of the executive order?  
The article doesn't specify the number of sectors. It mentions a review of the industrial and manufacturing base but no count. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** What rate did Trump propose for the "global supplemental tariff" mentioned in relation to trade deficits?  
The article says the order asks to recommend a "global supplemental tariff or other policies." The proposed rate isn't stated here. However, Trump mentioned a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico, but the global one's rate isn't specified. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Which former Trump administration trade official did Lydia Cox cite when discussing the economic impact of tariffs during the Harvard Kennedy School forum?  
The article mentions Lydia Cox, an economist at UW-Madison, but doesn't name a former Trump official she cited. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** What threshold did Trump establish for determining whether a country was manipulating its currency under the new trade policy review?  
The article states the executive order directs assessments of currency manipulation but doesn't specify a threshold. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** How many months did the executive order give agencies to establish the new tariff collection procedures before the Feb 1st deadline?  
The order asks for reports mostly by April 1. The ERS feasibility study is part of this, but the time before Feb 1 isn't specified. Since Feb to April is 2 months, but the question is about before Feb 1, maybe the order was signed on Monday (the article says "Feb. 1, as he signed an executive order"). Wait, the executive order was signed on the same day he mentioned Feb 1 as the tariff start. The reports are due by April 1, so the time between signing (Feb 1) and April 1 is 2 months. But the question is about the time given before Feb 1 to establish procedures. Since the order was just signed on Feb 1, there's no prior period. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** In light of the president’s plan to impose a 25 percent tariff on Canadian and Mexican products and his order to study migrant and drug flows, on what calendar day did he indicate these tariffs might commence?  
The article states Trump said he'd do it Feb. 1. So answer is February 1.

12. **Question 12:** Reflecting on the review that includes investigations of unfair trade practices, technology controls, and the feasibility of creating a new revenue agency, which organization does the president propose to build as an alternative to Customs and Border Protection?  
The External Revenue Service (ERS) is mentioned as the new agency to collect tariffs, replacing Customs and Border Protection's role. So answer is External Revenue Service.

13. **Question 13:** Considering the multifaceted assessment of trade deficits, discriminatory foreign taxes, and currency manipulation mandated by the executive order, by what date are federal agencies expected to deliver their reports?  
The article says "mostly by April 1." So April 1.

14. **Question 14:** Weaving together the president’s concerns over border security and the influx of illicit substances, which illegal drug did he cite as a justification for potentially targeting tariffs against neighboring countries?  
The article says Trump mentioned "fentanyl" coming in from Canada and Mexico. So fentanyl.

15. **Question 15:** Combining elements from the president’s inaugural promise to protect American workers with his approach to using trade policy as leverage, what economic tool is repeatedly credited with benefiting U.S. factories while serving as a bargaining chip in negotiations?  
The article states tariffs are praised for helping U.S. factories and as leverage. So tariffs.

16. **Question 16:** Referring to the potential retaliatory measures that were mentioned alongside discussions of external tariff collection, which government official declared his nation “absolutely ready to respond” to U.S. tariff actions?  
The Canadian finance minister Dominic LeBlanc is quoted as saying that. So Dominic LeBlanc.

17. **Question 17:** Linking the directive to investigate trade imbalances with proposals for fiscal remedies, what compensatory measure did the executive order suggest to address large and persistent trade deficits?  
The order mentions a "global supplemental tariff or other policies" to remedy deficits. So global supplemental tariff.

18. **Question 18:** Integrating the inquiries into unfair trade practices, U.S. technology controls, and discriminatory foreign taxes, which economic imbalance did the order instruct officials to scrutinize as a basis for possible national-security-related tariffs?  
The article says the review includes trade deficits. So large and persistent trade deficits.

19. **Question 19:** According to the article, what day did Mr. Trump indicate would mark the imposition of tariffs, contradicting his earlier social media commitment to act on his first day in office?  
He previously said first day (assuming day of inauguration, which might be Jan 20), but now says Feb 1. The article says he had tweeted in November about imposing on first day, but now says Feb 1. So the answer is February 1, but the contradiction is between his earlier plan (first day) and the new date. The question asks for the day he indicated (Feb 1), so February 1.

20. **Question 20:** Connecting his inaugural address with his broader trade policy strategy, which phrase did the president use to imply a forthcoming revival of economic prosperity despite potential international disruptions?  
The article quotes Trump saying "The American dream will soon be back and thriving like never before." So the phrase is "The American dream will soon be back and thriving like never before."
