Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information given in the article. Let me start by reading through the questions again and then check the article for each answer.

1. **Question 1:** Which Japanese publishing house originally released Uketsu's novels before they were translated to English by HarperVia?  
   The article mentions that "STRANGE PICTURES (HarperVia, 236 pp., paperback, $17.99), the first of Uketsu's novels to be translated into English..." So HarperVia is the English publisher. But the original Japanese publisher isn't named here. The article doesn't mention any other publisher for Uketsu's works in Japanese. So this is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many total murders were committed in the region before the discovery of the mysterious drawing on the receipt?  
   The article says "In the past, a string of unsolved murders plagued the region. In one instance, a man was brutally beaten..." So "a string" implies multiple, but the exact number isn't given. The example given is one instance, but there might be more. However, the question is about total before the discovery. Since the text doesn't specify a number, answer N/A.

3. **Question 3:** What was the name of Ashley Lutin's missing son?  
   The article states Ashley's son went missing but doesn't provide the son's name. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** In what year did Craig Clevenger begin writing The Contortionist's Handbook before its initial 2002 publication?  
   The article says it was "originally published in 2002 and now reissued 23 years later." There's no mention of when he started writing it. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** What medication did John Dolan Vincent overdose on?  
   The text says he "accidentally took too many painkillers." The specific medication isn't named. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** How many steps were involved in Ashley Lutin's ritual of death that included the 30-minute burial?  
   The article mentions "a multistep ritual of death he created where, among other things, he buries people alive in a coffin for 30 minutes." It says "multistep" but doesn't specify the number. Since the exact number isn't given, answer N/A.

7. **Question 7:** What was the name of the blog platform where the students found the widower's posts?  
   The article says the students read a blog but doesn't mention the platform's name. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** What was the medical condition causing John's extra finger?  
   The text states John has an extra finger but doesn't mention the condition's name. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** What was the occupation of the man beaten with a rock while hiking in Strange Pictures?  
   The man was "hiking and painting," so his occupation might be an artist or painter. The article says he was "painting," so maybe his occupation is painter. The text says "a man was brutally beaten to death with a rock while hiking and painting. Among his things was an unusual drawing..." So his occupation is painter. Answer: painter.

10. **Question 10:** How many psychiatric evaluations did John undergo before the one described?  
    The article mentions he's undergoing a psychiatric evaluation as Daniel Fletcher. It doesn't state prior evaluations. So N/A.
