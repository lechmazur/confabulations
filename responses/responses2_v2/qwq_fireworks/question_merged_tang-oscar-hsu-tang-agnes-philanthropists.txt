Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information from the text and answer exactly as per the instructions. Let me go through each question step by step.

1. **Question 1:** The question is asking about a Chinese dynasty minister's descendant who was a key advisor to UNESCO under Obama. The article mentions Agnes Hsu-Tang's father's side, with her ancestor Xu Guangqi, a Ming dynasty minister. It says she worked with UNESCO. So the answer should be Xu Guangqi.

2. **Question 2:** The Tangs contributed to the Fritz Scholder collection? The article mentions a triptych by Scholder in their home but no specific endowment funds for a collection. So maybe N/A.

3. **Question 3:** I.M. Pei's role in Tang's Bronze Age focus. The text says Tang teamed with Pei to form Committee of 100. No direct link to Bronze Age collecting. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Native American artist for Met's Modern wing. Emmi Whitehorse's work is in their home, but the Met's new wing? The article mentions the New York Historical's exhibition with Kay WalkingStick. Fritz Scholder's work is in their apartment, but not the Met's new wing. Maybe N/A unless WalkingStick is considered. Wait, the question says "Met's new Modern wing"â€”the article says the Met's Modern wing got the $125M, but the specific artist? The article mentions Emmi Whitehorse's triptych in their guest room, but not displayed at the Met's new wing. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Douglas Dillon's connection between Princeton's Asian art department and Tang's textile business. The article states that Dillon enlisted Wen Fong (Tang's brother-in-law) as a consultant. But how does that link to the textile business? The text doesn't mention the business connection here. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Oscar Tang's experience during Cultural Revolution influencing Fairbanks support. The article mentions his childhood in Shanghai during war, not the Cultural Revolution (which was 1966-76). He fled in 1949. So the experience mentioned is pre-Cultural Revolution. Hence, the answer is N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Total value of Song dynasty paintings donated. The article says Tang donated 20 paintings from 11th-18th century and the Song scroll "Riverbank". But no total value stated. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Commissioned composition for Vail Dance Festival. The text says Tang helped establish the festival but doesn't mention a specific composition. Damian Woetzel is involved, but no piece named. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Agnes's archaeological work influencing the Wing's design. The article says Hsu-Tang's ancestor Xu Guangqi's connection to Franklin and Voltaire, but her archaeological background (PhD from UPenn) might relate to the democracy wing's theme. However, the article doesn't explicitly state that her work influenced the design. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Yo-Yo Ma's role in Met Opera program. The Committee of 100 was co-founded by Tang, Ma, and Pei. The question asks about a cultural exchange program with the Met Opera. The article mentions Hsu-Tang was on the Met Opera board, but no link to Ma and the Committee's work with the Met Opera. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Hsu-Tang's ancestor's institution similar to Fairbanks. Xu Guangqi collaborated with Jesuits. The article mentions Hsu-Tang's ancestor's work with Ricci. Maybe a school or institution? The Fairbanks is a museum/planetarium. The article doesn't state what Xu established. N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Artistic medium Tang championed at Vail reflecting hardship. He started skiing and supported music festivals. The article says he helped establish Vail Dance Festival. The medium might be dance. So answer: dance.

13. **Question 13:** If $40M went to Met instead of Philharmonic, which department? The Met's Asian department already got donations. So Asian art department.

14. **Question 14:** Financial instrument to avoid, like selling art. The text says selling for commercial purposes is a sign of decay. So maybe stock trading? Or art investment funds? The answer would be "selling art for commercial purposes" but the question asks for an instrument analogous. Maybe "art as an asset for trade" but the exact term isn't given. The article says they avoid selling, so the instrument would be "commercial art sales" but the answer format wants a term. Alternatively, "financial assets" but not sure. Maybe the answer is N/A unless there's a direct term. Wait, the question asks for a financial instrument analogous to selling art. Since they don't sell, perhaps they avoid "selling art as an asset". The answer might be "art as a monetary asset" but the question wants an instrument. Alternatively, maybe "securities" or "stocks"? Not sure. The article says "paintings are not to be traded, not as monetary asset", so the instrument would be trading art for profit. But the question asks for a financial instrument. Maybe "securities" is not right. Hmm. The question might be tricky. The answer could be "art as an investment" but the exact term isn't in the text. Maybe N/A? Wait, the instructions say to infer if possible. The answer should be "selling art for commercial purposes" but the question wants an instrument. Alternatively, "financial speculation" but not sure. Maybe better to say N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Earlier conflict before Chinese Exclusion Act. Tang suggested expanding the exhibition beyond the Exclusion Act. The article says he wanted to include the history of Chinese students and arrivals like himself. The flight from China in 1949 due to Communist revolution? So the conflict might be the Communist revolution or the Boxer Rebellion? The article mentions the 1949 flight, so maybe the Chinese Civil War (1927-1949) or the Communist revolution. The question asks for a conflict predating the Exclusion Act (1882). The Chinese Exclusion Act is 1882, so earlier conflicts like the Opium Wars (1839-1842) or Taiping Rebellion (1850-1864). The article doesn't mention these, so N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Architectural style excluded from the new wing, related to Xu Guangqi's period. Xu was Ming dynasty (16th c.), associated with Jesuit collaborations. The Met's new wing's design focus isn't mentioned, but the article says the wing is Modern/contemporary. The style excluded might be traditional Chinese (like Ming) since it's a modern wing. So answer: Ming dynasty style.

17. **Question 17:** Historical event connected to Hsu-Tang's lineage and Franklin. The article says Xu Guangqi introduced Confucius to Voltaire, which Franklin encountered. The event is the Jesuit collaboration in the 17th century (Ricci and Xu). So the event is the Jesuit mission in China, or the cultural exchange between Jesuits and China.

18. **Question 18:** Artistic medium as a cultural bridge if Committee focused on art. The dining room has bronze bells (Warring States) and Ming cabinet. So bronze artifacts or Chinese bronzes.

19. **Question 19:** Academic institution for "Riverbank" analysis. Hsu-Tang has a PhD from UPenn. The Met's symposium might have involved Princeton (since Wen Fong was there). The article says the Met convened a symposium, but the institution could be Princeton or UPenn. Since Wen Fong was at Princeton, maybe Princeton.

20. **Question 20:** Performance type contrasting with classical. The article says Tang compared pop songs to classical, stating classical endures. So the answer is pop songs.
