Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and follow the instructions strictly. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks for the percentage reduction in all-cause mortality the National Academies panel attributed to heavy drinking. Wait, the article says the panel found moderate drinking linked to 16% lower all-cause mortality. But the question mentions "heavy drinking"—but the article's data is about moderate. The question might have a mistake. Since the article doesn't mention heavy drinking's effect here, the answer is N/A. Wait, let me check again. The National Academies panel's findings were about moderate drinking. The question says "heavy drinking" which isn't in the data. So answer is N/A.

2. Dr. Amanda Berger responded to a cancer report. The American Association for Cancer Research report linked cancers to alcohol. The Distilled Spirits Council refers to dietary guidelines. The National Cancer Institute links moderate drinking to breast, colorectal, esophageal, and head/neck cancers. The question asks which cancer Dr. Berger addressed. Since she was responding to a report that included cancers caused by alcohol, maybe breast cancer? But the question says "specific type"—the article mentions breast cancer in the context of the panel's report. Alternatively, maybe the ACR report mentioned breast cancer. But the Distilled Spirits Council's response would likely mention a cancer that's in the guidelines. The answer might be breast cancer. Wait, the article says the panel noted a heightened risk of breast cancer. So Dr. Berger, in her response, might address that. So the answer is breast cancer.

3. The question is about what action Congress took in late 2020 regarding funding for research on moderate drinking's impact on cardiovascular disease. Wait, the article says in late 2022, Congress gave $1.3 million to the National Academies. The question mentions 2020, so that's incorrect. So answer is N/A.

4. The former Canadian director criticized the panel's exclusion of studies. The NCI links moderate drinking to colorectal, esophageal, head/neck, and breast cancers. The panel's meta-analysis on cardiovascular included only four papers, possibly excluding cancer studies. The question asks which cancer linked by NCI was excluded. Since the panel focused on cardiovascular, maybe they excluded cancers. The article says they excluded many studies of alcohol's harms, including cancers. The specific ones NCI mentions are colorectal, esophageal, head/neck. The answer could be colorectal or one of those. The article says "colorectal cancer, at least one type of esophageal cancer, and cancers of the head and neck". The question asks which was excluded from the meta-analysis, which was on cardiovascular. Since the meta-analysis was about cardiovascular, maybe colorectal cancer was excluded. The answer is colorectal cancer.

5. The governmental committee's analysis is by the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Prevention of Underage Drinking. The article says their analysis focuses on health outcomes known to be caused by alcohol, not merely associated. So the primary focus would be on causally linked outcomes. The answer is health outcomes caused by alcohol.

6. Dr. Nestle mentioned the industry feared warning labels if guidelines tightened. The question asks what labeling requirement was feared. The answer is warning labels.

7. The question asks for the percentage of Americans believing moderate drinking is beneficial. The Gallup poll in July found 45% think 1-2 drinks are bad. So the opposite would be 55%? But the question asks specifically about cardiovascular benefit. The article doesn't state that exact percentage. The article only mentions the 45% believe it's bad. So the answer is N/A.

8. The panel's recommendation on two drinks for men and one for women. The article says the guidelines kept to the advice of moderate consumption. The panel's report supported moderate drinking. The question asks what recommendation they made. The panel found moderate drinking linked to lower cardiovascular deaths, so they might have supported the existing guidelines. The answer is N/A, since the question says "specific recommendation"—maybe they didn't change it, so the existing one remains. The article says the panel's findings could influence guidelines to stay the same. The answer might be "upholding the existing guidelines allowing up to two drinks for men and one for women".

Wait, the question says "what specific recommendation... did the National Academies panel make regarding the consumption of two daily drinks for men and one for women?" The panel's report supported moderate drinking's benefits, so maybe they endorsed the existing guidelines. The article says "the guidelines kept to the advice that moderate consumption... is safe". The panel's report might have supported that. So the answer is "endorsed the existing guidelines allowing up to two drinks for men and one for women".

9. The organization co-founded by Diane Riibe is the U.S. Alcohol Policy Alliance. The article says she co-founded it and criticized the report. So the answer is U.S. Alcohol Policy Alliance.

10. The question asks for a health outcome other than cardiovascular and breast cancer linked to moderate drinking. The panel found all-cause mortality lower, but that's not a specific disease. Wait, the article says the panel concluded moderate drinking was linked to fewer cardiovascular deaths, fewer all-cause deaths, and higher breast cancer. The epidemiologist (Dr. Calonge) mentions those three. The question asks for another outcome. The article says the panel didn't find other cancers linked, but maybe stroke deaths are part of cardiovascular. The answer might be "lower risk of all-cause mortality" but the question wants a specific health outcome other than the two mentioned. Since the question specifies "other than cardiovascular and breast cancer", the answer is "reduced cardiovascular disease deaths and all-cause mortality" but the question wants a different outcome. Wait, maybe stroke deaths are part of cardiovascular. The article doesn't mention another specific. So N/A? Or perhaps the question is tricking, since the panel's three findings are cardiovascular deaths, all-cause mortality, and breast cancer. So the other outcome is all-cause mortality reduction. But the question asks for a health outcome other than those two diseases. Maybe "all-cause mortality" is the answer.

11. The countries mentioned besides WHO, UK, and Canada? The article says "the World Health Organization, Canadian health authorities, the United Kingdom and several other countries". The "several other countries" are not named, so the answer is N/A.

12. The National Cancer Institute links moderate drinking to colorectal, etc. The National Academies panel didn't link moderate drinking to other cancers beyond breast. So the answer is colorectal cancer.
