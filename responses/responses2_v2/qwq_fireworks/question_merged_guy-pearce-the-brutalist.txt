Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict formatting instructions. Let me start reading through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: Which Australian soap opera actor mentioned in the article went directly to Hollywood without first establishing themselves in Australian theater?

The article mentions that Guy Pearce was on "Neighbours" and then moved to Hollywood, but I need to check if there's any mention of others. The text says "One of the funniest things Russell ever said to me was that he and I were the last two over the bridge before they took the toll off." So Russell Crowe is mentioned here. But the question is about someone who went directly without first establishing in Australian theater. Wait, the article says "the Chris Hemsworths, the Heath Ledgers, all those people kind of went, 'I'll do one job and then go to Hollywood, thanks,' and fair enough, good on them." Hemsworth and Ledger are mentioned as those who went directly. But the question asks for an actor from a soap. The soap mentioned is "Neighbours" where Pearce was. The actress who approached him was determined to succeed in Hollywood, but her name isn't given. The question is about an actor from a soap who went directly. The answer might be N/A because the text doesn't name a specific actor who did that. Wait, the question specifies "mentioned in the article". The only actors mentioned in the context of soaps are Pearce (from Neighbours) and the young actress who asked him about agents, but she's not named. The text says "the Chris Hemsworths, the Heath Ledgers, all those people kind of went, 'I'll do one job and then go to Hollywood, thanks,' and fair enough, good on them." Hemsworth and Ledger are examples of those who went directly. But the question is about a soap opera actor. Hemsworth wasn't in a soap, but Pearce was. However, the question is about someone who went directly to Hollywood without Australian theater. The article says "Australian actors would go, 'I'm going to go to theater school so that I can get an American agent.'" So maybe the ones who didn't do theater school went directly? But the answer might be N/A because the question requires a specific actor from a soap mentioned in the article who did that. Since the only named soap actor is Pearce, but he didn't go directly, the answer would be N/A. Wait, the question says "went directly to Hollywood without first establishing themselves in Australian theater". If the soap actors like Pearce did theater school first, then maybe N/A. The article doesn't mention Hemsworth or Ledger being in soaps. So the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "soap opera actor mentioned in the article". The only ones mentioned are Pearce and the young actress (unnamed) who was filming in Australia. Since the actress isn't named, the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: What was the name of the community center that Van Buren commissioned Toth to design in Pennsylvania?

Looking through the article: "commissions him to design a community center that could be the capstone to both men's careers." The name of the center isn't mentioned. So the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3**: How many years passed between Guy Pearce's departure from "Neighbours" and his role in "Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"?

The article says Pearce was on "Neighbours" from '85 to '89. "Priscilla" was in 1994. So 1994 - 1989 = 5 years. Answer: 5.

4. **Question 4**: Which HBO show did Guy Pearce appear in with Kate Winslet that was set in Pennsylvania?

The article mentions "Mare of Easttown" and "Mildred Pierce" as HBO shows with Winslet. "Mare of Easttown" is set in Pennsylvania (the community center in the article is in PA, but the question is about the HBO show). The article says "supporting Kate Winslet in two HBO shows, 'Mildred Pierce' and 'Mare of Easttown'." "Mare of Easttown" is set in Pennsylvania. So answer: Mare of Easttown.

5. **Question 5**: What was the budget of "The Brutalist" that allowed for its ambitious VistaVision filming format?

The article doesn't mention the budget. Answer: N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Who was the young Australian actress that approached Pearce about his American agents?

The article says "a young actress introduced herself by asking who his American agents were." But her name isn't given. Answer: N/A.

7. **Question 7**: What role did Carice van Houten play in "The Brutalist" alongside Pearce?

The article mentions that Pearce shares a son with Carice van Houten, but doesn't specify her role in the film. Answer: N/A.

8. **Question 8**: How many Academy Awards did "L.A. Confidential" win when it was released?

The article says "best-picture winners like 'The King's Speech' and 'The Hurt Locker'". "L.A. Confidential" is mentioned as a classic but no awards count. The article doesn't state how many Oscars it won. Answer: N/A.

9. **Question 9**: What role did Guy Pearce play in "The Time Machine" that made him realize blockbusters weren't for him?

The article mentions "The Time Machine" as a studio blockbuster he found a poor fit. His role there isn't named. Answer: N/A.

10. **Question 10**: What northern English city did Guy Pearce's mother come from before moving to Australia?

The article says his mother was from the north of England but doesn't name the city. Answer: N/A.

11. **Question 11**: What role did the young actress, who inquired about Guy Pearce's American agents while he was filming in Australia, play in "The Brutalist"?

The actress isn't mentioned in the article as being in "The Brutalist". The question is about her role there, but she's not in the film. Answer: N/A.

12. **Question 12**: How many Golden Globe awards has the director of "The Brutalist," Brady Corbet, won for his work on the film?

The article mentions Pearce's Golden Globe nomination but doesn't say Corbet won any. Answer: N/A.

13. **Question 13**: What studio produced "The Brutalist," starring Guy Pearce, in VistaVision?

The article doesn't mention the studio. Answer: N/A.

14. **Question 14**: What is the name of the community center that Laszlo Toth is commissioned to design in Pennsylvania, a project that could be the capstone of both his and Harrison Lee Van Buren's careers?

Same as question 2; no name given. Answer: N/A.

15. **Question 15**: What long-running soap opera did Guy Pearce star in, alongside future Hollywood stars like the Hemsworth brothers, before his breakout role in "Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"?

The soap was "Neighbours". Hemsworth isn't mentioned as being on it, but the question says "alongside future Hollywood stars like the Hemsworth brothers"â€”but the article says "the Hemsworths" as examples of those who later went to Hollywood. Since the soap is "Neighbours", answer: Neighbours.

16. **Question 16**: What specific format, other than VistaVision, was "The Brutalist" filmed in, appealing to cinephiles who appreciate classic filmmaking techniques?

The article mentions VistaVision and an intermission. No other format is stated. Answer: N/A.

17. **Question 17**: What was the title of the television series Guy Pearce was filming in Australia when a young actress, eager to succeed in Hollywood, asked him about his American agents?

The article says "a few years ago, as Guy Pearce filmed a television series in his native Australia..." The name of the series isn't mentioned. Answer: N/A.

18. **Question 18**: What best-picture winning film, starring Guy Pearce, did the author's mother find particularly distasteful due to its release coinciding with the anniversary of a personal tragedy?

The article mentions his mother's disdain for Elvis Presley's death overshadowing her husband's death anniversary. The question asks for a best-picture film with Pearce. "The King's Speech" and "The Hurt Locker" are mentioned as best-picture winners he appeared in. But the mother's distaste was about Elvis's death, not a film. The question seems to confuse this. The article says the mother's disdain was for Elvis, not a film. So the answer is N/A because there's no film mentioned that caused her distaste.

19. **Question 19**: What specific type of intellectual disability does Guy Pearce's sister have, which made him sensitive to the vacuous nature of fame?

The article says his sister has an intellectual disability but doesn't specify the type. Answer: N/A.

20. **Question 20**: In what year did Guy Pearce win his first acting award, solidifying his decision to pursue a career in Hollywood despite his initial reluctance?

The article mentions a Golden Globe nomination for "The Brutalist" but doesn't state he won it. His first award isn't mentioned. Answer: N/A.
