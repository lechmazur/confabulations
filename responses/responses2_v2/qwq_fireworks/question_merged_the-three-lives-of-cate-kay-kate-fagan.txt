Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article and not any outside knowledge. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** "In which year did Amanda's sister first learn about Annie's true identity as the author of 'The Very Last'?"  
The article mentions Annie's sister (Amanda's little sister?) but doesn't specify when Amanda's sister found out. The text says Annie fled and later wrote the book, but there's no year given for when the sister learned. So probably N/A.

2. **Question 2:** "How many different film adaptations were made of Ryan Channing's earlier works before she was cast in 'The Very Last'?"  
The article says Ryan was cast in the film adaptation of "The Very Last," but it doesn't mention any prior film adaptations of her earlier works. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** "What was the original title of Annie's manuscript before it became 'The Very Last'?"  
The original title is "The Very Last" as per the article. So maybe N/A since that's the title it had from the start.

Wait, the article says "The Very Last" is the title of the novel within the novel. So the original title was the same. So answer N/A?

11. **Question 11:** "In the layered narrative of the debut novel, which year is marked by the underground broadcast incident that ultimately sets in motion the memoir revealing a cascade of hidden identities?"  
The article starts with the year 2000 when Samantha and Jeremiah are in the garage during the nuclear bomb. That's the incident setting things off. So the answer is 2000.

12. **Question 12:** "Which small-town character, initially in love with her best friend and later manipulated into assuming a new name, is central to the coded messages embedded solely for a lost companion?"  
Annie is in love with Amanda, gets manipulated by Sidney to become Cass, and writes coded messages for Amanda. So the answer is Annie.

13. **Question 13:** "In the dramatic sequence that led to a cultural phenomenon, what catastrophic occurrence in an underground setting sparked the transformation of a story into multiple media adaptations?"  
The nuclear bomb dropping in the underground garage where Samantha and Jeremiah were. The answer is a nuclear bomb dropping.

14. **Question 14:** "Which in-universe literary work, later reimagined as a blockbuster movie trilogy, a limited TV series, a range of action figures, and even a theme park, plays a pivotal role in the evolution of the protagonist’s narrative?"  
That's "The Very Last" by Cate Kay. The answer is "The Very Last".

15. **Question 15:** "Which celebrity figure struggles with the tension between her public persona and an obscured true self, as reflected by her disoriented feelings about the boundary between authenticity and artifice?"

Annie's account, writing coded messages for Amanda. So Annie.

20. **Question 20:** "Which literary work is portrayed as the embodiment of the protagonist’s inner conflict—revealing a life of regrettable choices while earnestly seeking unconditional approval?"  
"The Three Lives of Cate Kay" is the memoir where Annie/Cate reveals her story. The work itself is the answer, but the question refers to the literary work within the story. The memoir is part of the novel, so maybe "The Three Lives of Cate Kay" or "The Very Last"? Wait, the memoir is written by Cate Kay (Annie) to reveal her story. The article says "The Three Lives of Cate Kay" is the title of the novel, which includes her memoir. The question is about the literary work that is her memoir. But the article might refer to the memoir as part of the novel. Alternatively, the answer might be "The Very Last" but that's the novel within the novel. Wait, the article says "The Three Lives of Cate Kay" is the novel where she writes the memoir. The memoir is part of the novel's structure. The question asks which work is the embodiment of her inner conflict. The answer is "The Three Lives of Cate Kay" as the memoir is within it. Alternatively, maybe the memoir itself isn't named, but the main book is. The article says "The Three Lives of Cate Kay" is the title of Fagan's novel. The memoir within the story is part of the structure. The exact answer might be "The Three Lives of Cate Kay" since that's the title of the book that includes her confession. Alternatively, the memoir is part of the novel. The question says "literary work" that embodies her conflict. Since the memoir is part of the novel's plot, the answer would be "The Very Last" but that's the novel within. Hmm. The article states that Annie writes "The Very Last" with coded messages. The memoir is part of the plot where she decides to reveal everything. The memoir's exact title isn't given, but the book within the story is "The Very Last". The question refers to the work that's the memoir, but the article says she writes a memoir that includes other perspectives. Wait, the article says "her agent urges her to write a memoir that delivers 'the full story,' and she agrees, with the caveat that other perspectives be included." So the memoir is part of the novel's structure, but the title of the memoir isn't given. The main title is "The Three Lives of Cate Kay". Since the question asks for the literary work that embodies her conflict, maybe the answer is "The Three Lives of Cate Kay" as that's the novel where she tells her story. Alternatively, the memoir within the story isn't named beyond being part of the novel. Since the question is about the work within the story that's her memoir, but it's not named, perhaps N/A. Wait, the article says "The Three Lives of Cate Kay" is the title of Fagan's novel, which includes Annie's memoir. The memoir itself isn't named as a separate work, so perhaps the answer is the same as the novel's title. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "The Very Last" because that's the book she wrote under a pseudonym. Wait, the memoir is separate from "The Very Last". The article says she decides to write a memoir after the success of "The Very Last". The memoir is the one where she reveals her true identity. So the memoir's title isn't given, so the answer would be N/A? Or is the memoir part of the "Three Lives" structure? The article says the novel is structured with multiple perspectives, including the memoir. Therefore, the literary work that's the memoir is part of the novel "The Three Lives of Cate Kay", so the answer would be "The Three Lives of Cate Kay". Hmm, tricky. The question is about the literary work that embodies her inner conflict. Since the memoir is part of that novel, maybe the answer is the novel's title. Alternatively, the memoir isn't named, so N/A. The article says "the memoir" but doesn't give its title. So the answer would be N/A. Wait, the question says "literary work portrayed as...", so perhaps the novel itself, "The Three Lives of Cate Kay". I'll go with that since that's the title of the book that includes her memoir.
