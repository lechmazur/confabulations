Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked without any extra details. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks about the number of student clubs West Point ended due to the D.E.I. ban, mentioned in the Palisades fires context. Wait, the Palisades fires were referenced by the environmental law professor, but the DEI part is a separate section. The article says "DEI: West Point leaders complied with President Trump's D.E.I. ban by ending a dozen student clubs." So the answer is a dozen, which is 12. But the question specifically mentions the Palisades fires. Wait, the Palisades fires are in the paragraph about the energy emergency and legal challenges. The DEI part is a separate bullet point. The mention of Palisades fires is in the quote from Patrick Parenteau. The question links the Palisades fires to the DEI clubs? That might be a trick. Wait, the question says "Considering the Palisades fires mentioned...", but the DEI clubs are in a different section. Since the Palisades fires are in a different context, maybe the question is a distractor. Wait, but the DEI bullet point doesn't mention Palisades. So the answer is 12, but the question's mention of Palisades might be irrelevant. Since the question is about the DEI clubs, the answer is "a dozen" which is 12. So answer is 12.

2. The second question: average gasoline price drop over the past 12 months. The fracking executive's position. The article states "Chris Wright, a fracking executive who is Mr. Trump's choice to lead the Energy Department..." So the position is Energy Department's leader, which is Secretary of Energy. So answer is Secretary of Energy.

3. Third question: Representative Frank Pallone's statement. The question asks which publication was targeted alongside CBS News. The article's last bullet point mentions "Media: First Amendment experts still believe that Trump's cases against CBS News and The Des Moines Register lack legal merit." So the answer is The Des Moines Register.

4. Fourth question: ClearView Energy Partners' managing director (Timothy Fox) talked about offshore wind leases. The question asks about the facility besides Guantanamo Bay for migrants. The article's immigration section says "U.S Forces are also preparing a tent city to house as many as 30,000 migrants." So tent city.

5. Fifth question: Palisades fires again. The trade group that applauded Trump's oil and gas path is the American Petroleum Institute, mentioned in the article: "Mike Sommers, the president of the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group."

6. Sixth question: Supreme Court's EPA authority. The law passed during Trump's term that's at odds with clean energy investments. The article mentions the infrastructure law and Inflation Reduction Act. The question says "during Trump's term"—those were passed under Biden. Wait, the article says "the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which together pumped hundreds of billions of dollars into clean energy and electric vehicles. The order appears aimed at stopping the government from distributing funds...". Since those laws were passed under Biden, but the question asks which law passed during Trump's term. Wait, the question says "during Trump's term"—but the article doesn't mention any law passed under Trump related. Maybe the question is a trick. Wait, the article says "the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law" and "2022 Inflation Reduction Act"—both under Biden. So the answer would be N/A? Wait, the question says "which law passed during Trump's term is portrayed as being at odds with his move..." Since Trump is the current president here (as per the article's context), but those laws were under Biden. The question might have an incorrect premise. Since the article doesn't mention any law passed during Trump's term (assuming he just started), then answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "passed during Trump's term"—maybe the user is confused. The article doesn't mention any such law, so N/A.

Wait, let me check again. The article says "the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act"—those were under Biden. The question is asking for a law passed during Trump's term, but the article doesn't mention any. So answer is N/A.

Wait, but the question might be referring to the infrastructure law that Trump signed? Wait, the article says "the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law"—so that was passed under Biden. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

7. Seventh question: ClearView Energy Partners' statement about offshore wind leases. The question asks for the percentage of electric cars in California. The article states "In California, roughly 25 percent of new cars sold are now electric." So 25%.

8. Eighth question: Robert N. Stavins's comments. The economist's name for the social cost of carbon. The article says "the calculation relied on the work of William Nordhaus, the economist who developed the concept of the social cost of carbon." So William Nordhaus.

9. Ninth question: Advanced Energy United's president (Heather O'Neill) mentions global energy dominance. The environmental group's president who called the orders "completely out of touch" is Earthjustice's Abigail Dillen. The article states "Abigail Dillen, the president of Earthjustice, an environmental group, called Mr. Trump's executive orders 'completely out of touch'..." So Earthjustice.

10. Tenth question: oil and gas producer in West Texas. The article says "Steve Pruett, chief executive of Elevation Resources LLC, an oil and gas producer in West Texas." So Elevation Resources LLC.

11. Eleventh question: the law passed during Trump's term conflicting with clean energy investments. Wait, as before, the laws were under Biden. The question might be a trick. The article says Trump is blocking funds from the 2021 infrastructure and 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Those were passed when Trump wasn't in office. The question asks which law passed during Trump's term is at odds. Since there's none, answer N/A. Wait, maybe the question is referring to a different law? Let me check again. The article says "the president has ordered that federal agencies stop spending money approved by Congress when it passed the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act". So those were passed under Biden, so the answer is N/A.

Wait, the question says "which law passed during Trump's term is portrayed as being at odds with his move..." Since those laws were passed when Trump wasn't in office (assuming current administration is Trump's new term), then there's no such law. So N/A.

12. Twelfth question: clean-energy installation vital for lowering costs but targeted. The article mentions electric vehicle charging stations and renewable projects. The question says "installation" – perhaps wind projects? The article states "he wants to block thousands of megawatts of planned wind projects that could power homes and businesses." So wind turbines or wind projects. Alternatively, the Advanced Energy United's statement mentions solar panels, wind turbines, battery storage. The question says "installation" that's targeted. The answer would be wind projects. But the exact wording? The article says "planned wind projects" so maybe "wind turbines" or "wind energy projects".

Alternatively, the question says "installation is described as both vital for lowering energy costs and yet targeted". The article says "Renewable energy companies... sought to cast themselves as the answer to Mr. Trump's call for lower energy costs... A freeze on investing in the technologies we need to power our grid and vehicles threatens our ability to lower costs..." So the answer could be electric vehicle charging stations? Or wind turbines? Let me check the exact quote. The Advanced Energy United president says "freeze on investing in the technologies we need to power our grid and vehicles threatens our ability to lower costs, create energy abundance, and win the race for global energy dominance." The technologies include wind, solar, etc. The specific installations targeted: the article mentions offshore wind leases being revoked. So maybe offshore wind facilities.

The question says "installation" that's both vital and targeted. The answer is wind turbines or offshore wind projects. The article mentions "offshore wind leases" in the context of Trump's order. So "offshore wind facilities" or "wind energy projects".

Alternatively, the question might be about electric vehicle charging stations, which Pallone mentions as being halted. The answer would be electric vehicle charging stations. Let me check the exact wording: "halt funding for electric vehicle charging stations that Congress has already authorized." So electric vehicle charging stations are being targeted. But the question says "installation" and "vital for lowering energy costs". The Advanced Energy United president mentions EVs as part of the needed tech. So the answer is electric vehicle charging stations.

13. Thirteenth question: EPA's greenhouse gas authority under threat despite Supreme Court ruling. The article says "Mr. Trump raised the possibility of reversing the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to regulate greenhouse gases, which has been confirmed by the Supreme Court..." So the answer is EPA.

14. Fourteenth question: excluded energy tech from the definition. The article states "the phrase 'energy resources' was defined as... solar panels, wind turbines or battery storage, which are three of the fastest-growing sources... were not mentioned." So wind turbines and solar are excluded. The question asks which is notably excluded. The answer is solar panels, wind turbines, or battery storage. Since the question says "rapidly expanding form of energy technology" excluded, perhaps solar panels, but the exact wording in the article says "no mention of solar panels, wind turbines or battery storage". So any of those. The first one listed is solar panels. But the question might want the most specific. The question says "rapidly expanding form" so perhaps wind turbines? Or battery storage. But the question says "even though similar technologies are growing quickly". The answer is solar panels, wind turbines, or battery storage. Let me check the exact quote: "There was no mention of solar panels, wind turbines or battery storage, which are three of the fastest-growing sources of electric capacity in the United States." So any of the three. The question asks "which" so probably the first one mentioned? The answer could be solar panels, wind turbines, or battery storage. Since the question says "notably excluded", maybe wind turbines. Alternatively, the answer is all three, but the question asks for one. The article lists them in order: solar panels first. So solar panels?

15. Fifteenth question: industry executives promised tax cuts for a billion-dollar contribution. The article says "At one fund-raising dinner in the spring, Mr. Trump told oil and gas executives they should donate $1 billion to his campaign..." So oil and gas executives.

16. Sixteenth question: judicial confirmation underpinning EPA's power at risk. The EPA's authority was confirmed by the Supreme Court. The question says "judicial confirmation" might refer to the Supreme Court's ruling. But the article says "the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to regulate greenhouse gases, which has been confirmed by the Supreme Court, and proposed to halt funding...". The judicial confirmation here is the Supreme Court's ruling. So the answer is the Supreme Court's confirmation.

17. Seventeenth question: renewable facility outperforming coal. The article states "In the United States last year, solar panels and wind turbines produced more electricity than the nation's coal-fired power plants for the first time ever." So wind turbines or solar panels. The question says "renewable facility"—so either. The answer could be wind turbines or solar panels. Since it says "solar panels and wind turbines", the answer is solar panels and wind turbines, but the question asks for the type. The answer is wind turbines and solar panels collectively, but perhaps "wind turbines" or "solar panels". The question might want "wind turbines and solar panels" but since it's a single answer, maybe "wind turbines" as the first mentioned? Wait the exact quote: "solar panels and wind turbines produced more electricity than coal". The answer is solar panels and wind turbines. But the question says "type of renewable facility"—so the answer is solar panels and wind turbines, but since it's one answer, perhaps "wind turbines" or "solar panels". Alternatively, the answer is both, but the question might expect "wind turbines" as an example. Hmm. Alternatively, the question says "which clean-energy installation is described as both vital for lowering energy costs and yet targeted..." but that was question 12. Wait, this is question 17: "which type of renewable facility is cited as having recently outperformed coal-fired power plants..." The answer is solar panels and wind turbines. But the question says "type", so maybe "wind and solar" but the exact term in the article is "solar panels and wind turbines". Since the answer must be one word or phrase, perhaps "wind turbines" or "solar panels". Alternatively, the answer is "solar panels and wind turbines", but that's two. The question might accept either. Let me check the exact wording. The article says "solar panels and wind turbines produced more electricity than..." so the answer is solar panels and wind turbines. But since the question asks for "type of renewable facility", maybe "solar and wind energy" but the article uses "solar panels and wind turbines". Since the options are separate, but the question asks for "type", perhaps the answer is wind turbines. Alternatively, the answer should be "solar panels and wind turbines" as the combined answer. Since the user wants a direct answer, perhaps the answer is "solar panels and wind turbines". But the format requires a concise answer. Let me see if there's a better way. The question is asking for the type, so "wind and solar" might be acceptable. Alternatively, since the question says "type", maybe "wind turbines" is sufficient.

18. Eighteenth question: economic measure being eliminated. The article says "social cost of carbon" is the metric being eliminated. The answer is social cost of carbon.

19. Nineteenth question: assertion undermining the emergency rationale. The article states "By any economic measure, the United States is not facing an energy emergency, experts said. America is the world's largest producer of oil and natural gas, and the price of oil, about $76 per barrel, is roughly the same as the average cost over the past 20 years, adjusted for inflation. The cost of gasoline, about $3.13 per gallon, has dropped about 3 percent over the past 12 months." So the assertion is that the US is not facing an energy emergency. The answer is "the United States is not facing an energy emergency" or the specific points. The question asks for the assertion that undermines the rationale. The direct answer would be "the United States is not facing an energy emergency" but maybe the specific fact about oil and gas production. The question asks for the assertion that undermines the emergency rationale, so the answer is "the United States is not facing an energy emergency" as stated by experts.

20. Twentieth question: individual leading Energy Department acknowledging climate change. The article says "Chris Wright... was Mr. Trump's choice to lead the Energy Department... Mr. Wright clarified that he believed climate change was 'a global challenge that we need to solve.'" So the answer is Chris Wright.
