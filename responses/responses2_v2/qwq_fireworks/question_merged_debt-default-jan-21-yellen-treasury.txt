merged_debt-default-jan-21-yellen-treasury.txt
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked and not infer beyond the text.

1. **Question 1**: The prompt for suspending investments in the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund is mentioned in the article. It says that as part of the extraordinary measures, Yellen would suspend certain investments in that fund. The reason is to avoid breaching the debt limit. The answer should be the "extraordinary measures" to prevent default.

2. **Question 2**: Scott Bessent's initial skepticism is noted. The article states he would study market participants' views. The question asks for specific market feedback he cited. However, the text doesn't mention specific feedback, only that he would survey them. Since there's no specific feedback cited, maybe "N/A".

3. **Question 3**: The article mentions West Point ended a dozen student clubs due to the D.E.I. ban. But the closure of U.S.A.I.D. is separate. The question links the two, but the article doesn't say the clubs were closed because of the USAID closure. So the answer is 12, but since the reason (closure of USAID) isn't connected, maybe "N/A". Wait, the question says "as a result of the order that also led to the closure of U.S.A.I.D." But the order causing USAID closure was Trump's call, not the same as the D.E.I. ban. So the two are separate. Therefore, the answer is 12, but since the reason is wrong, "N/A".

4. **Question 4**: Yellen implemented suspending investments in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. The question asks for an additional measure similar to suspending savings plans. The article mentions suspending investments in Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund as part of the same measures. Wait, the question asks for an additional measure besides the accounting maneuvers. The answer is suspending investments in the Civil Service fund.

5. **Question 5**: The article says Yellen didn't initiate legal actions. The legal actions mentioned are Trump's lawsuits against CBS and the Register. The question asks about legal actions by Treasury under Yellen related to debt limit. Since none are mentioned, "N/A".

6. **Question 6**: The Bipartisan Policy Center projects the X-date in summer, but the exact month isn't given. The article mentions "sometime this summer". The question links it to when Trump called to close USAID. The USAID closure was mentioned as happening "hours before most of its staff were expected to be suspended", but the month isn't specified. Since the X-date is summer and the call was made presumably before, but no month given, so "N/A".

7. **Question 7**: The stated reason by Trudeau for his comments was linking Canada's critical minerals to Trump's comments about making it a U.S. state. The answer is Canada's wealth of critical minerals.

8. **Question 8**: The tent city's capacity is 30,000 migrants. The number of migrants in Guantanamo is 10. The question says the number is related, but they're different (30k vs 10). The answer is 30,000, but the question asks for the maximum capacity which is 30,000. The second part is about the number related to the 10 migrants, but they are separate. So the answer is 30,000.

9. **Question 9**: The technicality mentioned by Yellen in December was a "technical issue related to federal investments". The answer is federal investments.

10. **Question 10**: Mnuchin described the debt limit as "ridiculous" when he was Treasury Secretary. The article says his predecessor (Yellen's predecessor) was Mnuchin in 2017. So his role was Treasury Secretary.

11. **Question 11**: The nominee for Treasury leadership is Scott Bessent, who said the U.S. won't default if confirmed. The answer is Scott Bessent.

12. **Question 12**: The period starting Jan 21 through March 14 is the debt issuance suspension. The start date is Jan 21.

13. **Question 13**: Mnuchin made the "ridiculous concept" comment in 2017, echoed by Yellen. The question asks who earlier said it. The answer is Steven T. Mnuchin.

14. **Question 14**: The fund impaired is the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, as Yellen couldn't fully invest in it.

15. **Question 15**: West Point shut down a dozen clubs due to the D.E.I. ban. The answer is West Point.

16. **Question 16**: The leader linking minerals to U.S. state comments is Justin Trudeau (Canada's PM). The answer is Canada.

17. **Question 17**: The reporter is Alan Rappeport.

18. **Question 18**: The debt limit suspension expired on Jan 2, so the month is January.

19. **Question 19**: The facility holding migrants is Guantanamo Bay.

20. **Question 20**: The agency targeted is U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).
