Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article provided. I need to make sure I don't look anywhere else and strictly follow the instructions. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks about the German city where Wolfgang Zwiener's parents ran their restaurant and lodge before he went to hospitality school in Bremen. Scanning the article, I remember there's a part where he talks about his parents' place in Silesia. The exact sentence says: "the restaurant and lodge that his parents once ran in Silesia". So the answer is Silesia. Wait, but the question specifies a city. Hmm, Silesia is a region, not a city. The article might mention a specific city? Let me check again. The text says "in Silesia" but doesn't name a city. So maybe the answer is Silesia even though it's a region? The question says "city", but the article only mentions the region. Since there's no city name given, maybe it's N/A? Wait, the question says "German city", but Silesia was part of Germany before WWII. The article says "in what is now Poland", so maybe the city is part of Silesia but the exact name isn't given. So the answer is N/A? Wait, no. The question says "which German city", so perhaps Silesia isn't a city but the region. Since the article doesn't mention the actual city name, I have to answer N/A. Wait, but the question might be expecting Silesia even if it's a region. Let me check again. The exact line is: "the restaurant and lodge that his parents once ran in Silesia". Since the question asks for the city, but the article only mentions the region, the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe Silesia is considered here. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick and the answer is Silesia even if it's a region. Hmm. I'll go with Silesia as the region was part of Germany then, so maybe the answer is Silesia, even if it's not a city. But the question specifies a city. Since the article doesn't give a city name, the answer should be N/A. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check again. The article says "the restaurant and lodge that his parents once ran in Silesia, and how he had followed their path by enrolling in the hospitality program of a trade school in Bremen". No city name. So the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe the question is referring to the region as a place, but the question says "city". So N/A.

Wait, no. The question says "German city" where his parents operated their restaurant. The article says "in Silesia", which was part of Germany before WWII. Since the question is about the city, but the article doesn't name a city in Silesia where they had the restaurant, the answer is N/A. Hmm, but maybe the question expects Silesia as the answer even though it's a region. I'm confused. Let me note that and proceed, but I'll have to decide later.

2. **Question 2:** How many years after starting at Peter Luger did the ownership change from the original German family? The article states: "Although the German family that founded Peter Luger had sold it by the time Mr. Zwiener started working there in 1964". So when he started in 1964, the family had already sold it. Therefore, the ownership change happened before 1964. The question asks how many years after he started working there. Since the sale was before he started, the answer is 0 years. Because when he began, the family no longer owned it. So the answer is 0.

3. **Question 3:** The name of the uncle's elevator company. The article says: "an uncle who owned an elevator company in Manhattan offered him a job and an immigration sponsorship". But the name of the company isn't mentioned. So the answer is N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The month in 1960 when he arrived on the Berlin. The article states: "In 1960, after an uncle... he sailed to New York aboard the ocean liner Berlin." But the month isn't specified. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Annual revenue of first Park Ave location in its first year. The article doesn't mention any financial figures, so N/A.

6. **Question 6:** How many minutes before serving steaks did they rest? The article says: "he insisted that each place be set with a heated plate no more than two minutes before the aged prime beef arrived." Wait, no, the question is about the steaks resting time? Wait, the text says: "he insisted that each place be set with a heated plate no more than two minutes before the aged prime beef arrived. If the time limit was exceeded, he would send servers back for fresh plates. Platters had to be even hotter -- so scalding that the butter and juices would sputter and smoke under diners' noses..." So the heated plate must be set no more than two minutes before the steak arrives. The question is about the steak's resting time? Or the time between plate setting and serving? The question says "let steaks rest before serving". The article doesn't mention resting time for the steak, but the time between plate setting and serving is two minutes. So maybe the answer is two minutes? The question is a bit ambiguous. Since the question says "let steaks rest before serving them to ensure optimal temperature", the article doesn't mention the steak's resting time, only the plate's timing. So N/A? Or is the two minutes the time before serving? The answer might be 2 minutes, but the question is about the steak's rest time, which isn't mentioned. Hmm. The article says the plate has to be set within two minutes before the beef arrives, but not the steak's resting period. So the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "how many minutes did Wolfgang require his staff to let steaks rest before serving". Since the article doesn't mention the steak's resting time, just the plate's timing, so N/A.

Wait, the article says: "Platters had to be even hotter -- so scalding that the butter and juices would sputter and smoke under diners' noses, a flourish borrowed from Peter Luger. A steak that failed to sizzle was 'a D.O.A.' Those went back to the kitchen, too." So maybe the steak needs to be hot immediately, implying no resting time? But the question is about the time between when the plate is set and the steak is served. The article says the plate must be set no more than two minutes before the beef arrives, so the time between plate setting and serving is two minutes. But the question is about the steak's rest time. Since the article doesn't mention how long the steak rests before serving, except that the plate has to be hot, the answer is N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Settlement amount in the lawsuit with Wolfgang Puck. The article says the case was resolved out of court but doesn't mention the amount. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Which famous regular customer from Peter Luger convinced him to open his first steakhouse? The article says: "Peter Zwiener and his brother, Steven, talked him into opening Wolfgang's Steakhouse". So the answer is his sons, Peter and Steven. Wait, but the question says "famous regular customer". The sons aren't customers but family. The article doesn't mention any customers convincing him. So N/A? Wait, the question might be a trick. The article says his sons talked him into it. Since the question asks for a "famous regular customer" who convinced him, but the article doesn't mention any customer, only his sons. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Monthly rent for the basement space in the Vanderbilt Hotel. Not mentioned in the article. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Number of German waiters at Peter Luger when he started in 1964. The article says: "nearly all the waiters had been born in Germany". But "nearly all" is vague and the exact number isn't given. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Which city did he establish his signature chain after starting in Brooklyn and cruise lines? The first restaurant was in Manhattan (Park Ave), so the city is New York (Manhattan). The question says "renowned city", so answer is New York City.

12. **Question 12:** Which attire did he leave behind when becoming an executive? The article says: "he traded black bow ties and cotton aprons for suits, silk pocket squares and buffed leather shoes. The crisp mustache... stayed the same". So he left behind the bow ties and aprons. The answer is black bow ties or cotton aprons. The question asks for a distinctive piece, so either. The first mentioned is "black bow ties".

13. **Question 13:** Maximum interval between heated plate and serving. The article says "no more than two minutes". So answer is 2.

14. **Question 14:** Traditional dessert with velvety topping. The article mentions "apple strudel with schlag". Schlag is whipped cream, which is velvety. So answer is apple strudel with schlag.

15. **Question 15:** Which location's door sign affirmed naming rights outside NYC borough? The lawsuit was about the Beverly Hills location. The article states: "the words on the door in Beverly Hills, and a judge denied Mr. Puck's request for an injunction." So the answer is Beverly Hills.

16. **Question 16:** Signature dish that was served at both places. The article mentions "porterhouse" as the signature. "The porterhouse, the German potatoes, the apple strudel... came along. So the porterhouse steak is the answer.

17. **Question 17:** Tragic event from childhood attributed to a wartime accident. His father was killed by a landmine. The article says: "his father, a soldier, was killed by a land mine". So the answer is his father's death from a landmine.

18. **Question 18:** Cautionary phrase to sons about the restaurant industry. The article says: "he warned them away from restaurant careers. 'You won't have a life,' he said." So the answer is "You won't have a life".

19. **Question 19:** Duration of apprenticeship in Bremen. The article says: "serving a two-year apprenticeship". So two years.

20. **Question 20:** Continent for planned 15 new branches. The article states: "fifteen more, most of them in Asia, are scheduled to open later this year." So the answer is Asia.
