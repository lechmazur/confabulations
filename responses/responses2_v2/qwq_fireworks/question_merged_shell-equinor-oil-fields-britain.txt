Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the given article. Let me go through each question and see what the article says.

1. The first question asks how many barrels of oil Shell committed to producing annually from Jackdaw to heat 1.4 million homes. The article mentions that Shell said Jackdaw could produce enough fuel for 1.4 million homes, but it doesn't specify the barrels per year. The Rosebank field has 300 million barrels, but that's total, not annual. So this is N/A.

2. The second question is about the environmental group that initially filed the lawsuit with Greenpeace. The article states "Uplift, an environmental group, which joined Greenpeace in a lawsuit..." Wait, actually it says Uplift joined Greenpeace, meaning Greenpeace was the first? Wait, no, the wording is "joined Greenpeace in a lawsuit to stop production". So Uplift was the one that joined, implying Greenpeace was the initial filer? Or maybe Uplift was the initial one? Hmm. Let me check again: "Uplift, an environmental group, which joined Greenpeace in a lawsuit..." So Uplift joined Greenpeace's lawsuit. So the initial filer was Greenpeace, but the question asks which group initially filed that Greenpeace later joined. Wait, the wording is "joined Greenpeace in a lawsuit", so Greenpeace was already there. Therefore, the initial group was Uplift? Wait no, the phrasing is "Uplift... joined Greenpeace in a lawsuit". That means Greenpeace was the one who started it, and Uplift joined. Wait, but the question is phrased as "which environmental advocacy group initially filed the lawsuit that Greenpeace later joined". So the answer must be Uplift? Wait no, that's conflicting. Let me parse again: "Uplift, an environmental group, which joined Greenpeace in a lawsuit to stop production, called the ruling..." So Greenpeace was part of the lawsuit, and Uplift joined them. Therefore, the initial filer was Greenpeace, and Uplift joined. So the question is asking which group initially filed that Greenpeace later joined? Wait no, the question is the opposite: the lawsuit was filed by the initial group, then Greenpeace joined. But according to the article, Uplift joined Greenpeace's lawsuit. Therefore, the initial filer was Greenpeace, so the answer to question 2 would be N/A because the question is asking which group initially filed that Greenpeace joined. Since Greenpeace was the one they joined, the answer would be N/A. Wait, but maybe the article says Uplift and Greenpeace joined together? Wait, the exact wording is "Uplift, an environmental group, which joined Greenpeace in a lawsuit to stop production". So Uplift joined Greenpeace's lawsuit. Therefore, the initial filer was Greenpeace, and Uplift joined. The question asks which group initially filed the lawsuit that Greenpeace later joined. Since Greenpeace was the one who started it, the answer would be N/A. But maybe I misread. Alternatively, maybe Uplift was the first, and Greenpeace joined. Let me check again. The sentence says "Uplift... joined Greenpeace in a lawsuit". The phrase "joined Greenpeace in a lawsuit" implies that Greenpeace was already part of the lawsuit, so Uplift joined them. Therefore, the initial filer was Greenpeace, so the answer is N/A. Wait, the question is asking which group initially filed the lawsuit that Greenpeace later joined. Since Greenpeace was part of the original lawsuit, the answer must be N/A. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps Uplift was the one who started, and Greenpeace joined. The wording is ambiguous. Wait the sentence says "Uplift... joined Greenpeace in a lawsuit". So Uplift joined Greenpeace's lawsuit, so the initial filer was Greenpeace. Therefore, the answer is N/A because the question is about the group that initially filed which Greenpeace joined. Since Greenpeace didn't join, the answer would be N/A. Wait, but maybe the question is worded as "the lawsuit that Greenpeace later joined", so the initial filer was Uplift, and Greenpeace joined. Then the answer would be Uplift. Let me think again. The sentence says "Uplift... joined Greenpeace in a lawsuit". So Greenpeace was already in the lawsuit, and Uplift joined. So the initial filer was Greenpeace, so the question's answer is N/A because the question is looking for the group that initially filed that Greenpeace joined. Since Greenpeace was the original, the answer is N/A. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is which group initially filed the lawsuit that Greenpeace later joined. Since the article says Uplift joined Greenpeace, meaning Greenpeace was already there, so the initial group was Greenpeace, so the answer is N/A. Hmm, this is tricky. Alternatively, maybe the lawsuit was filed by both, but the question specifies "initially filed" so perhaps the answer is Uplift? Maybe the wording is that Uplift and Greenpeace jointly filed, but the article says "Uplift... joined Greenpeace in a lawsuit", so Greenpeace started it. Therefore, the answer is N/A. Let me note this as needing to check again.

3. The third question asks the percentage of Britain's total energy supply from the two projects. The article doesn't mention any percentage, so N/A.

4. The fourth question is about how much Keir Starmer proposed for alternative energy. The article says the government is pushing for investment but doesn't specify an amount for Starmer's proposal. It mentions Equinor's PS10B for wind and carbon capture, but that's the company's investment, not Starmer's. So N/A.

5. The fifth question asks the timeline given by the Supreme Court for new guidelines. The article says "New guidelines are expected later this year." The Supreme Court's ruling in 2024 required assessments, but the timeline for guidelines is "expected later this year" (the article was written in 2024?), so the answer is "later this year". Wait, the question says the timeline given by the Supreme Court for implementing the guidelines. The Supreme Court's 2024 ruling required assessments, but the guidelines are being reconsidered now, and new ones expected later this year. The Supreme Court itself didn't set a timeline for the guidelines, the government is doing that. So the answer is N/A.

6. The sixth question: Which Norwegian company previously challenged similar restrictions? The article mentions Equinor as a developer here, but does it say they had a previous challenge? The article only discusses the current case involving Rosebank and Jackdaw. So N/A.

7. The seventh question about compensation package: The article doesn't mention any compensation offered by the government for work already done. So N/A.

8. The eighth question: How many jobs in Aberdeen's oil industry would the projects create? The article mentions Aberdeen as the heart of the oil industry, but Ithaca Energy's testimony argued suspension would affect international perception, but there's no number given. N/A.

9. The ninth question: Carbon emissions threshold established by the judge. The article doesn't mention a specific threshold. The judge required assessments but didn't set a number. N/A.

10. The tenth question: International regulatory body providing climate data. The article doesn't mention any specific body, so N/A.

11. The eleventh question: Which ruling did the Scottish judge rely on? The article says Judge Stewart followed the 2024 Supreme Court ruling that assessments must include climate impact. So the answer is the 2024 Supreme Court ruling.

12. The twelfth question: Company committed PS2.2B to North Sea development. The article states Equinor had PS2.2B in contracts for Rosebank, and planned PS10B for wind/carbon. So Equinor.

13. The thirteenth question: Balance between public and private interests. The judge said "the public interest in authorities' acting lawfully and the private interest of members of the public in climate change outweigh the private interest of the developers." So the answer is that public interests (lawful actions and climate) outweigh developers' private interests.

14. Fourteenth question: Which oil field could heat 1.4M homes? The article says Shell stated Jackdaw could heat 1.4M homes. But the question asks which was a litmus test for the British oil sector. The article says Rosebank and Jackdaw are seen as tests for the British oil industry. The question mentions heating 1.4M homes, which is Jackdaw. So the answer is Jackdaw, but the question also says "litmus test", which applies to both. Wait the question says "which oil field was described as having the potential... while also serving as a litmus test". The article says both are tests, but the heating capacity is Jackdaw. So the answer is Jackdaw.

15. Fifteenth question: Company that underscored PS800M spent. The article says Shell mentioned PS800M spent on Jackdaw. So Shell.

16. Sixteenth question: Project slated 2026-2027 with Ithaca as minority. Rosebank was 2026/2027, and Ithaca is a minority partner in Rosebank. So Rosebank.

17. Seventeenth question: Political party pushing investment and revisiting permits. The Labour Party government under Starmer is mentioned. So Labour.

18. Eighteenth question: Academic from Cambridge warned of more cases. The article quotes Harro van Asselt, Cambridge professor, saying further cases would be launched. So Harro van Asselt.

19. Nineteenth question: Environmental group that joined Greenpeace. Uplift, as per the article's mention that Uplift joined Greenpeace.

20. Twentieth question: Minority partner suggesting halting damages UK's image. Ithaca Energy is the minority partner in Rosebank and argued that suspension would affect the UK's reputation. So Ithaca Energy.
