Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict format. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks about the percentage decrease in overall infant mortality between 1999 and 2020. The article says "overall infant mortality rates dropped by 24 percent from 1999 to 2022." Wait, the question is up to 2020, but the article mentions 2022. Hmm, so maybe the 24% is from 1999 to 2022. The question specifies 2020, so since the article doesn't give a figure for 2020 specifically, I can't answer that. So maybe the answer is N/A?

Wait, but the question says "between 1999 and 2020". The article's data is up to 2022. Since the 24% is from 1999 to 2022, there's no info for 2020. So the answer is N/A. But wait, maybe the 24% is cumulative up to 2022, so the 2020 figure isn't given. So yes, N/A.

2. The second question asks what specific type of bedding, other than a fitted sheet, is recommended for a portable play yard according to Gail Bagwell. The article says the AAP recommends a firm, flat mattress and a fitted sheet, and no loose bedding, toys, or bumpers. But Gail Bagwell's statement is about safe sleep practices needing to be followed all day, not about specific bedding. Wait, the question is about Gail Bagwell's recommendation. Let me check again. The article says: "the A.A.P. does not recommend [bed sharing] under any circumstances." Then Dr. Wolf mentioned the Instagram study. Then Alicia McHatton talks about checking saferproducts.gov. Then Gail Bagwell says safe sleep practices are important all day. The AAP's recommendation is in the text: "There should be no loose bedding, toys or bumpers..." So the AAP says not to have those. But the question is about what is recommended. The only thing mentioned as allowed is the fitted sheet and firm mattress. So maybe the answer is "fitted sheet" but the question says "other than a fitted sheet". The AAP's recommendation is that there should be nothing else except the mattress and fitted sheet. So maybe the answer is "N/A" because the AAP says no other bedding except the fitted sheet, so the only allowed bedding is the fitted sheet. The question is asking for another type recommended, but the AAP says no other bedding. So perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, but the AAP says "no loose bedding, toys or bumpers" so the only bedding is the fitted sheet. So the answer is there's no other bedding recommended except the fitted sheet. Therefore, the question's answer is N/A because the AAP doesn't recommend any other bedding besides the fitted sheet. But the question is phrased as "specific type of bedding, other than a fitted sheet... explicitly recommended for use in a portable play yard". Since the AAP says nothing else is allowed, there's no other bedding recommended. So the answer is N/A.

Wait, but maybe the question is referring to the AAP's recommendation. The AAP says "a firm, flat mattress and a fitted sheet" so the mattress is part of the setup. The "bedding" would be the fitted sheet. So the answer is N/A because there's no other bedding recommended besides the fitted sheet. So yes, N/A.

3. The third question asks what intervention similar to breastfeeding could parents have used to mitigate SIDS. The article says breastfeeding is believed to offer some protection. The question is looking for another intervention similar to breastfeeding. The article mentions "limiting exposure to nicotine during pregnancy and after", "safe sleep environment". Since the question is similar to breastfeeding, which is a protective factor, maybe "limiting nicotine exposure" is the answer. The question says "similar to breastfeeding", so the answer is "limiting exposure to nicotine during pregnancy and after".

4. The fourth question asks which government agency's website, recommended by Alicia McHatton, would provide info on a product related to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s vaccine discussion. The article says Alicia recommends saferproducts.gov, maintained by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. The product in question is one Robert F. Kennedy Jr. discussed (like aluminum in vaccines). So the answer is the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's website, so the agency is "Consumer Product Safety Commission". The answer is "Consumer Product Safety Commission" (abbreviated as CPSC?), but the article says "saferproducts.gov, a federal database maintained by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission". So the agency's name is "U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission", but the question asks for the agency's name. So the answer is "U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission".

5. The fifth question asks about a specific element in asteroid Bennu samples that parallels the protective effect of breastfeeding against SIDS. The article mentions Bennu's samples had "organic molecules" that shed light on how life arose. The question is looking for an element in Bennu's samples that's a parallel to breastfeeding's protective effect. Since breastfeeding is protective, the organic molecules might be the answer. The question says "specific element" so maybe "organic molecules".

6. The sixth question asks besides social media, what factor linked to both the afternoon slump and SUID increase was hypothesized. The article says Dr. Wolf's hypotheses include "Covid and other respiratory illnesses, maternal opioid use and the influence of social media..." The afternoon slump is mentioned in a separate paragraph as a different topic. Wait, the question says "linked to both the rise in SUID and the afternoon slump". The afternoon slump is a separate topic in the article, but maybe the question is looking for a common factor. The afternoon slump is caused by things like fatigue, but the SUID factors are listed as respiratory illnesses, opioid use, social media. The afternoon slump isn't directly linked to any of these except maybe respiratory illnesses? Or maybe "respiratory illnesses" but that's part of the SUID factors. Alternatively, maybe "maternal opioid use" isn't linked to afternoon slump. Wait, the question says a factor linked to both SUID rise and afternoon slump. The afternoon slump is a separate topic in the article (a drowsy feeling), so perhaps the answer is "respiratory illnesses" (since afternoon slump could be due to illness? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to "Covid and other respiratory illnesses" as a factor for SUID, and the afternoon slump is a separate issue. Hmm. The question states "linked to both the rise in SUID and the afternoon slump". The article doesn't mention a direct link between the afternoon slump and SUID factors except that both are mentioned in the text. Maybe the answer is "N/A". Alternatively, maybe "Covid" is linked to both the pandemic (SUID) and the afternoon slump (as part of pandemic effects?). The article says "since the pandemic, drug trials..." but that's a different context. Alternatively, maybe "respiratory illnesses" could be part of both? The afternoon slump is a temporary drowsy feeling, not directly linked. The article doesn't connect them. So perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "hypothesized as a potential contributor to the increase in sleep-related infant deaths" besides social media. The hypotheses are "Covid and other respiratory illnesses, maternal opioid use". The afternoon slump is a separate topic. So the answer must be one of those two factors (respiratory illnesses or opioid use) that's also linked to the afternoon slump. Since the afternoon slump isn't connected to those in the article, maybe the question is a trick. Alternatively, perhaps "respiratory illnesses" is the answer, but the afternoon slump isn't linked to that. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. The question says "linked to both the rise in SUID and the afternoon slump". Since the afternoon slump is a separate topic in the article, perhaps there's no link, so the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe "respiratory illnesses" is the only possible one, but the article doesn't say they're linked to the afternoon slump. So the answer must be N/A. Wait, the question is asking for a factor that Dr. Wolf and colleagues hypothesized as contributing to SUID, and also linked to the afternoon slump. Since the afternoon slump is a different topic, the answer is N/A. Hmm, tricky. Let me check the text again. The SUID hypotheses are "Covid and other respiratory illnesses, maternal opioid use and the influence of social media". The afternoon slump is mentioned in another paragraph: "How to Beat the Afternoon Slump: This drowsy feeling..." So no connection. Therefore, the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "linked to both the rise in SUID and the afternoon slump". Since they are separate, maybe the answer is N/A. So I'll put N/A here.

7. The seventh question asks what item, often found in cribs and linked to suffocation, is depicted in unsafe Instagram posts. The article mentions "many Instagram posts showed babies sleeping in environments that didn't meet the A.A.P.'s guidelines" and the AAP says "no loose bedding, toys or bumpers". So the unsafe items are loose bedding, toys, bumpers. The question asks for a specific item common in unsafe environments. The answer is "bumpers" or "loose bedding". Since the question says "specific item", maybe "bumpers" is the answer, as they are commonly mentioned in such contexts. The article says "bumpers" are prohibited by AAP, so that's the item.

8. The eighth question asks what illness, mentioned in the drug trials context, might Dr. Goodstein associate with the pandemic blip. The article's drug trials part says "since the pandemic, drug trials that purposely make people vomit, shiver and ache have become a research area of growing interest." The specific illness mentioned in that context is not named. The question links to SUID's potential blip being pandemic-related. The drug trials are about making people ill, but the illness isn't specified. So the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe "Covid" is the illness, but the drug trials part is separate. The question says "specific illness mentioned in the context of drug trials". The drug trials context mentions "drug trials that purposely make people vomit, shiver and ache" but the illness isn't named. So the answer is N/A.

9. The ninth question asks about an unsafe practice common in many parts of the world promoted by influencers, per Dr. Wolf. The article says "bed sharing is common in many parts of the world, the A.A.P. does not recommend it under any circumstances." Dr. Wolf mentioned social media promoting unsafe practices. So the unsafe practice is bed sharing. The answer is "bed sharing".

10. The tenth question asks if the 1990s campaign were re-launched focusing on Bennu's findings, what positioning advice beyond back-sleeping would be emphasized. Bennu's samples had organic molecules. The article says the 1990s campaign was about back-sleeping. The question asks for positioning advice related to Bennu's organic molecules. Since organic molecules relate to life's building blocks, maybe the advice would be related to positioning in a way that supports life's origins, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, the question is a trick, since Bennu's findings are unrelated to safe sleep. So the answer is N/A. The article doesn't link Bennu's molecules to sleep positioning beyond back-sleeping. So N/A.

11. The eleventh question asks what protective factor against SIDS Dr. Goodstein attributed to breastfeeding. The article says "breastfeeding (which is believed to offer some protection against SIDS)" but it's mentioned in the general context, not specifically Dr. Goodstein's analysis. The question specifies Dr. Michael Goodstein's analysis. The article quotes Dr. Goodstein as hoping the increase is a pandemic blip. There's no mention of him talking about breastfeeding. So the answer is N/A.

12. The twelfth question asks what two risk factors for SUID, aside from respiratory illnesses, did Dr. Wolf hypothesize linked to the pandemic. The article lists her hypotheses as "Covid and other respiratory illnesses, maternal opioid use and the influence of social media". Excluding respiratory illnesses, the other two are maternal opioid use and social media influence. So the two are "maternal opioid use" and "social media influence".

13. The thirteenth question asks the primary reason for stagnation after the 1990s campaign. The article says "Rates of sleep-related infant deaths plummeted in the 1990s ... but have stagnated since." The reason given is "the new study does not offer any evidence about what is behind the seeming increase... But Dr. Wolf and her colleagues offered several hypotheses..." So the stagnation's reason isn't directly stated, but the article says the increase might be due to the pandemic factors. However, the question is about the stagnation after the 1990s, not the recent increase. The article says the 1990s success was due to the back-sleep campaign, and stagnation since then. The reason for stagnation isn't explicitly given except that the recent increase has hypotheses. The primary reason for stagnation isn't stated, so maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "The new study does not offer any evidence about what is behind the seeming increase in sleep-related infant deaths. But Dr. Wolf and her colleagues offered several hypotheses..." So the stagnation's reason isn't addressed, so the answer is N/A.

Wait, the question is about the stagnation after the 1990s campaign. The article says "have stagnated since" but doesn't give the reason. So N/A.

14. The fourteenth question asks what unsafe practice promoted in Instagram posts contradicts AAP's bedding recommendations. The AAP says no loose bedding, toys, or bumpers. The Instagram study showed unsafe environments, which would include those items. The specific item mentioned is "bumpers" or "loose bedding". The question asks for the practice promoted, which is using bumpers or loose bedding. Since the AAP explicitly says no bumpers, the unsafe practice is using bumpers. So the answer is "bumpers".

15. The fifteenth question asks which demographic group's SUID rates were statistically indistinguishable from white infants. The article states "rates of sleep-related death remain notably higher among Black, Native American and Pacific Islander babies than among white and Asian infants." So the groups with higher rates are Black, Native American, and Pacific Islander. The ones with lower rates are white and Asian. The question asks which group's rates were "statistically indistinguishable from white". Since Asian infants have lower rates than the others, maybe Asian and white are comparable. The article says "notably higher" for the others, implying Asian and white are similar. The answer is "Asian infants".

16. The sixteenth question asks what policy gap complicates safe sleep for working parents. The article mentions "the United States, which is among the few remaining countries with no paid parental leave." So the policy gap is "lack of paid parental leave".
