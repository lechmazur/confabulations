Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly what's asked. Let's start with the first question.

1. The question asks which country's trade surplus with the US nearly matches the EU's $240 billion surplus. The article mentions that the EU had a $240 billion surplus with the US, and China's surplus with the US was a third of its total $1 trillion, so about $333 billion. Wait, but the question is about another country's surplus matching the EU's $240B. Wait, the article says "the European Union ran an estimated $240 billion surplus with the United States." So maybe the answer is the US's deficit with China? Wait, the first paragraph says "only a third of the U.S. deficit was with China." The US deficit is around $1 trillion, so a third is $333B with China. But the EU's surplus with the US is $240B. The question is which country's surplus with the US matches the EU's $240B. Hmm. Wait, maybe the article says that the EU's surplus with the US is $240B, so maybe another country? Wait the article says "countries around the world are also running big trade surpluses with the United States -- nothing on the scale of China's, but they are adding up." So the only other specific number given is the EU's $240B. Wait the question says "based on the described global trade patterns" which might refer to the mirror image part. Wait the first paragraph says "China's record trade surplus of almost $1 trillion last year has a nearly perfect mirror image on the other side of the world: an American trade deficit last year that is expected to clock in at around $1 trillion." So maybe the answer is the US's deficit with China? Wait no, the question is about a country's surplus with the US matching the EU's surplus. Since the EU's surplus with the US is $240B, maybe another region? The article mentions "the European Union, for example..." so maybe the answer is the EU itself. Wait the question is phrased as "which country's trade surplus with the United States nearly matches the European Union's $240 billion surplus". But the EU is a region, not a country. The question might have a typo, but the article mentions that the EU's surplus with the US is $240B. The question is looking for a country. Hmm. Maybe the answer is N/A because the EU is a region. Wait the article says "the European Union ran an estimated $240 billion surplus with the United States." So perhaps the question is referring to the EU's surplus with the US, but the question is asking for a country, so maybe it's a trick question. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is China's surplus with the US is a third of its total surplus. Wait the article says "only a third of China's surplus was with the United States." China's total surplus was $1T, so a third is $333B. But the EU's surplus with the US is $240B. So no country's surplus matches the EU's $240B except the EU itself, but the question specifies a country. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait maybe the question is a trick because the US's deficit with China is $333B, which is higher than the EU's surplus with the US. The question says "nearly matches the European Union's $240 billion surplus mentioned in the article". Since the EU's surplus with the US is $240B, maybe the answer is N/A because no country's surplus with the US equals that except the EU, which is a region. So answer N/A? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again. The question says "which country's trade surplus with the United States nearly matches the European Union's $240 billion surplus". The EU's surplus with the US is $240B, so the answer would be the European Union, but it's not a country. Therefore, maybe the answer is N/A. But the question might have a typo. Alternatively, maybe the article says another country's surplus? Let me scan again. The article says "the European Union ... ran an estimated $240 billion surplus with the United States." No other country's surplus with the US is mentioned except China's third of $1T. So the answer is N/A. Hmm. Wait, maybe the question is referring to the mirror image part. The article says China's surplus is ~$1T, and the US deficit is ~$1T, so the US deficit with China is a third (so $333B). But the EU's surplus with the US is $240B. So no country's surplus with the US matches the EU's $240B except the EU itself. Since the question asks for a country, the answer is N/A. 

2. The question is about China's exports: what percentage were natural resources. The article says "China's imports are oil and other natural resources. But 98.9 percent of its exports last year were manufactured goods." So the exports are 98.9% manufactured, so natural resources would be 1.1%. The answer is 1.1%.

3. Kenya's trade with the US vs. China's 35:1 deficit. The article states: "Because Kenya's trade is roughly in balance with the United States, it has ended up borrowing heavily..." So Kenya's trade with the US is roughly balanced. The 35:1 is their deficit with China. So compared to their deficit with China, their trade with the US is balanced. The question asks how their trade ratio with the US compares to the 35:1 deficit with China. The answer is "roughly in balance".

4. The question asks which two regions reversed their ratios with China when trading with the US. The article says: "To obtain the dollars they need to buy these goods from China, these other countries sell everything from Mercedes cars to cheap T-shirts to the United States. The European Union... European Union buys $2 worth of goods from China for each $1 of goods that it sells to China. That left the European Union with a $247 billion trade deficit with China last year, while the E.U. ran an estimated $240 billion surplus with the United States. For developing countries, the discrepancies are even more pronounced... They then mostly reverse that ratio in their trade with the United States." So the two regions are the European Union and developing countries (but the question says regions, so maybe EU and developing countries? Or the article mentions Africa, etc. The exact regions might be EU and developing countries. Alternatively, the article says "developing countries as a group buy about $3 worth of goods from China for each $2 of goods they sell to China. They then mostly reverse that ratio in their trade with the United States." So the two regions would be the European Union and developing countries. The answer is European Union and Developing countries. The question says "regions" so maybe EU and Africa? Wait, the question says "two regions highlighted as having reversed their typical trade ratios". The EU and developing countries (which include Africa, etc.) are the two. So the answer is "European Union and developing countries".

5. Economic indicator linked to China's reduced spending on imports due to housing crash. The article says: "Households in China are saving more, and spending little on imports, because they have lost much of their net worth after a housing market crash..." The indicator here is savings rates. The question asks what economic indicator is linked, so the answer is savings rates.

6. Brad Setser's threshold: the article states "Chinese exports cannot grow by 12 percent when global trade is only growing by 3 percent without cutting deeply into other countries' export sectors." The numerical threshold is 12% growth in exports vs 3% global. The question asks the threshold cited as unsustainable. The answer is 12% (Chinese exports growing at 12% while global is 3%).

7. Legislative body that imposed restrictions on Chinese investments in US factories. The article says: "lawmakers in Congress and in state governments have been mostly hostile to that solution, even imposing new legal limits in the past couple years on Chinese investments in the United States." So the answer is Congress.

8. Primary reason developing countries have surpluses with US despite deficits with China. The article states: "To obtain the dollars they need to buy these goods from China, these other countries sell everything from Mercedes cars to cheap T-shirts to the United States." So they need dollars to buy from China, so they sell to the US. The primary reason is to obtain dollars to pay for Chinese imports. So answer is "to obtain dollars to pay for imports from China".

9. Fraction of US deficit from China. The article says "only a third of the American trade deficit was with China." So the fraction is a third (1/3 or 33.3%).

10. The EU's deficit with China is $247 billion. The question asks the number cited between EU and China. The article says "the European Union bought $2 worth of goods from China for each $1 of goods that it sells to China. That left the European Union with a $247 billion trade deficit with China last year". So the answer is $247 billion.

11. China's industrial base characteristic making tariff cuts ineffective. The article says "because China is strong in practically every manufacturing industry, eliminating tariffs on imports from the poorest countries may not make much difference in trade flows." So the characteristic is being strong in manufacturing.

12. Event causing more severe wealth loss than US 2008 crash. The article states: "Households in China are saving more, and spending little on imports, because they have lost much of their net worth after a housing market crash wiped out more wealth than the American housing market crash in 2008 and 2009." The event is the Chinese housing market crash.

13. Consequence of broad tariffs vs targeting China. The article mentions "raising tariffs on imports from a wide range of countries could hit American allies. Running a very large trade deficit... But the big trade deficit also has meant that American consumers have enjoyed low prices. Many consumers may be hesitant to give that up by paying higher prices..." So the consequence is higher consumer prices. The question asks what consequence might arise, so the answer is higher prices for consumers.

14. Governing bodies with new restrictions on Chinese investments. The article says "lawmakers in Congress and in state governments have been mostly hostile... imposing new legal limits in the past couple years on Chinese investments." So Congress and state governments.

15. Tax cut to foster domestic purchasing. The article mentions "cutting China's 13 percent national sales tax, as well as other consumption taxes on imported luxuries..." So the tax cut is the national sales tax (13%).

16. Release date for US trade data. The article says "The United States Department of Commerce will release final trade statistics for 2024 in early February." So the answer is early February.
