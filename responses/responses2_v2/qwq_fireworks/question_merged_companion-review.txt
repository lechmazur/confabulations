Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the given article. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked and avoid any assumptions beyond the text.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions that "Humans" examined emotional, social, and legal bonds between humans and synthetic beings. But it doesn't specify legal precedents about ownership rights of abused sexbots. So, the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Sergey is described as wealthy and oily, but there's no mention of his car. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Patrick has impressive kitchen skills. The article says "enviable hair and impressive kitchen skills" but doesn't mention a specific utensil. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The meet-cute is in a produce aisle. The article doesn't mention a vintage car brand there. N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Tom Green's prank isn't linked to Josh's actions. The article doesn't connect them, so N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Eli and Patrick's relationship is seemingly perfect. The article doesn't mention a board game they play. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Iris doesn't use a camera model mentioned. Cinematographer is Eli Born, but no camera model specified. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Iris's programmed preferences aren't detailed beyond her being a robot. The produce aisle had tangerines, but not ice cream. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The article mentions a malfunctioning appliance? It says "scraps of sci-fi" but no specific appliance. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The produce scene's song isn't named. The retro-pop is mentioned but not a specific song. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Josh can't afford Iris, so he's the one. The article states he's a rental, so answer is Josh.

12. **Question 12**: The robot with a drop-down menu is Iris, as per the article. So Iris.

13. **Question 13**: The script's writer is Drew Hancock, the director. The article says "Hancock's script", so Drew Hancock.

14. **Question 14**: Running time is given as 1 hour 37 minutes. So that's the answer.

15. **Question 15**: Cinematographer is Eli Born. The article says "cinematographer is Eli Born".

16. **Question 16**: Kat is Sergey's "accessory". So Kat self-identifies that way.

17. **Question 17**: The robot with programmable memories is Iris.

18. **Question 18**: Sergey is the wealthy owner described as "oily".

19. **Question 19**: Patrick is noted for hair and kitchen skills. So Patrick.

20. **Question 20**: Tom Green's return is mentioned with his Y2K-era MTV show. So Tom Green's projects on Amazon.

Now, check each again to ensure no oversight. The article doesn't mention specific cars, utensils, songs, etc., so those get N/A. The others have direct answers from the text.
