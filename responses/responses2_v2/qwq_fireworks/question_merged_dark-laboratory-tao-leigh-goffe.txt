Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and answer exactly what's asked.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks about the narrative structure Elizabeth Rush uses in her own writing, mirroring Goffe's approach. The article mentions Goffe's style as "episodic" and "moves so rapidly among disciplines" with a "purposeful" rebuke to conventional structures. Since Rush teaches creative nonfiction and the article compares their approaches, maybe the answer is "episodic" or "nonlinear". Wait, the article says Goffe's narrative is episodic and a rebuke to conventional structure. The question says Rush's own writing mirrors this. The article states Rush's book is "The Quickening...", but does it mention her narrative structure? The article only says Goffe's is episodic. Hmm, maybe the answer is "N/A" because the article doesn't explicitly state Rush's structure, only Goffe's. Wait, the first paragraph says "Dark Laboratory... is as interested... in offering a kind of alternative account..." which might relate to nonlinear. The reviewer also mentions Goffe's approach is nonlinear. The question says "mirroring Goffe's approach", so maybe the answer is "nonlinear" or "episodic". But the exact term from the text for Goffe's structure is "episodic style" and "purposeful, an obvious rebuke of a more conventional narrative structure". So Rush's own writing mirrors that, but the article doesn't say Rush's structure. Wait the first paragraph says "Elizabeth Rush... teaches creative nonfiction at Brown University." But the question is about her own writing's narrative structure. The article only mentions Goffe's structure, not Rush's. So the answer would be N/A? Wait the question says "mirroring Goffe's approach to climate storytelling". Since Goffe's approach is episodic and nonlinear, maybe the answer is "episodic" or "nonlinear". Wait the article says "Her narrative moves so rapidly among disciplines... that it's easy to lose track... Her episodic style feels purposeful..." So Goffe's is episodic. The question is about Rush's own writing mirroring that. But the article doesn't explicitly say Rush uses an episodic style. The only direct info is about Goffe. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the first paragraph says Rush is the author of "The Quickening: Motherhood, Antarctica and Cultivating Hope in a Warming World." The article doesn't describe her narrative style, only Goffe's. So the answer is N/A. But the question says "mirroring Goffe's approach". Since the article doesn't state Rush's approach, the answer is N/A.

Wait, but the user says "based solely on the facts in the text". The article says Goffe's approach is episodic, but the question is about Rush's own writing. Since the article doesn't mention Rush's narrative structure, answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The question asks how many islands Goffe identifies as crucial. The article says "the region's interconnected islands have served as a kind of testing ground..." but doesn't specify a number. So answer N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The article states "the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Caribbean in 1492, which she cites as a marker for the start of globalization." So the year is 1492.

4. **Question 4:** The example given is Jamaica with the mongoose. The article says "the curious case of the Calcutta mongoose in Jamaica" and "transformed the ecology of Jamaica". So the island is Jamaica.

5. **Question 5:** The mongoose is the animal with communal mothering practices. The article says "the Calcutta mongoose... Goffe deftly swerves... to write at length about the mongoose's radical mothering practices... all births... belong to all mongoose mothers... blueprint for collective survival." So the answer is mongoose.

6. **Question 6:** The article mentions "centering Black and Indigenous history and ecology" as a way to challenge scientific rationalism. So the approach is "centering Black and Indigenous history and ecology".

7. **Question 7:** The article lists terms like Anthropocene, Capitalocene, Trumpocene, and says linear chronology obscures injustices. The term implied to be less adequate is "Anthropocene" because the author argues for a non-linear view, implying Anthropocene's simplicity is insufficient.

8. **Question 8:** Rush's title is "The Quickening: Motherhood, Antarctica and Cultivating Hope in a Warming World." The question asks which title by her is mentioned, so that's the answer.

9. **Question 9:** Jamaica is again the example with the mongoose and sugar cane, so Jamaica is the locale.

10. **Question 10:** The bird mentioned is "blue-footed boobies". The article says "blue-footed boobies, coral reefs and even bat guano play a leading role".

11. **Question 11:** The book's price is listed as $35.

12. **Question 12:** The article says "new genres of climate storytelling to encompass the multiplicity and nonlinearity of salvation" so the answer is "new genres of climate storytelling" or "nonlinear storytelling". The exact term from the text is "new genres of climate storytelling to encompass the multiplicity and nonlinearity of salvation".
