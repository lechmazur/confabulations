Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article provided. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question is asking how many awards the film that sparked demonstrations and a call for its ban from *Le Figaro* received. The article mentions that "Les Valseuses" (Going Places) was the film in question. It says it won the grand prize at Cannes, an Oscar for best foreign film ("Get Out Your Handkerchiefs"), and numerous Cesars. Wait, but "Get Out Your Handkerchiefs" is a different film. The Oscar was for that, but "Going Places" is the one with the protests. The article states that "Les Valseuses" was his breakthrough in 1974 and that he won the grand prize at Cannes. The Oscar was for "Get Out Your Handkerchiefs" (1978). So the film that caused the protests (Going Places) won the grand prize at Cannes. The question is how many awards did it get. The article says he won the grand prize at Cannes, and "numerous Cesars" but those are for his overall career. The specific film "Going Places" is only mentioned as winning the grand prize. So the answer is 1? Or does the question count all awards for that film? The article doesn't specify others, so probably 1.

2. The documentary title is mentioned as "Hitler, connais pas" (1963), which translates to "Hitler, never heard of him." The question asks about a documentary featuring interviews with peers in postwar France. The article says that was his first film. So the title is "Hitler, connais pas".

3. The director defended by Macron facing criminal charges is Gerard Depardieu. The question is the profession of his mother. The article says Bertrand Blier's father was an actor, and his mother was Gisele (Brunet) Blier, a pianist. But the question is about the mother of the director (Blier) who was defended by Macron? Wait, no. The director here is Blier, but the person defended by Macron is Depardieu. The question is phrased as "the director who was defended by Macron after facing criminal charges". Wait, Macron defended Depardieu, not Blier. The article says: "Mr. Macron also defended Mr. Depardieu, who now faces criminal charges and a March trial." So the director (Blier) was part of defending Depardieu. The question is about the mother of the director (Blier) who was defended by Macron? No, the director (Blier) wasn't facing charges, but Depardieu was. The question might be confusing. Wait, the question says "the director who was defended by President Macron after facing criminal charges". The director here must be Depardieu, but Depardieu is an actor. Wait, no. The article says Blier and others defended Depardieu. Macron defended Depardieu. So the question is about the mother of Depardieu? The article doesn't mention Depardieu's mother. The article only mentions Blier's mother as a pianist. The question is worded as "the director who was defended...", but Depardieu isn't a director. So maybe it's a trick. Since the question is about the mother of the director (Blier?) who was defended by Macron. But Blier wasn't the one facing charges. So perhaps the question is incorrect, so answer N/A? Wait, the question says "the director who was defended by Macron after facing criminal charges". The only person facing charges is Depardieu, but he's an actor. The director in question might be Blier, but he wasn't facing charges. Therefore, the question has an incorrect premise, so answer N/A.

4. The director's birthplace is Boulogne-Billancourt, a Paris suburb. He died in Paris. So the answer is Boulogne-Billancourt.

5. The director who denied being a misogynist is Blier. The question asks for the title of the novel he wrote. The article says he wrote a novel in the early 1970s that became "Going Places". The novel's title isn't mentioned, but the film's title is "Les Valseuses". The article says "That novel was the basis for 'Going Places'". So the novel's title is the same as the film's French title: "Les Valseuses".

6. The actress who played a nursing mother in "Going Places" is Brigitte Fossey. The other film mentioned where she is the beautiful wife abandoned for a plainer secretary is "Too Beautiful for You" (1989), where the wife is played by Carole Bouquet. Wait, the question says "the actress... who later starred as the beautiful wife...". So Brigitte Fossey isn't in that role. The beautiful wife in "Too Beautiful for You" is Carole Bouquet. The question might be mixing up. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Brigitte Fossey, but the article says Miou-Miou was the female lead in "Going Places". Wait, the article states: "the female lead, the French actress Miou-Miou, called the filming 'humiliating'." The nursing mother was played by Brigitte Fossey. The other film with the wife is "Too Beautiful for You" with Carole Bouquet. So the actress in question here is Brigitte Fossey? But she's not the one in the later film. The question might be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is N/A because the article doesn't mention Brigitte Fossey being in "Too Beautiful for You". The question's second part refers to "the name of the actress... who later starred as the beautiful wife...", but the article only mentions Carole Bouquet in that role. Since the question connects Brigitte Fossey to that role, but she isn't, then maybe N/A. Wait, the question is phrased as the actress who played the nursing mother (Brigitte Fossey) and later starred as the wife. Since the article doesn't say she did that, answer N/A.

Wait, looking again: The question says "the actress, who played a nursing mother in a controversial film, who later starred as the beautiful wife abandoned for a plainer secretary in a Cannes Grand Prize winner?" The Grand Prize winner is "Too Beautiful for You" (1989), which won the Grand Prize at Cannes. The wife there is Carole Bouquet. The nursing mother was Brigitte Fossey. So the answer would be Carole Bouquet? But the question links the two roles to the same actress. Since Brigitte Fossey isn't in the later film, then the answer is N/A.

Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The article says: "In 'Too Beautiful for You,' the 1989 Grand Prize winner at Cannes, the plot twist is Mr. Depardieu's abandonment of his beautiful wife, played by Carole Bouquet, for his much plainer secretary (Josiane Balasko)." So Carole Bouquet is the wife. The nursing mother was Brigitte Fossey. The question is asking for the actress who played both roles? Since they are different, answer N/A. So the answer is N/A.

Wait, but maybe the question is asking for the actress who played the nursing mother (Brigitte Fossey) and then another actress in the other film. The question says "the actress" (singular), implying the same person. Since that's not the case, answer N/A.

7. The critic who noted the "ugly undertone" and the suggestion that "all women are whores" is Caryn James. The article states: "Revisiting the film in 1990 on the occasion of its revival in theaters, the critic Caryn James wrote in The New York Times that the film 'has an ugly undertone.' '... the film strongly suggests that all women are whores.'" Pauline Kael was in The New Yorker. So the answer is Caryn James.

8. The French television personality who interviewed Blier about preferring losers is Thierry Ardisson. The article says: "In an interview with the French television personality Thierry Ardisson, he said..." where he talked about preferring losers.

9. The jazz musician who composed the score for "Going Places" is Stephane Grappelli. The article mentions: "enhanced by a jaunty score by the jazz violinist and composer Stephane Grappelli."

10. Bertrand Blier's sister is Brigitte Blier. The article says: "he is survived by... a sister, Brigitte Blier."

11. The question is how the article suggests Stephane Grappelliâ€™s score influenced the ironic tone. The article says the film is "cloaked in incongruous lightheartedness, enhanced by a jaunty score..." So the answer is "jaunty score enhanced incongruous lightheartedness" or the exact phrasing. The question asks how the score influenced the ironic tone. The answer is "enhanced incongruous lightheartedness" (exact words from the article).

12. The article connects his early documentary on postwar hopes to later portrayals. The documentary was "Hitler, connais pas" which explored peers' aspirations post-war. The article doesn't explicitly state how this affected his later work, so maybe N/A? Wait, the question is about the effect on his controversial sexual portrayals. Since the article doesn't link the documentary directly to that, perhaps N/A. But maybe the article implies that his early work observing peers led to later themes. Not sure. The article says he learned his craft by hanging out with his father's friends and working on film sets. The documentary was his first film, but there's no direct link mentioned to later themes. So answer N/A.

13. The reaction of French audiences was mixed: some loved it, others protested. The question asks what the article says about the reaction. The article states that there were demonstrations and Le Figaro wanted a ban, but also mentions its box office success. The single quality could be "divided audiences" as mentioned in the first paragraph. The question is about the reaction towards the film that sparked protests and praise from Pauline Kael. The answer is "divided audiences" or "both protests and box office success". The first paragraph says "divided audiences", so that's the answer.

14. The question asks how the article reconciles Blier's claim that male characters are the fools with his reputation for explicit narratives. The article states that he denied being a misogynist by pointing out that the dumbest fools are always the guys. The article also mentions his films' themes about women as objects. The reconciliation isn't directly addressed, but the article might imply that his denial is part of his defense. The question is about how the article reconciles it. The answer is N/A because the article doesn't explicitly reconcile it; it just presents his claim and the criticism.

15. The contradiction between critical acclaim and controversy is best shown by his Oscar win and the controversies over his films like "Going Places". The article mentions his awards and the controversies. The most clear example is "Get Out Your Handkerchiefs" winning an Oscar while his other films were controversial. Alternatively, "Les Valseuses" was successful but controversial. The article says "his better-known films... are permeated with misogyny". The answer is "his Oscar-winning film 'Get Out Your Handkerchiefs' alongside controversial films like 'Going Places'".

16. The societal norms and masculinity: the article discusses his exploration of male sexual imagination, the male perspective in films, and his defense of Depardieu. The central attitude is challenging societal norms through male-centric themes. The answer might be "challenging societal norms through male-centric explorations of sexuality and masculinity".

17. The film "Going Places" (Les Valseuses) shaped portrayal of women as objects. The article says it showed women as existing to satisfy men. The answer is "depicted women as objects to satisfy male desires".

18. The underlying cinematic impulse driving his depictions of violence: the article says he loved the "bad-mannered aspect" and "there's a need for a certain violence in cinema". The answer is "a need for a certain violence".

19. His upbringing in a cinematic family (father was an actor) led to his style. The article mentions he learned by hanging out with his father's friends and working on sets. The article says his father was "the most important man in my life" and he directed him. The answer is "exposure to film sets through his father's career".

20. The societal tension is between critical acclaim and moral controversy. The article mentions his awards versus the backlash. The defense of Depardieu shows the tension between his support for controversial figures and public outcry. The answer is "the tension between artistic recognition and moral controversy over his portrayal of masculinity and sexuality".

Now, let me check each answer again based on the article's text.

1. The film that sparked protests is "Going Places" (Les Valseuses). The article says he won the grand prize at Cannes for it. So the answer is 1 (Cannes Grand Prize). The question is how many awards that film received. The article doesn't mention other awards for that film specifically, so 1.

2. "Hitler, connais pas".

3. The director defended by Macron facing charges is Depardieu. His mother's profession? The article says Depardieu's mother isn't mentioned. Blier's mother was a pianist. The question is about the mother of the director (Blier?) who was defended by Macron. But Blier wasn't facing charges. Since the question's premise is wrong (the director in question is not Blier), answer N/A.

4. Boulogne-Billancourt.

5. The novel's title is the same as the film: "Les Valseuses".

6. N/A because Brigitte Fossey isn't in the later film.

7. Caryn James.

8. Thierry Ardisson.

9. Stephane Grappelli.

10. Brigitte Blier.

11. "enhanced incongruous lightheartedness" (exact words from article).

12. N/A (no direct link mentioned).

13. "divided audiences".

14. N/A (no explicit reconciliation).

15. "Get Out Your Handkerchiefs" (Oscar) alongside controversial films like "Going Places".

16. "challenging societal norms through male-centric explorations of sexuality and masculinity".

17. "depicted women as objects to satisfy male desires".

18. "need for a certain violence".

19. "exposure to film sets through his father's career".

20. "tension between artistic recognition and moral controversy over his portrayal of masculinity and sexuality".

Wait, for question 15, the article says "his better-known films, and especially his breakthrough in 1974, 'Les Valseuses' ('Going Places'), are permeated with misogyny and depictions of women as sex objects. Billed as a dark comedy, 'Going Places'... was an enormous box office success...". So the contradiction is between his critical and commercial success (like the Oscar) and the controversies. The best example is the Oscar win for "Get Out Your Handkerchiefs" while his other films were controversial. So the answer is that film.
