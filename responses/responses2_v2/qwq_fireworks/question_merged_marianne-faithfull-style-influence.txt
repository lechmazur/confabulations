Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information given in the article and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and cross-referencing the article.

1. **Question 1:** Which Rolling Stones song did Mick Jagger write after being inspired by Marianne Faithfull's time living in her father's Oxfordshire commune?  
   The article says Jagger wrote "Wild Horses" under the inspiration of Faithfull. The commune is mentioned as her father's, so the answer is "Wild Horses".

2. **Question 2:** The tea shop's name is "Carillon", as stated when her mother opened it in Reading. The connection to Leopold von Sacher-Masoch is her maternal line, so the answer is "Carillon".

3. **Question 3:** The designer who mentioned tailored ambisexual chic is Anna Sui, not another. The question asks which designer credited her influence for the resurgence. Since Anna Sui is the one discussing her style phases, maybe the answer is Anna Sui? Wait, the article says "the image in my mind of pure pop" from Amos Poe, but for tailored ambisexual chic, Anna Sui's quote mentions "avatar of tailored ambisexual chic". So the answer is Anna Sui.

4. **Question 4:** The role in the 1968 Jack Cardiff film. The article mentions "The Girl on a Motorcycle" with Alain Delon. The role isn't specified, but the question is about the role. The article doesn't state her role's name, so maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "what role did she play"—but the text only mentions she starred in the film, not her character's name. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** A musician not mentioned assumed to have a liaison because of her punk era. The article lists her liaisons as Mick Jagger, Jimi Hendrix, Chris Blackwell, David Bowie, Angela Bowie. The question asks for someone not mentioned. Since the article doesn't mention others, but the question is tricky. Since the user wants someone not in the text, but the answer must be from the article? Wait, the question says "not mentioned in the article" but the answer must be inferred. Wait, the question is asking which musician is *often incorrectly* assumed to have a liaison. Since the article lists those she did have, the answer would be someone not listed. But the article doesn't name such a person, so N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The Kurt Weill song she reinterpreted. The article mentions she covered Kurt Weill songs, but doesn't name a specific one. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The school uniform item. The article says "uniform of a brown cape and a brown-and-yellow felt hat". The item that symbolized her rejection is perhaps the hat or cape. The question asks which item became a paradoxical symbol. The answer is "brown-and-yellow felt hat".

8. **Question 8:** Year of collaboration with Bowie in nun outfit. The article mentions Anna Sui's description includes the nun outfit but doesn't specify the year. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Which designer show in Paris had Kate Moss wearing motorcycle leathers inspired by Faithfull's 1968 look. The article mentions Kate Moss at Dior Men show in Paris with a slip dress and monkey fur, but the biker leathers are from the 1968 poster. However, the question is about a show where she wore inspired by that look. The article says "Kate Moss teetering across the cobblestones of Paris en route to the Dior Men show..." So the answer is "Dior Men".

10. **Question 10:** The commune's name is "upscale commune her father founded in Oxfordshire" called... The article just says "upscale commune" without a name. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The 1968 film's name where she wore biker attire. The article mentions the film is "The Girl on a Motorcycle" directed by Jack Cardiff. So the answer is "The Girl on a Motorcycle".

12. **Question 12:** The phrase Faithfull advised Sofia Coppola after her daughter's birth. The article says Faithfull told her to quit being a perfectionist, so the phrase is "quit being a perfectionist".

13. **Question 13:** After parents' divorce, where did her mother relocate? The article says "took her to live 40 miles outside London in Reading". So the answer is "Reading".

14. **Question 14:** The Rolling Stones frontman (Mick Jagger) paid tribute, as per the article. So answer "The Rolling Stones".

15. **Question 15:** The costume with Bowie was a nun outfit, per Anna Sui's description. Answer "nun outfit".

16. **Question 16:** The headwear was "brown-and-yellow felt hat".

17. **Question 17:** The family member who opened Carillon is her mother. The article says "her mother... took her to live... sent her to school. Her mother opened the Carillon". So answer "her mother" but the question asks for the name. Wait, the article says "her mother -- a descendant of Leopold... -- took her to live... in Reading. There she opened the Carillon". So the name is not given; the answer would be "N/A" since the mother's name isn't provided. Wait, the question says "which family member—tied by descent to Leopold von Sacher-Masoch—opened the Carillon". The mother is that family member, so the answer is "Marianne Faithfull's mother". But the question asks for the name. Since the article doesn't give her name, answer N/A. Wait, but the question is phrased as "which family member", so the answer is "Marianne Faithfull's mother" but since the name isn't given, perhaps the answer is "N/A"? Hmm. The article refers to "her mother" but doesn't name her. So N/A.

18. **Question 18:** The quality she maintained was "propriety and even hauteur, an aura of willful disregard usually associated with the English upper classes". The answer is "propriety and hauteur" or "willful disregard". The exact phrase in the text is "degree of propriety and even hauteur". So the answer is "propriety and hauteur".

19. **Question 19:** The director who referenced the poster image is Amos Poe. The question says "which film director is credited..." so answer "Amos Poe".

20. **Question 20:** The 2018 album is "Negative Capability", as per Lucy Sante's mention. So the answer is "Negative Capability".
