Okay, I need to answer these 20 questions based solely on the provided article. Let me go through each question one by one and check the article for the answers. I'll have to be careful to only use the information given and not infer anything beyond what's written.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks which government ministry official analyzed the impact of kumquat price fluctuations on Vietnam's GDP growth rate. The article mentions Ngo Tri Long, a retired Finance Ministry official, who discussed economic malaise but doesn't specifically mention GDP growth rate. Since the question is about GDP, and the article doesn't link his analysis to GDP directly, I should answer N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Asks how many farmers in the Red River region reported complete crop failures. The article mentions Nguyen Thi Hoa's 50% loss, but there's no specific number of farmers or complete failures. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The price difference between flood-affected and untouched areas isn't provided. The article only states prices dropped by at least 40%, but no comparison between regions. N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The traditional belief about perfectly round kumquats isn't mentioned. The article says the fruits looked less pretty, but no specific folk belief is named. N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The percentage of office workers substituting peach blossoms isn't given. The article mentions some people switched, but no specific percentage. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The Institute's method to determine optimal temperature isn't detailed. The director mentions temperatures affected the harvest, but no info on how they determined the range. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Total economic loss for the sector isn't stated. The article talks about individual losses but no total figure. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: No mention of neighboring provinces implementing price controls. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Nguyen Duc Vinh's family generations aren't mentioned. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: No chemical treatments are mentioned for high temperatures. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The typhoon named is Yagi, which caused flooding. The article clearly states Typhoon Yagi, so answer is Typhoon Yagi.

12. **Question 12**: The unsold kumquat tree price is about $24, as mentioned by Nguyen Thi Hoa. So $24.

13. **Question 13**: Bananas were priced at $28, which is unexpected. The article mentions bananas being expensive, so bananas.

14. **Question 14**: The imported orchids from China were chosen by Nguyen Thi Nguyet. So orchids.

15. **Question 15**: Nguyen Duc Vinh had 3,000 trees, half were lost. So 3,000 originally planted.

16. **Question 16**: The institute's director is Pham Thi Thanh Nga from the Institute of Meteorology, Hydrology and Climate Change. So that's the institute's name.

17. **Question 17**: Nguyen Van Loi cut prices by half. The question specifies a percentage decrease, so 50%.

18. **Question 18**: Nguyen Duc Vinh settled at $10 after a 50% markup. The article says he reduced to the normal price of about $10.

19. **Question 19**: The retired official is Ngo Tri Long, mentioned by VnExpress.

20. **Question 20**: Motorbikes are used to display and sell kumquat trees. The article starts with potted trees on motorbikes.

Alright, let me verify each answer again quickly. For question 17, the vendor cut prices by half, so 50% decrease. The answer should be 50%. For question 18, the normal price is $10. Question 15's original number is 3,000. The rest seem correct. Okay, I think that's all.
