Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let me start with the first question.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks for the percentage of $338,000 that Meta received from Doppelganger's ads related to the Moscow suburb attack. The article mentions that the ads after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack reached over 237,000 accounts, but it doesn't specify the revenue from that specific event. The $338,000 is the total in the EU, but there's no breakdown by event. So the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The report says the false claims about Ukraine selling weapons to Hamas reached over 237,000 accounts. The question specifies the U.S., but the article doesn't break down by country for that particular ad. The 237k is the total, but since it's not specified for the U.S., answer N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The question is about Mark Zuckerberg's initiative that prompted the EU's investigation. The article mentions Meta's new content policies were announced when Zuckerberg alluded to the EU conflict. The initiative isn't named, so N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The article states the Social Design Agency targeted France, Germany, Poland, Italy, and others in the report. But the report's focus was on those four, and the other countries mentioned (US, Israel) aren't in Europe. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The content automatically restricted before policy changes was about race and gender. The answer is "content regarding race and gender."

6. **Question 6**: The other news org besides Delfi Estonia is Suddeutsche Zeitung. That's directly stated.

7. **Question 7**: The 2022 threat analysis by Meta that first identified the campaign is called "threat analysis" but no specific title. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The total clicks across all platforms? The article mentions 123k clicks on Facebook in the EU. The total across all platforms isn't given, so N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The methods besides memes and clones. The article says they used "ads on Facebook and other platforms." So "political advertisements" or "ads" might be it. Wait, the question asks for another method besides memes and clones. The article also mentions ads, so answer "political advertisements."

10. **Question 10**: The executive director is Alexandre Alaphilippe. That's in the text.

11. **Question 11**: The $338,000 is explicitly stated as the EU revenue. So that's the answer.

12. **Question 12**: The group using inauthentic usernames is the Social Design Agency. The question says "name of the group," which is given.

13. **Question 13**: The term for the operation with memes and clones is "Doppelganger." The article says "Doppelganger" is the operation's name.

14. **Question 14**: The term for the propaganda effort using current events is "disinformation" or "Doppelganger." But the question specifies the term for the effort itself. The article refers to Doppelganger as the operation, so "Doppelganger."

15. **Question 15**: The campaign ran over 15 months ending in October. The duration is given as 15 months.

16. **Question 16**: The first European country mentioned in the report's target list is France, as per the list in the article.

17. **Question 17**: The media mimicry is "online clones of real news sites."

18. **Question 18**: The principle Zuckerberg invoked was "free speech." The quote mentions "push back against foreign governments seeking to restrict free speech."

19. **Question 19**: The Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, is when the false claims about Ukraine and Hamas were made.

20. **Question 20**: The legislative framework is the "Digital Services Act."

Alright, I think that covers all the questions. Need to make sure each answer is directly from the text and no assumptions. Let me cross-verify each point quickly.
