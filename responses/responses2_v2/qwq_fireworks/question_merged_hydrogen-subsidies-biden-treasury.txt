Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article and answer strictly based on that.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks about the megawatts of nuclear power capacity at risk of retirement for a reactor to qualify. Scanning the article, I found a part mentioning "nuclear reactors that are set to be retired for economic reasons can now claim the credit." However, there's no specific number like megawatts mentioned. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The question is about which European country's methods were the model. The article mentions Orsted of Denmark and Equinor of Norway in the context of renewable energy, but it's about offshore wind, not hydrogen tax credits. The tax credit structure's model isn't specified here. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The percentage reduction needed by 2028 for maximum credit. The article talks about conditions but doesn't specify a percentage. The strict conditions involved matching hourly renewable use, but no percentage reduction is given. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** States beyond CA and WA that meet the criteria. The article says "only California and Washington meet this criterion," so no others are mentioned. The answer is 0.

5. **Question 5:** Minimum operational hours for electrolyzers. The article doesn't mention specific hours. It talks about alignment with renewable output but not hours. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Major automotive manufacturer partnering with Ambient Fuels. The article mentions Ambient Fuels but doesn't name any partners. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Annual production capacity threshold for landfill methane. The article says "under certain conditions, companies... can use methane gas from landfills... if the methane would have otherwise been emitted." No specific threshold is given. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Number of international projects canceled. The article states "hydrogen companies have canceled several major projects," but "several" isn't a number. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Maximum grid power percentage allowed. The article mentions alignment with renewables but doesn't specify a percentage. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Federal agency overseeing hourly matching. The Treasury issued the rules, but the specific agency for certification isn't named. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The state where the benefit first applies. The article says California and Washington qualify first. The question asks for the first noted state, which is California.

12. **Question 12:** Year for transitioning to real-time renewable use. The article says until 2030, they can use annual standard, so starting 2030 they must align hourly. So 2030.

13. **Question 13:** Qualifying condition for nuclear reactors. The reactors must be set to be retired for economic reasons. The answer is "set to be retired for economic reasons."

14. **Question 14:** Gas permitted when otherwise released. Methane is mentioned from landfills, farms, or coal mines. So methane.

15. **Question 15:** Highest cost per kg for clean hydrogen. The article says $3 to $11, so the highest is 11.

16. **Question 16:** Extra years before alignment. Originally 2028, now 2030. That's 2 extra years.

17. **Question 17:** Which former administration could revise rules. The article mentions the Trump administration.

18. **Question 18:** Number of public comments. The article states "roughly 30,000 public comments."

19. **Question 19:** Pages of the guidance. The final guidance is nearly 400 pages.

20. **Question 20:** Who expressed cautious relief. Frank Wolak from the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association.

Double-checking each answer against the article to ensure accuracy. Some answers require precise wording from the text. For instance, the nuclear condition is exactly quoted. Methane is the gas. The Trump administration is mentioned. All others where info isn't present get N/A.
