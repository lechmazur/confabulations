Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and not any outside knowledge. Let's start with the first question.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks which state's insurance program faces potential insolvency due to claims from PFAS-contaminated farmland exceeding its $377 million reserves, according to Senator Alex Padilla's office. Looking at the article, there's a section mentioning the California FAIR Plan. It says, "As of last Friday, the FAIR Plan had just $377 million available to pay claims, according to the office of Senator Alex Padilla..." and notes that total losses are estimated up to $30 billion. So the answer should be California.

2. **Question 2:** This asks about the specific PFAS concentration threshold that triggers risk increases. The article states the EPA found risks "sometimes by several orders of magnitude" but doesn't mention a specific numerical threshold. So I'll have to put N/A here since there's no exact number given.

3. **Question 3:** The fire ecologist cited for attributing fires to PFAS in soil. The article mentions Hugh Safford discussing fire spread due to wind, not PFAS. Since there's no mention of PFAS affecting combustion dynamics here, this is N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The number of premature deaths from PFAS in sewage sludge. The article says wildfire smoke causes up to 675,000 deaths, but that's from smoke, not directly PFAS. The PFAS section doesn't link deaths to sludge, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The federal agency's 2019 testing criticized by Consumer Reports. The FDA tested food samples, and Consumer Reports found PFAS in milk they tested. So the answer is FDA.

6. **Question 6:** Percentage reduction in synthetic fertilizer from sludge use. The article says using sludge "means farmers need to use less synthetic fertilizer made from fossil fuel." But no specific percentage is given. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Chemical company's 2005 study on PFAS in cattle. The article mentions 3M found PFAS in sludge in 2000 and informed EPA in 2003. No 2005 study mentioned. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Number of bidding wars in affected neighborhoods. The article says "caused bidding wars in some neighborhoods," but doesn't specify a number. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Renewable energy tech falsely claimed to increase PFAS leaching. The article mentions a TV series by Taylor Sheridan misrepresents fossil fuels vs. renewables, but doesn't specify which tech. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Maine's PFAS limit in food packaging. The article says Maine banned sludge on fields in 2022 but doesn't mention a numerical limit on packaging. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Magnitude PFAS levels exceed safety thresholds. The article states "sometimes by several orders of magnitude." So the answer is "several orders of magnitude."

12. **Question 12:** Company that informed EPA about PFAS in sludge. The article says 3M told EPA in 2003. So 3M.

13. **Question 13:** Agricultural practice with sludge. The article refers to using sewage sludge as fertilizer, promoted by EPA. Answer is sewage sludge application/fertilizer.

14. **Question 14:** Aerial firefighting limitation. The text says planes can't fly due to winds. So answer is high winds/gusting winds.

15. **Question 15:** State banning sludge on farms in 2022. The article clearly states Maine. So Maine.

16. **Question 16:** TV series by Taylor Sheridan. The article mentions "Landman" as the series. So Landman.

17. **Question 17:** Chemical family focus. The article centers on PFAS. So PFAS.

18. **Question 18:** FAIR Plan amount vs. losses. The FAIR Plan had $377 million, losses up to $30 billion. So $377 million.

19. **Question 19:** Unintended measure after policy changes. Maine's ban forced some plants to ship sludge out of state. So shipping sludge out of state.

20. **Question 20:** Phrase from Al Gore about climate disasters. The article quotes him saying "new era" of disasters. So "new era."
