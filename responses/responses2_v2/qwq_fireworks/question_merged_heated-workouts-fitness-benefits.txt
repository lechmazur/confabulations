Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly as per the instructions. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks about the percentage increase in hemoglobin production in endurance athletes from training in hot environments. The article mentions that endurance athletes like runners and cyclists produce more hemoglobin when training in heat, but it doesn't specify a percentage. So the answer here is N/A.

2. The second question is about a workout other than Bikram yoga that reaches temperatures requiring extra caution (above 100°F). The article mentions heated classes can go up to 125°F, and Dr. McNeely warns about temps above 100. The other example given is hot Pilates or HIIT. The question says "other than Bikram," so hot HIIT or Pilates. The article specifically mentions "hot high-intensity interval training classes" as popular. So the answer is hot high-intensity interval training.

3. The third question asks which organ processes toxins supposedly removed by sweat. The article says toxins are processed by liver, kidneys, and spleen. The question specifies Dr. Bourbeau's view, so the answer is liver, kidneys, and spleen. But the question asks for "primarily responsible"—maybe liver? But the article lists all three. Since it's a list, I need to see if one is primary. The text says "your liver, kidneys and spleen process any toxic chemicals," so maybe list all three. But the answer format prefers concise. The exact wording says "your liver, kidneys and spleen process..." so the answer is liver, kidneys, and spleen. But the question asks for the organ "primarily," but the article doesn't single one out. Hmm, maybe just list all three as per the article. Wait, the question says "what organ," singular. So perhaps the answer is "liver, kidneys, and spleen" but since it's singular, maybe it's N/A? Wait, the question is "what organ, according to Dr. Bourbeau..." but the article says "your liver, kidneys and spleen process..." So the answer should list all three, but since it's a single answer, maybe separate them with commas. The instruction says to answer in a sentence fragment or words. So I'll put all three.

4. The fourth question is about core temperatures reached in Bikram yoga study, similar to a hot tub. The article states that in Bikram yoga, core temps reached 102-104. So the answer is 102 to 104 degrees.

5. The fifth question asks what physiological change newcomers should anticipate, similar to athletes. The article mentions that athletes produce more hemoglobin and adjust by sweating more, lower heart rate. Newcomers are told to adapt, so the answer is improved cardiovascular efficiency (or similar). The article says "their bodies start to adjust...sweating more, lower heart rates, more hemoglobin." So the adaptation is producing more hemoglobin and adjusting to heat, leading to better performance. The question says "physiological change similar to endurance athletes," so the answer is increased hemoglobin production or improved cardiovascular efficiency. The article says "improve their speed in both hot and temperate environments" due to these adaptations. The answer should be "increased hemoglobin production" or "lower heart rates and increased sweating." Wait the question says "what physiological change... should individuals anticipate as they adapt... impacting performance..." The key here is the adaptation that helps performance in both environments. The article says "their bodies start to adjust... by sweating more and lowering their heart rates. They also produce more hemoglobin..." So the answer is increased hemoglobin production. So the answer is increased hemoglobin production.

6. The sixth question asks the humidity level similar to Bikram's 40% where Bourbeau says blood vessels expand. The article says Bikram is 105°F with 40% humidity. The question is about the humidity level that Kelsey Bourbeau mentions. The article says "blood vessels expand in the heat, allowing them to deliver more oxygen..." but the specific humidity isn't linked to her statement. The question says "similar to that of Bikram yoga," so the answer is 40%. But the question is asking for the humidity level at which Bourbeau suggests this happens. The article doesn't mention Bourbeau specifying a humidity level, only that heat causes expansion. Since the question ties it to her, but she only mentions the heat, not humidity. So maybe N/A? Wait the article says "applying heat directly... can increase flexibility... stretching in a heated room may have similar effects. Your blood vessels expand in the heat..." So Bourbeau's statement about blood vessels expanding is due to heat, not humidity. The question asks for humidity level "similar to Bikram's 40% at which Bourbeau suggests..." Since she didn't mention humidity, maybe the answer is N/A. But the question is phrased as "what humidity level... at which Kelsey Bourbeau suggests..." Since she didn't specify a humidity, the answer is N/A. Hmm, tricky. Alternatively, since the article says Bikram uses 40% humidity, and the question is asking for the humidity level similar to that where Bourbeau's blood vessel expansion occurs. Since Bourbeau's statement is about heat, not humidity, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, the question might be implying that the humidity is part of the environment, but Bourbeau's point is about heat. So I think N/A.

7. The seventh question is about the sensation beyond normal tension that indicates overstretching. The article says "if you feel pain or discomfort, that's your body telling you to back away." So the answer is pain or discomfort.

8. The eighth question asks what additional health benefit besides heart strengthening and lower BP was found equally in hot and cooler yoga. The study funded by the nonprofit found "improvements to their vascular health" were similar. So the answer is vascular health improvements.

9. The ninth question: besides dizziness and nausea, what symptom prompts Dr. Bourbeau to advise a break? The article says "if you feel dizzy or nauseated, if you sweat excessively or if your skin feels hot..." So the other symptom is excessive sweating or skin feeling hot. The question says "in addition to dizziness and nausea," so the answer is excessive sweating or hot skin. The question says "what other symptom... similar to the effect on blood vessels." The article lists three: dizziness, nausea, excessive sweating, hot skin. The question asks for another besides the first two, so either of the last two. Since the question mentions "similar to the effect on blood vessels," maybe excessive sweating (since that's a result of the body cooling), but the article lists both. The exact wording is "if you feel dizzy or nauseated, if you sweat excessively or if your skin feels hot..." So the answer could be either. But the question says "what symptom experienced... similar to the effect on blood vessels." The effect on blood vessels (expansion) leads to more sweating and increased heart rate. But the symptoms listed are sweat and skin heat. The question asks for the third symptom besides dizziness and nausea, so either "excessive sweating" or "skin feels hot to the touch." The answer should be one of them. The question says "what symptom experienced during a heated workout, similar to the effect of heat on blood vessels..." The effect on blood vessels causes sweating and heat, so either could be correct. The article's exact wording is "if you feel dizzy or nauseated, if you sweat excessively or if your skin feels hot to the touch, you should take a break..." So the answer is either of the last two. Since the question says "in addition to dizziness and nausea," the answer is "sweat excessively" or "skin feels hot to the touch." The user might expect one. Since the question says "what symptom," maybe both are needed, but the answer should be one. The question might be looking for "skin feels hot to the touch" because that's a direct effect of blood vessels, but I'm not sure. The article lists both, so perhaps the answer is "sweat excessively or skin feels hot to the touch," but the instructions say to prefer sentence fragments. Alternatively, since the question says "what symptom" singular, maybe pick one. Since the article lists both, but the question is from Dr. Bourbeau's advice, the answer is either. But perhaps the question expects "skin feels hot to the touch" since that's a direct result of blood vessel dilation? Alternatively, "excessive sweating" is a result of the body's response. I think the correct answer here is "skin feels hot to the touch" because the question mentions "similar to the effect on blood vessels," which would lead to skin feeling hot. Hmm. Alternatively, the answer could be both, but the user wants a single answer. Since the options are listed as separate conditions, perhaps the question is expecting "excessive sweating" as another symptom. But the instructions say to pick what's in the text. The exact answer from the text for the third symptom is "skin feels hot to the touch" or "sweat excessively." Since the question asks for "what symptom" and the user wants one, maybe the answer is "skin feels hot to the touch."

10. The tenth question asks what class besides hot yoga can exceed the 100°F threshold needing caution. The article says "temperatures above 100 degrees warrant extra caution" and mentions heated classes can range up to 125. The examples are hot Pilates, hot HIIT. The question says "specific type of class besides hot yoga," so the answer is hot high-intensity interval training (HIIT).

11. The eleventh question is which organ proponents claim processes toxins, but the article says it's liver, kidneys, spleen. The proponents' claim is that sweat removes toxins, but the article corrects that the organs do it. The question asks which organ the proponents claim, but the article doesn't say the proponents mention an organ. The article says "toxins... processed by liver, kidneys and spleen." The proponents' claim is about sweat, so the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "which organ is primarily responsible for processing toxins according to the claims made by proponents..." The proponents didn't mention an organ; they said sweat removes toxins. So the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question might be a trick. The proponents claim sweat removes toxins, but the article says the organs do. The question is asking what the proponents' claim says about the organ. Since they didn't mention any organ, the answer is N/A. So the answer is N/A.

12. The twelfth question asks the temperature threshold Dr. McNeely identified as requiring caution. The article says "temperatures above 100 degrees warrant extra caution." So the answer is 100 degrees.

13. The thirteenth question: what vascular metric improved equally in hot vs. cooler yoga. The study found "improvements to their vascular health" were similar. The exact metric isn't specified, so the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "similar improvements to their vascular health" but doesn't name the specific metric. So the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe "vascular health" is the metric. The question says "what specific vascular health metric," so if the article just mentions vascular health improvement, then it's N/A. So answer N/A.

14. The fourteenth question asks which endurance athlete was explicitly named as benefiting from hemoglobin increase. The article says "endurance athletes like runners and cyclists." So the answer is runners and cyclists. But the question says "explicitly named," so the answer is runners and cyclists.

15. The fifteenth question asks the physiological adaptation in blood vessels during heated exercise that loosens muscles. The article says "blood vessels expand in the heat, allowing them to deliver more oxygen and blood to muscles and tendons." So the answer is blood vessel expansion.

16. The sixteenth question is which workout had participants' core temps over 104. The article says in Bikram yoga, "participants' core temperatures reached 102 to 104." So the answer is Bikram yoga. Wait, but the question says "exceeded 104." The article says up to 104, so the answer is N/A. Wait, the question is "exceeded 104 degrees," but the article says 102-104. So the answer is N/A. Hmm, the question might be a trick here. The article says "102 to 104," so the maximum is 104, so no one went over. So the answer is N/A.

17. The seventeenth question: Dr. Hunter's reason for elevated heart rates not correlating with energy expenditure. The article says "your heart rate will also probably be higher than usual, but that doesn't necessarily mean that your body used more energy during the workout, said Stacy Hunter..." The reason is that the heart is working harder to cool the body, not because of increased energy use. So the answer is the body's effort to cool down.

18. The eighteenth question: minimum hydration strategy for a 125-degree Pilates class. The article advises "show up... well hydrated and keep drinking throughout." So the answer is staying well hydrated before and during the workout.

19. The nineteenth question asks which expert warned about overstretching in hot yoga. The article mentions Dr. McNeely, the primary care physician at Corewell Health, saying to be careful not to overstretch. So the answer is Dr. McNeely.

Now, let me go through each again to make sure.

1. N/A (no percentage given)
2. hot high-intensity interval training
3. liver, kidneys, and spleen
4. 102 to 104 degrees
5. increased hemoglobin production
6. N/A (Bourbeau didn't specify humidity)
7. pain or discomfort
8. vascular health improvements
9. skin feels hot to the touch (or "excessive sweating" but I'll go with skin)
10. hot high-intensity interval training
11. N/A (proponents didn't name an organ)
12. 100 degrees
13. N/A (metric not specified)
14. runners and cyclists
15. blood vessel expansion
16. N/A (didn't exceed 104)
17. the body's effort to cool down
18. staying well hydrated before and during
19. Dr. McNeely

Wait, for question 18, the article says "show up... well hydrated and keep drinking throughout the workout." So the minimum strategy is to hydrate before and during. The answer should be "staying well hydrated before and during the workout" but the user wants concise. Maybe "hydration before and during."

Also, question 6: the user asks for the humidity level that Bourbeau suggests. Since she didn't mention humidity, it's N/A. The article's info on humidity is only for Bikram, but she's talking about heat in general. So N/A.

Question 16: the study on Bikram had temps up to 104, so exceeding would be over 104, which the article doesn't mention. So N/A.

Alright, I think that's all. Now to format the answers properly with tags.
