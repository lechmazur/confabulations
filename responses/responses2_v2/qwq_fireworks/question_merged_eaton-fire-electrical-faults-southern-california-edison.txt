Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked without any assumptions.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions voltage drops but doesn't specify the exact value for Salt Lake City at 6:10 PM. It says the faults propagated to Salt Lake City but doesn't give a number. So, N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The text states Whisker Labs' data doesn't provide conclusive evidence. No insurance company is mentioned doing this. Answer N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The time taken for the signal to reach Portland isn't specified. The article mentions it reached there but not the milliseconds. N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The age of the tower near Gould substation isn't mentioned. The 100-year-old tower was in the Camp fire, not this one. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The percentage of voltage reduction isn't given. Marshall mentions it lowered voltage across the western grid but no exact figure. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The article doesn't mention which neighborhood had the most sensor readings during those 3 seconds. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The article doesn't specify what was burning at the first drop. It mentions flames near towers but not the material. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Number of homes in Oregon with readings in first five seconds isn't provided. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Minimum wind speed at Goodrich isn't stated. The article mentions high winds up to 100 mph in Southern California but not specifically at Goodrich. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** No engineer's name is given who made the correlation. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The Camp fire destroyed Paradise, owned by PG&E, not Edison. So answer is Paradise. Wait, the question says owned by SCE? Wait, the Camp fire was PG&E's. The article says "Pacific Gas & Electric" filed bankruptcy. So the answer is Paradise, but the question's Edison ownership is incorrect. Since the question's premise is wrong, answer N/A.

12. **Question 12:** The article doesn't state the number destroyed in the Hurst fire. Lawsuits mention the Eaton fire, not Hurst. N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Wind speed in Eaton Canyon at the second fault isn't given. The 100 mph is general for the area, but not specific to Eaton Canyon at that time. N/A.

14. **Question 14:** The voltage decrease in Germantown (Whisker's HQ) isn't mentioned. The drops were noted in Altadena, but not their office location. N/A.

15. **Question 15:** The article says McCullough Research was asked by The Times, not a state regulator. So N/A.

16. **Question 16:** The Gould substation is 5 miles from Eaton fire origin. The question asks another fire. The Hurst fire's line was in Sylmar, but not stated about the substation distance. N/A.

17. **Question 17:** The sensors were by Whisker Labs. The question says "Austin, Texas-based" but Whisker is in Maryland. So N/A.

18. **Question 18:** The Eaton fire's liability is over $10B, but Paradise's claims aren't mentioned. N/A.

19. **Question 19:** The article doesn't name the specific equipment at Gould substation causing the pulses. N/A.

20. **Question 20:** The article mentions Harris toured but doesn't say she proposed methods. N/A.
