Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks about the year when On Site Opera's phone-based performances of "The Tale of the Silly Baby Mouse" helped them during pandemic closures. Wait, the article mentions that during the pandemic, they did a phone performance of Beethoven's "An die ferne Geliebte", not "The Tale of the Silly Baby Mouse". The inaugural production of that Shostakovich piece was in 2012 at the Bronx Zoo. So the phone performance was part of pandemic efforts, but the specific opera name is different. The question might be mixing up the two. Since the article doesn't mention "The Tale of the Silly Baby Mouse" being performed via phone during the pandemic, the answer here would be N/A. Wait, but maybe the user made a mistake? The question's premise is incorrect because the phone performance was for Beethoven's work, not the Shostakovich one. Therefore, the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The question is about the endowment decrease between 2020-2023. The article mentions the Met Opera withdrew tens of millions from their endowment, but On Site Opera's budget is $1 million. There's no mention of their endowment decreasing. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Which foundation withdrew support in 2022? The article states that government contributions and foundation gifts have dwindled over the past year but doesn't name a specific foundation or year. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Who succeeded Eric Einhorn as artistic director after 2023? The article says Einhorn stepped down in 2023 but doesn't mention who took over. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Percentage from corporate sponsorships. The article says ticket sales are less than 5%, but doesn't mention corporate sponsorships. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Number of participants in the mail-based Beethoven production. The article mentions "The Beauty That Still Remains" was sent via mail but doesn't give a number. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Major donor with a matching grant in 2023? The article doesn't mention any specific donor offering a grant. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Total employees including part-time. The article states three full-time employees will lose jobs, but part-time numbers aren't given. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The budget is mentioned as about $1 million. So answer is $1 million.

10. **Question 10:** The co-founder who announced departure in 2023 and expressed gratitude. The founders were Eric Einhorn and Jessica Kiger. The article quotes Einhorn's statement after stepping down in 2023. So answer is Eric Einhorn.

11. **Question 11:** The Russian fairy tale (Shostakovich's "The Tale of the Silly Baby Mouse") was staged at the Bronx Zoo. So answer is Bronx Zoo.

12. **Question 12:** The phone-based Beethoven performances were done by On Site Opera themselves. The article says "the company offered live and interactive one-on-one performances by phone of Beethoven's..." So answer is On Site Opera.

13. **Question 13:** Revenue stream under 5% is ticket sales. The article states "Ticket sales make up less than 5 percent of the money coming in."

14. **Question 14:** Production costs increased about 50% over three years. The article says "opera is about 50 percent more expensive to produce than it was three years ago."

15. **Question 15:** The mail-based production is "The Beauty That Still Remains: Diaries in Song."

16. **Question 16:** The Met Opera withdrew from their endowment. So answer is the Metropolitan Opera.

17. **Question 17:** The inaugural 2012 production was at the Bronx Zoo. So 2012.

18. **Question 18:** The founder who brought the vision was Eric Einhorn, as mentioned in his statement.
