Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to make sure I don't use any outside knowledge and only the given text. Let's go step by step.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about the legal precedent cited by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE). Looking at the article, there's a quote from Everett Kelley, the AFGE president, who says, "Federal employees should know that approved union contracts are enforceable by law, and the president does not have the authority to make unilateral changes to those agreements." He mentions the legal enforceability of contracts and presidential authority, but does he cite a specific precedent? The article doesn't mention any case name or specific legal precedent, just a general statement about the law. So the answer here would be N/A because there's no specific precedent named.

2. **Question 2**: This is about the percentage of USAID staff laid off due to the 30-day rule. The article says, "Trump directly called for the closure of the U.S. Agency for International Development, the government's main provider of global humanitarian and development aid, just hours before most of its staff were expected to be suspended with pay or laid off." The key here is "most of its staff," but "most" isn't a percentage. Since the question asks for a specific percentage and the article only uses "most," which is vague, the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The month and year Trump issued the memo. The article mentions the memo was issued "on Friday" but doesn't specify the date. However, it's about contracts signed in the last 30 days before a presidential inauguration. Since Trump's inauguration was January 20, 2021 (assuming this refers to Trump's second term? Wait, no, the article says "Mr. Trump's inauguration," so likely the 2021 inauguration, but Trump was already president then. Wait, maybe the article is from when Trump was taking over from Biden? Wait, the article says "Biden administration" so this must be a hypothetical scenario or a mistake? Wait, actually, the article is from a time when Trump was the incoming president, so the inauguration would be January 20, 2025? But the article mentions "Biden administration," so maybe it's a fictional scenario? The exact date isn't given, only that it's the last 30 days before the inauguration. Since the memo was issued on the day of the inauguration? The article says "on Friday," but no month/year. So the answer is N/A because the exact date isn't provided.

4. **Question 4**: The mineral wealth mentioned by Trudeau that's linked to lawsuits against CBS and The Des Moines Register. The article states, "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in a talk with business leaders, said Canada's wealth of critical minerals are behind Trump's comments about making its northern neighbor a U.S. state." The lawsuits against the media are mentioned separately: "Media: First Amendment experts still believe that Trump's cases against CBS News and The Des Moines Register lack legal merit." The question connects Trudeau's mineral comment to the lawsuits, but the article doesn't say the minerals are the reason for the lawsuits. The connection is missing here. So the answer is N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The agency head responsible for housing gang members with Al Qaeda suspects. The article says, "The Trump administration is holding 10 migrants with suspected gang affiliations in the same prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba that has housed men accused of being members of Al Qaeda, U.S. defense officials said." It doesn't mention which agency head approved this. The memo refers to agency heads needing to approve contracts, but this is about migrant detention, not contract approval. The question links the agency head mentioned in the memo to this decision, but there's no info on who that is. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The aspect of First Amendment rights preserved by rushed agreements. The article says unions rushed to negotiate contracts to preserve practices like remote work. The First Amendment is about free speech, but the article mentions lawsuits against media affecting First Amendment rights. The connection here isn't clear. The unions' actions are about labor contracts, not directly about free speech. So maybe N/A, but the question might be implying that preserving contracts (which allow certain work conditions) relates to workers' rights, but the article doesn't tie it to First Amendment. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Action Trump took regarding West Point student organizations. The article says, "DEI: West Point leaders complied with President Trump's D.E.I. ban by ending a dozen student clubs." So the action was ending student clubs due to a D.E.I. ban. The answer is the D.E.I. ban leading to closure of clubs.

8. **Question 8**: The mechanism to challenge the memo. The AFGE's statement mentions they will "aggressively defend" contracts if violated. The mechanism is legal challenges, but the question asks what aspect of the contracts is used. The article says they'll defend them in court, so the mechanism is legal action. The answer is legal challenges.

9. **Question 9**: Agency with agreements outside the 30-day window. The article says "Other agencies, like the Social Security Administration, approved new collective bargaining agreements outside the 30-day window." So the answer is Social Security Administration.

10. **Question 10**: Union leader arguing contracts are binding. The quote is from Everett Kelley, so his name is the answer.

11. **Question 11**: The Education Department's agreement is highlighted as an example in the memo. The article states, "the memo says, Such 'last-minute, lame-duck' agreements, it states, ... cites an agreement with the Education Department that attempts to preserve remote work arrangements."

12. **Question 12**: Agency facing closure leading to suspensions. The article mentions USAID: "Trump directly called for the closure of the U.S. Agency for International Development... staff were expected to be suspended with pay or laid off." So the answer is U.S. Agency for International Development.

13. **Question 13**: News organization targeted in lawsuits. The article lists CBS News and The Des Moines Register.

14. **Question 14**: Who stated presidential authority over contracts? The quote is from Everett Kelley, so his name again.

15. **Question 15**: Vulnerable contract highlighted. The Education Department's remote work agreement is mentioned as an example.

16. **Question 16**: Number of migrants in Guantanamo. The article says "10 migrants."

17. **Question 17**: Category of agreements targeted. The memo targets "last-minute, lame-duck agreements signed by the Biden administration" in the final 30 days before inauguration.

18. **Question 18**: Temporary facility for migrants. The article mentions a "tent city" to house 30,000 migrants.
