Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start with each question and see what the article says.

1. **Question 1:** How did the community described as "a powerful, parallel Twitter" react to the logo from the 2008 show "Heroes" being refashioned into "Negros"?  
Looking at the article, there's a part where it mentions "someone refashioned the logo from the 2006 show 'Heroes' into 'Negros.'" The article doesn't describe their reaction beyond that. The community's reaction isn't detailed here, so the answer might be N/A. Wait, but the Negro Solstice event was part of their humor, so maybe they embraced it? But the question is specifically about the logo change. The text just states it happened, not the reaction. So N/A.

2. **Question 2:** In what year did the author of "We Tried to Tell Y'All" begin teaching at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, coinciding with the rise of digital counternarratives?  
The article says Meredith D. Clark is a professor there but doesn't mention when she started. The rise of digital counternarratives is tied to Black Twitter's heyday, which the article mentions as "early 2020s" (since Negro Solstice was 2020). But no specific year for her starting. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** What form of media, other than a book of essays, is Jenna Wortham currently developing?  
The article states Jenna Wortham is working on a book of essays called "Work of Body," and she's a co-host of a podcast ("Still Processing") and co-editor of an anthology. The question asks for another form besides the book of essays. The podcast is mentioned, so that's the answer.

4. **Question 4:** What specific type of extraction, similar to that experienced by Black creatives in Hollywood, did Black Twitter users face, leading to a new ecosystem?  
The article mentions "data surveillance and mining" and compares it to industries like Hollywood that "extorted and extracted value from Black creatives." The extraction here is "data surveillance and mining."

5. **Question 5:** Given the devolution of "woke," what literary prize did Meredith D. Clark win?  
The article doesn't mention any awards for Clark. It does mention Han Kang as a Nobel laureate, but Clark's awards aren't listed. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** What percentage of the book is dedicated to discussing the misogynoir directed at Megan Thee Stallion?  
The review says Clark's book "omits most of the ways Black Twitter occasionally cannibalized itself" and mentions Megan Thee Stallion's case as an example outside her research window. The percentage isn't given, so N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Besides the planetary conjunction, what other celestial event contributed to the DNA unlocking?  
The article states "an upcoming winter solstice, during this extraordinary planetary conjunction." So the other event is the winter solstice.

8. **Question 8:** How many times does "homophobia" appear in the book?  
The text mentions "transphobia" appears only twice, but "homophobia" isn't mentioned. So the answer is N/A unless "transphobia" is confused, but the question is about homophobia. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** What technological advancement by Elon Musk addressed data surveillance issues?  
The article says Clark finished the book before Musk's takeover, and the future of Twitter isn't detailed. No specific tech mentioned, so N/A.
