Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to go through the article carefully and find the exact answers without using any outside information. Let me start with the first question.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks which New Deal agency Leuchtenburg credited with enabling him to attend Cornell through a scholarship. The article mentions he got a job cleaning test tubes via the National Youth Administration (NYA), part of the New Deal agencies. So the answer should be NYA.

2. **Question 2:** The book "In the Shadow of F.D.R." was updated up to Obama's administration. The original version went up to a certain point. The article says he updated it "several times, taking it up to the administration of Obama." The initial editions might have covered up to previous presidents. The question is how many presidents before the final update. The first edition was in 1983, so before Obama (who was the 44th president), but the exact number isn't given. Wait, the article says he updated it up to Obama, but doesn't state the number of presidents analyzed before. Since the question asks "before its final update," which included Obama, the number isn't specified. Hmm, maybe the question is tricky here. The text doesn't give a specific number, so maybe N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The article states he earned 30 cents an hour, "a little under $7 today." So the answer is $7.

4. **Question 4:** When did he start as an NBC analyst? The article mentions he worked with Chet Huntley and David Brinkley first, then John Chancellor. Huntley-Brinkley was on NBC Nightly News starting in 1956 until 1970s. So likely during the 1950s or 60s, but the exact administration isn't specified. Wait, the question is during which presidential administration. The article says he worked with them first, so probably during the Kennedy or Johnson era? The exact president isn't mentioned, so maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "first with Huntley and Brinkley, then with John Chancellor." Huntley-Brinkley era was under Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson? Not sure. Since the article doesn't specify the administration, answer N/A.

5. **Question 5:** His position at Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) with Eleanor Roosevelt. The article says he was "active" in ADA, which Eleanor helped found. It doesn't mention his specific position, so N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Number of quotes selected for FDR memorial? The article says he "selected the quotations" but doesn't specify the count. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Primary argument against Bork's nomination? The article only mentions he testified against Bork in 1987, but not the specific argument. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Which European historians wrote to him about Trump? The article says "letters I'm getting from historians, particularly in Europe" but doesn't name them. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Percentage of African Americans excluded? The article says the New Deal excluded "powerless groups like... most African Americans" but no percentage given. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Hours per week with John Chancellor? The article mentions he worked with Chancellor but no hours. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Year of the Greyhound trip. He was 12 when he took the trip. Born in 1922, so 12 would be 1934 (1922+12). The article says he visited the White House, Capitol, and the "recently built Supreme Court building." The Supreme Court building was completed in 1935. So the trip must be after 1935. Since he was 12 in 1934, but the building was finished in 1935, so the trip was in 1935 or later. The article says "recently built," so probably 1935. So 1935.

12. **Question 12:** When did he start at UNC? He taught for three decades at Columbia, then two more at UNC. He got his Ph.D. in 1951, so started at Columbia around then. Three decades would take him to 1981. Then two more years at UNC, so started in 1981 or 1982? The article says "then for two more at the University of North Carolina before emeritus." So likely started in 1981. But need exact. The article doesn't say the exact year, so maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "taught for three decades at Columbia and then for two more at the University of North Carolina before he was given emeritus status there." So after 30 years at Columbia, starting in, say, 1951 (PhD 1951), so 1951-1981. Then two years at UNC would be 1981-1983. So he began in 1981. So answer is 1981.

13. **Question 13:** The civil rights demonstration he joined with MLK. The article mentions he marched with MLK in 1965, which was the Selma to Montgomery march. So the answer is the 1965 march to Montgomery.

14. **Question 14:** Quality Roosevelt had that later presidents lacked. The article says a millworker's comment about FDR understanding their boss, and Leuchtenburg noted Obama didn't convey that same sense. The key quality is understanding the plight of ordinary people, "knowing what it is to be down and out." So the answer is "understanding the struggles of the disadvantaged" or similar. The exact wording from the text: "Franklin Roosevelt is the only president we've ever had who understands that my boss is a son of a gun" and Obama didn't convey that connection. So the quality is "empathy for the disadvantaged" or "connection with the underprivileged."

15. **Question 15:** Element he selected for the FDR memorial. The article states he selected the quotations for the memorial. So the answer is "quotations."

16. **Question 16:** Mother's immigrant heritage. His mother was from Ireland, as she immigrated from Ireland as an infant. So answer is "Irish."

17. **Question 17:** Judicial intervention against Watergate. The article mentions he joined lawsuits to stop Nixon from destroying the Watergate tapes. So the answer is "preservation of the Watergate tapes."

18. **Question 18:** Final book's era. His last book was "Patriot Presidents: From George Washington to John Quincy Adams," so the era is the early U.S. presidents up to John Quincy Adams.

19. **Question 19:** First book's subject. His first book was on the politics of flood control in 1953. So "flood control."

20. **Question 20:** Which former president compared to Trump? The article says he compared Trump to Nixon, mentioning Nixon's "madman theory." So answer is "Richard Nixon."
