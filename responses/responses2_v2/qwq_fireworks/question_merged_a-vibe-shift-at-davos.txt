Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and answer each question exactly as per the instructions. Let me start by skimming through the article again to find the relevant sections for each question.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks about a tech mogul whose absence from Davos is due to attending Trump's inauguration, and who was part of the Young Global Leaders program. The article mentions Elon Musk, who declined an invitation and hasn't been invited since 2015. Also, it says he's not attending Davos but was involved with the program before. The answer should be Musk.

2. **Question 2**: The financial institution projecting $20B losses from wildfires is JPMorgan, as stated in the article.

3. **Question 3**: The TikTok sale ban takes effect as soon as Sunday, per the Supreme Court ruling. The exact day might be Sunday, but since the article says "as soon as Sunday," maybe the answer is Sunday. Wait, the question asks for the day the law takes effect, so the answer is Sunday.

4. **Question 4**: The top economic risk in Conference Board's survey is a downturn or recession (45.7%). The article mentions this as the top economic risk.

5. **Question 5**: The Blackstone exec with delayed confirmation is Howard Lutnick, due to paperwork.

6. **Question 6**: The beverage CEO who gave Trump a Diet Coke is James Quincy from Coca-Cola.

7. **Question 7**: The tech leader with a stance on tariffs counter to Trump's is Elon Musk, since Tesla makes half its cars in China.

8. **Question 8**: Musk last received an invitation in 2015, as per the article's note.

9. **Question 9**: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon got the $80M bonus.

10. **Question 10**: Frank McCourt is trying to buy TikTok and is attending Davos.

11. **Question 11**: Same as question 6, so James Quincy again.

12. **Question 12**: Howard Lutnick again, mentioned with tariff policies.

13. **Question 13**: The CEO hosting the inauguration is Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber.

14. **Question 14**: The World Economic Forum's Davos is moving focus, so answer Davos.

15. **Question 15**: Elon Musk is the mogul in question here.

16. **Question 16**: David Solomon from Goldman Sachs again.

17. **Question 17**: Marc Benioff of Salesforce planted trees.

18. **Question 18**: The World Economic Forum survey named state-based conflict as top risk.

19. **Question 19**: Bill Ford of General Atlantic is on ByteDance's board.

20. **Question 20**: The S&P 500 index rose 56% over Biden's term.

Wait, let me check each again for accuracy:

1. Yes, Musk is the tech mogul who was a Young Global Leader and not attending Davos due to inauguration events. Correct.

2. JPMorgan mentioned for the $20B insured losses. Correct.

3. The law takes effect as soon as Sunday. The exact day is Sunday. But the question is about the day, so Sunday.

5. Howard Lutnick's confirmation delayed due to paperwork. Correct.

6. Coca-Cola's CEO Quincy gave Trump a Diet Coke. Correct.

7. Musk's stance on China tariffs because Tesla's reliance. Correct.

8. The article says Musk hadn't been invited since 2015, so last invitation was 2015. Correct.

9. Goldman's CEO Solomon got the bonus. Correct.

10. Frank McCourt is buying TikTok and attending Davos. Correct.

11. Same as 6, so Quincy. Correct.

12. Lutnick's confirmation is delayed due to paperwork. Correct.

13. Khosrowshahi's itinerary includes the inauguration. Correct.

18. World Economic Forum's survey. Correct.

20. S&P 500 index. Correct.

I think all answers are there. Let me ensure none are N/A. The article provides info for all except maybe question 3's exact day. The article says "as soon as Sunday" so the day is Sunday. So all should have answers except if any details are missing. Let me check again.

For question 8, the article says "A Forum representative told news outlets that Musk hadn't been invited since 2015." So the last invitation was 2015, so answer is 2015. Correct.

Everything looks covered. Now, format as per instructions.
