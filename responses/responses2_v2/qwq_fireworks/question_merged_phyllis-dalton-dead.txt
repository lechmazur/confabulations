Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and follow the strict format. Let me start by going through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions her time as a code breaker at Bletchley Park but doesn't link it to her costume design for "Lawrence of Arabia." She called it "unbelievably boring," but there's no direct connection stated between her codebreaking and her costume work. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The article says that in "Lawrence of Arabia," the character's robe (Peter O'Toole's) starts to wilt as he loses his sanity. The question asks which actor's wardrobe shows this. The answer is Peter O'Toole.

3. **Question 3**: The article states that "Doctor Zhivago" earned her her first Oscar. The film is set during the Russian Revolution, so that's the answer.

4. **Question 4**: The last film mentioned as her final credit is "Much Ado About Nothing" with Kenneth Branagh.

5. **Question 5**: The article emphasizes her attention to detail and research, like going to the desert in Jordan. The central quality would be "attention to detail" or "research," but the exact phrase might be "unflinching attention to detail" from the first paragraph. However, the question asks for a single quality. The article mentions "meticulous" and "immersed herself in research," so maybe "meticulous research" or "attention to detail."

6. **Question 6**: The article says "Doctor Zhivago's" fur designs influenced Christian Dior's runway. So the answer is "Doctor Zhivago."

7. **Question 7**: She worked in code breaking during wartime at Bletchley Park. The question asks what alternate function she performed. The article says she was a code breaker, so the answer is "code breaker" or "code breaking."

8. **Question 8**: The article mentions Cary Elwes broke his toe on "The Princess Bride," and she made a special shoe. So the answer is "The Princess Bride."

9. **Question 9**: "Doctor Zhivago" is noted for 3,000 costumes and 35,000 items.

10. **Question 10**: The process with steel files, hair spray, and grease was for "Henry V."

11. **Question 11**: The death was confirmed by her stepson, James Barton.

Let me double-check each answer against the article text to ensure accuracy. For question 5, the article says her "unflinching attention to detail" and "meticulous" process. The central quality would be "meticulousness" or "attention to detail." The exact phrase in the article is "meticulous" and "immersed herself in research." Since the question asks for a single quality central to her method, "meticulousness" or "attention to detail" fits. The first paragraph says "unflinching attention to detail," so maybe that's the answer. But the question says "single quality," so perhaps "meticulousness" is better. Wait, the article says "meticulous" in the context of Henry V's aging process. Hmm, but the question is more general. The first sentence says her "unflinching attention to detail earned her Oscars," so that's probably the answer here. 

Okay, proceeding with that. Let me make sure all answers are directly from the text and not inferred beyond what's stated.
