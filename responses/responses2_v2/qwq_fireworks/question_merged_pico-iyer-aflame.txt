Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks about the Santa Barbara Vedanta Temple's aspect besides its location that made it suitable for Christopher Isherwood's lecture on discipline and devotion from Big Sur. The article mentions the temple's "sweeping views of the bucolic California town and the ocean shimmering in the distance," but that's about location. Wait, the question is about what made it suitable for the lecture. Wait, the article says "the temple provided Iyer with an early sense of refuge" and "places of quiet." The lecture was on Hinduism. Maybe the temple's environment of quiet and refuge is the aspect. The answer might be "refuge" or "quiet." Let me check again. The exact quote: "the temple offers sweeping views... and it provided Iyer with an early sense of refuge." The question is about the setting for the lecture on discipline/devotion. Since the temple is a place of quiet and refuge, that's the aspect. So the answer is "refuge" or "quiet place." The article says "places of quiet" are where he found refuge, so maybe "quiet" is the key. Wait the question says "discipline and devotion found in Big Sur." Wait, the lecture was on Hinduism, not directly about Big Sur's discipline. Hmm, maybe the temple's association with seeking quiet is the aspect. The answer might be "quiet" or "refuge." The article says "the temple gardens in late October, not far from where, as a teenager, he heard Christopher Isherwood lecture on Hinduism." The aspect besides location would be the quiet or refuge. The answer is "a place of quiet" or "refuge." The exact phrase from the article when he talks about the temple is "provided Iyer with an early sense of refuge." So the answer is "refuge."

2. **Question 2**: The editor mentions a "conscious progression" where Iyer shifted focus. The question is what genre he transitioned away from after his travel book success. The article says his first book was a travel book, and later he wrote novels and essay collections. The editor says he's now focused more on inner terrain. The question asks what genre he moved away from. His initial job was rewriting reports for Time, which is non-fiction. His first book was a travelogue. The transition away might be from travel books to more introspective or essay-based works. Wait, the question is "transitioned away from after his initial success with Video Night..." So after that, he wrote other genres. The question is what genre he moved away from. Wait, the editor says he's now more focused on inner terrain. So maybe he moved away from travel writing? But the question says "transitioned away from after his initial success... other than travel books." Wait, the question is asking what genre besides travel books did he transition away from. Wait, the editor says "He's always had a burning curiosity about the internal lives of others, and now he's opening up more intimately about his own as well." So perhaps he moved away from non-travel? Or maybe he started with travel and then moved to novels and essays. The article mentions he wrote novels set in Cuba and Iran, and essay collections. The question is asking what genre he transitioned away from after the travel success. Maybe he moved away from his previous job, which was rewriting international reports for Time, which is more journalistic. But the question is about genre, so maybe the answer is "non-fiction" or "travel literature." Wait, the question is "what genre of writing, other than travel books, did Iyer transition away from..." So perhaps after his travel success, he moved into novels and essays, so the previous genre was non-fiction? But his job was rewriting reports, which is non-fiction. But the question is about writing genre, not his job. The article says "there are still parts of the world he craves to see... but now 'the great adventure takes place at the desk.'" So maybe he transitioned away from travel writing to more introspective works. Wait, the editor's quote says "He's always had a burning curiosity about the internal lives of others, and now he's opening up more intimately about his own as well." So perhaps he moved away from travel writing to more personal or essay-based works. The question says "transitioned away from after his initial success... other than travel books." Wait, maybe the answer is "non-fiction" but the article mentions he wrote novels, so maybe he moved away from non-fiction into fiction? Or the other way around? Wait, "Video Night in Kathmandu" is a travel book (non-fiction). Then he wrote "The Lady and the Monk" (Japan, likely non-fiction?), "Falling Off the Map" (travel essays?), and novels like "Cuba and the Night" (fiction). So perhaps he moved away from non-fiction into novels? But the question is what genre he transitioned away from. The editor says he's now more into inner terrain, so maybe he moved away from travel writing. But the question says "other than travel books," so the answer is "non-fiction" or "journalism"? Alternatively, the article says "there has always been an inward dimension to Iyer's work." Maybe he didn't transition away from anything but added more. Wait, the editor says "a conscious progression," a gradual shift in focus. So perhaps he moved away from external exploration (travel) to internal. The question is asking what genre besides travel he moved away from. Wait, maybe the answer is "novels" or "fiction"? Because the editor says he's now more into his own inner life, so perhaps he moved away from novels (which are fictional) to non-fiction? Hmm. The article says "there are still parts of the world he craves to see... but now 'the great adventure takes place at the desk.'" The desk implies writing, perhaps more introspective essays. The editor's quote says he's now more focused on inner terrain, so maybe he moved away from travel writing to essays? But the question asks "other than travel books," so the answer might be "non-fiction" but I'm confused. Wait, the question is phrased as: "what genre of writing, other than travel books, did Iyer transition away from after his initial success with Video Night..." So the initial success was in travel books. After that, he did other genres. The question is asking what genre he moved away from. Wait, maybe the answer is "journalism" because his previous job was rewriting reports (which is journalistic), and he transitioned away from that into travel writing, but that's his initial success. Hmm, maybe I need to read the article again. 

The article says: "He took a six-month leave of absence and made his way across 10 Asian countries. The result, 'Video Night in Kathmandu,' was published... and became an instant sensation... Iyer never looked back. Books followed on Japan ('The Lady and the Monk') and the 'lonely places of the world' ('Falling Off the Map'), as well as novels set in Cuba and Iran ('Cuba and the Night' and 'Abandon'). There were also essay collections on modern dislocation and spiritual jet lag ('The Global Soul') and on contemporary writers... ('Tropical Classical'). And yet there has always been an inward dimension to Iyer's work."

So after his travel success (Video Night), he wrote other travel books (Japan, Falling Off the Map), novels, and essay collections. The editor says he's now more focused on inner terrain, so perhaps he transitioned away from novels? But the question is asking what genre he transitioned away from after the initial success (so after Video Night). The answer might be "novels" because he started with travel, then did novels, but now moving away from that? Wait the question is asking what genre he transitioned away from. The editor says "a conscious progression," so maybe he moved away from novels and travel to more introspective essays. But the question is asking what genre besides travel he moved away from. The answer might be "fiction" since he wrote novels but now focusing on non-fiction essays. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is "journalism" from his previous job. The question is tricky. Let me check the exact quote from the editor: "He's always had a burning curiosity about the internal lives of others, and now he's opening up more intimately about his own as well." So maybe he moved away from external (travel) to internal (essays). The question asks for the genre he transitioned away from besides travel. So perhaps the answer is "non-fiction" but that's too broad. Alternatively, maybe "fiction" since he wrote novels but now moving away. The article says "there are still parts of the world he craves to see... but now 'the great adventure takes place at the desk.'" The desk implies writing, but the shift is to inner, so maybe he's moving away from novels? The question is about the genre transition. The answer might be "novels" but I'm not sure. Wait, the editor says "conscious progression... gradual shift in focus." The question is "what genre of writing, other than travel books, did Iyer transition away from..." So after his initial travel success, he wrote novels, then later moved away from novels into something else? The article says he has a "wealth of material to draw from" and "the great adventure takes place at the desk," so maybe he moved away from novels to essay collections? The essay collections are non-fiction. The answer could be "fiction" (novels) as the genre he transitioned away from. Alternatively, the answer might be "journalism" from his prior job. The article says his job was "rewriting international reports for Time magazine." So that's journalistic writing. After leaving that, he wrote travel books, then other genres. The question is about what he transitioned away from after the travel success. So perhaps the answer is "journalism" but that's not a genre of his books. The question is about his writing genre. Maybe the answer is "non-fiction" but that's too broad. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "travel literature" but the question specifies "other than travel books." Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick. The editor says he's now more focused on inner terrain, so he's moving away from travel writing. But the question is asking what genre besides travel he moved away from. Maybe the answer is "fiction" since he wrote novels but now focusing on essays. The article mentions "essay collections" as part of his work. So perhaps the answer is "novels" as the genre he transitioned away from after the travel success. Let me note this as a possible answer, but I'm not 100% sure.

3. **Question 3**: The question is how many viewers watched his TED talk on the lessons from the monks. The article says "his 2014 TED Talk... reached more than 11 million viewers worldwide." But the question specifies the talk on the aging monks. Wait, the TED Talk mentioned is "The Art of Stillness," which is about stillness. The article also mentions another talk on "the meaning of home and the lessons of table tennis." The question refers to the talk on the monks. Wait, the article says "the lessons of table tennis" but the 11 million viewers are for the TED talks in general. The exact quote: "He went on to give several more popular TED talks -- on the meaning of home and the lessons of table tennis, for example -- that gave him a 'global megaphone' and reached more than 11 million viewers worldwide." The question is about the talk on the monks. The article doesn't specify which talk got the 11 million. The 2014 TED Talk was on stillness, which might relate to the monks' teachings. Since the question is about the monks' lessons, but the article doesn't specify the exact viewers for that specific talk. The answer might be "N/A" because the 11 million is for all his TED talks combined. The question asks specifically about the talk on the aging monks, which isn't mentioned. So the answer is "N/A".

4. **Question 4**: The question asks what event prompted Iyer to write about the monastery in 1993, mirroring the destruction of his Santa Barbara home. The article states that he first went to the monastery in 1991 after his house burned down, and the fire led him there. The first time he wrote about it was in 1993, so the event prompting that was the house fire. The answer is "house burned down" or "fire destroyed his house."

5. **Question 5**: The question is asking for another work besides *Aflame* that explores impermanence through Old and New World cultures. The article says in *Aflame*, he found a blend of Old and New World culture at the hermitage. The other work might be "The Half Known Life: In Search of Paradise," since it's mentioned as an earlier work exploring inner and outer worlds. The article says "Like Iyer's previous book, 'The Half Known Life: In Search of Paradise,' 'Aflame' is an attempt to find a through-line in his exploration of inner and outer worlds." The question is about impermanence and Old/New World. The answer is "The Half Known Life: In Search of Paradise."

6. **Question 6**: The TED talk about the external world drowning out the internal, which is a theme in *Aflame*. The article says "In the age of smartphones and social media... this is even more true, he said. 'The external world is so intense now...' " The TED Talk on stillness was in 2014. The question's theme is mentioned in the article as part of the TED talks, but the exact year for that specific talk? The article says "his 2014 TED Talk, 'The Art of Stillness,' further expanded on the wonders of the contemplative life." The theme about external vs internal is part of that talk. So the answer is "2014".

7. **Question 7**: The element of the natural world similar to wildfires in *The Half Known Life*. The article mentions "forest fire" as a motif in *Aflame*. The question is about *The Half Known Life*. The article says "the effects of climate change made the book even more pressing. In 2008... wildfires..." But for *The Half Known Life*, I need to see. The article says "Like Iyer's previous book, 'The Half Known Life: In Search of Paradise,' 'Aflame' is an attempt to find a through-line..." but it doesn't mention a natural element there. The question asks for a motif similar to wildfires. Since the article doesn't mention another natural element in that book, the answer might be "N/A". Alternatively, maybe "ocean" or "mountains"? Wait the article doesn't specify. So "N/A".

8. **Question 8**: The specific aspect of monks' lives beyond humor, captured in his writing due to the TED talks' "global megaphone." The article says he captured their "brokenness and humanity." The "global megaphone" refers to the TED talks' reach. The answer is "brokenness and humanity."

9. **Question 9**: The Manhattan job before his escape that mirrored the "lonely places" in *Falling Off the Map*. The job was "rewriting international reports for Time magazine." The "lonely places" book includes dispatches from remote areas. The job's nature is office work, cubicle culture, which is the opposite of lonely places. The question asks what job mirrored the lonely places. Since the job was in Manhattan, maybe "cubicle culture" or "international reports." The answer is "rewriting international reports for Time magazine" but the question asks for the type of job. The answer is "rewriting international reports" or "journalistic reports." The exact term from the article is "rewriting international reports for Time magazine." So the answer is "rewriting international reports."

10. **Question 10**: The literary prize Han Kang won. The article says "Han Kang... Nobel laureate." So the answer is "Nobel Prize."

11. **Question 11**: The ritual at the Santa Barbara Vedanta Temple linked to silence and creativity. The article mentions "the art of sitting still" and "the temple provided Iyer with an early sense of refuge." The specific ritual might be the lectures or the act of seeking quiet. The article says "You learn to love the world only by looking at it closely," which is from his TED Talk. The ritual could be "seeking quiet" or "meditation." The article doesn't explicitly mention a ritual, but the act of going there for quiet is implied. The answer might be "meditation" but the text says "places of quiet" and "looking at it closely." The exact quote: "You learn to love the world only by looking at it closely," which is part of the TED Talk on stillness. The ritual would be "seeking stillness" or "meditation." Since the temple is a place of quiet, the ritual is the act of seeking refuge there. The answer might be "meditation" but the article doesn't state it explicitly. Alternatively, "sitting still" as per the book title. The article says "the art of sitting still," so maybe the ritual is "sitting still." The answer is "sitting still."

12. **Question 12**: The two geographical features juxtaposed in "Aflame." The article says the monastery is set "amid California's natural splendor and wide horizons." The two features might be "natural splendor" and "wide horizons," but the exact terms are needed. Alternatively, "forest" and "ocean" but the article mentions the temple has ocean views. Wait, the monastery is in Big Sur, which has "California's natural splendor and wide horizons." The answer is "natural splendor and wide horizons."

13. **Question 13**: The travel narrative misattributed as inspired by the Vedanta Temple but focused on a different region. The article mentions "Video Night in Kathmandu" as his first book inspired by travels. The Vedanta Temple is in California. So the answer is "Video Night in Kathmandu."
