Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I don't look beyond the text and answer exactly based on what's there.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions Stanford's initiative is funded by Charles R. Schwab, a discount-brokerage pioneer. The curriculum includes venture capital but does it mention cryptocurrency? The text says Stanford's course covers valuing stock options and venture capital, but not cryptocurrency. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Dr. Campbell's course at Harvard. The question is about discussing fixed pensions to critique challenges for first-gen students. The article states Harvard's course helps wealthier students understand less affluent peers' difficulties, but does it link fixed pensions to that? The article mentions fixed pensions in the context of past job benefits vs 401(k)s, but not specifically in Dr. Campbell's course for first-gen critique. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Two institutions requiring case studies on venture capital returns and tax brackets. Stanford's course covers venture capital (via Dr. Boskin), and maybe Berkeley? The article mentions Berkeley's course covers investment decisions and taxes? Let me check. The article says Berkeley's course covers major decisions like investments and mentions taxes, fees, inflation. Stanford's course also discusses taxes. But does it specify case studies on venture capital and tax brackets? The article says Stanford's course covers venture capital and investing principles, but not explicitly case studies on both. So maybe Stanford and another? The article mentions Dartmouth's course includes psychology but not venture capital. Hmm. The exact case studies aren't specified for two institutions. Answer N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Dr. Odean's course at Berkeley incorrectly attributes a bias to prioritizing debt over investing. The article states his course covers overconfidence and present bias affecting choices. The question asks which bias is incorrectly attributed to preferring paying debt over investing. Present bias is the tendency for immediate benefits over long-term. Paying debt is a long-term benefit, but present bias would make someone avoid it. Wait, the question says the course "incorrectly" attributes the tendency to prioritize paying debt over investing. But the article says present bias is the tendency to value immediate over long-term. Paying debt now might be seen as immediate, but investing is long-term. So if the course says present bias causes preferring debt repayment over investing, that might be correct. But the question says it's incorrect. The text doesn't mention any incorrect attribution, so N/A. Or maybe the question is wrong? Since the article states that present bias is part of the course's content, but the question says the course incorrectly attributes that bias to a specific behavior. Since the article doesn't say it's incorrect, answer N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The Stanford initiative's research says percentage of students who negotiated higher salaries. The article mentions the Stanford initiative but no specific stats on salary negotiations. The 2022 analysis found positive effects but not specific percentages. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Which professor's course was criticized for focusing on stock options instead of 401(k) accessibility. The article mentions Dr. Boskin's Stanford course covers stock options and venture capital, but any criticism? The text mentions some criticize financial literacy as a distraction from systemic issues. Dr. Odean says it's not a panacea. But is there a specific professor criticized for stock options vs 401(k)? The article says Harvard's course addresses systemic issues. The Stanford course by Boskin might be the one, but no direct mention of criticism. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Dartmouth's noncredit workshops influenced by P-Fin's compound interest questions. The article says Dartmouth's course explores psychology but the P-Fin Index includes compound interest. The article states the Stanford initiative uses questions by Dr. Lusardi on concepts like compound interest. The Dartmouth course's design? The article says Dartmouth's course was first taught last spring and includes psychology, but no direct link to P-Fin's compound interest influencing their workshops. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Alexandrea Coe incorrectly associates present bias with a concept. The article says she learned that her time is an asset, so starting to save early. Present bias is the tendency to value immediate over long-term. She might have thought present bias was about not saving, which is correct. The question says she incorrectly associates present bias with something else. The text doesn't mention her making a mistake here. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Which state's high school requirement is the model for venture capital in college courses. The article says over two-thirds of states require personal finance, but the Stanford program's model? The article mentions the Stanford initiative's collaboration but doesn't specify a state's requirement as a model. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Economist leading Stanford's initiative since 2023, blending venture capital and retirement. The article says Annamaria Lusardi leads the Stanford program since 2023. She's mentioned in that role. Yes, so answer Lusardi.

11. **Question 11:** University contrasting fixed pensions vs 401(k) and stock options. The article mentions Harvard's course addresses systemic issues but Stanford's course covers stock options and venture capital. The part about fixed pensions vs 401(k)s is in the context of Dr. Lusardi's comments. The U.NLV's course? The article says J. Daniel Chi mentions the need for personal finance because people have to manage their own money now instead of fixed pensions. The university that has a course contrasting these? Stanford's course covers stock options and venture capital, and the article's earlier part mentions the shift from pensions to 401(k)s. The specific course that contrasts them might be Stanford's. The article mentions Stanford's course covers valuing stock options and venture capital, and the context of moving from pensions to 401(k)s is part of why the courses exist. So Stanford?

12. **Question 12:** Finance professor at renowned business school addressing overconfidence and present bias. The article mentions Dr. Odean at Berkeley's Haas School. His course covers overconfidence and present bias. So Odean.

13. **Question 13:** Student on hockey team using debit instead of credit. The text mentions Sean Karaman, freshman at UNLV, hockey team, switched to debit. So answer Sean Karaman.

14. **Question 14:** Economist at a university with generous aid, using finance to teach economics. Harvard's Dr. Campbell. The article says his course uses finance to teach basic economics and encourages critical reflection on systemic issues. So Campbell.

15. **Question 15:** Educator co-developed course after students regret job offers. Dr. Boskin introduced the course with a colleague after former students wished they knew more about evaluating job offers. So Boskin.

16. **Question 16:** Institution funded by Schwab's family, courses on credit scores and diversification. Stanford's initiative is funded by Schwab. The courses cover credit scores and diversification. So Stanford.

17. **Question 17:** University with course where Coe learned time is greatest asset. Coe is at Berkeley. The article says her course taught that. So Berkeley.

18. **Question 18:** Educator discussing trade-offs between salary and schedule, family dependability affecting risk. Dr. Boskin mentions trade-offs like flexible schedule vs salary and family reliance on you. So Boskin.

19. **Question 19:** 2022 analysis in Journal of Financial Economics. The article says an analysis published there found positive effects. The answer is the 2022 analysis, so "positive" is the effect, but the question asks for the conclusion's wording. The answer is "positive effects on financial knowledge and behaviors".

Now, check each answer against the text:

1. N/A (no crypto mentioned)
2. N/A (no mention of fixed pensions in that context)
3. N/A (no two institutions specified with those case studies)
4. N/A (no incorrect attribution stated)
5. N/A (no percentage given)
6. N/A (no specific criticism mentioned)
7. N/A (no link to P-Fin influencing Dartmouth's workshops)
8. N/A (no incorrect association stated)
9. N/A (no specific state's requirement as model)
10. Annamaria Lusardi
11. Stanford (since their course covers stock options and the context of pensions vs 401k)
12. Michael Boskin? Wait, no: Dr. Odean is at Berkeley's Haas. The question asks about the professor addressing overconfidence and present bias. The article says Dr. Odean's course covers those. So Odean.
13. Sean Karaman
14. John Y. Campbell (Harvard)
15. Michael Boskin
16. Stanford
17. University of California, Berkeley (since Coe is a Berkeley student)
18. Michael Boskin
19. The analysis concluded "positive" effects, so the answer is "positive effects on financial knowledge and behaviors".

Wait for question 11: The article says Stanford's course covers valuing stock options and venture capital, and the part about fixed pensions vs 401(k) is in the context of why people need to manage their own finances now. The question asks which university's course contrasts fixed pensions with 401(k)s while including stock options. The article mentions that in the general discussion but specifically, the Stanford course includes stock options and venture capital. The contrast between pensions and 401(k)s is part of the rationale for the courses, but does any course explicitly contrast them? The Harvard course addresses systemic issues but maybe not the specific contrast. The article says Dr. Lusardi's point is about moving from pensions to 401(k)s, but the course that includes stock options is Stanford's. So the answer is Stanford.
