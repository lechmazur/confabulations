Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided.

1. **Fraction of trails open**: The article states "around one fourth of Park City's trails are currently open." So the answer is 1/4 or 25%. The question asks for the fraction, so 1/4 is appropriate.

2. **Hourly wage increase sought**: The patrollers are demanding a "$2 increase in their hourly base wage, from $21 to $23." The answer is $2.

3. **Labor organization**: The union is part of the Communications Workers of America. The text mentions "the union is now part of the Communications Workers of America." So that's the answer.

4. **Months between proposal and strike**: Proposal was in September, strike started Dec 27. From September to December is 4 months (Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec). But counting months passed: September to December is 3 full months, but since the strike started in December, it's 3.5 or 4 months? The exact months between September and December 27 would be about 3.5 months, but the question asks how many months passed. The article doesn't specify exact dates beyond the month. Since it's from September to December, it's 4 months (Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec). So the answer is 4.

5. **Percentage increase claimed by Vail**: The article says Vail increased wages by "more than 50 percent over the past four seasons." The exact percentage is over 50%, but the question asks for the percentage they assert, so "more than 50 percent" but since they need a specific number, it's stated as "more than 50 percent," so the answer is 50%.

6. **Multimountain pass**: The pass is called the Epic Pass. The article mentions "Vail sold 2.4 million of its multimountain Epic Pass."

7. **Patroller ratio**: Normally over 100 patrollers, now 30-35. The ratio is current (30-35) vs normal (over 100). The approximate ratio would be roughly 30/100 = 0.3, so 1:3.33. The question asks for the ratio of current to normal. The article says "30 to 35 patrollers" vs "more than 100." So the ratio is approximately 1/3 or 30-35:100. The answer could be "about 1/3" but the question wants the ratio, so 30-35 to 100. Since they want approximate, maybe 1:3 (since 30 is a third of 100). The answer is approximately 1/3 or 30-35:100. The article says "around one fourth of trails" but the ratio here is different. The answer should be the approximate ratio, so 30 to 35 compared to over 100. Let's say roughly 1/3.

8. **Role of federal mediator**: The article states they are negotiating "with a federal mediator." The role isn't explicitly stated, but the question asks what role the mediator plays. The standard role of a federal mediator is to facilitate negotiations. Since the article doesn't specify, but the question requires an answer based on the text, it just says they are negotiating with a federal mediator. The answer is "facilitate negotiations" but the exact term from the text? The text doesn't say, so maybe "negotiating with a federal mediator" but the role is to mediate. Since the question is about the role, the answer is "mediator in negotiations" but the exact wording? The article only says they are negotiating with a federal mediator. Since the role is to mediate, the answer is "mediator" or "facilitate negotiations." Since the question requires the role, the answer is "mediator" but the article doesn't state their role beyond being present. Hmm, maybe the answer is "N/A" but wait, the article says "negotiating almost daily with a federal mediator." The role is to mediate the negotiations, so the answer is "to mediate the negotiations" or just "mediator." The question asks "what role does this mediator play," so the answer is "mediator" or "facilitate negotiations." Since the article doesn't explicitly state the role beyond being part of the negotiations, maybe it's better to say "N/A"? Wait, the question says "role does this mediator play in the wage dispute." Since mediators typically facilitate negotiations between parties, even if not stated, but the instructions say to use only the text. The article doesn't specify the role beyond their presence. So the answer might be N/A. Wait, the article says "negotiating almost daily with a federal mediator." The role here is that the mediator is involved in the negotiations. The role is to facilitate the negotiation process. Since the question is asking what the mediator's role is, but the article doesn't explicitly state it, but we can infer it's a mediator's role. However, according to the instructions, if it's not directly stated, but can be inferred, it's okay. Since a mediator's role is to help negotiate, the answer is "facilitate negotiations" but the exact wording? The article says "negotiating... with a federal mediator," so the mediator's role is to mediate the negotiations. So the answer is "mediator in the negotiations" but the exact term is "mediator." Alternatively, the answer is "N/A" if the role isn't specified. Hmm. The article doesn't say the mediator's role, only that they are negotiating with one. Since the question asks what role the mediator plays, and the article doesn't state that, maybe it's N/A. Wait, but the term "federal mediator" implies their role is to mediate. Since the question allows logical inference, then the role is "to mediate the negotiations between the two parties." So the answer is "mediator between the parties" or just "mediator." The question requires the answer based on the text. Since the text says they are negotiating with a federal mediator, the role is "to mediate the dispute." So the answer is "mediator in the negotiations" but since the exact wording isn't given, maybe just "mediator." But the question wants the role, so perhaps "mediator." Let me check the article again: "Vail Resorts and the Park City patrol union are negotiating almost daily with a federal mediator." So the mediator is part of the negotiation process. The role is to facilitate the negotiation. Since the article doesn't explicitly state the role beyond their involvement, but the term "mediator" inherently means that. So the answer is "mediator in the negotiations."

9. **GoFundMe total**: The article states "An account on GoFundMe currently has more than $200,000 in donations." So the answer is over $200,000. The question asks for the total amount, so "$200,000+."

10. **Compromised guest experience element**: The article mentions "long lift lines, limited terrain and frustration among skiers." The question asks what element is most clearly compromised. The answer is "terrain access" or "terrain availability." The article says "limited terrain" so the answer is "terrain access" or "terrain availability." Alternatively, "skiing experience" but the text specifically mentions limited terrain and long lines. The question asks for the one element most clearly compromised. The first part says "long lift lines, limited terrain and frustration" so the main elements are the lines and terrain. The question asks for the one element, so perhaps "terrain access" is the key. Alternatively, the answer could be "terrain availability" or "skiing opportunities." The article says "limited terrain" so the answer is "terrain access" or "terrain availability." The exact wording is "limited terrain," so the answer is "terrain access."
