Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. Let me go through each question carefully and check the article for the answers.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions that in the pilot program, there were no seriously negative outcomes, but it doesn't specify a percentage for excessive bleeding. The answer is N/A because the exact percentage isn't given.

2. **Question 2**: The article says Washington is the first, but other states are expected to try similar programs. However, it doesn't mention how many have already implemented them. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The lawsuit against the New York provider is mentioned as being by the Texas attorney general. The anti-abortion organization associated with Dr. Skop is the Charlotte Lozier Institute. The question asks which organization initiated the lawsuit. Wait, the article says the Texas attorney general sued, not the organization. The Charlotte Lozier Institute is where Dr. Skop is from, but they didn't initiate the lawsuit. So the answer is N/A because the organization's name isn't mentioned as the one that initiated the lawsuit.

4. **Question 4**: The article states that Walgreens and CVS began dispensing mifepristone in some states, along with smaller pharmacies in at least a dozen states. The question asks besides Washington, how many other states? The article says "at least a dozen states," so the exact number isn't specified. N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The Comstock Act is mentioned as a law that could be used to restrict mailing of abortion pills. The question is about a federal law cited by Texas in a lawsuit. The Texas lawsuit was against sending pills to Texas, possibly under state laws, but the Comstock Act is federal. However, the question asks which law the Texas attorney general used. The article says Texas sued under their own law. The Comstock Act is mentioned as a concern by abortion-rights supporters regarding the Trump administration. The question asks the name of the federal law cited by Texas in their lawsuit. Since the article says Texas sued an abortion provider for sending pills to Texas, but the Comstock Act is a separate federal law that might be used by the administration, not necessarily by Texas in their suit. So the answer might be N/A because the Texas lawsuit isn't linked to the Comstock Act here. Wait, the question says "cited by the Texas attorney general in a lawsuit"â€”the article says the Texas AG sued an abortion provider in NY for sending pills to Texas. The article doesn't specify which law they used, so N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The cost mentioned is $40, which is noted as significantly less than other services. The Charlotte Lozier Institute's stance is against the practice, but the question asks for the cost related to their stance. The $40 is part of the pilot program, so the answer is $40.

7. **Question 7**: The professional title of the person from Family Policy Institute is an evangelical pastor and CEO. The question asks for their title. The article says Brian Noble is the CEO and an evangelical pastor. So the answer is chief executive (or CEO).

8. **Question 8**: The pilot program ran from Oct 31 to Nov 26. The end month is November, but the question asks for the previous year's month. Wait, the article says "On Tuesday, the Pharmacist Abortion Access Project reported that in a pilot program conducted between Oct 31 and Nov 26," so the previous year would be 2022? But the article doesn't mention the exact year. Since the question specifies "previous year," but the article doesn't give the current year, it's unclear. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The California-based pharmacy is Honeybee Health. The question links it to the lawsuit revived after the Supreme Court. The article mentions Honeybee Health in the pilot program. The lawsuit mentioned is the Texas one, but the pharmacy is Honeybee. The answer is Honeybee Health.

10. **Question 10**: The maximum weeks in the pilot was 10 weeks. The question asks under the Washington protocol, so 10 weeks.

11. **Question 11**: The protocol was approved by an obstetrician-gynecologist in Washington State. The answer is Washington.

12. **Question 12**: The article states patients could be up to 10 weeks pregnant. So 10 weeks.

13. **Question 13**: Pharmacists worked in chain pharmacies, community pharmacies, hospitals, or insurance companies. Any one is acceptable. Answer: chain and community pharmacies (but need to pick one). The article says "including chain and community pharmacies, hospitals and insurance companies." So "chain pharmacies" or "community pharmacies" are options. Let's pick "chain pharmacies".

14. **Question 14**: The cost was $40.

15. **Question 15**: Jessica Nouhavandi, the pharmacist and president of Honeybee Health, came up with the idea. The question is about who proposed deeper medical history inquiries. The article says Dr. Nouhavandi wanted to go deeper into medical history. So her name.

16. **Question 16**: Dr. Ingrid Skop from Charlotte Lozier Institute made that argument. The answer is Dr. Ingrid Skop.

17. **Question 17**: The FDA's regulations could be reinstated to restrict mifepristone. The question asks which federal agency's regulations. The answer is FDA.

18. **Question 18**: The two chains are Walgreens and CVS. Either is correct.

19. **Question 19**: The telehealth phase began on October 31.

20. **Question 20**: Honeybee Health is the pharmacy.
