Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. 

1. The first question asks about an architect whose work had a cantilevered design with exposed redwood beams admired from a dining view, and the owner liked the wood's texture. The article mentions Ray Kappe's Keeler House from 1991, which had exposed redwood beams and the owner, Anne Keeler, commented on the wood's beauty. So the answer should be Ray Kappe.

2. The historic ranch house frequented by Disney and Lindbergh is Will Rogers's ranch house. The text says Rogers hosted those people, so that's the answer.

3. The owner of the 1991 residence (Keeler House) listed for $8 million is Anne Keeler. The article states she was working with a real estate agent to sell it.

4. The preservation group mentioned is the Los Angeles Conservancy, led by Adrian Scott Fine. He's quoted talking about tracking cultural heritage losses.

5. The architect who founded SCI-Arc and had a residence in Rustic Canyon with concrete towers is Ray Kappe. The article mentions Kappe's own home in Rustic Canyon with those features.

6. The novelist with a 1907 Mediterranean estate linked to "Wildfire" is Zane Grey. His estate is mentioned, and he wrote "Wildfire" as per the text.

7. The residence in Rustic Canyon with cantilevered concrete towers is Ray Kappe's own home. The article notes it's in the evacuation zone.

8. The Queen Anne home with a Turkish room is the Andrew McNally House by Frederick Roehrig. The Bunny Museum had 45k bunny objects, so that's the neighboring institution.

9. The spokesperson from the Conservancy is Adrian Scott Fine, who talks about losing a key folk hero (Will Rogers) with the ranch house's destruction.

10. The architect of the Queen Anne home for Andrew McNally is Frederick Roehrig. The article states he designed the McNally House.

Wait, let me check each again to be sure:

1. Yes, Ray Kappe's Keeler House has those features. The owner is Anne Keeler. So first question's answer is Ray Kappe.

2. Will Rogers's ranch house.

3. Anne Keeler.

4. Los Angeles Conservancy.

5. Kappe again, since his own house is mentioned in Rustic Canyon.

6. Zane Grey.

7. Kappe's residence.

8. Andrew McNally's house by Frederick Roehrig. The other is Bunny Museum.

9. Adrian Scott Fine.

10. Frederick Roehrig.

All answers are directly from the text. I don't see any that require inference beyond what's stated. Let me confirm each question's specifics again to avoid mixing details. For example, question 5 asks for the architect whose residence in Rustic Canyon was razed. Wait, the article says Kappe's own residence there is in the evacuation zone but not yet confirmed as destroyed. Wait, the article says "whose work was lost" in question 1, but for question 5, the article says "has been destroyed" the Keeler House, but Kappe's own house in Rustic Canyon is mentioned as still potentially at risk. Wait, the question 5 says "whose celebrated residence in Rustic Canyon... is noted as having his work razed by the fire?" The article says "Kappe's own celebrated residence, on a slope in Rustic Canyon; its concrete towers..." but does it say it was destroyed? The article mentions the Keeler House was destroyed, but Kappe's own home is in the evacuation zone but not yet confirmed. Wait, the question is about "noted in the article as having his work razed by the fire?" So Kappe's own home might not be mentioned as destroyed yet. Wait the article says "the fires... have fallen victim... another major loss... Keeler House... Ray Kappe's..." but his own residence is in the evacuation zone, so maybe not yet destroyed. Wait the question 5 says "whose celebrated residence in Rustic Canyon... is noted as having his work razed by the fire?" But the article says "Kappe's own celebrated residence... is among others in the evacuation zone". So perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says "Kappe's own celebrated residence" but didn't confirm it was destroyed. Hmm. Wait the first part of the article lists the Keeler House as destroyed, but the residence in Rustic Canyon is part of what's still at risk. Therefore, question 5's answer might be N/A? Wait the question is "which architect... is noted in the article as having his work razed by the fire?" Kappe's own home isn't mentioned as destroyed yet. The article says "the fires, in their destructive rage, have highlighted... Kappe's own celebrated residence..." but that's still in danger. So the answer would be N/A. Wait, but the question might be about his work in general. Wait the first question's answer was Ray Kappe because his Keeler House was destroyed. But the residence in Rustic Canyon is his own home, which hasn't been confirmed destroyed. So question 5's answer would be N/A? Wait the question says "whose celebrated residence in Rustic Canyon... is noted as having his work razed by the fire?" Since the article doesn't state that his own house was destroyed, only that it's in the evacuation zone, the answer would be N/A. Wait, but maybe I misread. Let me check again. The article says "In the Palisades there's Kappe's own celebrated residence, on a slope in Rustic Canyon; its concrete towers support a series of floating platforms, merging with the outside via massive windows." The article mentions that his own residence is in the evacuation zone but does not say it was destroyed. Therefore, the answer to question 5 is N/A. Wait, but the question is about "noted in the article as having his work razed by the fire?" Since the article doesn't mention his own house being destroyed, then the answer is N/A. Wait but the first question's answer was Ray Kappe because his Keeler House was destroyed. The question 5 is about his own residence. So the answer would be N/A. But the original instructions say to answer based on the text. The article says "Kappe's own celebrated residence" is in the evacuation zone, but not that it was destroyed. Therefore, the answer to question 5 is N/A. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the question again: "Which architect, a founding member of SCI-Arc and whose celebrated residence in Rustic Canyon featured oversized balconies and concrete towers merging with panoramic windows, is noted in the article as having his work razed by the fire?" The description of the residence matches Kappe's, but the article says his own residence is in the evacuation zone but not yet destroyed. Therefore, the answer is N/A. But the question might be a trick. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Ray Kappe even if it's not confirmed, but the article doesn't state that his own home was destroyed. So I have to stick with N/A here. Wait, but the first part of the article mentions Kappe's Keeler House was destroyed, so maybe the question is referring to that residence? But the question specifies "residence in Rustic Canyon", which is his own home. So the answer must be N/A. Hmm, that complicates things. Let me check the other questions again to ensure I didn't miss anything else. 

Wait, the question 7 asks about the residence in Rustic Canyon highlighted as imperiled in the evacuation zone. The answer would be Kappe's residence there, but the question is about which residence is highlighted as imperiled, not destroyed. So for question 7, the answer is Kappe's residence. But question 5 is asking which architect's residence was razed (destroyed), so Kappe's own home wasn't mentioned as destroyed, so N/A. 

Therefore, I need to adjust my previous answers. Let me re-express the answers:

5. N/A because the article doesn't confirm his Rustic Canyon home was destroyed.

But maybe I missed a part. Let me check again. The article says "the fires... have fallen victim... another major loss in Pacific Palisades is Ray Kappe's Keeler House from 1991...". His own home in Rustic Canyon is mentioned in the evacuation zone but not as destroyed. So the answer to 5 is N/A. 

Proceeding with that correction:

1. Ray Kappe

2. Will Rogers's ranch house

3. Anne Keeler

4. Los Angeles Conservancy

5. N/A

6. Zane Grey

7. Kappe's residence (but the question says "celebrated residence in Rustic Canyon... noted as imperiled", so answer is Kappe's residence. The article mentions it's in the evacuation zone, so yes, the residence is highlighted as imperiled. The question asks for the residence's name? Wait, the question 7 asks "Which celebrated residence..." so the answer would be "Kappe's celebrated residence" but the article doesn't name it. Wait the article just refers to it as "Kappe's own celebrated residence". Since the question asks for the name, but the article doesn't provide a specific name, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait no, the question says "described as having cantilevered concrete towers..." which matches Kappe's. The question is asking for the name of the residence? The article doesn't give it, so maybe N/A? Hmm, this is tricky. The question is "Which celebrated residence in Rustic Canyon...", so perhaps the answer is "Kappe's residence" but the article doesn't name it. Since the question asks for the name, but the article only refers to it as Kappe's own home, the answer might be N/A. Alternatively, since the article says "Kappe's own celebrated residence", then the answer is "Kappe's celebrated residence" but the question might expect the architect's name? Wait no, the question asks for the residence's name. Since it's not named, the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "highlighted as imperiled in the evacuation zone". The article mentions it's in the zone, so maybe the answer is "Kappe's residence in Rustic Canyon" but that's not a proper name. Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the architect's name, but the question says "which celebrated residence". Since the article doesn't name it, the answer would be N/A. 

Wait, the question 7 says "Which celebrated residence in Rustic Canyon, described as having cantilevered concrete towers supporting floating platforms and similar in legacy to modernist icons, is highlighted as imperiled in the evacuation zone?" The article describes it as "Kappe's own celebrated residence... its concrete towers support a series of floating platforms..." and it's in the evacuation zone. Since the residence isn't named, the answer would be N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "Kappe's residence", but the question expects a specific name. Since it's not given, I'll have to put N/A. But perhaps the question allows the description as the answer? The instructions say to answer based on the article. Since the article refers to it as Kappe's own residence, maybe the answer is "Kappe's celebrated residence" but that's not a proper name. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick and the answer is "N/A" because there's no specific name given. 

This is getting confusing. Let me try to re-express all answers again with corrections:

1. Ray Kappe

2. Will Rogers’s ranch house

3. Anne Keeler

4. Los Angeles Conservancy

5. N/A

6. Zane Grey

7. N/A (since the residence isn't named)

8. Andrew McNally House (but the question asks for the Queen Anne home's architect, which is Frederick Roehrig. The question asks "Which Queen Anne style home...", but the answer should be the home's name, but the question's second part refers to the mapmaking magnate (Andrew McNally). So the answer to the first part is the Andrew McNally House. But the question says "distinguished from a neighboring institution that uniquely housed over 45,000 commemorative objects?" which is the Bunny Museum. So the Queen Anne home is the McNally House. The question asks for the home's name? The question starts with "Which Queen Anne style home..." so the answer is "Andrew McNally House".

9. Adrian Scott Fine

10. Frederick Roehrig

Wait, question 8: "Which Queen Anne style home, featuring a lavish Turkish room and associated with a prominent mapmaking tycoon, is distinguished from a neighboring institution that uniquely housed over 45,000 commemorative objects?" The answer is the Andrew McNally House (Queen Anne style) because it's linked to the mapmaker (McNally) and the neighboring Bunny Museum has the bunny objects. So the answer is Andrew McNally House.

So question 8's answer is Andrew McNally House.

Question 7: The residence in Rustic Canyon is described but not named, so the answer would be N/A? Or since the question says "celebrated residence in Rustic Canyon...", the answer is "Kappe's residence" but since the article doesn't name it, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is looking for the architect's name, but the question asks for the residence's name. Hmm.

Wait the question 7 is asking for the name of the residence. Since the article doesn't name it beyond "Kappe's own celebrated residence", perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the description is sufficient. The instructions say to answer based on the article. The article says "Kappe's own celebrated residence...", so perhaps the answer is "Kappe's celebrated residence". But the question uses the word "which" implying a proper name. Since none is given, I think N/A is correct here.
