Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let's start with the first question.

1. The first question asks which medical condition the therapist diagnosed in Mr. Bennet-Martin that led to his improved intimate relationship. Scanning through the article, I see that when Tawny Lara got sober, she was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. However, the question is about Mr. Bennet-Martin. Looking back, the article mentions his husband, but there's no mention of a medical condition diagnosed in him. The therapist mentioned is Laura Rademacher, but she's the one offering the class. The answer here might be N/A because the text doesn't state a diagnosis for him.

2. The second question is about how many months after starting her podcast Tawny Lara published her book. The article says she stopped drinking in 2015 and wrote "Dry Humping," but there's no mention of a podcast she started. Wait, actually, Mr. Bennet-Martin started a podcast, not Tawny Lara. The article says, "He wrote out what his dream sex life... and started a podcast." So the question is incorrect in attributing the podcast to Lara. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

3. The third question asks for a percentage improvement from Laura Rademacher's class. The article mentions her class but doesn't provide any specific percentages. So N/A.

4. The fourth question is about a hormone affected by alcohol according to Casey Tanner. The article discusses alcohol's effects on arousal and orgasm but doesn't mention specific hormones. So N/A.

5. The fifth question asks for the name of the 12-step program's workshop that helped Mr. Bennet-Martin. The article says he attended 12-step meetings but doesn't name a specific workshop. N/A.

6. The sixth question is about the number of couples in Laura's study. The article doesn't mention any specific study by her with numbers. N/A.

7. The seventh question refers to a neurological mechanism identified by Jeanette Hu's clinic. The article mentions she's a therapist and sobriety coach but doesn't specify any neurological findings. N/A.

8. The eighth question asks the year Mr. Bennet-Martin's husband suggested trying sobriety in their marriage. The article states that his first sober experience was after he started recovery in 2021, but there's no mention of the husband suggesting it in a specific year. N/A.

9. The ninth question is about average duration of sexual encounters before and after. The article doesn't provide numerical data on duration. N/A.

10. The tenth question asks about the psychological tool used by the NYC practice. The article mentions Casey Tanner as a therapist there but doesn't name any assessment tool. N/A.

11. The eleventh question asks for the month and year of his first awkward experience. The article says he started sobbing in 2021 and had been with his husband for eight years when he first tried sober sex. But the exact month isn't given. N/A.

12. The twelfth question counts individual therapists mentioned. The therapists named are Laura Rademacher, Casey Tanner, and Jeanette Hu. That's three. The answer is 3.

13. The thirteenth question asks the outcome of large alcohol consumption during sex. The article states that large amounts can make it harder to feel aroused or orgasm. So the answer is decreased arousal or difficulty experiencing orgasm.

14. The fourteenth question is who authored "Dry Humping". The article clearly states Tawny Lara wrote it. Answer is Tawny Lara.

15. The fifteenth question asks how many months she refrained from sex after stopping alcohol. The text says she didn't have sex for about six months. Answer is 6.

16. The sixteenth question: who compared sober sex to virginity? The article says Mr. Bennet-Martin felt "like a virgin again". So the answer is Steve Bennet-Martin.

17. The seventeenth question: what method did he use to envision his improved relationship? He wrote out his dream sex life. Answer: wrote out his dream sex life.

18. The eighteenth question: which city is linked to Laura Rademacher? The article says she's in Minneapolis. Answer: Minneapolis.

19. The nineteenth question: the benefit of his recovery. The article says better sex, intimacy, connection. Answer: better sex, intimacy, and connection.

20. The twentieth question: his age when the experience happened. He is 38 now, and he started recovery in 2021. If the article was written recently (assuming 2023?), but the exact age at that time isn't given. Wait, the article says he is 38 and had been with his husband for eight years when he first tried sober sex. But his age at that time would be 38 minus the time since then. Wait, the article says "Mr. Bennet-Martin, 38, said. 'But there was always a little bit of something to help ease the insecurities...'" So currently he is 38, and the first time was after starting sobriety in 2021. The article doesn't state when he turned 38, so his age during that experience isn't directly given. Wait, maybe the first time was when he was in his early recovery in 2021, but his current age is 38. Unless the article specifies when he turned 38. The text doesn't say, so N/A? Wait, the first time was when he was already 38? The article says "Mr. Bennet-Martin, 38, said" when discussing that experience. So his age is 38. Answer is 38.
