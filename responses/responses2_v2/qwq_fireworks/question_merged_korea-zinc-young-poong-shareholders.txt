Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and answer each question exactly as asked. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about the percentage of Young Poong that Sun Metals initially proposed to acquire before settling on the final amount that caused the circular ownership. The article mentions that Sun Metals bought a 10% stake. It doesn't say anything about an initial proposal different from 10%, so maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the text says "bought a 10 percent stake in Young Poong from the Choi family and another subsidiary." There's no mention of an initial proposal. So answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Asks about the specific smelting technology Young Poong uses. The article states that Young Poong runs its own zinc smelting business but doesn't mention the technology type. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The Choi family's rationale for selling shares suggested an alternative structure besides chaebol. The article says their statement claimed the sale was "the best course of action for the South Korean economy" and "long-term interests." They might be implying that non-chaebol structures (like Western governance) are less beneficial. Wait, the dispute is about Western-style governance vs chaebols. The article says the feud is a test of chaebols against Western corporate governance. So maybe the answer is "Western-style corporate governance" but the question asks for an alternative structure that would be less beneficial. The Choi family is defending chaebols, so they might suggest that Western-style is less beneficial. So the answer might be "Western-style corporate governance." Let me check the text again: "the feud has become a test of the resilience of South Korea's powerful family-run conglomerates known as chaebols in the face of Western-style corporate governance." So the Choi family's argument is that their structure is better. The question asks what structure they implied would be less beneficial. So the alternative is Western-style. So answer is "Western-style corporate governance".

4. **Question 4**: Legal precedent similar to South Korean antitrust law mentioned by Professor Mike Cho, focusing on international implications. The professor says that the law applies only to domestic companies. The issue is whether Sun Metals (Australian subsidiary) is domestic or foreign. The question is about a similar legal precedent. The article doesn't mention any specific precedent, so N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The clause determining Sun Metals' status as domestic or foreign under antitrust law. Professor Cho says the case hinges on whether Sun Metals is considered a South Korean company because the law applies only to domestic companies. So the clause would be about the definition of a domestic company. The exact clause isn't named, so maybe the answer is "the definition of a domestic company under South Korean antitrust law" but the question asks for the specific clause. Since the text doesn't name it, N/A? Wait, the question says "specific clause in the South Korean antitrust law, as interpreted by Professor Mike Cho". Since he mentions that the law applies only to domestic companies, the clause is probably the one defining domestic vs foreign entities. But since the article doesn't name the clause, the answer is N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Choi family's believed percentage before the circular ownership. The article states that the consortium (Young Poong and MBK) had 47% vs Choi's 40%. So before the invalidation, Choi had 40%? The question is about what they believed they controlled before the circular issue. The answer is 40%.

7. **Question 7**: South Korean court's action after Korea Zinc's Sun Metals transaction. The article says that on Tuesday, the court blocked a proposal to change vote tallying. Then Korea Zinc announced the Sun Metals deal on Wednesday. The question asks what the court did after the announcement. The court's prior action was on Tuesday, before the transaction. After the transaction, the court didn't act again mentioned, so the answer is N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Australian subsidiary involved in the share transaction. The article says Sun Metals Corp., an Australian subsidiary, bought the shares. So answer is Sun Metals Corp.

9. **Question 9**: Which family's share sale created the circular ownership. The sale was from the Choi family to Sun Metals. So Choi family's sale.

10. **Question 10**: Percentage stake pivotal in forming the circular ownership. The text says Sun Metals bought 10% of Young Poong. So 10%.

11. **Question 11**: Capped board membership number. The article states shareholders approved capping the board at 19 members. So 19.

12. **Question 12**: Judicial body that blocked the vote tally change. The court mentioned was a South Korean court. The article says "a South Korean court sided with Young Poong and MBK by blocking..." So answer is South Korean court.

13. **Question 13**: Action by Korea Zinc that led to protests. The article mentions the labor union protested against Young Poong and MBK gaining control. The action that benefited the Choi family was the invalidation of Young Poong's votes. So the action was invalidating the votes, leading to protests. The question asks what action by management led to protests. The answer would be the "invalidation of votes" but the question might need a specific action. The article says the union protested if Young Poong and MBK gained control. The management's maneuver to block that led to the protest. The key action was the stock maneuver (the Sun Metals deal). So the answer is "invalidating votes" or "the stock maneuver". The article says "Korea Zinc erected a last-minute roadblock. It announced that Sun Metals Corp... bought a 10% stake..." leading to invalidation. The action that led to protests was the invalidation. The question says "action by Korea Zinc management... led to protests from the labor union". The answer is the invalidation of votes. But the exact action? The question might need the specific action: the share transaction creating circular ownership. The text says "the start of the meeting was delayed... because of delays in verifying voters, Korea Zinc said. When the session finally started, Korea Zinc confirmed that Young Poong's votes would be voided." So the action that led to the protest was the invalidation. But the protest was before the meeting started, as mentioned: "protest from Korea Zinc's labor union threatening to strike if Young Poong and MBK gained management control." The protest was a threat, not caused by the invalidation. The invalidation happened during the meeting. The union's protest was about the potential change in management. The action by management that led to their protest (the strike threat) was the ongoing feud? Maybe the question is about the action that led to the protest during the meeting. The article says when shareholders gathered, they were confronted by a protest. The union's protest was a threat, but the actual action that caused it was the ongoing dispute. The question is tricky. Alternatively, the invalidation of votes by management caused the union to protest. Wait the article says "the start of the meeting was delayed five hours because of delays in verifying voters, Korea Zinc said. When the session finally started, Korea Zinc confirmed that Young Poong's votes would be voided." The union's protest was separate. The union's protest was "threatening to strike if Young Poong and MBK gained management control." So the protest was a threat, not caused by the invalidation. The question is which action by management led to the protest. Maybe the management's actions (invalidating votes) led the union to escalate, but the text says the protest happened when they gathered, before the vote was confirmed. The union's protest was a separate event. Since the question asks for the action that "led to protests", perhaps the answer is the invalidation. But the text doesn't explicitly link the protest to the invalidation. The protest was a prior threat. Since the question is unclear, maybe N/A. Alternatively, the answer is the stock maneuver (the Sun Metals transaction). The article says the union's protest was "confronted by a protest from Korea Zinc's labor union threatening to strike if Young Poong and MBK gained management control." So the union's action was a threat against the consortium's control. The management's action (invalidation) prevented that, so the protest was a reaction to the potential change. The question's answer might be "invalidating Young Poong's votes". But the exact wording in the article says the union's protest was a threat if the consortium won. The management's action (invalidation) led to the consortium losing, so the protest's threat was averted, but the protest itself was there. The answer might be the invalidation. The article says the union's protest happened when shareholders gathered, before the invalidation was confirmed. So maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm. Alternatively, the action that led to the protests (the union's presence) was the ongoing dispute. The question might be tricky. Let me check the text again. The union's protest was a threat if the consortium took control. The management's actions (invalidation) prevented that, so the protest was a response to the potential outcome, not the invalidation itself. So maybe the answer is N/A. But maybe the question expects "invalidating votes" as the action. I'll go with "invalidating Young Poong's votes" but need to check the exact wording. The question says "action by Korea Zinc management... led to protests". The protest was the union's threat, so perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, the answer is the creation of the circular ownership structure. The article says "the union threatening to strike if Young Poong and MBK gained management control." The management's actions (the circular ownership) prevented that, so the union's protest was a reaction to the ongoing situation, not directly caused by the invalidation. Since the article doesn't link the protest directly to a specific action by management beyond the overall dispute, perhaps the answer is N/A. Hmm, this is a tough one. Maybe the answer is N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Private equity firm collaborating with Young Poong and vowed to challenge in court. The article mentions MBK Partners. Yes, they did vow to challenge in court. So answer is MBK Partners.

15. **Question 15**: Sector Korea Zinc helps secure with metals independent from China. The article says "critical to global supply chains without ties to China." The metals are for supply chains. The sector would be "metals supply chain" or "global supply chains". The exact wording says "metals critical to global supply chains without ties to China". So the sector is "global supply chains".

16. **Question 16**: The single word a representative used to describe feelings. The article says a Young Poong representative felt "robbed" according to local media. So the word is "robbed".

17. **Question 17**: The month the challenge began. The article states "the dispute officially started in September". So answer is September.

Now, let me go through each answer again to ensure they're correct based on the article:

1. N/A (no initial proposal mentioned)
2. N/A (no tech type mentioned)
3. Western-style corporate governance (from the article's context of chaebol vs Western governance)
4. N/A (no precedent mentioned)
5. N/A (no specific clause named, only the criterion)
6. 40% (Choi's initial control before invalidation)
7. N/A (court action was before the transaction)
8. Sun Metals Corp.
9. Choi family
10. 10%
11. 19
12. South Korean court
13. N/A (protest was a threat, not caused by management's action directly mentioned)
14. MBK Partners
15. global supply chains
16. robbed
17. September

Wait, for question 13: The action that led to the protest. The union's protest was a threat if the consortium took over. The management's action (invalidating votes) prevented that, so the protest was a reaction to the potential change. The article says when shareholders gathered, they were confronted by the protest. The management's invalidation was after that. So the protest was there regardless. The question is asking which action by management caused the protest. Since the protest was a prior threat, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, the answer is "invalidating votes" but the protest was before that. So I think N/A is correct.
