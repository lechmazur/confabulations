Okay, I need to go through each question and answer them based solely on the provided article. Let me start with the first question.

1. Which cryptocurrency investment firm did Scott Bessent found that managed George Soros's Bitcoin portfolio?

Looking through the article, it mentions that Bessent founded Key Square Capital Management. However, the article says he managed the Soros Fund Management earlier. The specific mention of a cryptocurrency firm isn't there. The article states he's involved with Bitcoin through his investments but doesn't name a firm he founded for Soros's Bitcoin portfolio. So maybe N/A?

Wait, the article says he was top investor for Soros, but the question is about a firm he founded that managed Soros's Bitcoin. The article doesn't say Key Square managed Soros's Bitcoin, just that Bessent has a Bitcoin ETF. So answer N/A.

2. How much did Bessent's bet against the British pound in the 1990s earn for his personal investment fund?

The article states he bet against the British pound and earned his firm, Soros Fund Management, $1 billion. The question asks for his personal fund. Since he was part of Soros's fund, maybe the $1B is for the firm, not his personal. So the answer is $1 billion, but the question says "his personal investment fund" which might not be the case. Wait, the article says "his firm, Soros Fund Management, $1 billion." So the answer is $1 billion, but since it's the firm's, not his personal, maybe N/A? Hmm. The question is about his personal fund, but the article says the firm earned that. So N/A?

Wait, the question says "his personal investment fund" but the article says Soros Fund Management (which he was part of) earned $1B. So unless the question is implying that the fund was his personal, which it's not. So answer is N/A.

3. What was the sale price of Bessent's North Dakota farmland when he liquidated it to comply with ethics requirements?

The article mentions he owns up to $25M of farmland in ND but doesn't say he sold it. The sale price isn't mentioned. The only sale mentioned is his Charleston mansion. So N/A.

4. Which member of Trump's economic team previously served as CEO of both Cantor Fitzgerald and Goldman Sachs?

Looking at the article, Howard Lutnick is commerce secretary and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald. The article says he's CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald. The article doesn't mention Goldman Sachs. The only mention of Goldman is his margin loan with them. So N/A. Wait, the question is about serving as CEO of both. Since the article only mentions Cantor Fitzgerald for Lutnick, so N/A.

Wait the article says "Howard Lutnick, a billionaire banker whom he tapped to be commerce secretary" and Lutnick is CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald. No mention of Goldman Sachs. So N/A.

5. What percentage return did Key Square Capital achieve on the $2 billion investment from George Soros?

The article says Key Square got $4.5B including $2B from Soros, but now manages much less. It doesn't mention the return percentage. So N/A.

6. When did Bessent establish the Bessent-Freeman Family Foundation's scholarship program for Treasury Department employees?

The article mentions he will resign from the Bessent-Freeman Family Foundation but doesn't mention when the scholarship program was established. N/A.

7. How much did Bessent earn from his short position on the renminbi during his time at Soros Fund Management?

The article mentions he bet against the renminbi but doesn't specify the amount earned. N/A.

8. What was the total value of Bitcoin holdings that Bessent was required to divest before his confirmation hearing?

The article says he's selling a Bitcoin ETF but doesn't give the total value. The financial disclosure shows assets over $700M but specifics on Bitcoin holdings' value aren't stated. So N/A.

9. Which university appointed Bessent as chairman of their economics department before he joined the Trump administration?

The article says he was chairman of the investment committee at Rockefeller University. Not economics department. So N/A.

10. What was the monthly rental income generated by Bessent's Bahamas property investment?

The article states the Bahamas property is worth up to $25M but no info on rental income. N/A.

11. Which Trump administration official previously sold their stake in a Hollywood film production company to their spouse, leading to ethics concerns during trade negotiations with China in 2018?

The article mentions Steven Mnuchin, Trump's first-term Treasury secretary, sold his interest to his wife, leading to ethics issues during a 2018 trade deal. So answer is Steven Mnuchin.

12. Which Trump cabinet nominee founded Key Square Capital Management in 2016 with $4.5 billion in initial investments, including $2 billion from George Soros, but now manages significantly less?

The article says Bessent founded Key Square in 2016 with $4.5B, including $2B from Soros, now manages much less. So answer is Scott Bessent.
