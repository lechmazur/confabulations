Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which fashion magazine conducted the career-retrospective interview. The article mentions that Balenciaga is sitting for a career-retrospective interview, but it doesn't specify the name of the magazine. The framing device is part of the show's structure, but the text doesn't mention any particular magazine. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many languages did Balenciaga speak fluently? The article says the show is in Spanish, French, and Basque with subtitles, but that's about the series' language options, not Balenciaga's fluency. No info on his language skills is given, so N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The year he introduced the "million-yard stare." The article states that the stare started as part of his rivalry with Dior, but no specific year is mentioned. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The actress who portrayed his business partner. The text mentions a business partner and friend suggested he improve communication skills, but no name or actress is given. Answer N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Total number of haute couture collections. The article doesn't provide a specific number, just mentions his 30-year career. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Hollywood actress who wore his designs. The text doesn't mention any specific actress or pivotal scene. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Innovative fabric technique. The article doesn't name any specific fabric technique he developed. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Number of employees in his original atelier. No numbers are given about employees. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Price of his first perfume. The series isn't mentioned discussing his perfume's price. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Architectural feature from his childhood home. The article doesn't describe his childhood home's features influencing designs. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Designer's rivalry leading to orchestral performances. The rivalry with Dior is mentioned regarding the stare, but not orchestral shows. N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Material innovation causing conflict with Chanel. The article doesn't mention Chanel or a specific 1958 conflict. N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Years before the private show inspiring Dior. The article says Dior adopted minimalist silhouettes from Balenciaga, but no time frame is given. N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Historical event interrupting collaboration. The third episode's subplot isn't detailed in the text. N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Health condition from work habits. The text mentions his obsessive work habits but doesn't specify a condition. N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Journalist from apprenticeship. The framing device mentions a journalist critic, but no name or connection to his past is given. N/A.

17. **Question 17:** Architectural feature linked to his romance. The series associates the flagship store's feature with his relationship, but specifics aren't provided. N/A.

18. **Question 18:** Reconciling reluctance to synthetics with nylon use. The article notes he was reluctant but pioneered nylon blends. The answer might be that he used them in military designs despite reluctance, but the text doesn't explicitly reconcile this. So N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Political scandal backdrop for 1961 cancellation. No mention of a scandal related to that decision. N/A.

20. **Question 20:** Basque garment inspiring shoulders. The article mentions Basque language and his origin, but no specific garment is named. N/A.

All answers are N/A except maybe some? Wait, let me check again.

Looking back at the article: 

The article mentions "million-yard stare, stern expression and lack of eye contact with the audience started, according to 'Balenciaga,' as part of his rivalry with Christian Dior." So question 11 asks which designer's rivalry led him to use orchestral performances. The article doesn't mention orchestral performances, so still N/A. 

The only possible non-N/A might be question 11? Wait, no, the question is about orchestral performances as a response to rivalry. The article only mentions the stare. So no. 

Another check: The article says "the show occasionally drifts toward cliche, especially because of its trite framing device: Balenciaga is finally sitting for a career-retrospective interview, and we bounce between that and his wistful recollections." So the interview is part of the show's framing, but the magazine isn't named. So Q1 is N/A.

No other answers are present. All must be N/A except maybe... Hmm. Let me check each question again.

Wait, question 20: "Which real-world political scandal..." The article doesn't mention any political scandal related to his 1961 cancellation. 

So all answers are N/A except perhaps none. Therefore, all answers are N/A. But let me confirm once more. 

The article does say "the show follows Balenciaga's life and career over 30 years in Paris, an origin story not only of a famed fashion designer but also, according to the show, of modern fashion itself." But no numbers or specifics for the questions. 

So all answers are N/A.
