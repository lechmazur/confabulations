Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article and follow the strict instructions. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The percentage of mail-in and early voting data incorporated into the initial release. The article mentions that some states don't include early or mail-in ballots, so the data is incomplete. But it doesn't give a specific percentage. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Which state provided the most comprehensive and easily formatted files. The article says some states had nicely formatted tables, but doesn't name any specific state. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Hours spent parsing PDFs. The text says some data was in PDFs and had to be parsed, but no time mentioned. N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The formula for red-blue intensity. The article mentions they used a choropleth where intensity corresponds to margin, but doesn't specify the formula. N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Lead data scientist for matching boundaries. The team is listed, but no one is mentioned as the lead for that specific task. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Trump's support shift in suburbs vs urban areas. The article says he made gains but doesn't give percentages by area types. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Third-party group that contributed data. The article mentions some individuals had collected data, but no specific group named. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Staff in manual verification. The article mentions a large team, but no number given. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Average time delay between data receipt and publication. No timeframe mentioned here. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Demographic group with most significant change. The article doesn't specify any demographic, just mentions geographic patterns. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Number of team members who worked on 2016. The article lists the team but doesn't mention past projects. N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Percentage excluded due to PDF parsing. The article says some data couldn't be matched but no percentage. N/A.

13. **Question 13**: Rejected visualization method. The article says they chose choropleth but doesn't mention other methods considered. N/A.

14. **Question 14**: 2020 technique for Trump's gains. The article states they used choropleth in 2020 too, but no other method mentioned. N/A.

15. **Question 15**: Analysis to compensate for incomplete data. The article says the data is incomplete but doesn't suggest specific analyses. N/A.

16. **Question 16**: Primary reason for excluding incomplete states. The article states they consider such data incomplete and don't include them. The reason is exclusion due to missing early/mail-in votes. So answer: "incomplete data" or similar. The exact quote says "since a majority... we consider the data... incomplete, and do not include them". So the primary reason is the exclusion of early/absentee votes. Answer: "exclusion of early or mail-in absentee ballots".

Wait, the question asks for the reason Wilson Andrews cited. The article says "many places do not include early or mail-in absentee ballots... we consider the data... incomplete, and do not include them". So the primary reason is the exclusion of those ballots. So the answer would be "exclusion of early or mail-in absentee ballots".

17. **Question 17**: Average time in months per state. The article mentions months spent collecting data but not per state. N/A.

18. **Question 18**: Software for parsing PDFs. The article mentions parsing but doesn't name any tool. N/A.
