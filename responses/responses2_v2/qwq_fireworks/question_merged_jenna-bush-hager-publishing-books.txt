Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by reading through each question and then check the article for the answer.

1. **Question 1:** Which literary agent initially approached Jenna Bush Hager about starting her own publishing imprint after seeing the success of her book club selections?

Looking at the article, there's a quote from Christy Fletcher, a literary agent who had early conversations with Hager about her imprint. The exact sentence says: "the literary agent Christy Fletcher, a co-head of the publishing division for United Talent Agency, who had early conversations with Hager about her vision for the imprint." So the answer should be Christy Fletcher.

2. **Question 2:** How many of Jenna Bush Hager's book club selections were optioned for television series by streaming platforms in 2023?

The article mentions that 34 of her selections have been optioned for the screen, with nine by her own production company. But the question is specifically about 2023. The article doesn't mention a specific number for 2023, only that as of 2024, 34 total have been optioned. Since it's not specified for 2023 alone, this is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** What percentage of Hager's book club picks were written by debut authors during her first year of recommendations?

The article lists some debut novels like "The School for Good Mothers" and "The Cloisters," but there's no percentage given for the first year. The total number of selections (74) and bestsellers are mentioned, but not the percentage of debut authors. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Which major publishing house competed with Penguin Random House for the rights to launch Hager's Thousand Voices imprint?

The article says she's starting the imprint with Penguin Random House, but there's no mention of another publisher competing. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** What was the average increase in sales for books selected by Hager's book club compared to their pre-selection numbers?

The article states that in 2024, her picks outperformed the adult fiction market by over 30%, but that's compared to the market, not pre-selection sales. The exact average increase isn't provided, so N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Who will serve as the editorial director for Thousand Voices x RHPG, overseeing day-to-day operations?

The article doesn't mention an editorial director other than Hager herself. It says she's involved in acquisitions and marketing but doesn't name another person in that role. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** What criteria did Hager establish for manuscripts to be considered for publication through her new imprint?

The article quotes her saying she looks for books that are "propulsive and fun... conversation starters." So the criteria are books that are engaging and start conversations.

8. **Question 8:** Which bestselling author endorsed Hager's new publishing venture in the announcement press release?

The article mentions Christy Fletcher's praise but doesn't name a bestselling author endorsing it. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** How many publishing industry veterans will join Hager's team to evaluate manuscript submissions?

No specific number is given about her team's size. The article says she's involved in acquisitions but doesn't mention the number of veterans. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** What marketing budget has Random House allocated annually for books published under Hager's imprint?

The article doesn't mention any specific budget figures. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** How many New York Times bestsellers has Jenna Bush Hager published through her Thousand Voices imprint since its launch?

The imprint is new, and the first book is coming out in October. The article says 47 of her book club picks became NYT bestsellers, but those are from her club, not her imprint. Since the imprint hasn't published any yet, the answer is 0 or N/A? Wait, the first book is coming out in October, so maybe it's not launched yet. The article says "she has already acquired six books" but the imprint hasn't released any yet. So N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Which celebrity book club host collaborated with Jenna Bush Hager to co-found the Thousand Voices x RHPG imprint?

The article says it's her own venture with Penguin Random House. No other celebrity co-founder is mentioned. N/A.

13. **Question 13:** What was the title of the debut novel by Sandra Cisneros that Jenna Bush Hager selected for her book club in 2019?

The article mentions Sandra Cisneros's 1984 novel "The House on Mango Street" as one of her selections. That's her debut? The article says it's from 1984, so if that's her first, then the answer is "The House on Mango Street."

14. **Question 14:** How many books has Jenna Bush Hager's production company, Thousand Voices, directly adapted into screenplays as of 2024?

The article states nine of the 34 optioned books were by her production company. So the answer is 9.

15. **Question 15:** Which imprint under Penguin Random House originally published Jenna Bush Hager's first book club pick, "The Last Romantics," before it became a bestseller?

The article says her first pick was "The Last Romantics" by Tara Conklin but doesn't mention the imprint. N/A.

16. **Question 16:** What genre does Jenna Bush Hager's imprint exclusively focus on, according to her stated editorial preferences in the article?

She mentions genres including memoir, literary fiction, romance, and historical fiction. The article says she's looking across genres, so "exclusively" isn't the case. The question might be a trick. Since it's not exclusive, the answer is N/A, but maybe the question is wrong. Wait, the question asks what genre it "exclusively" focuses on, but the article says "across a range of genres." So N/A.

17. **Question 17:** How many years did Jenna Bush Hager spend working as a literary agent prior to launching her book club on the "Today" show?

20. **Question 20:** Which of Jenna Bush Hager's upcoming imprint titles is described as a historical fiction novel set during the Korean War?

The article lists three upcoming books: "Conform" (dystopian romance), "Abby Offsides" (romance), and "Into the Blue" (lovers with a tragic secret). None mention the Korean War. So N/A.
