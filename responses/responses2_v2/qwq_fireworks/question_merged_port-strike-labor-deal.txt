Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each question exactly as asked. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks about the percentage of U.S. container traffic processed through ports where the ratified contract mandates job creation proportional to automation. The article mentions that the agreement covers East and Gulf Coasts, which handle three-fifths of U.S. container traffic. The contract includes a framework for jobs when automation is added, so the answer should be 60% (three-fifths is 60%). 

2. **Question 2:** This is about how many longshoremen in the Port of New York and New Jersey earned between $100k and $200k in the fiscal year ending June 2021. The article states that nearly 60% of longshoremen made that range through June 2020, which is the latest data. The question asks for 2021 data, but the article's data is up to June 2020. So that's a problem. The answer should be N/A because the data is from 2020, not 2021.

3. **Question 3:** The maritime alliance's original wage increase proposal before Biden's intervention. The article says the maritime alliance agreed to a 60% raise over six years if other parts were resolved. But does it mention the original proposal's duration? The text doesn't specify how many years they initially proposed. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The labor disruption in 2020 that the union used to push their stance against automation. The article mentions a short strike in October. That's the basis for their stance. So the answer is the October strike.

5. **Question 5:** The framework established by the agreement. The joint statement says it "protects current jobs and establishes a framework... for implementing technologies that create more jobs while modernizing." So the answer is the framework that protects jobs and allows tech adoption.

6. **Question 6:** The new hourly wage. The article states wages would increase to $63 an hour from $39. So the answer is $63.

7. **Question 7:** The public figure who criticized automation. The article mentions Donald J. Trump on his Truth Social post. So Trump.

8. **Question 8:** The guarantee regarding employment when automation is introduced. The person briefed said the union got guarantees that jobs would be added when automated equipment is added. So the answer is job addition guarantees.

9. **Question 9:** The combined label for ports handling three-fifths of traffic. The article refers to "East and Gulf Coasts ports" as the combined label. So "East and Gulf Coasts".

10. **Question 10:** Preemptive measures by companies. The text says some accelerated imports to arrive before the deadline and diverted shipments. The answer is accelerating imports and diverting shipments.

11. **Question 11:** Maximum annual income via overtime. The article says pay could rise to "well over $200,000 a year". The exact figure isn't given, but the text says "well over $200,000". The question asks for the maximum figure referenced, so the answer is over $200,000. But since it's "well over", maybe they want the exact number? Wait, the article says "well over $200,000", so the answer is over $200,000, but the question asks for the maximum figure mentioned. Since the article says "well over $200,000", maybe they just want $200,000 as the threshold. Hmm, tricky. The exact wording is "could rise to well over $200,000 a year". So the answer is $200,000+ but the article doesn't specify an exact maximum. But the question is asking for the maximum annual income figure referenced. Since the article says "well over $200,000", perhaps the answer is $200,000 as the starting point? Or maybe the answer is N/A because there's no exact number. Wait, the question says "maximum annual income figure referenced". The article says "could rise to well over $200,000 a year", so the figure mentioned is $200,000, but it's exceeded. Since the question is asking for the maximum figure referenced, maybe the answer is N/A because it's not an exact number. Or maybe the answer is $200,000 since that's the threshold. Hmm. The article says "well over $200,000", so the figure given as the maximum is not exact. Since the question is about the figure mentioned, perhaps the answer is $200,000. Let me check the exact quote: "the pay of many longshoremen at some East Coast ports could rise to well over $200,000 a year." So the figure referenced is $200,000 as the starting point for the over. The answer is $200,000. Wait, but the question is the maximum. The answer would be over that, but since it's not exact, maybe the answer is "well over $200,000" but the question wants a numerical value. Since they can't write "well over", maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "maximum annual income figure referenced". The article mentions "well over $200,000" but doesn't give a specific maximum number. So maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, the answer is $200,000 because that's the figure mentioned as the threshold. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous, but since the question asks for the figure referenced, even if it's a minimum for the over, maybe the answer is $200,000.

12. **Question 12:** The detrimental impact the union is concerned about. The union argues automation reduces jobs, so the answer is job reduction.

13. **Question 13:** The behavior of other unions rejecting agreements. The article states that other unions have rejected accords agreed by their leaders. So the answer is that members rejected accords approved by their leaders.

Let me check each again quickly.

1. 60% â€“ correct.

2. Data is up to June 2020, so 2021 is N/A.

3. Original proposal's duration? The article says the maritime alliance agreed to 60% over 6 years if other parts resolved. It doesn't say what they originally proposed. So N/A.

4. October strike.

5. The framework is protecting jobs and allowing tech adoption. The exact wording from the statement: "protects current I.L.A. jobs and establishes a framework for implementing technologies that will create more jobs while modernizing". So the answer is the framework that protects current jobs and creates more jobs via tech.

6. $63.

7. Trump.

8. The guarantee is adding jobs when automation is introduced. The article says "the International Longshoremen's Association had guarantees that jobs would be added when automated equipment was added at a port."

9. East and Gulf Coasts.

10. Accelerated imports and diverted shipments.

11. The article says "well over $200,000". The question asks for the maximum figure referenced. Since the exact number isn't given beyond that threshold, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the question is "maximum annual income figure referenced". The article references $200,000 as the threshold that they exceed, so the figure mentioned is $200,000. But since it's "well over", the actual maximum isn't stated. So the answer is N/A? Or maybe the answer is $200,000 because that's the number given. Let me see the exact sentence: "the pay of many longshoremen at some East Coast ports could rise to well over $200,000 a year." The figure referenced here is $200,000 as the lower end of the over. Since the question is about the maximum figure mentioned, perhaps the answer is N/A, but the article mentions $200,000 as the point they go over. Since the question is about the figure referenced, maybe it's $200,000. Hmm. I think the answer is $200,000 because that's the number given in the text. Even if it's exceeded, that's the figure mentioned.

12. Job reduction.

13. Members of other unions have rejected accords agreed to by their leaders. So the answer is that other unions' members have rejected agreements approved by their leaders.

Alright, I think that's all. Let me format the answers accordingly.
