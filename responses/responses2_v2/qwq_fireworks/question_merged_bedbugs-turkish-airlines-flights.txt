Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Which airline maintenance base did Turkish Airlines ultimately send the bedbug-infested aircraft to for treatment after the October incidents?**  
   The article mentions that planes need to go to a maintenance base but doesn't specify which one. So N/A.

2. **How many total bedbug incidents were reported to Turkish Airlines' customer service department during Fashion Week in Paris?**  
   The article says Paris had an outbreak during Fashion Week, but it's not clear how many were reported to the airline. N/A.

3. **What was the name of the Facebook travel group where Ms. Titcombe discovered other passengers had similar experiences?**  
   The text mentions a Facebook travel group but doesn't give its name. N/A.

4. **After receiving medical documentation from Ms. Bourgeois, what compensation did Turkish Airlines provide?**  
   Ms. Bourgeois was offered 5,000 miles if she couldn't provide docs. The article doesn’t say what happened after she provided them. N/A.

5. **Which route had the highest number of reported incidents according to deep cleaning records?**  
   The article doesn’t mention specific routes in the records. N/A.

6. **Total cost incurred by Turkish Airlines for treating all mentioned aircraft?**

   The article doesn’t mention any new protocols post-Titcombe. N/A.

    The process takes 2-5 days, but the exact days after evidence isn’t stated. N/A.

11. **Which social media platform did Bourgeois use?**  
    She shared photos with help desk, but the article mentions X user and Facebook. Wait, the user who claimed in August used X, but Bourgeois' method isn't specified. Wait, the article says "an X user who claimed... shared photos with the airline's help desk". But for Bourgeois, it says she attempted to follow up and they asked for medical docs. The question is about Bourgeois, so the article doesn't specify her platform. N/A.

    The article doesn’t mention a count. N/A.

13. **Cleaning method Rob Tuck referenced conflicting with "deep cleaning every 21 days"?**
