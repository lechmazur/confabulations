Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the given article and strictly follow the instructions. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks about the percentage point difference between the 10 largest credit card issuers and smaller banks, according to the CFPB. The article mentions the 25 biggest issuers had rates 8-10 points higher than smaller ones. Wait, the question says "10 largest" but the article says "25 biggest". Since the article specifies 25, but the question is about 10, maybe the answer is still 8-10 because it's the closest info. But maybe it's a trick and should be N/A? Hmm, the question says "10 largest", but the article says "25 biggest". Since the exact number isn't 10, maybe it's N/A. Wait, the question says "the 10 largest" but the article says "25 biggest". Since it's not exactly matching, maybe the answer is N/A. But the question might just be paraphrasing. Wait the article says "25 biggest credit-card issuers had rates that were 8 to 10 percentage points higher than smaller banks or credit unions." The question is about the 10 largest. Since the article doesn't mention 10, maybe the answer is N/A. But maybe the 25 includes the top 10, so the difference is still 8-10. The question says "the 10 largest", but the article's data is on the 25. Since the question's exact terms aren't in the article, maybe N/A. But the answer might be 8-10. Let me check the exact wording again. The question is asking about the difference between the 10 largest and smaller ones. The article's data is about the 25 largest. Since the question's parameters don't exactly match, the answer is N/A. Wait but maybe the question is referring to the 25 as the 10? Probably not. So I think the answer here should be N/A because the article refers to 25, not 10.

Wait, but the question says "the 10 largest" but the article says "25 biggest". Since the question's numbers don't align with the article's, the answer can't be directly inferred. Therefore, the answer is N/A. But maybe the question meant 25 but wrote 10? But the user says to only use the article. So I'll go with N/A here.

2. The second question asks which yield tracked by Jeff Sommer would surpass 5.13% if Trump's policies caused inflation. The article mentions Jeff Sommer's columns on money-market funds, and the Crane 100 Money Fund Index was at 4.19% in January, down from 5.13% in July. So if inflation leads to higher rates, the Crane 100 yield would go above 5.13% again. The question is asking what would surpass the July level. So the answer would be the Crane 100 Index's yield. The question says "specific yield previously tracked by Jeff Sommer" which is the Crane 100. So the answer is the Crane 100 Money Fund Index yield.

3. The third question is about the average yield on a two-year online CD in January, assuming a similar decrease as the one-year. The article says one-year online CDs averaged 3.63% in January, down from 4.1% six months earlier. The decrease over six months is 0.47%. If the two-year followed the same pattern, but the article only mentions one-year terms. Since two-year isn't mentioned, maybe N/A. The question assumes a similar decrease, but the article doesn't provide data for two-year CDs. So the answer is N/A because the article only gives data for one-year terms. 

4. Fourth question: If someone with low credit score had a new car loan at the average rate (6.6% in Dec) and refinanced through a CFPB-mentioned credit union, what would the new rate be? The CFPB said the big issuers had rates 8-10 points higher than smaller ones. Assuming the best case (10 points lower), 6.6 -10 = negative, which doesn't make sense. Wait, the CFPB's warning was about credit cards, not car loans. Wait, the question is about car loans refinanced through a credit union. The CFPB's info was for credit cards. The article says "credit unions require you to work or live someplace particular to qualify for membership, but some bigger credit unions may have looser rules." But the CFPB's warning was on credit cards. The question might be mixing. Wait the article says for credit cards, the big issuers had rates 8-10 points higher than smaller. The question is about car loans, but the CFPB's info is on credit cards. Since the article doesn't mention the difference in auto loan rates between big and small lenders, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, if assuming the same 8-10 difference, then 6.6 minus 10 would be negative, so maybe that's not possible. So maybe N/A.

Wait the question says "credit union highlighted by the CFPB". The CFPB's warning was about credit card issuers. The article mentions for car loans, you can get preapproved through credit unions, but the CFPB's info was on credit cards. Since the CFPB's warning didn't mention auto loans, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the best case difference from the credit card example is 10 points lower, but that's for credit cards. Since the question is about car loans, and the article doesn't provide that info, so N/A.

5. Fifth question: Federal undergrad loans are 6.53%, and the formula uses the 10-year Treasury yield plus a fixed percentage. The unsubsidized grad loans are 8.08%, so the difference is 1.55%. If the Treasury yield in May follows the trend (assuming the Fed's rate is decreasing?), then if the Treasury yield is, say, lower, then the grad loan rate would be Treasury + 1.55. But the question says "assuming the formula added a fixed percentage similar to undergrad and grad difference". The current difference between undergrad (6.53) and grad (8.08) is 1.55. If the Treasury yield in May is the same as the previous year, then the new grad rate would be the same. But the question says "assuming the formula added a fixed percentage to the Treasury bond yield, similar to the difference between undergraduate and graduate loan rates mentioned?" So the fixed percentage is 1.55. If the Treasury yield is, say, X, then grad loan is X +1.55. But without knowing the Treasury yield, can't compute. Wait the question says "if the formula added a fixed percentage... similar to the difference between undergraduate and graduate loan rates mentioned?" The difference is 1.55. So the fixed percentage added would be 1.55. But the question is asking what the new rate would be for unsubsidized grad loans starting July 1. The article states the current rates are 6.53 (undergrad), 8.08 (grad), 9.08 (PLUS). The formula is based on the 10-year Treasury auction in May. So if the Treasury yield in May is the same as before, then the rate would stay. But the question is asking if the formula uses the same fixed percentage. Since the current grad rate is 8.08, which is undergrad's 6.53 plus 1.55, then the fixed percentage added is 1.55. So if the 10-year yield in May is, say, Y, then the new grad rate would be Y +1.55. But the question doesn't give the Treasury yield. So maybe the question is asking for the rate based on current data. Wait the current grad rate is 8.08. The question says "assuming the formula added a fixed percentage... similar to the difference between undergraduate and graduate loan rates mentioned?" So the fixed percentage is 1.55. If the Treasury yield is, say, the same as in May 2023, but the article doesn't say what that was. Since the article only gives the current rates, maybe the answer is N/A because we don't have the May's Treasury yield. Alternatively, maybe the question is just asking for the difference, so the fixed percentage is 1.55, so the new grad rate would be the Treasury yield plus 1.55. But since we don't know the Treasury yield, the answer can't be determined, so N/A.

Hmm, maybe the question is phrased differently. It says "assuming the formula added a fixed percentage to the Treasury bond yield, similar to the difference between undergraduate and graduate loan rates mentioned?" So the fixed percentage is the difference between the current grad and undergrad rates. So 8.08 -6.53=1.55. So the fixed percentage added is 1.55. If the Treasury bond yield (from May's auction) is, say, the same as the previous year, then the grad rate would stay the same. But the question doesn't give new info on Treasury yields. Since the article doesn't provide the May's yield, can't compute the new rate. So N/A.

6. Sixth question: Average interest rate for new car loans in December of the year when the Fed began its rate cuts. The Fed started raising rates in March 2022 and then cut in 2023. The article says "the Fed began lifting rates rapidly -- from near zero to a high of 5.33 -- between March 2022 and July 2023. Prices have cooled... Fed pivoted to rate cuts, lowering rates in September, November and December." So the Fed began its rate cuts in 2023. The question is asking for the year when the Fed began its rate cuts. The Fed began rate cuts in 2023 (September, etc.), so the year when they started cutting is 2023. The question asks for the average rate in December of that year. The article says "the average rate on new car loans was 6.6 percent in December [2023?], according to Edmunds... down from 7.1 percent in the same month in 2023 and 6.7 percent in 2022." Wait the article says "in December, according to Edmunds, down from 7.1 percent in the same month in 2023 and 6.7 percent in 2022." Wait that seems conflicting. Wait the article says "the average rate on new car loans was 6.6 percent in December, according to Edmunds, down from 7.1 percent in the same month in 2023 and 6.7 percent in 2022." Wait that can't be. Wait maybe it's a typo. Let me check again:

The article states: "The average rate on new car loans was 6.6 percent in December, according to Edmunds, down from 7.1 percent in the same month in 2023 and 6.7 percent in 2022."

Wait that can't be. If December 2023 is the same month, then the current year must be 2024. But the Fed's actions in the article are up to recent times, so likely the article is from 2024. So December of the year when Fed began rate cuts (which was 2023) would be December 2023, which had a rate of 7.1% as per the article. So the answer is 7.1%.

7. Seventh question: If someone took an adjustable-rate mortgage after the Fed's last rate cut, how many months until rate change? The article says "adjustable-rate mortgages... generally adjust within two billing cycles after a change in the Fed's rates." So two billing cycles. Assuming monthly billing, that's 2 months. So the answer is 2.

8. Eighth question: What loan other than auto would reflect the full percentage point decrease in the Fed's key rate. The Fed's key rate decreased by a full point last year. The article says home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages are tied to the Fed's rates. The question asks for another loan besides auto. So home equity line of credit (HELOC) or adjustable-rate mortgages. The question asks for another type besides auto. The answer is adjustable-rate mortgages or HELOC. The article mentions both. The question says "other than auto loans", so either of those. The article says "Home-equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages... generally adjust within two billing cycles after a change in the Fed's rates." So both are directly tied. Since the question asks for a type, either is correct. The answer is adjustable-rate mortgages.

9. Ninth question: If a money-market fund's yield decreased proportionally to the drop in one-year CDs over six months. The Crane index was 5.13% in July, then 4.19% in January (a drop of 0.94%). The one-year CDs dropped from 4.1% to 3.63% over six months (a decrease of 0.47%). The question says if the money-market fund's yield decreased proportionally. Wait the article says the Crane index went from 5.13% in July to 4.19% in January. That's a drop of 0.94%. The one-year CD dropped from 4.1% to 3.63% over the same period (0.47% decrease). The question says "the yield decreased proportionally to the drop in the average one-year online CD rate over the six months prior to January". Wait the money-market's drop was bigger. But the question is phrased as if the money-market fund's yield would drop in the same proportion as the CD's drop. The CD decreased by 0.47% over six months. If the money-market fund's previous yield was, say, higher, but the question says "the yield decreased proportionally to the drop in the average one-year online CD rate over the six months prior to January". The CD dropped by (4.1 -3.63)/4.1 ≈ 11.46% decrease. The money-market fund's drop from July to Jan was (5.13-4.19)/5.13 ≈ 18.3%. If instead, the question is asking for the current yield in January assuming proportional drop from its previous level. Wait the question says "the yield decreased proportionally to the drop in the average one-year online CD rate over the six months prior to January". The CD dropped by 0.47% (from 4.1 to 3.63). So the money-market fund's drop would be the same percentage decrease. The money-market fund's previous yield was 5.13% in July. The CD's decrease was 0.47 over 4.1, so (0.47/4.1)*100 = ~11.46%. Applying that to the money-market's July yield: 5.13*(1 -0.1146)=5.13*0.8854≈4.54. But in reality, the Crane index was 4.19%, which is a bigger drop. But the question is hypothetical. Alternatively, if the drop in percentage points is proportional, but the question is unclear. Since the article states the Crane index was at 4.19% in January, which is exactly the drop as given, so the answer is 4.19%. But the question says "assuming a proportional decrease", but the article already gives the result. Since the question is asking what would be the approximate yield if it decreased proportionally, but the actual yield is 4.19%, so that's the answer. But maybe the question is hypothetical. The article says "the yield on the Crane 100 Money Fund Index... was 4.19% as of Monday, down from 5.13% at the end of July." So the answer is 4.19%, so the approximate yield in January is 4.19%. Therefore, the answer is 4.19%.

10. Tenth question: If delinquency rates decrease significantly, what's the impact on qualification difficulty for excellent credit borrowers for used car loans. The article says "as those [delinquency rates] move higher, so do rates, which makes qualifying for a loan more difficult, particularly for those with lower credit scores." So if delinquency rates decrease, rates would go down. For borrowers with excellent credit, qualification difficulty would decrease (easier). So the answer is easier. But the question says "likely impact on the qualification difficulty". So the answer is "less difficult" or "easier". But the exact wording: "likely impact... if delinquency rates were to decrease significantly?" So the answer is "less difficult" or "easier", but the options are sentence fragments. The article says that when delinquency rates go up, rates go up and qualifying is harder for lower credit. So lower delinquency would mean lower rates, making it easier to qualify, especially for excellent credit. So the answer is easier, but need to phrase as per instructions. The question is "what would be the likely impact on the qualification difficulty for borrowers with excellent credit scores if delinquency rates were to decrease significantly?" The answer is that qualification becomes easier, so "easier" or "less difficult". The article says "makes qualifying for a loan more difficult, particularly for those with lower credit scores." So inversely, if delinquency decreases, the difficulty decreases. So the answer is "less difficult" or "easier". The question asks for the impact, so "less difficult" or "easier". The answer should be "easier" or "less difficult". Let me check the article again: "As those move higher, so do rates, which makes qualifying for a loan more difficult, particularly for those with lower credit scores." So lower delinquency would lead to lower rates and easier qualification. Since the question is about excellent credit, they might not be affected as much, but still, lower rates would mean easier terms. So the answer is "less difficult" or "easier". The article says "more difficult" when rates go up, so when rates go down, it's easier. So the answer is "easier".

11. Eleventh question: Which Treasury note is the key reference for auto loans? The article says "auto loans tend to track with the yield on the five-year Treasury note". So the answer is five-year Treasury note.

12. Twelfth question: What peak rate did the Fed reach before lowering rates? The article states "the central bank began lifting rates rapidly -- from near zero to a high of 5.33 -- between March 2022 and July 2023." So the peak was 5.33%.

13. Thirteenth question: Which bank is mentioned as one of the largest auto lenders? The article says "Capital One and Ally are two of the largest auto lenders".

14. Fourteenth question: Which Treasury bond tracks 30-year mortgages? The article says "30-year fixed-rate mortgages... generally track with the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds".

15. Fifteenth question: Which regulatory body warned about credit card rates? The article says "the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sent up a flare..."

16. Sixteenth question: Which online platform for comparing savings rates? The article mentions "DepositAccounts.com".

17. Seventeenth question: Unsubsidized grad federal loans' rate? The article says "8.08 percent for unsubsidized graduate student loans".

18. Eighteenth question: Which columnist covers personal finance topics like college savings and retirement? The article ends with "Tara Siegel Bernard writes about personal finance, from saving for college to paying for retirement and everything in between." So the answer is Tara Siegel Bernard.

19. Nineteenth question: Fee to lower mortgage rate? The article mentions "discount points... optional fees buyers can pay to 'buy down' their interest rate".

20. Twentieth question: What rate for new car loans in December that shows a decline from previous years? The article says "the average rate on new car loans was 6.6 percent in December, down from 7.1 percent in the same month in 2023 and 6.7 percent in 2022." Wait, but December of the current year (maybe 2024) is 6.6, down from 2023's Dec (7.1) and 2022's Dec (6.7). The question is asking for the rate that is a decline from previous reporting. The current rate is 6.6, which is lower than both previous years. So the answer is 6.6% as it's the current rate that's lower than previous years. The question says "cited as representing a decline from rates noted in previous reporting?" The article states that 6.6 is down from 7.1 (last Dec) and 6.7 (2022). So the answer is 6.6%.
