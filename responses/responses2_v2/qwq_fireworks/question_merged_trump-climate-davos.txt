Okay, I need to tackle these 18 questions based solely on the provided article. Let me go through each question one by one and see what the article says.

1. **How many migrants with suspected gang affiliations... did the Trump administration plan to house in the tent city?**
The article mentions "10 migrants with suspected gang affiliations" in Guantanamo and a tent city for up to 30,000. But the question asks how many were planned for the tent city. The 10 are in Guantanamo, the tent is for 30k. So answer is 30,000? Wait, the question is about the migrants with gang affiliations in the tent? The article says the 10 are in Guantanamo, and the tent is preparing for 30k. The question specifically mentions the migrants with gang affiliations alongside Al Qaeda detainees (which are in Guantanamo). The tent city is separate. So the answer for the tent city's planned number isn't specified for those migrants. The article says "preparing a tent city to house as many as 30,000 migrants." But the 10 are in Guantanamo. So the answer is N/A because the 10 are in Guantanamo, not the tent. The tent's number is 30k total migrants, but not specifically about the gang-affiliated ones. So the question is about how many gang-affiliated migrants were planned for the tent. Since the article says the 10 are in Guantanamo, and the tent is for 30k migrants (not specified how many are gang-affiliated), the answer is N/A.

2. **What prompted Ursula von der Leyen to initiate the closure of USAID?**
The article says Trump called for USAID's closure. The question links Ursula's actions to that. But the article states that Ursula was talking about Europe's stance on Paris Agreement. The closure of USAID was due to Trump's call, not her. So the answer is N/A because Ursula didn't initiate USAID's closure.

3. **What legal precedent did Simon Stiell cite for rejoining Paris?**
The article says Simon mentioned the U.S. could rejoin at any time. But the legal precedent question references the lawsuits against CBS and Register. The article says those lawsuits are by Trump and lack legal merit but are effective harassment. Simon's statement doesn't mention legal precedents related to the lawsuits. So answer N/A.

4. **In what year did WEF survey about extreme weather prompt Trudeau's concerns about Canada's minerals?**
The article mentions Trudeau's talk about critical minerals in the same paragraph as the WEF's survey on extreme weather. But no year given. The main article's date is when Trump took office, but the year isn't specified. The Paris Agreement was 2015. The article might be from when Trump took office, but the exact year isn't stated here. So N/A.

5. **What tech discussed by Kate Brandt did Berman refer to with LA's scorched landscape?**
Brandt talked about advanced nuclear, geothermal, battery storage, AI. Berman mentioned dependence on fossil fuels causing LA's scorched landscape. The tech Brandt discussed isn't directly linked to Berman's comment. Berman's reference is about fossil fuels, not the specific tech. So answer N/A.

6. **What action by We Mean Business prompted lawsuits against press?**
We Mean Business expressed frustration over US leaving Paris. The lawsuits are against CBS and Register, but the article doesn't connect their statement to the lawsuits. So N/A.

7. **Name of Climate Forward newsletter mentioned with Fossil Fuel Treaty?**
The article says David Gelles leads Climate Forward and the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative is mentioned. The question asks if the newsletter is named in context of the treaty. The article mentions both but not together. So N/A.

8. **Amazon's Kara Hurst's response to West Point clubs?**
The question asks Amazon's response to the West Point issue. The article links Amazon's stance on climate targets, not the West Point clubs. So N/A.

9. **Which org criticized by Berman did Trump shut down?**
Berman criticized dependence on fossil fuels. The article says Trump called for USAID's closure. USAID isn't a fossil fuel org. The article doesn't say Trump shut down a fossil fuel org. So N/A.

10. **Which agency was directly targeted for closure reflecting withdrawal from multilateral engagements?**
The USAID closure is mentioned as per Trump's call, and the article's theme is US withdrawal from Paris (multilateral). So USAID is the answer.

11. **Which coalition expressed regret over US policy change?**
We Mean Business expressed frustration. So that's the answer.

12. **Who linked Canada's minerals to becoming a US state?**
Trudeau in a talk with business leaders said Canada's minerals are behind Trump's comments about making it a state. So Trudeau.

13. **Whose admin policy linked to ending diversity at West Point?**
The article says West Point ended clubs due to Trump's D.E.I. ban. So Trump's administration.

14. **Which sustainability officer pledged targets remain?**
Amazon's Kara Hurst said they're staying the course. So her.

15. **Which activist claimed policy would cost lives?**
Tzeporah Berman said Trump's move would cost lives.

16. **Who said Europe would stay the course on Paris?**
Ursula von der Leyen.

17. **Which Cuban facility houses the migrants?**
Guantanamo Bay prison.

18. **Swiss locale for discussions and US policy critiques?**
Davos, Switzerland.
