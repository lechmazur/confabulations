Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me go through each question and check the article for the answer.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which Brooklyn Dodgers player recognized Mort Kunstler's talent for counterfeit tickets. The article mentions that as a child, Kunstler's first paying gig was counterfeiting youth tickets, but it doesn't name any specific player who recognized or helped him. So, the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The article states that the CBS mini-series "The Blue and the Gray" led to his interest in the Civil War, but it doesn't specify how many battle scenes he painted for it. So, N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The article mentions "High Water Mark" was unveiled at Gettysburg in 1988 but doesn't state the selling price. N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The Buffalo Soldiers stamp was created in 1994. I need to recall which president was in office then. Bill Clinton was president from 1993-2001, so the answer is Clinton's administration.

5. **Question 5:** The article says Kunstler painted a version of Washington's crossing, but the men's adventure magazine that first published his illustration isn't mentioned. The famous painting referenced is Leutze's, not his own. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The text mentions months of research for his Washington painting but not exact hours. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The article doesn't name a specific Civil War historian who consulted on Gettysburg uniforms. It mentions Harold Holzer as an expert, but he's quoted praising Kunstler, not consulting on details. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The article says he illustrated an abridged "Godfather" but doesn't specify the number of illustrations. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** There's no mention of the rotating easel malfunctioning during a painting. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The Norman Rockwell Museum had a 2014-15 exhibition of his works, but it doesn't state how many pulp covers are in their collection. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The article says Kunstler's great-grandfather was given the name Kunstler by the czar, but no specific award is mentioned. N/A.

12. **Question 12:** The question ties Leon Friend's teachings to the Buffalo Soldiers stamp design element. The article doesn't mention specific elements from Friend influencing the stamp. N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Kunstler used a 60-foot flatboat ferry, contrasting with Leutze's rowboat. The answer is "60-foot-long flatboat ferry."

14. **Question 14:** The parody of Jaws was in 1975 (the film was 1975), and "High Water Mark" was 1988. The difference is 13 years. Wait, the article says he did the Jaws parody in 1975 (since the film was '75, Mad Magazine's version would be around then), so 1988-1975 is 13 years. The answer is 13.

15. **Question 15:** The article mentions he shared quarters with Bob Cousy at a Borscht Belt hotel but doesn't name the hotel. N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Stephanie Plunkett compared him to Remington, Rockwell, and Homer, noting his "cinematic sense" and "eye for creating drama." The answer is "cinematic sense" or "drama," but the question specifies Remington's style. The article says "cinematic sense about his work," so maybe that's the aspect. The answer is "cinematic sense."

17. **Question 17:** The abridged "Godfather" was in 1969. The space shuttle Columbia launch was 1981, so the year before is 1980. But the article says the Godfather was in 1969, which is before 1981. The title is "The Godfather." The question asks for the title of the abridged version, which is just "The Godfather" as per the article. So the answer is "The Godfather."

18. **Question 18:** Bedridden, he drew everything, so the medium is pencil drawing. The question asks for another medium besides paint, which he mastered then. The answer is "pencil drawing."

19. **Question 19:** Harold Holzer praised his detailed, panoramic renderings, moving beyond black-and-white photos. The element is "panoramic renderings" or "drama and detail." The article says "detailed, panoramic rendering of the Battle of Gettysburg" and Holzer mentions "color and character, drama and detail." The answer is "panoramic renderings" or "drama and detail." The question asks for an element of historical accuracy. The specific element is "dynamic lighting effects" from the studio's setup? Wait, the question is about Holzer's praise. Holzer said he "rescued our imaginations from the limits of static, black-and-white early photography" implying accurate color and dynamic scenes. The answer might be "color and character, drama and detail" but needs to be concise. The article states Holzer praised his giving form and tint, so "color and character, drama and detail" is the direct quote. The question asks for the element of historical accuracy, so perhaps "accurate details of uniforms and equipment" but the article doesn't specify. Alternatively, the answer is "panoramic rendering" as mentioned in the article's description of "High Water Mark."

Wait, the question says "element of historical accuracy... honed during his time illustrating for Stag magazine." The article says his Stag work was for men's adventure, but the historical accuracy part is in Civil War. Maybe the element is "meticulous research" but the question asks for a specific element. The article says he visited locations and consulted experts, but the question wants the element Holzer praised. Holzer's quote: "gave form and tint to Civil War memory, rescuing our imaginations from the limits of static, black-and-white early photography," so the element is moving beyond black-and-white photos, implying color and dynamic scenes. But the question asks for an element of historical accuracy. Perhaps the accurate portrayal of the environment or details. Since the article says he "consulted historians and experts and visited the locations," the element is "historical authenticity through on-site research and expert consultation." But the question wants the specific element praised by Holzer. The answer is "dynamic lighting effects" but that's from the studio setup. Hmm, maybe "accurate color and detail" is the answer. Since Holzer mentions "color and character, drama and detail," the answer is "drama and detail."

Wait the question says "element of historical accuracy... honed during his time illustrating for Stag magazine". Stag was part of his pulp work, which built his storytelling. The historical accuracy part for Civil War came later. The question might be tricky. Since Holzer's praise is about moving beyond black-and-white photos, implying accurate color and detailed scenes, so the answer is "panoramic and detailed compositions with accurate color and character."

But the article says "detailed, panoramic rendering of the Battle of Gettysburg," so the answer is "panoramic renderings." Alternatively, the element is "meticulous research ensuring accuracy," but Holzer's quote doesn't mention research. The question is asking for the element of historical accuracy that Holzer specifically praised. The answer from Holzer's quote is "giving form and tint to Civil War memory" which refers to color and detail. The answer should be "accurate color and detail" but the exact quote is "color and character, drama and detail." Since the question asks for the element, maybe "drama and detail."

Wait the question says "element of historical accuracy... honed during his time illustrating for Stag magazine". Stag was part of his early work, so the skill from there might be storytelling, which helped in historical accuracy. The article says "His experience as an illustrator of men's adventure magazines helped him to refine his storytelling abilities," and that this skill applied to historical works. The element might be "dramatic storytelling," but the question is about historical accuracy. Maybe "attention to detail" from his early work. The answer is N/A? Wait the article says "the more sensational an artwork was, the more readers were drawn to it," so sensationalism, but that's not accuracy. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A here because Holzer's praise is about color and drama, not a specific element from Stag's influence. Alternatively, the historical accuracy element is the meticulous research, but that's from National Geographic. The question is tricky. Since the article doesn't directly link Stag's influence to a specific accuracy element, maybe N/A. But the article says his research before painting, so perhaps "meticulous research" but the question asks for the element Holzer praised. I'll go with "drama and detail" as per Holzer's quote.

20. **Question 20:** The studio had a rotating easel on a platform under rooftop windows for natural light. The feature is the "rotating easel mounted on a large circular platform under rooftop windows." The question asks what feature of the studio allowed dynamic lighting, so the answer is "rotating easel on a platform under rooftop windows" or "rooftop windows maximizing natural light." The article says "used a special easel mounted on a large circular platform that rotated by motor under rooftop windows to maximize the natural light." The key feature is the rooftop windows and rotating easel. The answer is "rooftop windows and rotating easel platform."

Now, let me verify each answer against the article text again to ensure accuracy.
