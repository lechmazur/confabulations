Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article and strictly follow the instructions. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions that Ancora nominated Alan Kestenbaum, who was part of Stelco Holdings, which was acquired by Cleveland-Cliffs. So the company linked here is Cleveland-Cliffs.

2. **Question 2:** Ancora criticized U.S. Steel's spending on Wall Street advisers, estimating it to be in the "nine figures." The exact dollar amount isn't specified, so maybe it's N/A? Wait, the question asks for the specific dollar amount they claimed was wasted. The article says "nine figures," which is a figure like $100 million or more, but the exact number isn't given. So maybe N/A?

3. **Question 3:** Ancora mentioned that President Trump is a vocal opponent of the deal. So the answer is Trump.

4. **Question 4:** Nippon Steel's statement mentions $300 million for Gary Works. The question is about Cleveland-Cliffs' commitment. Wait, the article says Cleveland-Cliffs is considering a bid and acquired Stelco, but their specific commitment to Gary Works isn't mentioned. Wait, Nippon's investment in Gary is part of their plan, but the question is about Cleveland-Cliffs. Since the text doesn't mention Cleveland-Cliffs' funding for Gary Works, the answer might be N/A. Wait, the question says "Cleveland-Cliffs' competing bid" but the article says Cleveland-Cliffs is considering a bid. The article only mentions Nippon's investments, so N/A?

5. **Question 5:** Ancora nominated nine directors. The article states this clearly. So 9.

6. **Question 6:** The CEO of Cleveland-Cliffs is Lourenco Goncalves, who has a strained relationship with David Burritt. The question asks for the executive's name. So Lourenco Goncalves.

7. **Question 7:** The article says shares are down 22% over the past year and down 1% on Monday. The question asks for the percentage decline between the blocked bid and Ancora's letter. The article doesn't specify the time between the announcement and the letter, so maybe N/A?

8. **Question 8:** Nippon Steel's $1 billion for Mon Valley Works is mentioned. So Mon Valley Works is the answer.

9. **Question 9:** The Biden administration blocked it citing national security concerns. So the justification is national security.

10. **Question 10:** The executive is Alan Kestenbaum, as he's the one Ancora wants to replace Burritt.

11. **Question 11:** The same as question 10 and 1, so Alan Kestenbaum again.

12. **Question 12:** The $1 billion for Mon Valley Works is stated. So $1 billion.

13. **Question 13:** The company that acquired Stelco is Cleveland-Cliffs, so they're the key competitor now.

14. **Question 14:** The total investment is $1 billion (Mon Valley) + $300 million (Gary) = $1.3 billion. But the article says Nippon has already committed $2.7 billion in total, including these. The question asks for the total from the two mentioned, so $1.3 billion? Or the article says "as part of $2.7 billion in investment that it has already committed". The two are part of that total. So maybe the answer is $1.3 billion, but the question says "allocated in its plan" so perhaps the total of the two is the answer. The question is about combining Mon and Gary, so yes, 1.3 billion.

15. **Question 15:** Same as question 5, which is 9 directors.

16. **Question 16:** The Biden administration blocked the deal.

17. **Question 17:** The answer is Trump again, as mentioned in the article.

18. **Question 18:** The shares mentioned are U.S. Steel's, which dropped 1% on Monday and 22% annually.

19. **Question 19:** The $2.7 billion is the total committed by Nippon.

20. **Question 20:** The expenses in the nine figures are Wall Street advisers' costs.

Now, let me check each again for exactness:

2. The article says "nine figures", which is a figure in the hundreds of millions (since a figure is a digit, 9 figures would be $100,000,000 or more). But the question asks for a specific amount. Since it's not exact, maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "specific dollar amount", so since it's not given, N/A.

4. The question is about Cleveland-Cliffs' commitment. The article only mentions Nippon's investments. Cleveland-Cliffs is considering a bid but there's no mention of their funding for Gary Works. So N/A.

7. The article doesn't mention the exact time between the blocked bid and the letter, so the percentage decline between those two specific points isn't given. The 22% is annual, so N/A.

14. The question asks for the total of Mon and Gary. Mon is $1B, Gary $300M, so total is $1.3B. The article says "as part of $2.7 billion in investment that it has already committed". So the answer is $1.3 billion? But the question says "allocated in its plan", so yes, that's the sum of those two. But the question might want the total from the two mentioned, so 1.3B. But the answer should be written as $1.3 billion? The question says "dollar amount", so $1,300,000,000 or $1.3 billion. The article uses "$2.7 billion", so maybe just 1.3 billion.

Wait, the article says "at least $1 billion to Mon Valley Works and approximately $300 million to Gary Works as a part of $2.7 billion in investment that it has already committed". So the total of those two is part of the 2.7B. The question asks for the total investment figure allocated for those two. So the answer is $1.3 billion. But the question says "what total investment figure...", so yes, 1.3B.

Let me confirm all answers again:

1. Cleveland-Cliffs

2. N/A (since "nine figures" is not a specific amount)

3. Trump

4. N/A (Cleveland-Cliffs' commitment not mentioned)

5. 9

6. Lourenco Goncalves

7. N/A (time frame not specified)

8. Mon Valley Works (the question is which facility's $1B investment)

9. National security concerns

10. Alan Kestenbaum

11. Alan Kestenbaum

12. $1 billion

13. Cleveland-Cliffs

14. $1.3 billion (but the article says "as part of $2.7 billion", but the question wants the total of the two mentioned, so yes)

Wait, the question says "what total investment figure in dollars does the article imply Nippon Steel has allocated in its plan?" The answer is $2.7 billion. Wait, the question is confusing. Let me read again:

"Referring to the investment figures discussed for revitalizing operations, what dollar amount did Nippon Steel pledge for the Mon Valley Works as part of its commitment?" That's question 12. Then question 14 says "combining the commitments mentioned for both Mon Valley Works and Gary Works, what total investment figure..." So Mon is $1B, Gary $300M, total $1.3B. But the article says "as a part of $2.7 billion in investment that it has already committed". So the total of those two is part of the 2.7B. The question is asking for the sum of those two, so 1.3B. So the answer is $1.3 billion.

15. 9

16. Biden administration

17. Trump

18. U.S. Steel

19. $2.7 billion

20. Wall Street advisers
