Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one, using only the provided article. Let me start by going through each question and cross-referencing the article.

1. The question asks which VA Hospital administrator first issued the directive about pride symbols. The article mentions an email from the Veterans Affairs hospitals, but it doesn't name the specific administrator. So that's N/A.

2. The article says employees were placed on administrative leave, but it doesn't specify the number. So N/A here.

3. The $400k project's findings were preemptively censored, but the article doesn't mention a percentage deleted. So N/A.

4. The datathon was organized by Nancy Krieger from Harvard, but the question asks about a former coordinator at VA. The article doesn't name who organized it, so N/A.

5. The number of folders deleted isn't stated. The article mentions files with "DEI" were deleted, but no count. N/A.

6. The unsigned memo's author isn't identified in the text. So N/A.

7. The AtlasPlus has 20 years of data. The article says it's missing, so the answer is 20.

8. The article mentions some state health admins interpreted DEI as hiring only, but doesn't name the first state. N/A.

9. The article doesn't mention when RFK Jr. made that statement. N/A.

10. The article says employees asked if books should be removed, but no number given. N/A.

11. The question refers to a military branch's clubs. The article mentions West Point (Army) ending clubs, so Army.

12. The article states Canada's critical minerals were referenced by Trump, but which one? The text doesn't specify, so N/A.

13. The article says USAID was ordered closed. So USAID.

14. The database named is AtlasPlus, which includes HIV, TB, hepatitis B. So AtlasPlus.

15. RFK Jr. focused on chronic diseases, which the article says are mentioned in his nomination. The exact disease isn't specified, so N/A.

16. The Youth Risk Behavior data highlighted depression in teenage girls and LGB youth. So teenage girls and LGB youth.

17. Contractors involved in health equity were fired. The article says "federal contractors working on health equity issues", so health equity contractors.

18. The prison is Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The article mentions that.

19. The term removed from directories was personal pronouns.

20. The co-leader was Nancy Krieger.
