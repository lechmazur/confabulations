Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. 

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks for the name of Chuck Todd's MSNBC show that moved to a digital platform. The article mentions "Meet the Press Daily" was moved to a digital channel in 2022. So the answer should be "Meet the Press Daily".

2. **Question 2:** The second question is about NBC's statement highlighting a specific aspect of "Meet the Press" legacy. The NBC statement says they're grateful for his commitment to "Meet the Press" and its enduring legacy. So the answer is "enduring legacy".

3. **Question 3:** Todd mentioned new projects transitioning from "pie in the sky" to reality. The question links this to Trump's social media company's focus on financial services. The answer is "new projects" or maybe "financial services"? Wait, the user wants what Todd said. The text says "new projects that are on the cusp...", so the answer is "new projects". But the trend mentioned is Trump's company moving to financial services. Hmm, maybe the question is looking for "projects" but the trend is financial services. Wait, the question says "reflecting a broader trend similar to the focus of Trump's social media company?" So the answer should be "financial services" but Todd's own stated pursuit is "new projects". Wait, the question is asking what Todd was excited to pursue, which is the projects, but the trend similar to Trump's company's focus is financial services. But the answer should be Todd's own projects. The question says "what specific type of programming did Chuck Todd say he was excited to pursue, reflecting a broader trend similar to...". The answer is "new projects" but maybe the trend is "financial services", but Todd's answer is about his projects. The question is a bit confusing, but according to the text, Todd said "a few new projects", so the answer is "new projects".

4. **Question 4:** The former RNC chairwoman criticized was Ronna McDaniel. The article states that Todd's comments about her hiring led to criticism from Maddow and others. So answer is "Ronna McDaniel".

5. **Question 5:** The year Todd joined NBC is mentioned as 2007. The question asks the year he joined, so "2007".

6. **Question 6:** The digital channel where his show moved isn't named. The article says "moved to a digital channel in 2022" but doesn't name it. So answer is N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Todd's stated reason for leaving was wanting to start new projects. The NBC statement says he's excited about new projects. The answer should be "to pursue new projects" or "excited about new projects". The exact quote is "I'm pretty excited about a few new projects..." so the answer is "to pursue new projects" or similar. The question says "echoing the broader trend of media figures seeking new opportunities" so the reason is seeking new opportunities. But the direct answer from the text is his stated reason: "excited about a few new projects".

8. **Question 8:** The same as question 5, so 2007.

9. **Question 9:** Same as question 4, so Ronna McDaniel.

10. **Question 10:** The show he passed to Kristen Welker is "Meet the Press". The article says he stepped down from "Meet the Press" in 2023, handing over to Welker. So answer is "Meet the Press".

11. **Question 11:** The digital channel shift of his show ("Meet the Press Daily") led to decreased presence. The question asks for the name of the digital channel, but the article doesn't specify. So answer N/A.

12. **Question 12:** The co-host who exited "Today" show is Hoda Kotb. The article mentions Hoda Kotb exited NBC's "Today" show this month (same time as Todd's departure). So answer "Hoda Kotb".

13. **Question 13:** The day he announced his departure: the article says he told colleagues on Friday that he was leaving, and his last day was Friday. So the announcement was on Friday. The question asks on which day he announced, which is Friday.

14. **Question 14:** The program associated with his rise is "Meet the Press", as he became moderator in 2014. The article says he became a major presence during the 2008 campaign, and his rise included becoming moderator. The question is about the program associated with his rise, so "Meet the Press".

15. **Question 15:** The relative of the president mentioned is Lara Trump (daughter-in-law of Trump) hosting on Fox News. So answer "Lara Trump".

16. **Question 16:** The media company with increased digital subscribers is The New York Times. The article states they added 350k digital-only subscribers. So answer "The New York Times".

17. **Question 17:** The controversial analyst's appointment was Ronna McDaniel, same as before. So answer "Ronna McDaniel".
