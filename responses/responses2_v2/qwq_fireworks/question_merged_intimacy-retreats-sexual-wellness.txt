Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and avoid any external knowledge. Let's go step by step.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which retreat uses somatic bodywork to overcome childhood trauma with local indigenous practices. The article mentions Back to the Body in Joshua Tree offers sexological bodywork, breathwork, etc., but does it mention childhood trauma or indigenous practices? The text says their retreats are grounded in sexological bodywork and include things like breathwork and body exploration. The article also mentions Blue Spirit in Costa Rica with Esther Perel's program, which includes Afro Flow yoga (African-inspired). Wait, the question is about local indigenous healing practices. The Afro Flow yoga might be the indigenous part? The question specifies "local indigenous" so in Costa Rica, Blue Spirit's Afro Flow yoga is African-inspired, but maybe that's considered local? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the Esalen Institute mentions something? Let me check again. Esalen's program with Victor Warring in Big Sur uses movement, consensual touching, but I don't see mention of indigenous practices. The Blue Spirit retreat in Costa Rica's program includes Afro Flow yoga, which is African-inspired, but is that considered local indigenous? The question is about overcoming childhood trauma through somatic bodywork with local indigenous practices. The article doesn't explicitly state that any retreat uses local indigenous practices for childhood trauma. Back to the Body's focus is on women reclaiming their erotic selves, but not specifically indigenous. So maybe the answer is N/A?

2. **Question 2:** How many hours of daily individual coaching in Back to the Body's standard package? The article says the eight-day retreat includes one-on-one coaching sessions, but the exact hours aren't mentioned. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Percentage improvement after Miraval's program? The article mentions the Miraval retreat 15 years ago, but there's no specific percentage given. The research mentions 60% awareness of preferences, but that's not about Miraval's results. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Which medical specialist at SHA pioneered the pelvic floor protocol? The article says SHA has doctors in urology, gynecology, etc., but doesn't name any individual who pioneered a protocol. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Max group size for Esalen's partner massage workshops? The Esalen section mentions workshops like "The Rewilding of Eros" and "Authentic Consent," but group size isn't specified. The Blue Spirit retreat in Costa Rica has up to 140 participants, but that's for Perel's program. Esalen's program's group size isn't given. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** How many breathwork techniques does Pamela Madsen use? The article states Back to the Body uses breathwork but doesn't specify the number of techniques. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Traditional Costa Rican elements in Blue Spirit's program? The program uses Afro Flow yoga (African-inspired), not Costa Rican. The article doesn't mention Costa Rican indigenous practices here. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Which retreat has the lowest staff-to-participant ratio for intimate healing? The article mentions Back to the Body accommodates up to 12 women, but staff numbers aren't given. Esalen's group sizes aren't specified either. Without specific numbers, can't determine. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Minimum relationship length for Kripalu's "Getting the Love You Want" workshop? The article doesn't mention any minimum requirement. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Square footage of SHA Mexico's therapeutic space? The article doesn't provide any numbers on space. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Victor Warring's retreat in Costa Rica with Afro Flow yoga? Wait, Victor Warring leads a workshop at Esalen in Big Sur, California. The Afro Flow yoga is part of Esther Perel's program in Costa Rica. The question is about Victor Warring's retreat in Costa Rica? No, the article says Victor Warring is at Esalen. So N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Which retreat combines physiotherapy for pelvic floor with yoga of intimacy? The yoga of intimacy is at Kripalu, while SHA offers physiotherapy. The article says SHA combines Western medicine with yoga/meditation. So maybe SHA Mexico or Spain? The question says "in the same retreat package." The article states SHA's programs include both physiotherapy and yoga. So answer: SHA Wellness (either location). But the question asks which destination. The options are Costa Mujeres (Mexico) or Spain. The article says both locations have sexual health units. But does it explicitly say they combine with yoga? The article says SHA's programs include yoga and meditation. So perhaps SHA Mexico or Spain. The question might be looking for Kripalu? Kripalu's "Yoga of Intimacy" is separate from physiotherapy. Wait, the article says SHA offers physiotherapy for pelvic floor and mentions yoga as part of their wellness programs. The question is which retreat combines both in the same package. So SHA's locations do that. The answer would be either Mexico or Spain. The question says "destinations" so maybe the answer is SHA Wellness (either location). But the question might expect one of the two, but the article doesn't specify a single one. Since both have it, but the question might accept either. Wait the question says "according to the article". The article says both locations have the sexual health units with physiotherapy and yoga/meditation. So the answer is SHA Wellness (either location), but the question asks "at which destination", so maybe the answer is either Costa Mujeres (Mexico) or Spain. But the question might want one. Wait the article says "As we live longer... the philosophy at SHA Wellness, a medical-wellness clinic with locations on the Mediterranean coast in Spain, and the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Both locations recently opened sexual health units..." So both locations do it. The question might accept either, but the question might have a specific answer. Since the question is about a retreat that combines physiotherapy for pelvic floor strengthening with yoga of intimacy, which is part of their programs. The yoga of intimacy is mentioned in Kripalu's retreat, but SHA combines physiotherapy with yoga. So the answer is SHA Wellness (either Spain or Mexico). The question says "according to the article" so either is correct? The question might expect SHA Wellness (but the options are the destinations listed). The answer should be "SHA Wellness" but the question asks for the destination. The article mentions Costa Mujeres and Alicante, Spain. The question might expect one of those. Since both have the same setup, but the question might not have a specific answer. Hmm, perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, the question is asking which retreat (i.e., which of the listed retreats) combines both. Since SHA's programs do that, so answer: SHA Wellness (either location). But the question says "according to the article", so the answer would be the locations mentioned. Since the question asks for the destination, maybe the answer is "Costa Mujeres, Mexico, and Alicante, Spain" but the question expects one. Alternatively, since the question is about a retreat that includes both, the answer would be SHA Wellness. But the options given in the article list the two locations. The question might have the answer as SHA Wellness, but the question says "destination", so perhaps "Costa Mujeres, Mexico" or "Alicante, Spain". Since the article doesn't specify one, maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "both locations recently opened sexual health units, offering guests an add-on option to the existing array of ongoing wellness programs, which focus on areas such as longevity, burnout, menopause and fitness. Those interested in enhancing their sexual well-being can try treatments for erectile dysfunction in men and physiotherapy sessions to help strengthen pelvic floor muscles for women. Each wellness program provides a blend of Western medicine... and ancient healing practices like yoga and meditation." So the answer is SHA Wellness (either location). The question might accept either. Since the options are the destinations listed, maybe the answer is "SHA Wellness (Mexico or Spain)" but the question probably expects one. Wait the question might not have an exact answer. Let me recheck. The question says "which retreat offers...", so the answer is SHA Wellness in either location. Since the question is about a retreat that combines both, the answer is SHA Wellness. But the options are the destinations. The article lists the locations as Costa Mujeres and Spain. Since both have the same, but the question might accept either. Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A because the article doesn't explicitly say they combine them in the same package, but the article says "a blend of Western medicine... and ancient healing practices like yoga and meditation." So yes, they do. So answer: SHA Wellness (either location). But since the question asks for the destination, the answer is either "Costa Mujeres, Mexico" or "Alicante, Spain". The article mentions both, so perhaps the answer is "SHA Wellness (Mexico and Spain)" but the question might want one of them. Since the question is in the list, maybe it's expecting one, but since both are valid, perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says both locations have the same setup. The question is asking "at which destination", so either is correct. But since the question is presented in the list, perhaps the answer is SHA Wellness, but the question expects the specific place. Hmm. Maybe I'll answer "SHA Wellness" as the retreat, but the question might need a specific location. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is N/A because the question specifies "yoga of intimacy workshops", which are mentioned at Kripalu, but SHA's yoga is part of their overall programs. Since the question says "in the same retreat package", maybe it's SHA. Let's tentatively say SHA Wellness (either location). But since the question asks for the destination, perhaps the answer is "Costa Mujeres, Mexico" or "Spain". Since both are correct, but the question might have an answer. Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A because the article doesn't explicitly state that the yoga is part of the sexual health package. The article says "each wellness program provides a blend...", so the yoga is part of the overall program. The sexual health add-on includes physiotherapy and the other treatments. So the answer is SHA Wellness (either location). Let me proceed with that as the answer.

13. **Question 13:** The August 2025 retreat at Kripalu using Imago therapy and includes a private intensive? The article says Kripalu's "Getting the Love You Want: A Couples Retreat" from Aug 1-3 includes Imago therapy and offers a private intensive after the group retreat. So answer: Kripalu.

14. **Question 14:** Juliana Cheng's program included which activity not mentioned in her testimonial but falsely implied? Juliana's testimonial mentions body exploration, touch techniques, etc. The article says Back to the Body's retreat includes bodywork sessions, group discussions, etc. The question asks for an activity not mentioned in her testimonial but falsely implied. The article says participants also have one-on-one coaching and group discussions. Juliana's testimonial says she learned to appreciate her body as a gift, but maybe the activity not mentioned but part of the program is something like dance, as mentioned in the retreat's description. The article says Back to the Body uses "voice, dance, breath, touch and movement". Juliana's testimonial didn't mention dance. So the answer would be dance? The question says "falsely implied", but according to the article, the retreat includes dance. So the answer is dance.

15. **Question 15:** Male-focused retreat in Joshua Tree addressing power dynamics and boundaries. The article mentions that Back to the Body's staff offer male-only retreats: Cosmo Meens through Himeros Project and Court Vox for queer community. The retreat that addresses power dynamics and boundaries is mentioned in Back to the Body's program (group discussions on power dynamics and boundaries). The male-focused ones would be Himeros Project. So answer: Himeros Project.

16. **Question 16:** Which program includes three meals and starts at $149 per night with "naming your desire"? The Kripalu retreats start at $299 for programs, accommodations at $149. The "Love, Sex and Intimacy" retreat by Linda Bloom includes "naming your desire" as per the retreat's description: "group discussions on topics like power dynamics and boundaries, naming your desire, and obstacles to pleasure." Wait, the "naming your desire" is part of Back to the Body's retreat? Wait the question says "naming your desire" is part of the program. The article says Back to the Body's retreat includes group discussions on "power dynamics and boundaries, naming your desire, and obstacles to pleasure." Also, Kripalu's Linda Bloom's retreat is "Love, Sex and Intimacy" which includes those topics? The article says "Back to the Body's eight-day immersion offers... group discussions on topics like power dynamics and boundaries, naming your desire, and obstacles to pleasure." So "naming your desire" is part of Back to the Body's program, but their accommodations are $10,500. The Kripalu's accommodations start at $149 and include three meals. The question is which program's pricing includes three meals and starts at $149 for accommodations, and also offers workshops on "naming your desire". The Kripalu's Linda Bloom's retreat (Love, Sex and Intimacy) does include "naming your desire" as per the article? Wait, the article says the Back to the Body retreat has that topic. The Kripalu's "Love, Sex and Intimacy" retreat is led by Linda Bloom and includes "naming your desire" as part of their offerings? The article says: "Back to the Body's eight-day immersion... group discussions on topics like power dynamics and boundaries, naming your desire, and obstacles to pleasure." So the "naming your desire" is part of Back to the Body's program, but their accommodation is part of the $10,500 package. The Kripalu's "Love, Sex and Intimacy" retreat's description mentions "experiential exercises to explore intimacy and sensual pleasure" but not "naming your desire". However, the article says the group retreat at Kripalu (the "Love, Sex and Intimacy") includes those topics? Wait, the article says: "the retreat offers experiential exercises to explore intimacy and sensual pleasure. 'We define sexual happiness...'" So maybe the answer is Back to the Body, but their accommodation is part of the retreat cost, not separate. The question asks for a program that includes three meals and starts at $149 per night for accommodations. That's Kripalu's. The "naming your desire" is part of Back to the Body's program, so Kripalu's might not have it. Hmm. Wait the article says the Back to the Body retreat includes those topics, but the Kripalu's "Love, Sex and Intimacy" retreat (Oct 24-26) is led by Linda Bloom and includes "experiential exercises to explore intimacy and sensual pleasure" but the exact wording about "naming your desire" is from Back to the Body. So perhaps the answer is N/A because the program with three meals and $149 is Kripalu, but their retreat doesn't mention "naming your desire". Alternatively, maybe the "Love, Sex and Intimacy" retreat at Kripalu does include that, but it's not stated. The article says "Back to the Body's eight-day immersion... group discussions on topics like power dynamics and boundaries, naming your desire, and obstacles to pleasure." So the correct program with "naming your desire" is Back to the Body, but their accommodation isn't $149. The question is asking for a program that includes "naming your desire" and has the $149 accommodation. Since only Back to the Body has the topic but not the price, and Kripalu has the price but not the topic, the answer is N/A.

Wait, the article says the Kripalu "Love, Sex and Intimacy" retreat includes "exercises to explore intimacy and sensual pleasure" but the specific "naming your desire" is only in Back to the Body's retreat. So the answer must be N/A.

17. **Question 17:** Maximum group size at Costa Rica retreat exploring obstacles to pleasure? The Blue Spirit retreat in Costa Rica allows up to 140 participants. The question refers to the retreat that uses experiential exercises to explore obstacles to pleasure. The article mentions Back to the Body's retreat has up to 12 women, but that's in Joshua Tree. The Costa Rica retreat by Perel at Blue Spirit has up to 140. The group exploring obstacles to pleasure is part of Back to the Body's retreat? No, the question specifies the Costa Rica retreat. The Blue Spirit retreat's program includes exploring obstacles to pleasure as part of their topics? The article says Perel's program delves into why great sex fades, safety, etc., and the retreat includes group discussions on those topics. The question is about the Costa Rica retreat (Blue Spirit) which has up to 140 participants. So the answer is 140.

18. **Question 18:** Retreat leader offering May 2025 workshop on "embodied consent". The article mentions Amina Peterson leads "Authentic Consent: An Intimate Weekend..." from July 11-13. The May workshop is Victor Warring's "The Rewilding of Eros" in May 30- June 1. The question asks which leader offers a May 2025 workshop on "embodied consent". The "embodied consent" is part of Amina Peterson's July workshop. The May workshop by Victor Warring is about rewilding, not embodied consent. So the answer is N/A.

Wait, the question says "which retreat leader mentioned in the article also offers a workshop in May 2025 focused on 'embodied consent'..." The article says Amina Peterson's workshop is in July, and Victor Warring's is in May. But the May one is Victor's "Rewilding of Eros", which uses movement and touch to explore the erotic body. The "embodied consent" is in Amina's July workshop. The question is about a May workshop on embodied consent. Since Victor's May workshop isn't about that, the answer is N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Total cost of eight-day retreat with erotic touch techniques improving assertiveness? Back to the Body's eight-day retreat starts at $10,500. So answer: $10,500.

20. **Question 20:** Which SHA location combines endocrinology with meditation for erectile dysfunction? The article says SHA's programs combine Western medicine (including endocrinology) with ancient practices like yoga and meditation. The erectile dysfunction treatments are mentioned for men. The locations are Spain and Mexico. The question asks which location offers this. The article doesn't specify which location does, but since both have the same setup, the answer could be either. But the question might expect both. However, since it's a question expecting one answer, perhaps it's either. The article says "both locations recently opened sexual health units..." So the answer is both, but since the question asks for a specific location, maybe the answer is "SHA Wellness (Mexico and Spain)" but the options are the destinations listed. The question might accept either. The article doesn't specify, so perhaps N/A? Wait the question says "which SHA Wellness location", so either Costa Mujeres (Mexico) or Spain. Since both do, but the question requires one, maybe N/A. Alternatively, the answer is SHA Wellness, but the question specifies a location. Since the article says both, perhaps the answer is both, but since the question is singular, maybe N/A. Alternatively, the article says "the philosophy at SHA Wellness... locations on the Mediterranean coast in Spain, and the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico." So both locations have the same, so either is correct. The question might accept either, but since the user wants an exact answer, perhaps the answer is "SHA Wellness in Spain or Mexico". But the question probably expects one. Since the article doesn't differentiate, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait the question says "which SHA Wellness location", so since both do it, but the question requires one, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, the answer is "both locations", but the question expects one. Hmm. The article states that both locations have the sexual health units offering the same treatments. Since the question asks for the location, but both qualify, but the options are separate entries, perhaps the answer is "SHA Wellness (Spain and Mexico)", but in the context of the article, maybe the correct answer is the Mexico location because it's mentioned first? Not sure. Alternatively, the article says "endocrinology treatments" are part of the SHA programs, so the answer is SHA Wellness (either location). But the question asks for the location, so maybe "Costa Mujeres, Mexico" or "Alicante, Spain". Since the question is part of the list, maybe the answer is one of them. But since the article doesn't specify one, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, since the question mentions "ancient healing practices like meditation", and SHA's description includes that, the answer is either location. Since the question is about erectile dysfunction treatment combining endocrinology and meditation, the answer is SHA Wellness (either location). Since the question requires a specific answer, perhaps the answer is N/A because it's not specified which location does it. Wait the question is about "combining endocrinology treatments with ancient healing practices like meditation for erectile dysfunction". The article states that both locations do this. So the answer is either, but the question asks for "which SHA Wellness location", so it's ambiguous. Since the question might expect one, but the article mentions both, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, the correct answer is "SHA Wellness" as the retreat, but the question specifies a location. Hmm, this is tricky. Let me proceed with "SHA Wellness (Mexico or Spain)" but since the user requires a single answer, perhaps it's N/A. Alternatively, the answer is "SHA Wellness" but the question specifies location, so N/A.

Wait the question says "which SHA Wellness location offers a sexual health unit combining endocrinology treatments with ancient healing practices like meditation for erectile dysfunction?" The answer is both locations do, but since the question requires a specific one, perhaps the answer is N/A because the article doesn't single out one. Alternatively, the answer is "both locations", but the user might expect one. Since the article mentions both, but the question is singular, perhaps N/A.

Now compiling all answers:

1. N/A

20. N/A (since both locations do it but question requires one, or perhaps "SHA Wellness" but the answer must be a destination. Alternatively, the article might have a specific mention, but I don't see it. The answer is N/A)

Wait for question 20, the article says both locations have the same, so the question might expect either. Since the question asks for a specific location, but the article doesn't differentiate, the answer is N/A.

Let me confirm each again quickly.

11. Victor Warring's retreat in Costa Rica with Afro Flow? No, Afro Flow is at Blue Spirit in Costa Rica with Perel. Victor is in Big Sur. So N/A.

12. SHA Wellness (either location).

13. Kripalu.

14. Dance (since the retreat includes that, but Juliana didn't mention it).

15. Himeros Project.

17. 140 (Blue Spirit's Costa Rica retreat).
