Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information given in the article and follow the strict instructions. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question asks about the percentage of U.S. adults with chronic kidney disease caused by Type 1 diabetes that Dr. Gough cites as benefiting. Wait, the article mentions that Type 2 diabetes is a leading cause, and Dr. Gough said roughly 40% of people with Type 2 diabetes will develop chronic kidney disease. But the question specifies Type 1. Since the article doesn't mention Type 1, the answer should be N/A.

2. The second question is about a clinical trial led by Dr. Hoenig that showed a 30% reduction in kidney transplants. The article says Dr. Hoenig prescribes Ozempic but doesn't mention her leading a specific trial with those exact numbers. The study cited in the article showed a 24% lower likelihood of complications. So this specific trial isn't mentioned, so N/A.

3. The third question asks for a blood pressure medication that works synergistically with Ozempic. The article lists medications for blood pressure, sugar, cholesterol, etc., but doesn't name any specific drug or mention a synergistic effect. So N/A.

4. The fourth question is about the minimum threshold of cardiovascular mortality reduction required by the FDA. The article states the F.D.A. based approval on a 24% lower likelihood of complications, but doesn't specify a minimum threshold. So N/A.

5. The fifth question is about a vitamin deficiency caused by Ozempic's interaction. The article mentions managing iron, calcium, and vitamin D levels in patients, but doesn't link Ozempic to a deficiency. So N/A.

6. The sixth question asks how many years of data Novo submitted. The article mentions Dr. Gough's comments but doesn't specify the number of years. N/A.

7. The seventh question about a genetic marker isn't mentioned in the text. N/A.

8. The eighth question asks for a competing drug that failed due to liver toxicity. The article doesn't name any other drugs or their trial failures. N/A.

9. The ninth question is about the number of U.S. adults on Ozempic for off-label weight loss. The article mentions a shortage but not the exact number. N/A.

10. The tenth question asks for the surname of the Novo executive who talked about minimal progress. The article says Dr. Stephen Gough made that comment. So the answer is Gough.

11. The eleventh question asks the percentage reduction in complications like dialysis. The article states a 24% lower likelihood. So 24%.

12. The twelfth question is about the biological process beyond blood sugar. The article suggests reduced inflammation in the kidneys. So inflammation reduction.

13. The thirteenth question about the compound in shortage. The FDA lists semaglutide. So semaglutide.

14. The fourteenth question on non-pharmacological approaches. The article mentions lifestyle changes like diet and exercise. So diet and exercise modifications.

15. The fifteenth question about the proportion of Type 2 patients developing kidney disease. The article says roughly 40%. So 40%.

16. The sixteenth question asks which intervention is less needed. The article mentions reduced need for dialysis or transplant. So dialysis or kidney transplant.

17. The seventeenth question on lifestyle interventions. Same as question 14, so diet and exercise.

18. The eighteenth question about another health issue lessened. The article mentions cardiovascular death risk. So cardiovascular issues or cardiovascular problems.

19. The nineteenth question about the federal agency. The FDA approved the expanded use. So FDA.

Let me double-check each to ensure accuracy. For question 11, the 24% is correct. For 18, the article says "less likely to die from cardiovascular issues," so cardiovascular problems. All others seem to align with the text. I'll format the answers now.
