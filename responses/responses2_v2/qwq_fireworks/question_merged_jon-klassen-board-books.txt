Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article. 

1. **How many pages long is Sandra Boynton's "Hippos Go Berserk!"?**
   - The article mentions that "Hippos Go Berserk!" is a board book. The text says original board books are often shorter than picture books (which are ~32 pages). But it doesn't specify the exact page count for this book. So, answer N/A.

2. **Conflict resolved in "Spring Is Here"?**
   - The article states that "Spring Is Here" has no plot, premise, hero, or villain. So, there's no conflict resolved. Answer N/A.

3. **Title of book with conflict resolution after imaginary child feedback?**
   - The author talks about picture books having a beginning/middle/end with resolved conflict. His own books like "This Is Not My Hat" might fit, but the question specifies after the imaginary child stopped yelling. The article mentions his new board books like "Your Island," but those don't have traditional conflict. The answer might be N/A since the example given is "Spring Is Here" which doesn't resolve conflict. Wait, the question is about the author's own book. The article says after the process, he made board books but those don't have conflict. The initial books (like "This Is Not My Hat") do have conflict. But the question says "after the imaginary child stopped yelling" which is part of the process for picture books. The answer might be N/A as the author's new board books don't have conflict.

4. **Title where Boynton uses plot with problem?**
   - The article says Boynton's books don't need a plot or problem. So answer N/A.

5. **Height of Taro Gomi's board books?**
   - The article says board books are smaller than picture books (10-12 inches). But doesn't specify exact inches. So N/A.

6. **Profession author compares himself to after writing?**
   - "You feel like a poet." So poet.

7. **Han Kang's book exploring trauma?**
   - The article mentions "We Do Not Part" as her latest novel, which delves into remembering atrocities. So that's the title.

8. **Name of prosecutor's book that's 77 pages?**
   - The article says Rusty Sabich is in a new case in "Presumed Guilty." It doesn't mention page count. The question says the book is 77 pages, but the article says Scott Turow is 75, Rusty is 77. The question is about the book's page count, which isn't stated. So N/A.

9. **Podcast where Scott Turow discusses "Presumed Guilty"?**
   - The article mentions "The Book Review Podcast" where authors talk about news. It doesn't say Turow is on it specifically. So N/A.

10. **Nnedi Okorafor's book about atrocities?**
    - The article says Okorafor's latest is an autobiographical novel exploring a traumatic event. The question mentions a book delving into remembering atrocities, which is Han Kang's "We Do Not Part". So N/A for Okorafor's book title here.

11. **Theme of "Your Ocean" by Jon Klassen?**
    - The article doesn't mention "Your Ocean". It mentions "Your Island", "Your Forest", "Your Farm". So N/A.

12. **Pages in "Hippos Go Berserk!" given 32-page format?**
    - Board books are shorter than picture books (32 pages). But exact number isn't given. So N/A.

13. **Collaborator with Sandra Boynton?**
    - The article doesn't mention Jon Klassen collaborating with Boynton. So N/A.

14. **Feedback from imaginary baby?**
    - The baby doesn't give as much feedback as the older child. The question asks for the mechanism. The baby's note says they don't care about stories, so the feedback is their indifference. The answer is "N/A" since the text says the baby doesn't give much feedback, not specifying a mechanism.

15. **Gomi's book with non-linear timeline?**
    - "Spring Is Here" is described as a circular lullaby bending time. So that's the title.

16. **Dimensions of board books vs picture books?**
    - The article says board books are smaller in dimension than 10-12 inches. But exact numbers not given. So N/A.

17. **Author using allegory for Korea's trauma?**
    - Han Kang is mentioned as exploring South Korea's historic wounds. So her name is Han Kang, but the question asks for the author's name. The answer is Han Kang.

18. **Narrative device in "Hippos Go Berserk!"?**
    - The article says Boynton uses emotional/energetic rise and fall without plot. The device might be rhythm or music, since she's a songwriter. The answer is "N/A" since the exact device isn't named, but the question might expect "rhythm" or "music". Wait, the article says "board books can behave more like songs than stories". So the device is "song-like rhythm" or "music". But the exact term used is "rhythmically or tonally" but the answer should be what's stated. The article says "emotional, energetic rise and fall without needing a plot". The question asks for the device. The article says she uses rhythm (since she's a songwriter). The answer might be "rhythm", but the exact term from the text is "emotional, energetic rise and fall".

19. **Primary difference in audience engagement?**
    - The baby's note says they don't care about stories/plots. So the difference is board books engage without those elements. The answer is "engagement minute to minute without stories/plots".

20. **Novelist with legal dramas like Klassen's board books?**
    - The article mentions Scott Turow's "Presumed Guilty" with Rusty Sabich. So Scott Turow.

Wait, let me recheck each:

1. N/A (page count not stated)
2. N/A (no conflict)
3. N/A (the author's own books with conflict are older, but the new board books don't have conflict)
4. N/A (Boynton's books don't use plot with problem)
5. N/A (size not given)
6. poet
7. "We Do Not Part"
8. N/A (page count not stated)
9. N/A (podcast not linked to Turow specifically)
10. N/A (Okorafor's book is autobiographical trauma, not about atrocities remembered. The question might be a mix-up. The article says Han Kang's book delves into why atrocities must be remembered. So the Okorafor's book is different. So answer N/A for Okorafor's title here)
11. N/A (no "Your Ocean" mentioned)
12. N/A
13. N/A
14. The baby doesn't give feedback except the note, so the feedback mechanism is "N/A" as the text says the baby didn't give much feedback, not specifying a mechanism. The answer is "N/A".
15. "Spring Is Here"
16. N/A (dimensions not specified)
17. Han Kang
18. The article says "emotional, energetic rise and fall without needing a plot or problem". So the device is "emotional/energetic rise and fall" but the question asks for the narrative device. The answer might be "rhythm" as she's a songwriter, but the exact term from text is "emotional, energetic rise and fall". So answer "emotional, energetic rise and fall".
19. The difference is board books don't use stories/plots. The baby's note says they don't care about those, so the primary difference is engagement without classical elements. The answer is "engagement without stories/plots".
