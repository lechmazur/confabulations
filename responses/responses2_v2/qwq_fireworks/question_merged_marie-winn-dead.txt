Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions that Pale Male settled at 927 Fifth Avenue, a 12-story building where Mary Tyler Moore lived. So the answer is 927 Fifth Avenue.

2. **Question 2:** Marie Winn was born as Marie Wienerova. The article states she was born on October 21, 1936. So the year is 1936.

3. **Question 3:** Pale Male arrived in Central Park in 1991, and the nest controversy was in December 2004. Subtracting 1991 from 2004 gives 13 years. Wait, the question says "how many years elapsed between Pale Maleâ€™s first appearance and the controversy in December?" So 2004 minus 1991 is 13 years.

4. **Question 4:** The text says Pale Male vacationed at Woody Allen's penthouse terrace. So the director is Woody Allen.

5. **Question 5:** The 2008 book is "Central Park in the Dark: More Mysteries of Urban Wildlife."

6. **Question 6:** The book criticizing TV as a "dependency" is "The Plug-in Drug: Television, Children, and the Family."

7. **Question 7:** Chocolate died in a collision on the New Jersey Turnpike. So the mate is Chocolate.

8. **Question 8:** Her original surname was Wienerova, and she was born in Prague. So the city is Prague.

9. **Question 9:** She expressed her anger on NPR's "All Things Considered."

10. **Question 10:** The letters to the editor were in The New York Times, mentioning the comparison to a landmark.

Wait, let me double-check each point.

For question 3, the arrival was 1991, the controversy in 2004. 2004-1991 is indeed 13 years. So that's correct.

All others seem directly from the text. No need for N/A here since all answers are present.
