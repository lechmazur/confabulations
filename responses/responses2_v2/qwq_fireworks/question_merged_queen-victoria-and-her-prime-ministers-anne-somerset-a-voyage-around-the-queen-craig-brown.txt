Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks about Prince Albert's political ideology that mirrors Benjamin Franklin's quote on monarchy. The article mentions Albert had "liberal sympathies," like his role in the Society for the Extinction of the Slave Trade. Franklin's quote supports monarchy, but the question links Albert's ideology to Franklin's sentiment. Wait, Franklin's quote is about people's inclination towards kings, but the question is about Albert's ideology. Maybe the answer is "liberal" since that's his stated ideology. But Franklin's quote isn't about ideology, so maybe the connection is that both support monarchy? Hmm, maybe the question is a bit tricky. The answer should be "liberal" as per the text.

2. **Question 2**: The letter from Queen Elizabeth about a corgi's death. The article says when a corgi died, someone wrote a condolence letter and she replied with a six-page letter. The question specifies the corgi that bit Prince Philip, but the article mentions a corgi's death leading to her six-page reply. It doesn't specify which corgi, so maybe the answer is "six pages".

3. **Question 3**: The Cambridge chancellor who gave Derrida an honorary degree. The article mentions Prince Philip was chancellor, and during the year Derrida got the degree, someone noted his comment about deconstruction. So the answer is "Prince Philip".

4. **Question 4**: What made Victoria think of moving to Australia? The text says she was "tempted to go off to Australia â€” there to ignore all" due to the strain of duties, especially after Albert's death. So the answer is "the strain of her duties".

5. **Question 5**: The prime minister whose "camp sycophancy" was like Melbourne's influence. The article says Disraeli used "camp sycophancy" to win Victoria over, similar to how Melbourne initially influenced her. So answer is "Disraeli".

6. **Question 6**: Event in Crimean War causing distress to the monarch in "Bloody Panico!". The article mentions Victoria's distress over the Crimean War when Palmerston was PM. The book "Bloody Panico!" is by Wheatcroft, but the question refers to the monarch in that book. Since the article's author wrote "Bloody Panico!", the monarch might be Victoria. The distress was from Palmerston's policies during the war. But the question is about the event causing distress. The article says Albert deplored Palmerston's policies during the Crimean War. The event causing Victoria's distress was likely Palmerston becoming PM during the war. The exact event? The text says "when he became prime minister during the Crimean War" caused distress. So the answer is "Lord Palmerston becoming prime minister during the Crimean War".

7. **Question 7**: Literary device in Craig Brown's account and Sylvia Plath's 1955 account. The article says Brown's book uses "reception history" and Plath wrote "The queen looked quietly radiant". The device here might be "repetition" since both use similar phrases. The question mentions Craig's example of his grandmother's meeting and Plath's account using the same phrases. The device is "stock phrases" or "repetition of phrases". The answer is "repetition of stock phrases".

8. **Question 8**: Title of Wheatcroft's book on Victoria's political turmoil. The article mentions Somerset's book "Victoria and Her Prime Ministers" and asks for Wheatcroft's similar one. But Wheatcroft's own work is mentioned as "Bloody Panico!", but that's about the Tory Party. Wait, the question says "mirroring the themes in Anne Somerset's work". Since Somerset's is about Victoria and PMs, maybe Wheatcroft's isn't that. Wait, the initial article's first paragraph says Wheatcroft is the author of "Bloody Panico!" but the two books discussed are Somerset's and Craig Brown's. The user's question 8 asks for Wheatcroft's book that mirrors Somerset's themes. But the article doesn't mention another book by Wheatcroft except "Bloody Panico!". Since the user might have a mistake, but according to the article, the answer is N/A. Wait, the user's question says "the title of the book written by Geoffrey Wheatcroft that explored the political turmoil during Queen Victoria's reign, mirroring the themes in Anne Somerset's work?" The article says Somerset's book is about Victoria and her PMs. Wheatcroft's own book isn't mentioned as about Victoria. The only other book mentioned by Wheatcroft is "Bloody Panico!", which is about the Tory Party. So the answer is N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Deconstruction theory aspect linked to Amin and Ceausescu. The article mentions the Duke of Edinburgh's comment that his family was "deconstructing" after Derrida's honorary degree. Deconstruction theory involves breaking down structures. The actions of Amin and Ceausescu (tyrants) might relate to destabilizing or undermining, so the answer is "deconstruction of structures" or "breaking down existing structures". The question asks what aspect of deconstruction theory was reflected in their interactions. Since Derrida's theory is about deconstructing meaning, but the Duke's comment was about his family's breakdown, maybe the answer is "deconstruction of familial or institutional structures".
