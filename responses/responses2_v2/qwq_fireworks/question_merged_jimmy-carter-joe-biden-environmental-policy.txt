Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article provided. 

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which specific environmental legislation from Carter's era Reagan completely repealed. Scanning the article, it mentions Reagan undoing many of Carter's policies but doesn't specify a single repealed law. It lists Carter's laws like the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, National Energy Act, Energy Security Act, and Superfund. However, the article says Reagan "worked to undo many of Carter's legislative accomplishments" but doesn't state any were completely repealed. The Clean Water Act veto was overridden, so that wasn't repealed. So the answer is N/A because there's no specific law mentioned as completely repealed.

2. **Question 2:** The solar panels on the White House under Carter. The article says they were "crude and inefficient by today's standards, and powerful enough only to run a water heater." There's no mention of megawatts generated. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Percentage of EPA enforcement actions eliminated in Reagan's first 100 days. The article states "the agency's enforcement actions plummeted" but doesn't give a specific percentage. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Carter's national monument in Arizona converted back to commercial use. The article mentions Carter created the Grand Canyon National Monument. Reagan wanted to exploit public lands, but does it say he converted that specific one? It says he opened areas to drilling, logging, etc., but the exact monument name? The article says "Grand Canyon National Monument" but maybe it's a different name now? Wait, the Grand Canyon was already a national monument before Carter, but the article says Carter created several new ones, including that. However, the article doesn't state that Reagan converted it back. It mentions the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, but that's in Alaska. The answer might be N/A because the article doesn't specify that the Grand Canyon monument was reversed.

5. **Question 5:** Total dollar amount of renewable energy tax credits eliminated from the National Energy Act of 1978. The article says Reagan "eliminated a tax break for wind installations" but doesn't specify the amount. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Number of Superfund sites cleaned up during Carter's presidency. Superfund was created in 1980 under Carter, but the article doesn't mention how many were cleaned up during his term. It says Reagan mismanaged it. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Environmental measure Anne Gorsuch implemented that strengthened Carter's policies. The article says Gorsuch pushed to weaken the Clean Air Act, so she didn't strengthen. The answer is N/A since she weakened, not strengthened.

8. **Question 8:** Annual carbon reduction from Carter's fuel standards before rollback. The article mentions Reagan rolled back fuel economy standards but doesn't give the carbon reduction number. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Acres of Alaska wilderness opened to drilling under Reagan's changes. The article states Carter's Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act protected over 100 million acres. Reagan tried to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which is part of that, but the exact acreage isn't given here. The article doesn't specify how much was opened, so N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Percentage of DoE clean energy funding remaining after Reagan's cuts. The article says federal research budgets were "slashed" but doesn't give a percentage. So N/A.
