Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Material for Jacques Monneraud's ceramics**: The article mentions Monneraud references classical Chinese, Iranian, and Guatemalan forms. The question asks for the material reminiscent of artisanal tiles. Wait, the artisanal tiles are in the Brach Madrid's cafe. But the question is about Monneraud's work. The article says he uses stoneware that looks like cardboard. The answer might be cardboard, but the question is about the material used for his latest pieces. The tiles are in the hotel, but the answer is about Monneraud's material. The article says he mimics cardboard, so maybe the answer is "cardboard".

2. **Cheese for Elena Liao's collaboration**: Win Son uses Parmesan, and Caffe Panna added grana Padano. The article mentions grana Padano in the sundae. So if they collaborate, maybe grana Padano is the other cheese.

3. **Inspiration for Camacho's work**: The Macroplaza was the original commission. The later installation was in a pool. The aspect besides the square could be the water or pool, but the question is about inspiration. The text says he used water in the exhibition. Maybe "water" but the article says he used vulcanized canvas and references the tarps over market stalls. Hmm, the question is what aspect of the Macroplaza besides the square? The article mentions the swimming pool installation, so maybe the swimming pool?

4. **Number of Buns of Steel tapes**: The article says "the complete 'Buns of Steel' workout series on VHS". But it doesn't specify how many tapes. Since it's a complete series, maybe the answer is "N/A" because the exact number isn't given.

5. **Frozen dinner aesthetic like Monneraud's ceramics**: Monneraud's ceramics look like cardboard. The frozen dinners in Shih's exhibit are on a microwave. The question is what frozen dinner would match the cardboard aesthetic. The article mentions "frozen dinners -- one for each member..." but doesn't specify the type. Maybe "cardboard boxes" but the answer should be a frozen dinner product. Since it's about aesthetic, maybe "boxed frozen dinners" but the exact product isn't mentioned. So N/A?

6. **Lighting fixtures inspired by Shih's temptations**: Shih's exhibit includes cigarette butts and beer can as temptations. Starck might use those shapes in lighting. Maybe "cigarette-shaped" or "crushed beer can" fixtures. The article says "crushed beer can" is part of the exhibit. So maybe beer cans as lighting?

7. **Dessert inspired by za'atar sauce**: Te Company's approach uses pineapple and yuzu. Za'atar is a spice. Maybe a dessert with za'atar, like a cookie or cake. The article mentions linzer cookies. Maybe a za'atar-infused cookie with pineapple?

8. **Guatemalan form symbolizing the book**: The book is "Prisoner of My Desire". Monneraud references Guatemalan forms. The question asks which form symbolizes the book. The article doesn't specify, so N/A?

9. **Color of artisanal tiles**: The article says the cafe has "artisanal tiles" but doesn't mention color. N/A.

10. **Book reinterpreted as a library**: The article says "Divorce for Dummies" was rendered as part of a self-help library. So that's the answer.

11. **Vintage workout series**: The "Buns of Steel" VHS series is mentioned. So that's the answer.

12. **Spanish poet's portrait**: The Brach restaurant has portraits of Gabriel Garcia Lorca. So his name.

13. **Traditional treat reinvented**: The question is about the linzer cookie variant. The traditional is pineapple cake. The article says they created a linzer version of pineapple cake.

14. **Title of Camacho's work**: "Aquaplen o plano central flotante".

15. **Cardboard texture**: The article says "slightly grainy texture and mottled brown hue...resemble cardboard". So "cardboard".

16. **Chef explaining broth**: The article mentions chef Yann Nury.

17. **Exhibition end date**: Shih's exhibit is from Jan 22 to Feb 26. So Feb 26.

18. **Hotel designed by French designer**: Brach Madrid by Philippe Starck.

19. **Frozen food symbol**: The article says "frozen dinners -- one for each member of the titular 'Nuclear Family'".

Now, checking each answer against the text to confirm:

1. The question is about the material Monneraud uses for his latest pieces that are reminiscent of the artisanal tiles. Wait, the tiles are in the hotel's cafe, but the question links to Monneraud's work. The article says he mimics cardboard, so the material is stoneware that looks like cardboard. The artisanal tiles are tiles, but the question is about the material he used. The answer is "cardboard" since he mimics that.

2. Win Son uses Parmesan, and Caffe Panna used grana Padano. So the cheese would be grana Padano.

3. The Macroplaza's aspect besides the square: the installation was in a pool, so maybe "swimming pool" but the question is about inspiration. The article says the tarps over market stalls inspired the colored vinyl. But the question is about Macroplaza's other aspect. Since the work was first in the square and then in a pool, maybe the pool is part of the Macroplaza? The answer might be "swimming pool".

4. The number of Buns of Steel tapes isn't given, so N/A.

5. The frozen dinner is on a microwave, but the article doesn't specify type. N/A.

6. The temptations include cigarette butts. Maybe lighting shaped like cigarettes? Or beer cans. The article says "crushed beer can", so maybe beer can-shaped lights.

7. Za'atar sauce is from the Brach's menu. Te Company's approach uses pineapple and yuzu. A dessert could be a cookie with za'atar and pineapple. The article mentions "linzer cookie composed of pineapple jam and yuzu kosho". Maybe za'atar-infused linzer cookies?

8. The question is about a Guatemalan form that symbolizes the book. No info, so N/A.

9. Tiles' color: not mentioned, N/A.

10. "Divorce for Dummies".

11. "Buns of Steel".

12. Gabriel Garcia Lorca.

13. Pineapple cake.

14. "Aquaplen o plano central flotante".

15. Cardboard.

16. Yann Nury.

17. Feb 26.

18. Brach Madrid.

19. Frozen dinners (the product is just "frozen dinners" as per the article).
