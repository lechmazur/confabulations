Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each question strictly based on that. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks which Republican senator changed their position after a personal letter from their daughter, similar to the 1920 Tennessee legislator. The article mentions the 1920 story of a legislator influenced by his mother. However, the article doesn't mention any senator receiving a letter from their daughter. The closest is Trump's involvement lifting a hold, but no specific senator's name is given for that. So, answer is N/A.

2. The article states that Anna Laymon was told she was asking for too much, even for one acre. It says she requested one acre but was told it was too much. So the initial request was one acre. Answer is 1.

3. The cost of moving the 1921 sculpture from the closet to upstairs in 1997 isn't mentioned. The article only mentions the move happened, not the cost. So N/A.

4. The question is about which First Lady chose Constitution Gardens. The article mentions Laymon hopes it will be placed there but doesn't name a First Lady involved in that decision. So N/A.

5. The fundraising goal is $80 million, but the article doesn't state how much has been achieved. So N/A.

6. The question asks which Democratic senator proposed combining the monument with the Latino museum. The article mentions the Smithsonian wants new museums for women and Latinos on the Mall, but no specific senator proposed combining them. So N/A.

7. The Park Service required a special exception. The article says they dropped opposition and supported the exception. The process needed a new law, so the modification was a legislative exception. The answer is a legislative exception (but need exact wording). The article says "the first time it has supported an exception to the ban on new monuments on the Mall." So the required modification was a legislative exception. Answer: legislative exception.

Wait, the question is about what modifications the Park Service required to their standard process. The article says the Park Service had a blanket opposition but then dropped it. The exception was due to legislation, not a procedural change by the Park Service. The answer might be N/A since the Park Service didn't modify their process but supported an exception via law. Hmm. The article says the Park Service wrote that supporters demonstrated the exception warranted. So maybe the modification was a waiver or exception via legislation. The answer is "exception to the 2003 ban via legislation" but the question asks what the Park Service required. Since the Park Service's own process required a legislative act, perhaps the answer is that they required a legislative exception. But the question is about modifications to their standard process. The article states the Park Service had a blanket opposition, so their standard is no new monuments. To accommodate, the exception needed a law. Therefore, the Park Service didn't change their process but allowed an exception through the law. The answer might be N/A because the Park Service didn't modify their own process but supported the legislative exception. Alternatively, the required modification is the legislative act. But the question is about what the Park Service required. Since the article says the Park Service dropped opposition but the law was needed, maybe the answer is "N/A" because the Park Service didn't change their own process but supported the exception via the law. Hmm, tricky. Let me check again. The article says "the first time it has supported an exception to the ban on new monuments on the Mall." So the Park Service's own policy required a legislative exception. So the modification was that the Park Service supported the exception, but the actual change was legislative. The question is about what the Park Service required. Since the Park Service required the legislative exception, but the question is about their process. Maybe the answer is that they required a legislative exception. But the question says "modifications to their standard approval process". Since their standard process was no new monuments, the modification was allowing this via legislation. So perhaps the answer is "legislative exception". But the exact wording in the article is that the Park Service dropped opposition and supported the exception. The required modification would be the legislative act. The question is about the Park Service's process. Since the Park Service's policy was to not allow new monuments, the modification was that they allowed this one via the law. So maybe the answer is "exception to the 2003 ban through legislation" but the question asks what the Park Service required. Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A because the Park Service didn't change their process but the law did. I'm a bit stuck here, but given the instructions, if the article doesn't specify a process change by the Park Service beyond legislative approval, then N/A might be better. Let me proceed and come back if time.

8. The question is about corporate donors who pledged seed funding. The article doesn't mention any corporate donors. So N/A.

9. Susan B. Anthony's great-granddaughter's role. The article mentions Trump pardoning Susan B. Anthony, but no mention of her great-granddaughter's involvement. So N/A.

10. Number of rejected designs. The article says the design competition is upcoming (they haven't selected yet), so no rejected designs yet. Answer N/A.

11. Existing monument to be relocated. The article doesn't mention any existing monument needing to move. The 2003 law prohibits new construction, but the article says the suffrage monument got an exception. No mention of moving others. So N/A.

12. Percentage secured through Biden's executive order. The article mentions Biden's executive order but doesn't link it to fundraising. So N/A.

Now, going back to question 7. The Park Service's standard process is governed by the 2003 law which banned new monuments. The exception required legislation. The Park Service had a blanket opposition, but later supported the exception. The question is what modifications the Park Service required to their standard process. Since the standard process was no new monuments, the modification was allowing this through legislation. The Park Service's own process required the legislative exception. The article states that the Park Service "dropped its opposition" and supported the exception. So perhaps the modification was their approval, but the actual change was the law. The question is about the Park Service's process. Since the Park Service's policy required a legislative exception, but they supported it, maybe the answer is that they required legislative approval. But the question is about their own process modifications. Since the Park Service's process was already the law, they didn't modify their process but complied with the new law. Hence, N/A might be correct here. Alternatively, the answer is "legislative exception", but the Park Service didn't modify their own process, they just supported it. The article says "the first time it has supported an exception to the ban on new monuments on the Mall." So the modification was their support for an exception. But the question is about what they required. The Park Service's required modification was the legislative act. Since the question asks what the Park Service required, perhaps the answer is "N/A" because they didn't change their process but the law did. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that they required a legislative exception. But the question is about their own process. Since their standard process was governed by the law, the modification was the law itself. So the Park Service didn't change their process beyond complying with the new law. Therefore, the answer is N/A.
