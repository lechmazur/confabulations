Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. I need to be careful to answer each exactly as per the instructions, only using the text given and avoiding any outside knowledge. Let me start with the first question.

1. **In which Italian restaurant did Charles Wright have his epiphany about understanding Ezra Pound's Cantos?**  
The article mentions that Wright was living in Verona when he encountered the word "dodici" in Pound's Cantos, which referred to a well-known restaurant there. But the specific name isn't given. So the answer is N/A.

2. **How many years passed between Frost's first and second reading of the Emerson poem that initially confused him?**  
The article states Frost's first encounter was confusing, and 50 years later, he understood all but two lines. So the answer is 50.

3. **What was the name of the cat meme that combined Milton's Paradise Lost with Robert Lowell's poetry?**  
The meme is described as a hissing cat with "I MYSELF AM HELL," combining Lowell's line (from "Skunk Hour") and Milton's "Paradise Lost." The name of the meme isn't provided, so N/A.

4. **Which philosopher's lecture on wonder did Waldrep reference in his poem about Clare Priory?**  
The article says Waldrep referenced Heidegger's quote from "The Origin of the Work of Art." The philosopher is Heidegger.

5. **What was the title of Jennifer Chang's book that contained Longenbach's discussion of voice as metaphor?**  
Chang's collection is "An Authentic Life," as stated in the article.

6. **At what time of day did Catherine Barnett's conversation with Nicholson Baker about anthology preferences occur?**  
The poem starts with "At dinner I was seated next to him," so the time is dinner.

7. **What modernist poem's endnotes did the author find particularly helpful during their student years?**  
The article mentions "The Waste Land" and needing endnotes, so the answer is The Waste Land.

8. **What was the name of the group chat where the debate about proper placement of epigraphs took place?**  
The article refers to "my group chat" but doesn't name it, so N/A.

9. **How many stanzas appear in Barnett's poem before the revelation about her father's condition?**  
The father's condition is mentioned in the 17th stanza. The revelation comes before that, so the answer is 16 or fewer? Wait, the question is before the revelation. The 17th stanza mentions the father, so prior stanzas would be up to 16. But the exact count isn't given, so maybe N/A. Wait, the poem's 19th stanza has Goethe's words. The father is in the 17th. The question is how many stanzas before the revelation (the father's condition is revealed in 17th). So before stanza 17, there are 16 stanzas. But the article doesn't explicitly state the total number of stanzas. The answer might be N/A because it's not specified how many are before, but the 17th is when it's mentioned. Alternatively, maybe 16? Hmm. The article says "in the 17th stanza" so the number before would be 16. But since it's not stated, perhaps N/A. Wait, the question is how many stanzas appear in the poem before the revelation. Since the revelation is in the 17th, the answer is 16. But the article might not specify the total number. Wait, the article says "in the 17th stanza" so the count before would be 16. Let me check again. The article states: "her father is dying on the other coast, we learn, in the 17th stanza." So before stanza 17, there are 16 stanzas. So answer is 16.

10. **What was the name of the poetry collection by G.C. Waldrep that contained the Heidegger-influenced 'world worlding' reference?**  
The poem is "Some Lines Written in Clare Priory Yard," but the collection isn't named. So N/A.

11. **How many interior room door knockers did the novelist friend suggest were appropriate for a typical house, mirroring a book with epigraphs for individual poems?**  
The article uses the metaphor of a house with "every interior room has an ornate door knocker" as an example of too many epigraphs. The question asks how many the friend said were appropriate. The friend suggested putting epigraphs into the book itself, not as front matter. The number isn't specified, so N/A.

12. **In what year did Robert Frost write "The Prerequisites," outlining his method for iterative understanding of poetry?**  
The article doesn't mention the year Frost wrote it, so N/A.

13. **What specific restaurant in Maine, mentioned by Nicholson Baker during his dinner with the poet in "Solutions for the Problem of Bodies in Space," inspired Catherine Barnett to include Goethe's last words in her poem?**  
The article states Nicholson Baker is living in Maine, but the restaurant name isn't given. N/A.

14. **What was the title of the anthology that the poet in Catherine Barnett's poem was asked about by Nicholson Baker, prompting her reflections?**  
The question is about the anthology's title. The poem mentions "What's your favorite anthology?" but the title isn't provided. So N/A.

15. **According to Elisa Gabbert, what is the title of the work by Srikanth Reddy that influenced Waldrep's "world worlding"?**  
The article says Reddy's "The Unsignificant" includes Heidegger's quote, which Waldrep referenced. So the answer is The Unsignificant.

16. **What was the title of James Longenbach's book referenced in Jennifer Chang's poem?**  
The book is "How Poems Get Made," as mentioned in the text.

17. **What is the name of the hissing cat in the meme?**  
The meme's cat isn't named, so N/A.

18. **What was the original title of Ezra Pound's "The Cantos" containing "dodici"?**  
The collection is "The Cantos," so that's the title. The question asks for the original title, which is the same. So The Cantos.

19. **What was the name of the poem by Waldrep that inspired Reddy's quote?**  
The poem is "Some Lines Written in Clare Priory Yard," but the article says Waldrep's poem referenced Heidegger, and Reddy's work included the quote. So the question is reversed. The article states that Waldrep's poem had the Heidegger reference, and Reddy's work had the quote. So the question is asking which of Waldrep's poems inspired Reddy. But the article doesn't say Reddy was inspired by Waldrep; rather, Waldrep's poem used Heidegger, and Reddy's work had the quote. So maybe N/A.

20. **How many lines from Emerson's poem did Frost still not understand after 50 years?**  
The article says "all but two lines of it," so the answer is two.
