Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions a Japanese trade minister who wrote to Biden. Looking through the text, it says, "Takehiko Matsuo, a senior trade minister, wrote to Biden administration officials last month." The question is about the Cleveland-Cliffs deal, but the article refers to Nippon Steel's takeover of U.S. Steel. Wait, the question mentions Cleveland-Cliffs, but in the article, Cleveland-Cliffs is mentioned as a possible bidder if the Nippon Steel deal falls through. However, the trade minister's letter was about the Nippon Steel deal, not Cleveland-Cliffs. The question might have a typo, but I'll go with what's stated. The answer is Takehiko Matsuo.

2. **Question 2:** Musk's projection on autonomous taxis. The article states, "he has focused on what he says will be trillions of dollars in revenue from self-driving taxis..." So the answer is "trillions," but the question asks for "how many billions." Since "trillions" is mentioned, but the question specifies billions, maybe it's a trick. However, the exact figure isn't given in billions, so perhaps N/A? Wait, the article says "trillions," so if the question is in billions, it's over a thousand billion. But since the article doesn't convert it, maybe the answer is "N/A" because it's not specified in billions. Hmm.

3. **Question 3:** Fine on Meta leading to Nick Clegg's departure. The article doesn't mention a fine. It says Nick Clegg was leaving, but the reason given is his leftish politics and possibly planning his exit. No fine is referenced, so N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Supreme Court justice Joel Kaplan supported. The article says Joel Kaplan is a close friend of Kavanaugh and was present at his confirmation hearings. So the answer is Brett Kavanaugh.

5. **Question 5:** Tesla's delivery decline percentage. The article says deliveries "fell slightly in a growing market, the first annual decline in the company's history." But the exact percentage isn't given. Since it's not specified, the answer is N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Number of state attorneys general in the net neutrality lawsuit. The article doesn't mention how many states were involved, only that state laws in CA, WA, CO exist. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Nippon Steel's timeline for U.S. Steel upgrades. The article states U.S. Steel's CEO mentioned needing investment, but Nippon Steel's specific timeline isn't provided. CFIUS noted U.S. Steel's history of inadequate attempts, but no timeline from Nippon. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Highest returning hedge fund. The article lists funds with double-digit returns: Millennium, D.E. Shaw, Bridgewater, Citadel. But it doesn't specify which had the highest. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Tim Wu's role in Biden admin. The article says Tim Wu was a former Biden admin official who coined "net neutrality." His role isn't specified, so N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Zuckerberg's meeting timing vs. Kaplan's appointment. The article mentions Zuckerberg met Trump after the election, and Kaplan's appointment is mentioned in the context of Meta repositioning for the new admin. But no specific timeline relation is given. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Aerospace companies in China's restrictions. The article states China's Ministry of Commerce restricted "Boeing and Lockheed Martin." So those are the two.

12. **Question 12:** Economic theory challenged by Easterlin. The article mentions Easterlin's work challenged the idea that more money leads to more happiness. The theory is the "money buys happiness" assumption, so the answer is "more money always leads to more happiness" or the theory's name. The article refers to it as "the assumption that more money always leads to more happiness," so the answer is that exact phrase.
