Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions beyond what's written.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions Vanya (Bob Laine's interpretation) as a ball of pent-up frustration and an ugly drunk whom Yelena has to push away. So the answer should be Vanya. 

2. **Question 2:** The article says Gasda's version isn't like Andre Gregory's "Vanya on 42nd Street" which was a mise en abyme. Since the question is about Andre Gregory's role in influencing Gasda's adaptation, but the article states Gasda's is different, the answer might be N/A. Wait, the question is phrased as what role Andre Gregory played in Gasda's adaptation. The article doesn't say he was involved; instead, it contrasts Gasda's approach with Gregory's. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The article says Astrov sings "100,000 Fireflies" by Magnetic Fields. The question says Yelena performs it, but the text says Astrov does. So answer N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Annie Baker's 2012 production was claustrophobic, but Gasda's isn't using that. The article says Gasda's is straightforward. So no techniques incorporated. Answer N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The costumes are present-day but low key. The article doesn't specify social status differences between Astrov and the professor. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Gasda's earlier works like "Zoomers" focus on 21st-century urban milieus, but the article says this production is conventional. No mention of thematic callbacks. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The new translation by Aleksandrova isn't causing issues for purists. The article doesn't mention which character's portrayal was altered. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The location is Brooklyn Center in Greenpoint. The article doesn't explain symbolic meaning related to urban isolation. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The article says Gasda's setting a loft is different from Jack Serio's 2023 version. It mentions Gasda's own plays like "Zoomers" and "Doomers" as 21st-century urban works, but the connection to the loft setting isn't stated. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The translation didn't upset purists because Gasda adhered to the original. The criticism implied might be that it's too traditional. The question asks about criticism of the translation. The article says it won't send purists into a tizzy, so maybe the criticism is N/A, but the question is about what the article implies. Since adherence to original structure might mean the translation is conventional, the article doesn't state criticism, so N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The article mentions Blue Man Group's end and Fred Armisen's drumming gig, but doesn't connect it to the play's themes. N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Jon Robin Baitz's quote is given as "a drama about being driven insane..." The article attributes that quote to Baitz, not Andre Gregory. The question says the article attributes it to Andre Gregory's analysis, which isn't stated. So N/A.

13. **Question 13:** The article mentions no smartphones and no one scrolling Instagram, so the subplot isn't present. The question asks about a missed opportunity involving social media, but since it's absent, maybe the answer is N/A. Or the article says "seeds of interesting ideas not fully developed" but doesn't name which, so N/A.

14. **Question 14:** The article mentions Bernardo Ortiz as wardrobe consultant for this play, but no info on previous collaboration with Menzel. N/A.
