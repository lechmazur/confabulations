Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any external knowledge.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions that the Arctic route is about 40% shorter than the Suez Canal, not the Panama Canal. Robert O'Brien's quote refers to the Panama Canal, but the 40% figure is about the Suez. Wait, the question says "using the Panama Canal instead of the Arctic route". The article states the Arctic route is 40% shorter than Suez. Since the question is about Panama, but the text doesn't mention Panama's comparison, so maybe N/A?

Wait, let me check again. The article says: "navigating through the Arctic Sea from Western Europe to East Asia... about 40% shorter compared to sailing through the Suez Canal." The question asks about the Panama Canal. Since the article doesn't mention Panama in this context, the answer would be N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The closure of USAID is mentioned, but the question asks what new entity Denmark established. The article says Denmark published a report on Greenland's minerals, but there's no mention of a new Danish entity. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The text states "11,000 square miles... area roughly the size of Massachusetts." The question asks how many square miles smaller than Massachusetts that area is. Since it's "roughly the size," the difference isn't given. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The legal precedent for the lawsuits against CBS and Register? The article says experts think the lawsuits lack merit but are harassing. No mention of a legal precedent. N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Trump Jr.'s reason for visiting Greenland? The article says he was visiting, and Trump posted photos with "MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN." No stated reason given, so N/A unless it's implied by the context. Since the article doesn't state his reason, N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Trudeau mentioned a mineral abundant in Canada that Trump wants. The article says Canada's wealth of critical minerals are behind Trump's comments. But which specific mineral? The text mentions Canada's critical minerals in general. No specific mineral listed here. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The U.S. ally refusing territorial concessions. Denmark refused, as per the article. The question says "citing the need to protect the free world"â€”but actually Denmark rejected Trump's offer. The article says Denmark said Greenland isn't for sale, and Egede said it's their business. The ally is Denmark. But the question says "refused the offer of military assistance in exchange for..." Trump offered? Wait, Trump threatened tariffs, but the question's phrasing: "refused the offer of military assistance..." The article says Denmark rebuked the proposal. So answer is Denmark.

8. **Question 8**: Percentage increase in Arctic ship traffic attributed to Chinese activity in O'Brien's Fox interview. The article states ship traffic surged 37% over the past decade, but the 37% is from an Arctic Council report. The question asks what part was due to Chinese activity. The text mentions China and Russia working on routes, but no specific percentage. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Ice loss compared to Maryland instead of Massachusetts. The article says "roughly the size of Massachusetts." No mention of Maryland, so N/A.

10. **Question 10**: National Guard partnership with Greenland mentioned by Trump. The article doesn't mention any state's National Guard partnership. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Lithium reserves for Russian-Chinese projects. The article says minerals like lithium are essential for industries like batteries. The part about Russian-Chinese collaboration is mentioned in the context of shipping routes (China and Russia agreed to work on Arctic routes). But does it link lithium to their projects? The article doesn't explicitly state that. So N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Former official who said Suez vs Panama? O'Brien mentioned the Panama Canal in his quote. The article says O'Brien referred to the Panama Canal as a route that might be replaced. The question asks for someone contradicting the focus on Panama (since the article's main route was Suez vs Arctic). Wait, the article says O'Brien said the Arctic could be a pathway cutting down on Panama usage. So he was the one who mentioned Panama. The question is asking if someone else contradicted by mentioning Suez? No, the article's text has O'Brien talking about Panama. The article's own focus is on Suez, but O'Brien's quote is about Panama. The question is phrased as someone contradicting the article's focus (which was on Suez comparison). Wait, the article states that the 40% shorter is compared to Suez, but O'Brien's quote mentions Panama. The question is looking for someone who mentioned replacing Suez, but the article's focus was on Suez vs Arctic. Wait, the question says "which former Trump official claimed Greenland's value included replacing the Suez as primary trade route, contradicting the article's focus on Panama Canal?" Wait, the article's focus was on Suez. The question is perhaps mixing up. Let me recheck. The article says: "as the climate gets warmer, the Arctic is going to be a pathway that maybe cuts down on the usage of the Panama Canal." So O'Brien was talking about Panama. The article's main route comparison was Suez. The question is looking for someone who said Suez, but the article's O'Brien mentions Panama. The question is maybe a trick here. The article doesn't mention Suez being replaced, so if someone else said Suez, but the text doesn't have that. So N/A.

13. **Question 13**: Threshold of migrant detentions tied to Greenland's mineral timelines. The article mentions 10 migrants in Guantanamo and preparing a tent for 30,000, but no mention of this being tied to Greenland's mineral exploitation timelines. So N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Mute B. Egede rejected a specific mineral as justification. The article says Egede rejected the designs on Greenland, but doesn't mention any specific mineral he rejected. The 2023 report lists minerals, but Egede's speech didn't specify which. So N/A.

15. **Question 15**: Disbanded West Point club linked to Greenland's independence. The article mentions DEI: West Point ended clubs related to Trump's ban, but the article doesn't name any specific club focused on Arctic geopolitics. So N/A.
