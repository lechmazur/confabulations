Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each exactly as per the instructions. Let me start by going through each question and cross-referencing the article.

1. **Question 1**: The name of the Swiss-Italian real estate company. The article mentions that Morandi was the island's guardian hired by a Swiss-Italian real estate company. Wait, but does it actually name the company? Let me check again. Scanning through the relevant part: "hired by the Swiss-Italian real estate company that owned it." Hmm, no name given. So the answer must be N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Months tourists could visit the pink beach. The article says tourists are allowed only on certain paths as part of efforts to protect the pink sand. But does it specify months? I don't recall any mention of seasonal restrictions. The text doesn't state specific months, so N/A.

3. **Question 3**: How many books Morandi wrote before 2023. The article states "at least two books" were spawned by his life, including one with Rinaldis in 2023. So before 2023, at least one. But the question is asking for the exact number. The text says "at least two books, at least one song..." Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. The two books might include the 2023 one. Wait, the exact phrase is "spawned at least two books, at least one song..." So "at least two books"—so at least one before 2023? The 2023 one is with Rinaldis, so that's one. So before that, maybe one? But the article doesn't specify the exact number. Since it's "at least two", but we don't know how many he wrote alone. So the answer would be N/A because the exact number isn't given.

4. **Question 4**: Annual salary after 2016. The article says after 2016 when the park took over, he was asked to leave. It mentions he was paid initially but stayed even after no longer receiving a salary. So after 2016, he wasn't paid by the park. The question asks the salary from the national park after 2016, which would be N/A since he wasn't paid anymore.

5. **Question 5**: Environmental org behind the petition. The petition is mentioned as having nearly 75k signatures, but the article says "an online petition" without naming the organization. It just quotes the petition's text. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Previous caretaker's name. The text says in 1989, they met Budelli's caretaker who offered the job. But no name is given for this person. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Number of solar panels. The article mentions he used solar power to charge devices but doesn't specify the number of panels. Answer: N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Title of the song. The article mentions "at least one song" but doesn't name it. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: University department for the flora/fauna study. The study is by the University of Sassari, but the department isn't mentioned. Just the university name. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Average monthly visitors in final year. The article doesn't provide visitor numbers. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Name of the Modena-born individual. The article states Morandi was born in Modena, so the answer is Mauro Morandi.

12. **Question 12**: Name of the island with pink sand and WWII hut. That's Budelli.

13. **Question 13**: National park that required him to leave. Maddalena Archipelago National Park.

14. **Question 14**: Town he moved to. La Maddalena.

15. **Question 15**: Profession before solitude. He was a physical education teacher.

16. **Question 16**: Literary work that inspired him. "Jonathan Livingston Seagull" by Richard Bach.

17. **Question 17**: Ecological motive. The main motive was protecting the island's habitat from tourists and preserving its natural state. The text says his task was to protect the habitat from unruly tourists and that he cared about protecting Budelli because of its natural beauty.

18. **Question 18**: View about time and consumerism. He mentioned having a serene relationship with time and criticized consumerism and individualism. The quote: "He didn't like what humanity had become in the 21st century -- consumeristic and individualistic -- especially with regard to nature."

19. **Question 19**: Concern beyond building codes. The authorities cited medical emergency concerns. The article says "whether Mr. Morandi would be able to survive a medical emergency alone, not to mention his shack's failure to meet code."

20. **Question 20**: Impact of his removal on public view. The petition states that Budelli remained a wonder thanks to him and the park would gain from his presence. So the answer refers to the petition's claims, so the impact was that the public believed his presence was crucial for the island's preservation. The question asks what the removal had on public view as per the petition. The answer would be that the public viewed his removal as detrimental to the island's preservation, but the exact wording in the question asks for the impact as evidenced by the petition. The petition says they didn't want him to leave because the island remained a wonder thanks to him. So the impact was that the public thought his removal would harm the island's natural state. The answer should be the petition's assertion that Budelli remained a wonder thanks to him, so the impact was that his removal was seen as harmful. The question asks "what impact did his removal have... as evidenced by the online petition?" The petition's text says they didn't want him to leave because the island was a wonder "thanks to him." Therefore, the answer is that his removal would compromise the island's preservation, but the exact phrasing in the question requires the answer to reflect the petition's view. The answer is that the petition argued his presence was crucial for the island's preservation, so the impact was that the public viewed his removal as a threat to the island's natural wonder. The article's exact quote from the petition: "we think first of all that if Budelli has remained a wonder of nature it is also thanks to him," so the answer is that his removal was seen as undermining the island's preservation. But the question asks for the impact on public view as evidenced by the petition. The answer would be that the petition asserted his presence was vital for the island's preservation, implying his removal would harm it. The question wants the impact on the public's view, so the answer is that the public believed his departure would negatively affect the island's status as a natural wonder. However, the question specifically says "what impact did his removal reportedly have on the public’s view..." The petition's existence shows the public's view was that he was essential. The answer should be the petition's claim that Budelli remained a wonder thanks to him, so the removal would take away that. The answer should be "that Budelli's natural wonder was maintained thanks to him" or similar. The exact wording from the petition is "if Budelli has remained a wonder of nature it is also thanks to him," so the impact on public view is that they believed his presence was key. The question's answer is that the petition argued his presence was crucial, so his removal would harm the island's natural state. The answer should be "that his departure would undermine the island's preservation" but the exact wording from the text is the petition's statement. The question wants the impact as per the petition, so the answer is the petition's assertion that the island remained a wonder thanks to him. So the answer is "that Budelli's status as a natural wonder was due to his efforts" or similar. The article states the petition said "we think first of all that if Budelli has remained a wonder of nature it is also thanks to him," so the answer is that his removal would mean the island's preservation was at risk, but the question asks what the removal had on the public's view. The answer is the petition's view, so the answer is "that the island's natural wonder was preserved thanks to him."
