Okay, I need to go through each question and answer them based solely on the provided article. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then checking the article for the exact information needed. Remember, if the answer isn't directly stated or can't be logically inferred, I should put "N/A".

1. **Question 1**: The question asks for the percentage increase in HIV infections in South Africa over the next decade using AMFAR data as a baseline. The article mentions that PEPFAR's shutdown would add over half a million new infections. But the question is about percentage increase. However, the article doesn't provide a baseline number from AMFAR data to calculate the percentage. So I can't find the percentage increase here. Answer: N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Dr. Abdool Karim's stance on self-reliance and the specific immune cell affected. The article says when patients stop meds, the virus attacks a certain immune cell, crippling the immune system's ability to fight infections like TB. The immune cell mentioned is likely CD4+ T cells. Wait, the article says "a certain type of immune cell" but doesn't name it. Since the answer must be exact, if it's not stated, it's N/A. Wait, the article says "the virus will start attacking a certain type of immune cell, crippling the body's ability to fend off other infections, including tuberculosis..." It doesn't name the cell. So N/A?

Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check again. The exact sentence: "the virus will start attacking a certain type of immune cell, crippling the body's ability to fend off other infections, including tuberculosis..." So the article doesn't specify the name of the cell. So the answer would be N/A. But maybe it's implied as CD4 cells? But since it's not stated, I can't assume. Answer: N/A.

Wait, but maybe Dr. Deeks or another expert mentioned it? Let me check again. The article says "Dr. Sallie Permar... alternating days or to share their pills with others. If the virus replicates... become resistant..." The question is about the immune cell mentioned by Dr. Abdool Karim's stance. Wait, the question is specifically about Dr. Salim Abdool Karim's stance on self-reliance and the cell he mentioned. Wait, no, the question is about the cell affected by stopping meds, which the article mentions but doesn't name. So answer N/A.

3. **Question 3**: How many doctors, nurses, etc. would be affected? The article states "The organization employs 270,000 doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other health workers. They had been told not to report to work or to serve patients." So the number is 270,000. Answer: 270,000.

4. **Question 4**: Maximum viral load within a week. The article says "Within a week, H.I.V. levels will skyrocket from undetectable levels to more than 100,000 copies per milliliter of blood." So the answer is 100,000.

5. **Question 5**: What initiative would be jeopardized by drug resistance? Dr. Permar mentions "losing whatever ability we had to make an effective vaccine." The question asks which initiative under PEPFAR's trials would be jeopardized. The answer is "effective vaccine trials" or "vaccine candidates". The article says "vaccine candidates being tested". So the initiative is vaccine trials. Answer: vaccine trials.

6. **Question 6**: What Omicron variant was cited? The article states "dangerous Covid variants, including Omicron, are thought to have evolved in immunocompromised people with H.I.V." It doesn't specify a variant beyond Omicron. The question asks for a specific Omicron variant, but the article just says Omicron. So answer: Omicron.

7. **Question 7**: Number of new pediatric HIV diagnoses per month without testing. The article says "more than 220,000 people pick up H.I.V. medications daily... more than 7,400 children under 15." But if testing stops, how many new cases? The article says "If H.I.V. testing falls by the wayside... may pass the virus to her child. Children with H.I.V. are less likely to be diagnosed..." But there's no data on new infections per month. The question asks "how many children in this age group would be newly diagnosed in a single month if testing services were unavailable." Since testing stops, they wouldn't be diagnosed, but the question is about new diagnoses, not actual infections. The article doesn't give numbers for new infections per month. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Ratio of migrants in tent city to PEPFAR recipients. The tent city can hold 30,000 migrants. PEPFAR's daily recipients are over 220,000. So 30,000 / 220,000 simplifies to 3/22. But the question says "ratio of migrants to the number receiving H.I.V. medications". The exact numbers are 30k to 220k. So the ratio is 30,000:220,000 which simplifies to 3:22. The answer should be 30,000 to 220,000 or 3:22. But the question asks for the ratio. The answer would be 30,000:220,000. But maybe the question wants it simplified? The article says "as many as 30,000 migrants" and "more than 220,000 people pick up HIV meds daily". So the ratio is 30,000 to 220,000. The answer is 30,000 to 220,000.

9. **Question 9**: What category did the waiver exclude? The waiver by Rubio allowed distribution of HIV meds but it's unclear if it extended to preventive drugs or other services. The question is about what the waiver explicitly excluded. The article says "whether the waiver extended to preventive drugs or other services... was not immediately clear." So the excluded category is preventive drugs or other services. The answer is "preventive drugs" or "preventive drugs or other services". The question asks for the specific category beyond treatment. The answer is "preventive drugs" or "preventive drugs and other services". The article says "preventive drugs or other services offered by the program". So the answer is "preventive drugs and other services".

10. **Question 10**: Ideal timeframe for transition in years. Dr. Abdool Karim said the shift should happen gradually over years. The article says "he said. 'But ideally that shift would happen gradually, over years during which PEPFAR would train local health workers and prepare them for the transition, he said.'" The exact number of years isn't given. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Children under 15 in South Africa relying on PEPFAR. The article says "more than 7,400 children under 15, according to data published on Tuesday by AMFAR". So answer: 7,400.

12. **Question 12**: Which agency's closure was demanded by Trump, tied to PEPFAR? The article says "U.S.A.I.D.: Trump directly called for the closure of the U.S. Agency for International Development... just hours before most of its staff were expected to be suspended..." USAID is the answer.

13. **Question 13**: Physiological symptom linked to gender-based violence support. The article mentions "resources for... support for orphans and women experiencing gender-based violence." The question asks which symptom was inaccurately linked. Wait, the question says "specific physiological symptom... was inaccurately linked to PEPFARâ€™s gender-based violence support initiatives". The article doesn't mention any inaccuracy here. It's possible the question is a trick. The article states that loss of resources for testing would prevent diagnosis, leading to transmission. The symptom mentioned in the context of viral rebound is flulike symptoms. But how is that linked to gender-based violence? The article says if a pregnant woman isn't tested, she might pass HIV. Gender-based violence support might help women access care. The question is about a symptom inaccurately linked to the support programs. Maybe the symptom is not directly linked, but the question might be pointing to a wrong connection. Since the article doesn't mention any inaccuracy, answer N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Which university projected the deaths? The article says "Dr. Salim Abdool Karim, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of KwaZulu-Natal... PEPFAR's shutdown would add more than a half million new H.I.V. infections and more than 600,000 related deaths over the next decade, according to one estimate." So the university is University of KwaZulu-Natal.

15. **Question 15**: How did Dr. Permar link PEPFAR's preventive programs to vaccine trials? The article states "a virus that is resistant to treatments will also be better at evading vaccine candidates being tested. 'Not only are we looking at more drug resistance, but we're looking at losing whatever ability we had to make an effective vaccine,' Dr. Permar said." So the answer is "vaccine trials".

16. **Question 16**: Numerical threshold erroneously attributed to pediatric outreach. The question says AMFAR's data "erroneously" linked a number to pediatric outreach. The article says "more than 7,400 children under 15, according to data published on Tuesday by AMFAR". But the question is about an erroneous attribution. Since the article doesn't state that the number is wrong, maybe the question refers to the 7,400 being part of the total 220k, but the question is about an error. Since there's no mention of an error, answer N/A.

17. **Question 17**: Trump's media policy parallel to PEPFAR funding. The article mentions lawsuits against CBS and The Des Moines Register as part of Trump's strategies. The question asks which policy is a parallel strategy. The answer is the lawsuits against media organizations.

18. **Question 18**: Financial loss to South Africa's healthcare from losing 270k workers. The article doesn't provide financial figures, only the number of employees. So N/A.
