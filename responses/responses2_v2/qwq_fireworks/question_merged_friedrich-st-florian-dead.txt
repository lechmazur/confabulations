Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. Let's start with the first question.

1. The first question asks how many pillars Mr. St. Florian originally proposed before Senator Robert Dole intervened. The article mentions that the pillars represent the states and territories, so there are 56. But does it say anything about an original proposal that was changed by Dole? Scanning through, the article states that Dole supported the design but I don't see any mention of him altering the number of pillars. The text says "pillars represent the states and territories" which are 56, but there's no info on original proposal vs. Dole's intervention. So the answer is N/A.

2. The second question is about a material reminiscent of Speer's style that was considered but rejected. The article mentions comparisons to Speer's fascist architecture, but doesn't specify any material. The materials used are bronze and granite. The text doesn't mention any other material being considered. So N/A here too.

3. The third question asks the year Providence Place got initial funding. The article says Providence Place opened in 1999 and that St. Florian was the architect. But it doesn't mention the funding year. The article also says he won a Fulbright in 1961. The question links funding to a pivotal moment before the memorial (which was designed after 1996). Since there's no funding date given, N/A.

4. The fourth question asks an artistic element common to both Centre Pompidou and WWII Memorial that critics cited as a stylistic weakness. The article mentions his design for Centre Pompidou where he placed second. The critics compared his style to fascist or mid-20th century dictators. The WWII Memorial's style was called "modern classical" similar to Mussolini, etc. So maybe "modern classical style" is the element. The article says Herbert Muschamp criticized the memorial's "modern classical style" as like structures under Mussolini, Stalin, etc. Since Centre Pompidou was another design he did, perhaps that style is the common element. So answer: modern classical style.

5. Fifth question: Which university besides Columbia did he attend on scholarship? The article says he got a Fulbright to Columbia for a master's, and before that, he graduated from Graz University of Technology in Austria. The scholarship part: the Fulbright is a fellowship, so Graz University of Technology is the answer. The question specifies "besides Columbia" and "on a scholarship". The text says he received a degree from Graz, and the Fulbright was for Columbia. So Graz is the answer.

6. Sixth question: What feature of Lincoln Memorial was undermined by St. Florian's design? The article says critics thought the memorial's placement near Washington and Lincoln Memorials was problematic. Herbert Muschamp said it "diminishes the substance of its architectural context". The specific feature? The Lincoln Memorial's axial alignment on the Mall might be the context. The article mentions the semicircles facing a pool, which might interfere with the Mall's layout. But the exact feature? The article doesn't specify a particular feature like the steps or statue. So maybe N/A unless there's a direct mention. Wait, the article says "its siting on the Mall in proximity to the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial" provoked opposition. The design "fit seamlessly" per some, but others said it was bad. Muschamp's criticism was about context, but the question asks for a specific feature of Lincoln Memorial. Since the text doesn't name a specific feature like the Reflecting Pool or the statue, maybe N/A. Hmm. Wait, the question says "specific feature of the Lincoln Memorial". The article doesn't mention any specific feature being undermined. So N/A.

7. Seventh question: What aspect of Reagan's presidency mirrored the memorial's failure, per WaPo critic? The article quotes Muschamp (NYT) saying Reagan confused making combat movies with actual service. The WaPo critic Fisher said the memorial didn't capture the war's impact. The question is about a WaPo critic's view. The article says Fisher wrote that the memorial's broadness was like a slab, and didn't honor the war's unifying role. The question links to Reagan's aspect. Wait, in the text, Muschamp (NYT) mentioned Reagan's confusion about combat movies. The WaPo critic's point is about the memorial's failure to capture transformation, but the Reagan part is from Muschamp. Since the question specifies the Washington Post critic, maybe N/A? Because the Reagan reference is from Muschamp's NYT review. So the answer would be N/A because the question attributes it to the WaPo critic but the Reagan part is from Muschamp. So answer N/A.

8. Eighth question: What wartime experience shared by Dole and Smith influenced the design's unity focus? The article says Dole was a WWII vet, Smith is Fed Ex chairman. The text says Mr. Neumann said St. Florian aimed to meet the needs of veterans who wanted to feel at home. The design's unity aspect was noted by Fisher as missing. The question asks what experience they shared. Both were WWII veterans. So their shared experience is being WWII veterans. The answer would be "World War II service" or "their experience as WWII veterans". The article states Dole was a WWII vet, and Smith's background isn't specified except as chairman, but the text says "World War II veteran; Frederick Smith, chairman of Federal Express; and Tom Hanks..." So Smith was also a veteran. So the answer is their shared experience as WWII veterans.

9. Ninth question: Besides Tom Hanks, who else from Saving Private Ryan supported the design? The article mentions Tom Hanks, the actor in the movie, supported it. The question asks another prominent figure from the film. The article only lists Tom Hanks, so unless there's another person mentioned, like the director Steven Spielberg, but the article doesn't mention him. The text says "the actor who starred..." so only Hanks is named. Therefore, N/A.
