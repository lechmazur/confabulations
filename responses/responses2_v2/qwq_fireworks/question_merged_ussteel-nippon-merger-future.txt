Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the given article and answer strictly based on that. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about the annual revenue lost to Chinese competitors between 2018-2023 according to World Steel Association data. The article mentions that Chinese steel dominated the international market and U.S. Steel's decline, but I don't see specific numbers on revenue loss. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The executive who proposed the electric furnace transition leading to the Arkansas plant. The article says U.S. Steel opened the Arkansas plant in 2023 but doesn't name an individual. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The percentage of production capacity affected by the Mon Valley Works upgrade. The article mentions a $1 billion commitment for the plant but no percentage. N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Jobs Cleveland-Cliffs promised compared to Nippon. The union opposed Nippon and wanted Cleveland-Cliffs, but no numbers on job promises. N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Peak steel price during the post-tariff boom. The article says prices reached record highs but doesn't give a specific figure. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Specific trade violations accused by the union. The union accused Nippon of illegal trade practices but the article doesn't list specifics. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Market share decrease from 1st to 24th. The article states the rank but not the market share percentage. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Energy cost savings from Arkansas plant. The article compares electric vs blast furnaces as more energy-efficient but no exact percentage. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Three modernization projects in Nippon's original proposal. The article mentions Mon Valley and Gary Works, but not three projects before. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Dollar amount of imports affected by Trump's tariffs. The article mentions 25% tariffs but not the total value. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Arkansas plant's production vs Baowu's. No data on output percentages. N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Tariff percentage affecting exports. Trump's 25% tariffs and Biden's quotas. The question asks for a specific tariff percentage, so maybe 25%? But need to check if it's adjusted. The article says Biden expanded tariffs on some steel, but the original was 25%. So maybe 25%.

Wait, the question specifies a tariff percentage that would impact exports to countries without quotas. Since Trump's was 25%, unless Biden changed it, but the article says Biden used quotas and expanded tariffs. The exact percentage isn't stated for the merged company's exports. Hmm. The article says "expanded tariffs on some steel melted outside the United States," but the original Trump tariff was 25%. Since the question asks for the specific tariff percentage from Trump later adjusted by Biden, but the exact number isn't given. So maybe N/A?

Wait, the question says "what specific tariff percentage, initially imposed by Trump and later adjusted by Biden..." Trump's was 25%, but Biden's adjustments aren't specified in numbers. So maybe 25% is the initial, but since it's adjusted, but the article doesn't say the new rate. So perhaps N/A.

13. **Question 13**: Dollar amount redirected from Mon Valley to legal fees. The article says they're suing, but no mention of redirecting the $1 billion. N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Illegal trade practice affecting Arkansas plant. The union accused Nippon of illegal practices, but the article doesn't specify which ones. If they oppose the Nippon deal, maybe the same practices would be an issue. Since it's unspecified, N/A.

15. **Question 15**: Technological advancement Bill Farrier would advocate. The article says he wants modernization and new equipment. The lag is in electric furnaces vs minimills. Since Nucor uses electric, maybe electric furnace technology? The question is about what's lagging compared to Nucor. So "minimills" or "electric furnace technology".

The article says domestic companies are slower to adopt minimills (electric furnaces). So the specific tech would be electric furnace technology. So answer: electric furnace technology.

16. **Question 16**: Global rank if merged with Cleveland-Cliffs. The article says U.S. Steel was 24th, but merged with Cleveland-Cliffs (who is top domestic?), but no global rank given. N/A.

Wait, the article says in 2023, U.S. Steel was 24th. Cleveland-Cliffs is another company. The three top domestic in 2023 were Nucor, Cleveland-Cliffs, U.S. Steel accounting for half of U.S. production. But global rank? The article doesn't say where Cleveland-Cliffs stands globally. So N/A.

17. **Question 17**: Aspect of the deal impacting job security. The union opposed Nippon, accusing them of bad faith. The article mentions that Nippon's deal includes investments but the union is against it. The specific aspect could be the $1 billion for Mon Valley and $300M for Gary, but the union might be worried about job cuts. The question asks what specific aspect would impact job security if the deal proceeds. The lawsuit accuses Cleveland-Cliffs of colluding, but the union's concern is about jobs. The article states that without the deal, US Steel might shut plants and lay off workers. But if the deal proceeds, maybe the Gary Works investment is part of it, so if that's criticized, maybe the Gary Works relining would impact Mon Valley? Not sure. The question is about what aspect the union criticized that would affect Mon Valley workers. The union might oppose the Nippon deal's terms which could lead to shutting other plants. The article says US Steel might have to shutter plants without the deal. If the deal goes through, maybe the Gary Works investment is part of it, but the union might argue that other plants like Mon Valley would be neglected? The answer isn't clear. The article says the lawsuit is about collusion, but the specific aspect impacting jobs isn't stated. So N/A.

18. **Question 18**: Entity legally obligated to compensate. The lawsuit is against the federal government and Cleveland-Cliffs. If successful, Cleveland-Cliffs might have to compensate for collusion with McCall. The question says "specific entity accused of colluding with David McCall" so Cleveland-Cliffs. So answer: Cleveland-Cliffs.

19. **Question 19**: Economic consequence exacerbated by shutting blast furnaces. Frank Giarratani said tariffs protect jobs but not competitiveness. Sarah Bauerle Danzman mentions that a merger would make steel more expensive. If US Steel shuts blast furnaces and focuses on Arkansas (electric), maybe higher prices? The question asks what consequence would be exacerbated. The article says Bauerle Danzman said controlling more production would make steel expensive. So answer: increased prices.

But the question is about shutting traditional plants and focusing on electric. The consequence identified by Bauerle Danzman is higher prices. So answer: higher prices.

20. **Question 20**: Specific steel type vulnerable without tariffs. The article says U.S. Steel makes flat-rolled sheet steel for cars, trucks, appliances. Without tariffs, they'd be less competitive. So the answer is flat-rolled sheet steel.
