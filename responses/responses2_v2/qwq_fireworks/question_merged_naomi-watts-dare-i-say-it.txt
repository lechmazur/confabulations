Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I don't use any outside knowledge and only the text given.

1. The first question asks about the French film director Naomi Watts collaborated with on "The Friend" that got critical acclaim. The article mentions "The Friend" is based on a novel by Sigrid Nunez, but doesn't name the director. So N/A.

2. For the Wordle streak: The article says she's missed a few here and there since starting, but doesn't specify consecutive days. So the exact number isn't there. N/A.

3. The boutique Parisian restaurant where she learned cooking from her mom? The text says she learned from her mom, who isn't linked to a restaurant. The hotel mentioned is Le Pavillon de la Reine, but that's a hotel, not a restaurant. So N/A.

4. Skincare product for menopause? She mentions Eucerin Intensive Repair lotion for her feet. Wait, the question is about skincare related to menopause? The text says she uses it for cracked feet in winter. Maybe not directly linked. So N/A unless it's inferred. Since it's for moisturizing, maybe the answer is Eucerin, but the question is about menopause challenges. Hmm, the article says she uses Eucerin for her feet, so not directly for menopause symptoms. So N/A.

5. How did "Changes" lead her to speak about menopause? The article says she was inspired by Bowie's work, but no direct link to her decision. It mentions she got tired of keeping the secret. So N/A.

6. Pickleball venue in LA with 20-somethings? The text mentions she plays pickleball and that people in their 20s in NYC are into it, but no specific venue. N/A.

7. Doctor's name who diagnosed her? The article doesn't mention the doctor's name. N/A.

8. Cups of builder's tea during filming? The article says she drinks it all day but no number. N/A.

9. Card game strategy from her brother? The text says she's competitive from having a big brother, but no specific strategy. N/A.

10. Duration at Le Pavillon during filming with Cotillard? The hotel is mentioned, but no info on her stay related to filming with Marion Cotillard. N/A.

11. First album purchase? The article says "The first album I ever bought was 'Hunky Dory'". So answer is Hunky Dory.

12. Character that defied the prediction of a short career? The prediction was about her acting career ending by 40, and she's now 56. The role mentioned is Babe Paley in "Feud". So Babe Paley.

13. Age told about menopause? The text states "at 36". So 36.

14. Daily game where winner picks the word? Wordle chain, with the previous day's winner choosing the word. So Wordle.

15. Boutique hotel in Paris with fireplace? Le Pavillon de la Reine.

16. Beverage made with water over the bag and milk, rejecting peppermint? Builder's tea. She insists on that method and hates peppermint with milk.

17. Product for cracked feet? Eucerin Intensive Repair lotion.

18. Film with ensemble cast and Zoe Saldana's nod? The article mentions "Emilia Perez" where Zoe Saldana was recognized. So Emilia Perez.
