Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful and make sure I only use the information given.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions that ferry services to Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard would have been affected, but it doesn't specify which routes had the highest number of strikes. The data from 2017-2023 is given as 15 fatal and 7 nonfatal, but no specific routes are named. So, N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The article doesn't state a projected percentage reduction. It talks about expanding slow zones and regulating more ships, but no numbers on reduction. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The article says existing slow zones include areas off Cape Cod, Mid-Atlantic bays, and SC/Georgia. It doesn't compare collision numbers between these regions. No data on highest number here. N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The article mentions the population is about 370 in 2023 but doesn't state a recovery threshold. Conservation groups talk about needing protection but not a specific number. N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The proposal was to "expand existing slow zones" but doesn't specify how many new ones. So, exact number isn't given. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The article states Healey opposed it, saying it's good for the local economy, but doesn't mention specific economic impact figures. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The 90k comments are mentioned, but there's no breakdown of how many supported Healey's stance. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The scientist mentions vessel strikes as a threat but the question asks for another specific threat besides strikes. The article only lists vessel strikes as the issue. Wait, the question says "other specific threat" but the text doesn't mention others. Wait, the article says "existing boundaries for seasonal slow zones and rules limiting the speed of some ship classes will remain in place" but the scientist's statement says "preventable deaths"â€”maybe vessel strikes are the only mentioned threat here. Wait, the question is about other threats besides vessel strikes? The article mentions "existing slow zones" but doesn't list other threats. So N/A?

Wait, the article's quote from Jessica Redfern says "preventable deaths" from vessel strikes. The question asks for another specific threat besides vessel strikes that she mentioned. Since she only talks about vessel strikes, then the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The article says "existing boundaries... remain in place. These areas including waters off the coast of Cape Cod, bays dotting the Mid-Atlantic and most of the coastline off South Carolina and Georgia." The scientist's statement is about vessel strikes. The other part mentions offshore wind farms but that's from Trump's side. The question is about what the conservation scientist mentioned. So no, she didn't mention another threat. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The proposal was in August 2022. The question asks for the month in 2022 when they proposed it. The article says "August 2022", so answer is August.

10. **Question 10**: Trump mentioned halting wind farms due to claims about delta smelt. The article says he claimed delta smelt protection impeded wildfire containment. So the primary reason for halting wind farms was his claim about whales, but the question links it to the delta smelt context. Wait, the article says "he has made inaccurate claims about what he saw as the unnecessary protection of delta smelt... for impeding wildfire containment... he announced... to halt offshore wind farms." The reason for halting wind farms is his claim that wind farms kill whales, but that's separate from delta smelt. Wait, the question says "as mentioned in the same context as the delta smelt protection issue". The article connects the two by saying he made claims about delta smelt and then about wind farms. But the primary reason for halting wind farms was his claim about whales. The delta smelt was part of his broader criticism of environmental protections. The question asks for the primary reason cited by Trump for halting wind farms in the context of delta smelt. The answer might be the delta smelt issue isn't the reason for wind farms, but the question links them. Wait, the article says: "he has made inaccurate claims about... delta smelt... impeding wildfire containment... he announced... to halt the construction of new wind farms." The halting wind farms was because of his claim about whales, but the delta smelt is a separate issue. The question is asking for the reason given for halting wind farms in the same context as delta smelt. Maybe the answer is that the primary reason for halting wind farms was his claim about whales, but the delta smelt was another example. The question is specifically about the wind farms, so the answer is "killing whales" but the question mentions the delta smelt context. Wait, the question says "primary reason cited by the incoming Trump administration for halting... wind farms, as mentioned in the same context as the delta smelt protection issue?" The article says Trump "announced... to halt the construction of new wind farms" and in the same paragraph he made claims about delta smelt. But the reason given for wind farms is his whale claim, not delta smelt. So perhaps the answer is "killing whales" but the question wants the connection. The question might be tricky here. Since the article states "he announced in early January that he planned to halt the construction of new wind farms. Simon J. Levien..." and the prior sentence says he assailed offshore wind farms for killing whales. So the primary reason is "killing whales". The delta smelt is a separate issue but mentioned in the same context paragraph. The question is about the reason for halting wind farms in the context of delta smelt, but the reason is whales. So the answer is "killing whales".

11. **Question 11**: The existing slow zones include "bays dotting the Mid-Atlantic". The question asks for a specific bay mentioned in the context of existing zones and the Massachusetts fishing industry. The article says Massachusetts has a major fishing industry along its extensive coastline. The specific bay isn't named except Cape Cod, but Cape Cod is part of Massachusetts. The Mid-Atlantic bays are separate. The article doesn't mention a specific bay's name. So N/A.

12. **Question 12**: The action Trump took regarding delta smelt was making claims about it impeding wildfire containment. The National Marine Fisheries Service's effort was to protect right whales. The question asks what action he took regarding delta smelt that contradicts their efforts. Since delta smelt is a different species, maybe it's the delta smelt protection being opposed, but the question is about an action that contradicts the NMF's whale efforts. The connection is that Trump opposed environmental protections, but the delta smelt and whale rules are separate. The article doesn't link the delta smelt action to the whale rules. So N/A.

13. **Question 13**: The article says as of 2023, there were ~370 whales. It doesn't project a number by the end of Biden's term (which would be early 2025). The trend isn't provided. So N/A.

14. **Question 14**: The proposed rules affected ferry services to Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard. The type of vessel is ferry. The question asks for the vessel type affecting Cape Cod's economy. The article mentions ferries to those destinations, which are in Cape Cod area. So the answer is "ferries".
