Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks which federal agency had the largest percentage increase due to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The article mentions that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act led to over 9,000 hires across agencies. But the largest percentage increase specifically? The article says the Department of Veterans Affairs grew by nearly 16% since 2020, driven by the PACT Act. Wait, but the question is about the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Hmm. Wait, looking back, the article states: "the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. Recruiters streamlined hiring procedures to bring on more than 9,000 people, distributed across the agencies handling parts of the laws." But the biggest increase was at the VA due to the PACT Act. So maybe the answer is not the VA here. Wait, the VA's growth was due to the PACT Act, not the infrastructure law. The infrastructure law's hires were spread across agencies. The article also mentions the Treasury's IRS went to over 100,000 after an $80B infusion (later cut). But the article says the biggest increase was VA. Wait, the question is about the agency with the largest percentage increase due to the infrastructure law. The article doesn't specify which agency had the largest percentage from infrastructure. It says the VA's growth was due to PACT. So perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, but the question is about the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law specifically. The article says agencies handling parts of the laws (both infrastructure and Inflation Reduction) got the 9,000 hires. But the largest percentage increase would need to be specified. The article mentions the VA's 16% growth, but that's from PACT. The State Department grew by nearly 20% (from 2020 to 2024), but that's due to passport processors and post-pandemic. Wait, the State Department's growth was mentioned as 20% from 2020 to early 2024, not specifically due to infrastructure. The article says the infrastructure and Inflation acts led to hiring across agencies, but the biggest percentage increase mentioned is the State Department's 20%, but that's not directly tied to infrastructure. The article might not specify which agency had the largest percentage due to infrastructure. Hmm. Maybe the answer is N/A here. Wait, the question says "specifically due to the implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law". The article says the 9,000 hires were distributed across agencies handling parts of the laws. Since it's distributed, maybe none had the largest percentage, but the VA's growth was from PACT, so not that. The answer might be N/A, but I need to check again. Alternatively, maybe the IRS? The article says the Treasury expanded due to the $80B for IRS. The IRS went to over 100,000, the highest since 1997. But was that due to the infrastructure law? The article says the IRS funding was part of the infrastructure law? Wait, the article says: "The Treasury Department also expanded as the Internal Revenue Service received an $80 billion infusion — later cut to $40 billion — that allowed it to top 100,000 employees, the highest level since 1997." The $80B infusion was part of which law? The article doesn't explicitly say. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is mentioned alongside the Inflation Reduction Act. So maybe the IRS's expansion was part of the infrastructure law. If so, then the IRS might have a significant increase, but percentage-wise, the State Department's 20% is higher. But the question is about the largest percentage. The State Department's 20% growth is mentioned as due to passport processors and pandemic recovery, not the infrastructure law. Wait, the article says "the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. Recruiters streamlined hiring procedures to bring on more than 9,000 people, distributed across the agencies handling parts of the laws." The State Department's growth isn't attributed to those laws. The VA's growth is from the PACT Act. The article mentions the VA's growth as a separate point. So perhaps the largest percentage due to the infrastructure law would be another agency, but the article doesn't specify which. Hence, the answer is N/A? Or maybe the answer is the IRS? The article says the IRS's expansion was due to the $80B infusion. But the law that included that isn't specified. The article says "the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act" were the sources. So maybe the IRS's funding was part of one of those. But since the article doesn't specify which, maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, tricky. I'll need to check again.

Wait, the question is about the largest percentage increase due to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The article says that the 9,000 hires were spread across agencies handling parts of the laws (both infrastructure and Inflation Reduction). The largest percentage increase from those would be... the article doesn't say which agency had the largest. The State Department's 20% is mentioned, but that's due to passport processors, not the laws. The VA's 16% is due to PACT. The article mentions the Treasury (IRS) expanding due to the $80B, but maybe that's part of the infrastructure law. The IRS's growth: the article says "the Internal Revenue Service received an $80 billion infusion... that allowed it to top 100,000 employees, the highest level since 1997." Assuming that the $80B was part of the infrastructure law, then the IRS's growth would be a result. But how much did their workforce increase? The article doesn't give a percentage for IRS. The VA's 16% is from PACT. The State Department's 20% is from other factors. The article doesn't specify which agency had the largest percentage from the infrastructure law. So the answer might be N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the IRS, but the article doesn't give a percentage. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A for question 1.

2. The question asks how many passport processors were hired by the State Department between 2021-2023 to address post-pandemic travel surge. The article mentions that some of the gain in the State Department's workforce reflected passport processors, whose numbers had fallen when few people traveled. But it doesn't give a specific number. The article says the State Department gained nearly 2,300 workers from 2020 to early 2024, not including the Foreign Service. The 2,300 includes passport processors, but how many exactly? The article doesn't specify. So answer N/A.

3. Total dollar amount saved through remote work initiatives outside DC. The article mentions that remote work allowed agencies to hire elsewhere, but there's no mention of a specific dollar amount saved. Answer N/A.

4. How many of the 9,000 hires under Biden's legislative initiatives (Bipartisan Infrastructure and Inflation Reduction Acts) were for the Inflation Reduction Act? The article says the 9,000 were distributed across agencies handling both laws. But the exact split isn't given. So N/A.

5. Number of contractors terminated when VA expanded. The article says the VA expanded its internal workforce, but doesn't mention contractor terminations. So N/A.

6. Average salary differential for tech workers in Northern Virginia. The article states federal workers make nearly 25% less than private counterparts. It also mentions Terry Clower noting difficulty attracting tech workers because of lower pay and cost of living in Northern Virginia. The 25% is the general figure, so answer 25%.

7. How many Trump-era hires remained through Biden's expansion. The article says staffing expanded during Trump's first term by 2.9%, but doesn't track individual employees' tenure. So N/A.

8. Percentage of DoD's civilian employees in roles supporting military ops. The article says DoD's civilian employees are part of the 1.25 million federal workers along with VA and Pentagon. But no breakdown of roles. N/A.

9. Number transitioning to remote work. The article mentions remote work allowed hiring elsewhere but no numbers on transitions. N/A.

10. Agency with 16% growth since 2020 due to toxic substances funding. The article says VA added over 486k employees, up 16% since 2020 due to PACT Act. So answer is Veterans Affairs.

11. The GOP figure who stepped aside (Ramaswamy) claimed 75% could be cut. The article says he said 75% of workforce could go for $2T cuts. Answer 75%.

12. Share in Washington metro. The article states 12% are in DC area. So answer 12%.

13. Federal proportion drop from 1980s. The article says federal workforce is 1.9% now vs 3% in 1980s. The drop is 1.1 percentage points (3-1.9=1.1). So 1.1.

14. Agency exceeding 1997 milestone after $80B (cut to $40B). The IRS reached over 100k, highest since 1997. So answer Internal Revenue Service.

15. Department rebounded 20% after a hiring freeze. The State Department had a hiring freeze under Tillerson, then grew 20%. So State Department.

16. Earnings percentage difference. The article says federal workers make nearly 25% less. So answer 25%.

17. Federal civilian workforce increase between two administrations. The first paragraph says "the federal civilian head count rose by about 4.4 percent" over four years under Biden, but the question is about the period separating Trump's two terms. Wait, the article says "In the four years separating President Trump's two terms, the federal civilian head count rose by about 4.4 percent". So answer 4.4%.

18. Law providing $797B for VA growth. The PACT Act authorized $797B. So PACT Act.

19. Percentage outside DC if 12% are in DC. 100-12=88%. So 88%.
