Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not anything else. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks about the percentage increase in leadership voting when managers told two jokes. The article mentions "Managers who were randomly assigned to make one joke in one conversation were over 9 percent more likely to be voted into leadership positions by their teammates." The question specifies two jokes, but the article only mentions one joke. Since the exact data for two jokes isn't there, the answer should be N/A. Wait, but maybe I misread. Let me check again. No, it's definitely one joke. So 9% is for one joke. The question asks for two jokes. Since there's no info on two, answer is N/A.

2. The question is about which type of questions participants preferred: benign or sensitive. The article states that "friends and strangers alike preferred fielding 'sensitive' questions" like the sexual thoughts one over benign ones like morning person. So the answer is sensitive.

3. The question asks for a literary magazine mentioned in the African publishing Renaissance. The article mentions "a new ecosystem of publishers, bookstores, literary magazines and festivals" but doesn't name any specific magazine. So N/A.

4. The reviewer Dan Piepenbring mentions he was "about ready to take a vow of silence" after reading certain advice. The question is about the vow he'd take if someone followed the levity tips (Onion headlines, Seinfeld reactions). The answer should be "silence" as per his reaction.

5. The question asks what type of question was less preferable than direct ones. The article says participants avoided topics with negative valence like "When did you last cry..." but enjoyed them when made to answer. Wait, the question mentions "Have you had sexual thoughts..." as an example of sensitive, which were preferred over benign. The less preferable ones would be benign, but the question is phrased as "what type of question...was found to be less preferable than more direct inquiries". The sensitive ones were preferred over benign, so the less preferable are benign. But the example given is the sensitive one. Wait, the question is about the type that was less preferable. The article says people avoided sensitive but when made to answer, they enjoyed it. Wait, no: the article says "most avoided topics with a negative valence... but when they were made to answer, they actually enjoyed it." So the "sensitive" ones were preferred when forced, but initially avoided. The question says "less preferable than more direct inquiries". Hmm, maybe the "candidate answers" which are leading questions are the type that are less preferable. Wait the question says "exemplified by 'Have you had sexual thoughts...'" but that's a sensitive question which was preferred. The question might be confusing. Wait the question says "what type of question... was found to be less preferable than more direct inquiries". The article says that sensitive questions were preferred over benign ones. So the less preferable are benign. But the example given in the question is the sensitive one, which is actually preferred. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the question's example is the sensitive one, which was preferred, so the answer might be "benign". The question is phrased as "less preferable than more direct inquiries" which might refer to the benign ones being less preferred. So the answer is benign.

6. The question asks what specific spreadsheet Brooks' students made. The article says "spreadsheets filled with promising topics to raise with strangers," so the answer is "topics to raise with strangers".

7. Brooks warns against "candidate answers" which narrow down open questions. The question asks what type of answer she warns against. The answer is "candidate answers".

8. The question asks what was forbidden in Kant's dinners besides games and music. The article says "Games, beer and music were forbidden; lulls were unpardonable." So beer? Wait, "games, beer and music were forbidden". So the answer is beer.

9. Nnedi Okorafor is an award-winning sci-fi writer who wrote an autobiographical novel. The article mentions she's an award-winning author but doesn't specify the award. So N/A.

10. The philosopher with structured dinners is Kant. The question is who, so answer is Kant.

11. The question asks percentage increase from sensitive vs benign. The article only mentions the 9% from a joke, not from questions. So N/A.

12. The conversational compass's axes. The article doesn't specify the two axes, just mentions the existence of the compass. So N/A.

13. The question asks which prosecutor from Scott Turow's book is cited as an example of Brooks' research. The article mentions Rusty Sabich from "Presumed Innocent" but says Brooks' research is on negotiation, but the example given is not linked. The question states it's incorrectly cited, but the article doesn't mention Brooks using that example. Since the question is about an incorrect citation, but the article doesn't mention that, so N/A? Or maybe the answer is Rusty Sabich because the article mentions him in the sidebar, but the question is about Brooks' research example. Since there's no info linking him to Brooks, answer N/A.

14. The comedy show for text optimization is Seinfeld. The article says "imitating the outsize reactions of 'Seinfeld' characters".

15. The term from Arlie Hochschild is "the jazz of human exchange".

16. The emotion excluded in the chart for negotiations. The article doesn't list any emotions, so N/A.

17. The question asks how many participants reported increased enjoyment when discussing crying vs morning routines. The article says "most avoided... but when made to answer, they actually enjoyed it". No specific percentage given, so N/A.

18. The publisher of Han Kang's novel is not mentioned. The article says "Crown" for Brooks' book, but Han's is by another? The article's sidebar mentions "Crown" as Brooks' publisher, but Han's is not specified. So N/A.

19. The mnemonic TALK uses "Asking" instead of "Questions" to avoid parallelism. The question asks what term replaced "Questions", so the answer is "Asking".

20. The philosopher with structured dinners is Kant again, but question 10 already asked that. Wait question 10 was about the philosopher whose dinners had jesting during dessert and prohibited music. So same answer: Kant.

Wait, let me check each question again carefully.

Question 1: The article says one joke gives 9% increase. The question is about two jokes, so N/A.

Question 2: Sensitive questions preferred.

Question 3: No specific magazine, so N/A.

Question 4: Vow of silence.

Question 5: The question says "what type of question... exemplified by 'Have you had sexual thoughts...' was less preferable than more direct inquiries?" But the article says sensitive were preferred over benign, so the less preferable are benign. So answer is "benign".

Wait the example given is sensitive, which was preferred. The question's wording is tricky. The question is asking what type was less preferable than more direct inquiries. Since the sensitive ones were preferred, the less preferable would be the benign ones. So the answer is "benign".

Question 6: The spreadsheet is "promising topics to raise with strangers".

Question 7: "candidate answers".

Question 8: Forbidden items besides games and music: beer.

Question 9: N/A (no award mentioned for Okorafor).

Question 10: Kant.

Question 11: N/A (no % given for questions, only for jokes).

Question 12: N/A (no axes listed).

Question 13: N/A (no mention of prosecutor being linked to Brooks' research).

Question 14: Seinfeld.

Question 15: "the jazz of human exchange".

Question 16: N/A.

Question 17: N/A (no numbers given).

Question 18: N/A (publisher not stated).

Question 19: The mnemonic replaced "Questions" with "Asking".

Question 20 (the 10th question): same as 10, which is Kant.

Wait the 10th question is "which philosopher's structured dinner..." so answer is Kant.

Alright, compiling all these.
