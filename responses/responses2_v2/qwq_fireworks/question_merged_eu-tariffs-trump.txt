Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I'm only using the information from the provided article and not my own knowledge. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks for the percentage tariff Marco Rubio proposed on American whiskey. Scanning the article, I remember that in 2018, the EU retaliated against US tariffs by targeting whiskey, specifically Kentucky's bourbon. But the question mentions Marco Rubio, who is the Secretary of State here. Wait, the article says Rubio hasn't met with Kallas but there's no mention of him proposing a tariff. The tariff on whiskey was done by the EU, not Rubio. So the answer here is N/A because Rubio isn't linked to the whiskey tariff percentage.

2. The second question is about the legal framework von der Leyen is considering. The article mentions an "anti-coercion instrument" from 2023, not something used in 2018. The 2018 retaliation was just regular tariffs on whiskey. So the answer would be "anti-coercion instrument". But wait, the question specifies "utilized in 2018"â€”since that was the whiskey case. Since the anti-coercion tool was from 2023, that's not the one from 2018. The article says the 2018 response was hitting whiskey, which didn't use that framework. So the answer here is N/A because the framework mentioned (anti-coercion) wasn't used in 2018.

3. The third question asks which geopolitical rival Kaja Kallas mentioned benefiting from defense purchases. The article says when talking about avoiding a trade war, the EU warned it would benefit China and Russia. But the specific mention of Kaja Kallas? The only part with her name is in a call with Rubio. The article doesn't say Kaja Kallas mentioned this. The general warning is from EU officials. Since the question specifies Kaja Kallas, it's N/A.

4. Fourth question: number of migrants with Al Qaeda ties in the tent city. The article says 10 migrants with gang affiliations are in Guantanamo, and the tent city is for up to 30k. But the 10 are in Guantanamo, not the tent city. The question is about the tent city, so maybe N/A. The article doesn't specify how many of the tent city migrants are Al Qaeda. The 10 are in Guantanamo, so the answer is N/A for the tent city's count.

5. Fifth question: Greenland's product to appease annexation. The article mentions Denmark's PM Frederiksen talking about Greenland's strategic importance, especially in defense and security. The High North and Arctic region are important. The article doesn't mention a specific product, just that they're open to investing. So N/A.

6. Sixth question: Which state's bourbon was hit by EU tariffs, prompting Jorn Fleck's comment. The article says the EU hit Kentucky's bourbon in 2018. Jorn Fleck is from the Atlantic Council and said the EU is uncertain about Trump's objectives. So the answer is Kentucky.

7. Seventh question: News org accused by Trump of benefiting rivals. The article mentions lawsuits against CBS and Des Moines Register, but the reason given is about legal merit, not specifically linking them to China/Russia. The article states that experts say the lawsuits lack merit but are effective at harassing the press. The question's premise might be incorrect because the article doesn't state that Trump accused them of benefiting rivals. So N/A.

8. Eighth question: Action by West Point per Trump's D.E.I. ban. The article says they ended 12 clubs to comply with Trump's D.E.I. ban. So the answer is ending student clubs.

9. Ninth question: Trudeau's reason for buying American LNG. The article says Trudeau mentioned Canada's mineral wealth as a reason behind Trump wanting to annex, but the LNG switch is about replacing Russian gas. The specific reason Trudeau gave? The article states von der Leyen said they can replace Russian LNG with American. The question is about Trudeau's reason. The article says Trudeau talked about minerals being behind Trump's comments about annexation. So maybe the answer is critical minerals? But the question is about LNG replacement. Wait, the article says "Threats to Canada: ...Trudeau ... said Canada's wealth of critical minerals are behind Trump's comments..." So the reason for LNG isn't directly linked to Trudeau's statement. The EU's reason for buying LNG is to replace Russian gas. The question is about Trudeau's reason for EU's willingness, which might be N/A because Trudeau's statement was about minerals and annexation, not LNG. So answer N/A.

10. Tenth question: Besides employment, what else did von der Leyen mention. The article says "European companies employ millions of Americans. "A lot is at stake for both sides," Ms. von der Leyen said this week. But the other point? She emphasized that they buy American services. The exact quote: "the E.U., when treated as a bloc, America's most important trading partner. It is also a major importer of American services..." So the answer is "importer of American services".

11. Eleventh question: Percentage tariff triggering anti-coercion. The article says if Trump orders 20% tariff, EU might not respond with same. But the threshold isn't specified. The question is about a specific percentage von der Leyen mentioned. The article doesn't mention a specific percentage threshold, so N/A.

12. Twelfth question: Number of tech jobs impacted. The article mentions Silicon Valley firms could be targeted but doesn't give a number. N/A.

13. Thirteenth question: Number of Republican states identified. The task force's plan is to target politically sensitive sectors, like Kentucky in 2018. But the article doesn't state how many states were identified. N/A.

14. Fourteenth question: Which Cabinet member declined to meet Kallas. The article says Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State, was invited but didn't meet. So the answer is Marco Rubio.

15. Fifteenth question: Deadline set by task force. The article mentions "staggered response, kicking in or ratcheting up retaliation only if certain triggers are met or dates passed" but no specific date given. N/A.

16. Sixteenth question: Russian export competing with LNG. The article says "We still get a lot of LNG from Russia", so the answer is Russian LNG.

17. Seventeenth question: Joint migrant facilities in Guantanamo. The article says the Trump admin is holding migrants there, but it's U.S. Forces, not joint with EU. So N/A.

18. Eighteenth question: Annual NATO defense spending increase. The article mentions Europe is ramping up military spending in part due to Trump's demands but doesn't give a percentage. N/A.
