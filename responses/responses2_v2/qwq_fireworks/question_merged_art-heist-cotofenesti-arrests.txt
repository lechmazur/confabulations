Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information given in the article. Let me start by reading through the questions again and then check the article for each answer.

1. **Total weight of golden artifacts including bracelets and helmet?** The article mentions the helmet weighs a little over two pounds but doesn't specify the bracelets' weight. Since the total isn't given, I'll have to say N/A.

2. **Which Romanian official discovered the theft?** The article doesn't mention who first noticed the theft. It talks about the museum director's statement but not who found it. So N/A.

3. **Minutes between explosion and departure?** The article doesn't provide specific time frames between the explosion and when they left. Surveillance footage shows the door but not the timeline. N/A.

4. **Insurance value declared by Romania?** The authorities declined to attach a monetary figure, and Romania said the cultural value was incalculable. No insurance value given, so N/A.

5. **Archaeologist who discovered the helmet?** The article doesn't name any archaeologist involved in the discovery. N/A.

6. **Security company protecting the museum?** The article doesn't mention the security company. N/A.

7. **Historical figure depicted on helmet?** The helmet has scenes like a lamb sacrifice but no specific figure named. N/A.

8. **Name of the traveling exhibition?** The article says it's part of a traveling exhibition from the National History Museum of Romania, but the exhibition's name isn't provided. N/A.

9. **Previous theft attempts at the museum?** The director says it's the first major incident in 170 years, so previous attempts aren't mentioned. N/A.

10. **Connection between hardware store and security system?** The hardware store footage showed a suspect, but no link to the security system is stated. N/A.

11. **City 30 miles north of Amsterdam where suspects were from?** The article says Heerhugowaard is 30 miles north of Amsterdam. So the answer is Heerhugowaard.

12. **Headwear of suspect in surveillance?** The description mentions a dark shirt and ball cap. So a ball cap.

13. **Weight of the helmet?** The article says over two pounds. Converting pounds to grams (1 lb ≈ 453.59g), two pounds is about 907 grams. But the question asks for approximate, so maybe 907g or just over 2 pounds. The article uses pounds, so maybe they want the given value: "a little over two pounds".

14. **Ancient people linked to the helmet?** The Dacians, mentioned as inhabiting the Balkans. So Dacians.

15. **Museum's years of history?** The director mentions 170 years. So 170.

16. **Official who lost position?** The general director of the National History Museum was fired after refusing to resign. So the general director.

17. **Other jewelry stolen?** The three golden bracelets. So bracelets.

18. **Display began since when?** July 2024.

19. **Prized item stolen?** The Cotofenesti helmet is called the prized artifact.

20. **Indian festival mentioned?** Maha Kumbh Mela is mentioned.

Now, checking each against the article again to confirm:

1. Helmet's weight is given but not total with bracelets. N/A.

2. No info on who discovered it first. N/A.

3. No time between explosion and departure. N/A.

4. No insurance value. N/A.

5. No archaeologist named. N/A.

6. Security company not mentioned. N/A.

7. No specific figure. N/A.

8. Exhibition name not given. N/A.

9. Previous attempts? The director says it's the first major incident, so N/A.

10. Hardware store and security system link? No. N/A.

11. Heerhugowaard is correct.

12. Ball cap is stated.

13. Over two pounds. The question asks for approximate weight. Since it's specified as over two pounds, maybe converting to grams: 2 lbs is 907 grams. But the article uses pounds, so maybe just answer in pounds as per the text? The question asks for grams, so need to convert. But the article doesn't give grams, so maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "approximate weight of this asset" (the helmet). The article says "a little over two pounds". Since 1 pound is 453.59 grams, two pounds is 907.18 grams. A little over would be around 910-920 grams. But since the article doesn't specify, maybe the answer is "a little over two pounds" but the question asks for grams. Since the exact grams aren't given, maybe N/A? Wait, the question is about the helmet's weight, so the article states it's over two pounds, so approximate is acceptable. So converting: 2 lbs is ~907g, so the answer is approximately 907 grams. But the question says "approximate", so maybe that's acceptable. Hmm, but the article says "a little over two pounds"—so maybe the answer is "over two pounds" but in grams, that's roughly 907 grams. Since the question asks for grams, I'll go with ~907 grams. Wait, but the question says "approximate", so maybe 907 is okay. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the answer as per the article's units, but since it asks for grams, I need to convert. Let me see, the question says "total weight in grams of all golden artifacts"—wait, the first question is about total weight, but here question 13 is about the helmet's weight. The article says the helmet is a little over two pounds, so converting to grams is necessary. So 2 lbs is 907g, so approximate is ~907 grams. But the article doesn't specify, so maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "approximate", so maybe it's okay to convert. Let me check the article again. The article says "weighs a little over two pounds"—so the answer is approximately 907 grams, but since the article doesn't give grams, maybe the answer is N/A? Hmm, tricky. Wait, the question is asking for the approximate weight, so even if it's converted from pounds to grams, that's a valid approximation. Since the user wants an answer if it can be logically inferred, so 2 pounds is ~907 grams. So I'll put that.

14. Dacians, correct.

15. 170 years, yes.

16. General director of the National History Museum. The article says the general director was fired.

17. Three golden bracelets. So bracelets.

18. July 2024, yes.

19. Cotofenesti helmet.

20. Maha Kumbh Mela.
