Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict instructions. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Dickensian element in Jono's character development?** The article mentions Norton likes "A Tale of Two Cities" and "Misfortune" has Dickensian qualities. But the question connects Dickens to Jono in *Frankie*. Wait, the article says *Frankie* is a happy romance, and the Dickens reference was about reflecting on life's end. Maybe "retrospective on life" or "epilogue reflection"? But the question asks for an element in Jono's development. Hmm, not sure. The article says "Carton looks back at his life and considers his death" in Dickens, which relates to Frankie's reflections. But the question is about Jono. Maybe "N/A" because there's no direct link between Dickens and Jono's character.

2. **Element from *A Gentle Murderer* in *Presumed Guilty*?** *A Gentle Murderer* is unsettling. Rusty Sabich is a prosecutor returning at 77. Maybe an unsettling twist or moral ambiguity? The article says Norton admires Davis's unsettling style. So maybe "moral ambiguity" or "unsettling plot twists"?

3. **Echo in Frankie's reflections?** Han Kang's *We Do Not Part* deals with historical wounds. Frankie's reflections on lost loves etc. might echo how historical wounds affect personal stories. The article says both involve reflecting on life's weight. So "historical wounds' impact on personal narratives"?

4. **Character inspired by Sculls in African publishing?** The Sculls were taxicab entrepreneurs influencing art. African Renaissance mentions new publishers. Maybe an unconventional entrepreneur in publishing? Like a "taxi entrepreneur" but in books? "Unconventional entrepreneur in publishing" or "taxi mogul-inspired publisher"?

5. **Aspect of *Parade* that's challenging?** Norton says his books are undemanding. *Parade* by Rachel Cusk is on his nightstand. The article says he avoids demanding books. Maybe "demanding themes" or "complex narrative structure"?

6. **Aspect of *Misfortune* to emphasize in screenplay?** Norton wrote *Frankie* as a happy romance. *Misfortune* has gender fluidity and epic plots. He might focus on "gender fluidity" or "epic plot twists". The question asks beyond Dickensian and gender fluidity. Wait, the article says "wild plot twists and gender fluidity" so maybe "wild plot twists"?

7. **Comedic technique admired?** Norton snorts at Sedaris but says little makes him laugh. Sedaris uses hyperbole or irony. The question asks for a technique Norton might secretly like. "Hyperbole" or "absurd humor"?

8. **Thematic element resonating with undemanding novels?** *Our Evenings* made him cry, and his books are undemanding but emotional. Maybe "emotional depth without complexity" or "simple yet moving narratives"?

9. **Character archetype inspired by Enid Blyton?** Enid Blyton is mentioned for dinner; Norton might use her style to satirize. Blyton is known for children's adventure. Maybe "wholesome protagonist" or "innocent everyman" to contrast with changing storytelling?

10. **Question for Nnedi Okorafor?** Norton writes happy romances despite past misery. Okorafor's novel is autobiographical. He might ask about balancing personal trauma with hope. "How do you balance personal trauma with hopeful narratives?"

11. **Term for his novels?** The article says "pure entertainment" and "undemanding". The question asks the term he uses. The answer is "pure entertainment".

12. **Crime writer he hasn't read?** He says he's never read Patricia Highsmith. So "Patricia Highsmith".

13. **Couple in Pop Art?** Robert and Ethel Scull. Directly stated in the article.

14. **Novel about life's retrospective?** "A Tale of Two Cities" with Carton's reflection. So that's the answer.

15. **Crime writer out of print?** Dorothy Salisbury Davis.

16. **Writer causing snorts?** David Sedaris.

17. **Character in first happy romance?** Frankie.

18. **Work he tried to adapt?** *Misfortune* by Wesley Stace.

19. **Reflective passage by whom?** Charles Dickens in "A Tale of Two Cities".

20. **Novelist's age?** The prosecutor is 77, novelist is 75 (Turow). So 75.

Now I need to check each answer against the text to ensure accuracy. Let me go through again quickly.

1. The question connects Dickens to Jono. The article links Dickens to Frankie's reflections, not Jono. So N/A.

2. *A Gentle Murderer* is unsettling. *Presumed Guilty* involves a prosecutor. Maybe moral ambiguity or unsettling elements. The article says "unsettling and unlike anything today" so "moral ambiguity" or "unsettling plot twists".

3. Han Kang's book and Frankie's reflections on life's weight. The article says both involve considering life's end. So "the emotional weight of life's reflections".

4. Sculls were taxicab entrepreneurs. African Renaissance has new publishers. So "taxi mogul-inspired publisher" but the article says "unconventional entrepreneur in publishing" maybe? The answer should be "taxicab impresario-inspired character".

Wait, the article says "taxicab impresario" for Sculls. So the character would be an unconventional entrepreneur in the publishing scene, like a "taxi mogul in publishing".

5. *Parade* is on his nightstand. He says his books are undemanding. If *Parade* is demanding, that's the aspect. The article doesn't specify, but since he avoids demanding, maybe "complex narrative structure".

6. *Misfortune* has wild plot twists. He wants to adapt it. Since he wrote a happy romance, maybe he'd focus on the "wild plot twists".

7. Sedaris uses absurd humor. Answer is "absurd humor" or "hyperbole".

8. Thematic element in *Our Evenings* that resonates with his undemanding but emotional books. "Emotional depth through simple narratives".

9. Enid Blyton's archetype. The article mentions dinner with Blyton to talk about her after she leaves. Maybe a "wholesome protagonist" to contrast with the new African publishing's changes. Or "innocent everyman".

10. Question for Okorafor: since Norton writes happy despite misery, he might ask about balancing personal trauma with hope. The article says Okorafor's novel is autobiographical and explores a traumatic event. So "How do you balance personal trauma with hopeful narratives?"

11. The exact term he uses is "pure entertainment".

12. Patricia Highsmith.

13. Robert and Ethel Scull.

14. "A Tale of Two Cities".

15. Dorothy Salisbury Davis.

16. David Sedaris.

17. Frankie.

18. Wesley Stace's *Misfortune*.

19. Charles Dickens.

20. 75.
