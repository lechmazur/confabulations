Okay, I need to tackle these questions based solely on the provided article. Let me go through each one step by step.

1. **Harlem Renaissance writer influencing "new jack" terminology**: The article mentions Cooper read Langston Hughes and Wallace Thurman at the Schomburg Center. The question asks for the primary influence. Since it's about developing the "new jack" term, the article doesn't specify a primary one, just lists them. But maybe "N/A" since it's not stated which was primary.

Wait, the question says "primary influence for developing the 'new jack' terminology". The article doesn't link any specific Harlem Renaissance writer to the term's development. So answer N/A.

2. **Copies sold of Baltimore teen murders piece**: The article says he won an award for the 1987 article, but doesn't mention copies sold. So N/A.

3. **Drug kingpin inspiring Nino Brown**: The article says the screenplay was based on Nicky Barnes, but Cooper updated it to the crack era. The character Nino Brown is fictional, so no real person named here. Answer N/A.

4. **Award in 1989 for hip-hop/drug coverage**: The article mentions he won in 1987 from NABJ for the Baltimore article. 1989 isn't mentioned. So N/A.

5. **Box office revenue adjusted to 1994 dollars**: The article states "New Jack City" earned nearly $50 million. The other two films' earnings aren't given, and adjusted figures aren't mentioned. So N/A.

6. **First Voice piece subject before George Clinton**: The first piece was "The Gospel According to Parliament" about George Clinton. Wait, the question is about before that? The article says his first Voice piece was about Clinton. So the answer might be N/A, unless there's another. Wait, the article says "embarked on a journalism career with a piece for The Voice, 'The Gospel According to Parliament,' about George Clinton." So no prior Voice piece. Answer N/A.

7. **Baltimore community center for workshops**: The article mentions he had to leave LA for a year due to a plea deal but doesn't name a community center. So N/A.

8. **Studio exec offering three-picture deal before Quincy Jones**: The article says after the "Kids Killing Kids" article, he flew to meet Quincy Jones two weeks later. No mention of another exec offering a deal first. So N/A.

9. **Original title of New Jack City's screenplay**: The article says Wright's script was about Nicky Barnes. The original title might be the same as the film, or maybe not. The article doesn't state the original title. Answer N/A.

10. **Episodes of "Blood on the Wall$"?**: The article says he made a semi-autobiographical web series but doesn't specify how many episodes. So N/A.

11. **Film directed by Spike Lee in Trilogy**: The trilogy includes "New Jack City," "Sugar Hill," and "Above the Rim." The article says Spike Lee's film was the basis for the Netflix series, but Cooper's films don't mention Spike Lee directing any. So N/A.

12. **Years as Voice staff reporter**: The article says he wrote for Voice in 1980 and his career thrived in the 80s, but doesn't specify years as staff. So N/A.

13. **Unpublished novel basis for web series**: The article mentions the web series is semi-autobiographical but doesn't name a novel. N/A.

14. **Actor from Above the Rim for Nino Brown**: The article says Tupac was in "Above the Rim," but Cooper chose Wesley Snipes for Nino. It doesn't say Tupac was intended. So N/A.

15. **Charmaine's cancer type**: The article only states she died in 2022, no cause. N/A.

16. **Harlem poet influencing Sugar Hill dialogue**: The article mentions Cooper referenced Harlem Renaissance in context of "Sugar Hill" wanting to put it in a modern context. Langston Hughes is mentioned as someone he read. Maybe Hughes? But the question is about the 2007 interview. The article says in 2007 he mentioned wanting to use Harlem Renaissance like Gatsby. The specific poet isn't named here. So N/A.

17. **Episodes adapted from Nicky Barnes screenplay**: The article says he wrote episodes for "She's Gotta Have It" but not from his own unproduced screenplay. N/A.

18. **Nightclub assault location**: The article mentions arrest for assault in 1997 but no nightclub name. N/A.

19. **Collaborator on George Clinton film**: The article doesn't mention a Pulitzer winner he collaborated with. N/A.

20. **Total box office adjusted to 2024**: Only "New Jack City" made nearly $50M. Others' earnings aren't given, and 2024 adjustment isn't in text. N/A.

Wait, let me check again for question 16. The article says in 2007 he wanted to "take Harlem and the Renaissance and put it in a modern context." The Harlem Renaissance writers mentioned were Hughes and Thurman. The question is about the dialogue style in "Sugar Hill." The article also says he wanted to put it in a literary context like "The Great Gatsby." But the specific poet isn't named here. So still N/A.

Similarly, question 6: The first Voice piece was about George Clinton. So the question is wrong in asking about before that, so answer N/A.

All right, proceeding with answers as N/A where info isn't present.
