Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict instructions. Let me start by skimming through the questions again to see what each is asking.

1. The first question asks which federal agency Elon Musk proposed to eliminate first as co-leader of DOGE. The article mentions that Musk and Ramaswamy are co-leaders of DOGE and they want to slash bureaucracy, but it doesn't specify any particular agency to eliminate first. So maybe N/A?

2. The second question is about how many Liberty League pamphlets cited the "tentacles" quote. The article says "a group of businesspeople created the American Liberty League to attack the New Deal... In the lurid rhetoric of one Liberty League pamphlet..." So only one pamphlet is mentioned. Answer should be 1.

3. The third question asks which Turkish political figure developed the "deep state" concept. The article mentions that the term "deep state" was used in Turkey, but doesn't name a specific person. So N/A.

4. Fourth question: Russell Vought's percentage reduction in federal workforce during his first term. The article says he was director of OMB during Trump's first term but doesn't mention a specific percentage. N/A.

5. Fifth question: Literary character from "Little Dorrit" referenced by David Foster Wallace. The article mentions Dickens' "Little Dorrit" describes the Circumlocution Office. But the question says David Foster Wallace referenced it. Wait, the article says "David Foster Wallace's 'The Pale King'" and mentions that "Little Dorrit" is by Dickens. There's no mention of Wallace referencing that character. So N/A.

6. Sixth question: Number of 1776 Commission members who approved the Wilson-Mussolini comparison. The article says the 1776 Commission published a report comparing Wilson to Mussolini, but doesn't state how many members voted for it. N/A.

7. Seventh question: Total budget for DOGE. The article doesn't mention a specific budget figure. N/A.

8. Eighth question: Obama-era policy Jennifer Pahlka identified as causing risk aversion. The article states Pahlka argued that a "bureaucratic fetish for caution and compliance" compounded risk aversion, but doesn't name a specific policy. N/A.

9. Ninth question: Number of civil servants interviewed by Michael Lewis for his book. The article mentions Lewis's book "Who Is Government?" but doesn't specify how many interviews he conducted. N/A.

10. Tenth question: Timeline JD Vance outlined for his Hungary-inspired strategy. The article says Vance admires Orban's approach and mentions "reinstitutionalize the right," but no specific timeline. N/A.

11. Eleventh question: The figure who used "deconstruct the administrative state" and mentioned "Praetorian Guard deep state." The article says Stephen Bannon used the phrase for nearly a decade and mentioned the Praetorian Guard in his discussion with David Brooks. So answer is Stephen K. Bannon.

12. Twelfth question: Co-leader with Musk at DOGE. The article states Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are co-leaders. So Vivek Ramaswamy.

13. Thirteenth question: Appointee quoted wanting workers to feel like villains. The article quotes Russell Vought: "We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected..." So Russell Vought.

14. Fourteenth question: Term favored over "administrative state." The article says Trump prefers "deep state" over "administrative state." So "deep state."

15. Fifteenth question: Anthropologist who decried politicization in 2015. The article mentions James C. Scott and David Graeber on the left, and Graeber lamented in 2015 the right's use of anti-bureaucratic sentiment. So David Graeber.

16. Sixteenth question: Initiative comparing Wilson to Mussolini. The 1776 Commission's report did that. So "the 1776 Commission."

17. Seventeenth question: Federal agency that expanded during Trump's first term. The article says "Department of Homeland Security was one of the few agencies that actually grew." So Department of Homeland Security.

18. Eighteenth question: Executive order to fire civil servants, later revived. The article mentions "Schedule F" was issued by Trump, rescinded by Biden, and now being revived. So Schedule F.

19. Nineteenth question: Number of U.S. civilian employees. The article states "more than 2.2 million civilians." So 2.2 million.

20. Twentieth question: Nation with critical minerals mentioned. The article's last section says Canada's minerals are behind Trump's comments about making it a state. So Canada.
