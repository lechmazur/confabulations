Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **How many awards did Barbara J. Haveland win for her translation of the Danish septology?**
   - The article mentions Barbara J. Haveland as the translator, but there's no mention of awards. So answer is N/A.

2. **What was the name of the village in northern France where Tara Selter burned her hand on an old gas heater?**
   - The article says Tara is from Clairon-sous-Bois, a fictional village in northern France. The burning happened at Philip's shop, but the village is Clairon-sous-Bois.

3. **What item did Tara Selter purchase for her clients at the rare-books auction in Bordeaux?**
   - The text states she acquired some titles for her clients at the auction. So the answer is "titles" or "books". The exact items aren't specified beyond that.

4. **In what city did Tara encounter crowds from a soccer match, leading to a "faint frisson"?**
   - The article mentions Dusseldorf as where she found the soccer match crowds. That's the city.

5. **What was Ned Ryerson's profession?**
   - The article refers to Ned Ryerson as "the resident nudnik in 'Groundhog Day'". His profession in the movie isn't stated here, but since he's part of the movie's cast, maybe he's a mailman? Wait, the article doesn't say. Wait, the text here just mentions him as a character in the movie. The question is about his profession as per the article. The article doesn't specify, so N/A. Wait, actually, the user's question is in the context of the article's mention. The article only refers to him as a character in "Groundhog Day," but doesn't state his job here. So answer N/A.

6. **What was the title of Solvej Balle's debut novel before "On the Calculation of Volume"?**
   - The article doesn't mention any previous novels by Balle. The septology is "On the Calculation of Volume," so unless there's another title mentioned, it's N/A.

7. **What was the original language of the book Georges Perec wrote?**
   - The article mentions Georges Perec in connection with "infraordinary," but doesn't specify his book's original language. Since he's a French author, likely French, but without explicit info, answer N/A.

8. **What is the catalog number of the Roman sestertius coin Tara purchased?**
   - The article doesn't mention a catalog number for the coin, so N/A.

9. **What specific weather did Tara seek for proper winter?**
   - The article says she wanted "a proper winter" and mentions traveling to places that could simulate the weather. The exact type isn't specified beyond seasons, so maybe "cold weather" but the question might expect "snow" or similar? Wait, the text says "simulate the temperatures of her perceived times of year." The answer is "cold temperatures" or "cold weather"? The article says "simulate the temperatures of her perceived times of year" so maybe the answer is "cold temperatures" but the exact term isn't given. Wait, the article says "A proper summer. A proper winter. As if you hadn't done your job until you had delivered a certain sort of weather." So the specific type is just "cold" for winter, but the question asks for the specific type, maybe the article says "cold temperatures" but I don't see exact terms. Hmm. The question is "specific type of weather", maybe "cold weather" but since it's not stated, perhaps N/A? Wait, the text says "simulate the temperatures of her perceived times of year". So the answer would be "cold weather" for winter, but since the article doesn't specify further, maybe N/A. Wait, the user instruction says to use only the text. The article says "simulate the temperatures of her perceived times of year" so the specific type is just "cold temperatures" as part of winter. The exact term isn't given beyond "proper winter," so maybe N/A.

10. **How is the persistent mark on the protagonist first introduced?**
    - The article mentions Tara burns her hand on Philip's heater, which is the first injury that persists. So the answer is "a burn on her hand."

11. **What recurring date is the central temporal landmark?**
    - The date is November 18, which repeats endlessly.

12. **What is the name of the small French village Tara departs on Nov. 17?**
    - Clairon-sous-Bois.

13. **What term from Georges Perec describes her observation?**
    - The article says "infraordinary."

14. **What company does Tara help found?**
    - T. & T. Selter, specializing in 18th-century illustrated works.

15. **What ancient artifact did she acquire as a gift?**
    - A Roman sestertius coin.

16. **What designation is given to her as she notices variations?**
    - The article refers to her as an "expert noticer."

17. **What narrative shift is indicated by her returning home via train instead of staying in Paris?**
    - The loop isn't tied to geography anymore. The article says her loop is decoupled from geography because she takes the train home and Thomas finds her early. So the answer is "decoupled from geography."

18. **What action does she resolve to secure her future?**
    - The last line: "I will have to build it myself."

19. **Which holiday did she invite her family to celebrate?**
    - Christmas, even though it's still November 18 for them.
