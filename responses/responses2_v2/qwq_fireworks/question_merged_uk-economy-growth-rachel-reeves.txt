Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article and not any external knowledge. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which specific banking regulations Rachel Reeves announced would be permanently eliminated. The article mentions that regulators delayed some banking rules for another year, waiting to see what the Trump administration would do. But it doesn't say they were permanently eliminated. So "N/A" because it's only delayed, not eliminated.

2. **Question 2:** This asks about billions in private investment from Chinese partners during Reeves' talks in Beijing. The article says she went to China to restart talks, but there's no mention of specific amounts secured. So "N/A".

3. **Question 3:** The projected GDP growth rate by 2025 through infrastructure. The article states the economy expanded 0.1% in Q3 and forecast to slow to zero in Q4 2024. No 2025 projection is given, so "N/A".

4. **Question 4:** Environmental protection measures as obstacles to Heathrow. The article mentions opposition due to knocking down homes and building a tunnel, but not specific environmental measures. "N/A".

5. **Question 5:** Compensation package for residents. The text doesn't mention any specific compensation details, just that homes would be knocked down. "N/A".

6. **Question 6:** Additional daily flights from the new runway. The article doesn't provide numbers on flight capacity increase. "N/A".

7. **Question 7:** Interest rate level needed to control inflation. The article says the Bank of England might lower rates more, but Reeves didn't specify a rate. "N/A".

8. **Question 8:** Companies relocating to Oxford-Cambridge. The article mentions the government's plans but no specific companies named. "N/A".

9. **Question 9:** Percentage of tax increase for National Wealth Fund. The tax increase was 40 billion, but the article doesn't say how much went to the fund. "N/A".

10. **Question 10:** Number of regulatory barriers identified by CMA. The article mentions the CMA's chair was replaced but no specific number of barriers. "N/A".

11. **Question 11:** Initiative delayed by antitrust regulator similar to National Wealth Fund. The CMA delayed some rules, but the article says they delayed banking rules, not their own initiatives. "N/A".

12. **Question 12:** Percentage job increase from Oxford-Cambridge project like Heathrow's 100k jobs. The article doesn't give a percentage for this project. "N/A".

13. **Question 13:** Type of investment beyond public/private to address the black hole. The article mentions planning reforms and the National Wealth Fund, but no other specific type. "N/A".

14. **Question 14:** Regulatory body's leadership change cited by PwC's CEO. The article says the CMA chair was replaced, and the PwC survey mentioned attractiveness but not the leadership change. Wait, the article says "the chair of the Competition and Markets Authority... was recently replaced" and "the change in leadership was 'an encouraging sign' said Duncan Edwards of BritishAmerican Business". The question mentions PwC's CEO, but the quote is from BritishAmerican Business. So "N/A" since it's not PwC's CEO.

15. **Question 15:** Measure like building houses to help mortgage holders. The article mentions the Bank might lower rates, but the question asks for a measure similar to building houses. The tax increase and other policies are mentioned, but nothing like that. "N/A".

16. **Question 16:** Growth rate for Q3 2024 by Mahmood Pradhan. The article says the economy expanded 0.1% in Q3 (probably 2023?), and forecast to zero in Q4 2024. Pradhan's comment is about growth taking time but no specific rate given. "N/A".

17. **Question 17:** Other project requiring knocking down homes like Antigua's. The Antigua project was about a blood filter, not infrastructure. The Heathrow expansion involves homes, but the question asks for another project. The article mentions Oxford-Cambridge development but not home demolitions. "N/A".

18. **Question 18:** Action to address environmental groups blocking projects. The article says it's easier to build houses and harder for environmental groups to block in court. So the action is making it harder for them in court. Answer: "making it harder for environmental groups to block infrastructure projects in court".

19. **Question 19:** Trans-Atlantic lobby group's name. The article mentions BritishAmerican Business, whose CEO Duncan Edwards said people are frustrated. The question asks for the group's name. Answer: "BritishAmerican Business".

20. **Question 20:** Projected decrease in interest rates by Amundi's survey. The article says analysts predict the Bank will lower rates more than markets suggest, but Amundi's Pradhan is quoted about growth and budgets. The survey by PwC mentioned investment attractiveness, not rates. "N/A".
