Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I use only the article provided. Let me start by going through each question and cross-referencing the article.

1. The first question asks about YouTube's initiative similar to Meta's Community Notes. The article mentions, "YouTube began testing a version of Community Notes, though it was described as more of a supplemental feature." So the answer is Community Notes.

2. The second question is about the impact on crude oil prices due to Trump's comments. The article states, "crude oil prices on a steady rise in recent weeks." The exact impact is that they rose, so the answer is "steady rise."

3. The third question asks for another tech company's CEO contributing to Trump's inauguration besides the ones listed. The article mentions Sam Altman of OpenAI as having chipped in. OpenAI is a tech company, so the answer is OpenAI.

4. Fourth question about Banzai's Bitcoin holdings. The article says Banzai invested in Bitcoin, but shareholders were alarmed. However, there's no figure given for their holdings. So answer N/A.

5. Fifth question: EU's prior action against Meta. The article says the EU "has sought to punish companies, including Meta, for insufficiently policing their platforms." So the action is punishing for insufficient policing.

6. Sixth question: JPMorgan's required days. The article says employees were required to be in three days a week, but 60% are already full-time. The question asks for the percentage different from full-time, which is 3 days. Wait, the question says "initially required to work three days a week" so the answer is 3.

7. Seventh question: Green energy company besides Tesla that declined. The article mentions Tesla and "green energy and companies including Tesla slumped." No other named company, so N/A.

8. Eighth question: total amount aimed for inauguration. The article states "record haul of at least $150 million." But the question asks for exceeding disclosed donations, but the article doesn't mention a higher target, so the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says "at least $150 million" which is the disclosed, but the question asks for total amount including undisclosed. Since it's not mentioned, N/A.

9. Ninth question: traditional treasury's favored security besides Treasuries. The article says "steady, predictable securities like U.S. government bonds and money market funds." So money market funds.

10. Tenth: who benefits from corporate adjustments? The article mentions Trump, so answer Trump.

11. Eleventh: valuation tripled. The article says Anthropic is valued at $60 billion, triple previous year's $20 billion. So $60 billion.

12. Twelfth: detail about workers relocated to Texas. The article says "many such workers are already based there." So the irony is they were already in Texas.

13. Thirteenth: donation to political fund by tech giant. The article mentions Meta's $1 million donation to Trump's inaugural fund.

14. Fourteenth: MicroStrategy's Bitcoin stockpile. The article states "now sits on a stockpile worth over $40 billion."

15. Fifteenth: record fundraising for inauguration. The article says "record haul of at least $150 million" with previous record being $107 million. So $150 million.

16. Sixteenth: rallying statement by Zuckerberg. The article quotes him saying "get back to our roots around free expression."

17. Seventeenth: international entity critiqued. The EU is mentioned as the entity being referenced when Trump talked about foreign governments.

18. Eighteenth: JPMorgan's mandated days. The article says "five days a week."

19. Nineteenth: long-term debt instrument with yield rise. The article mentions "the yield on the 10-year Treasury note hit a roughly nine-month high."

Now, let me check each again to ensure accuracy and that I didn't miss anything.
