Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article. 

1. The first question asks what percentage of Christie's 2023 sales the $887 million from RM Sotheby's represented. The article states that RM Sotheby's turned over $887 million in classic auto sales last year (2024?), but Christie's 2023 sales data isn't directly provided. The text mentions Christie's 2022 turnover was $8.4 billion and 2024 projected sales were $5.7 billion. There's no 2023 figure for Christie's, so this can't be calculated. Answer: N/A.

2. The second question is about how many employees Patrick Drahi laid off from Christie's. The article says Sotheby's laid off over 100 employees, not Christie's. Drahi owns Sotheby's, so the question mixes up the companies. Answer: N/A.

3. The third question asks for the total value of private sales at Sotheby's in 2024 considering yacht market growth. The article states Sotheby's projected $6B in total sales (auction + private), but the exact private sales figure isn't given. Answer: N/A.

4. The Alexander McQueen experience was auctioned by Sotheby's, not Christie's, per the text. The price isn't revealed, only the estimate. Answer: N/A.

5. Christie's 2022 was $8.4B, 2024 is projected at $5.7B. The decrease from 2022 to 2024: (8.4-5.7)/8.4 = 32.14%. But the question mentions 2023 vs 2024. The 2023 data for Christie's is only that sales were down 6% from 2023 to 2024. So 2023 was 5.7B / 0.94 ≈ 6.06B. 2022 was 8.4B. The decrease from 2022 to 2024 would be (8.4-5.7)/8.4=32.14%, but the question asks between 2022 and 2024 for Christie's. But the question says "between 2022 and 2024", so that's a two-year span. The answer would be 32.14%, but the exact numbers aren't given directly. Wait, the question is phrased as "between 2022 and 2024"—so the decrease from 2022 to 2024. The 2022 was 8.4B, 2024 is 5.7B. So (8.4 -5.7)/8.4 = 32.14%. The article doesn't state this as a percentage, but can we calculate it? The question says "given the $60B debt of Altice"—but Altice is Sotheby's owner, not Christie's. The question might have a wrong premise. Since the question's premise might be incorrect (since Altice is Drahi's company, which owns Sotheby's, not Christie's), then answer N/A. Alternatively, if the question is just asking the percentage decrease for Christie's between 2022 and 2024, regardless of the debt, then 32.14%. But since the article says Christie's 2022 was 8.4B and 2024 is 5.7B, so (8.4-5.7)/8.4 is 32.14%, which can be rounded. But the question says "given the $60B debt"—since that debt is unrelated to Christie's, maybe the question has an incorrect premise. So the answer might be N/A. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is okay. The debt part is just context, but the actual numbers are there. Since the question is about Christie's, which is owned by Pinault, not Drahi's Altice. So the debt part is irrelevant, but the question still asks for the percentage decrease between 2022 and 2024 for Christie's. So the answer is (8.4-5.7)/8.4 = 32.14%, so 32%? But the article doesn't state it as a percentage, so maybe it's better to calculate it. Let me check: 8.4B to 5.7B. 5.7 is 5.7/8.4=0.675, so 32.5% decrease. But since the question asks for the percentage decrease, the answer would be 32% or 32.14%. But the article might not explicitly state that. The article says in 2022, Christie's was $8.4B, and in 2024 projected $5.7B. So the decrease is (8.4 -5.7)/8.4 *100 = 32.14%. Since the user wants exact answer, maybe 32%? But the exact number would be 32.14%, but since the article doesn't give a rounded number, perhaps N/A? Wait, the question says "given the $60 billion of debt of Altice"—since Altice is Sotheby's owner, not Christie's, this is a wrong premise. Therefore, the question's premise is incorrect, so answer N/A.

6. The cryptocurrency investor who bought the duct-taped banana isn't named in the article. The article mentions the sale at Sotheby's but not the buyer's name. Answer: N/A.

7. The investment in Paris headquarters: the article says Sotheby's made costly infrastructure decisions including the Breuer Building ($100M), new Paris HQ, and Hong Kong space. But the exact amount for Paris isn't given. Answer: N/A.

8. Combined 2023 turnover: In 2023, Sotheby's had $6B (down 24% from 2023? Wait, the article says in 2024, Sotheby's estimated $6B, which is a 24% decline from 2023. So 2023 Sotheby's was 6B / (1-0.24) = ~7.9B? Wait, the article says "Sotheby's estimated it would have turned over about $6 billion in auction and private sales by year-end, a decline of 24 percent on 2023." So 2024's Sotheby's is 6B, which is 24% less than 2023. So 2023 Sotheby's was 6 / 0.76 ≈ 7.89B. Christie's 2024 is $5.7B, which is a 6% drop from 2023. So Christie's 2023 was 5.7 / 0.94 ≈ 6.06B. So combined 2023 would be 7.89 +6.06≈13.95B. But the question asks for 2023 combined turnover. The article doesn't state this directly, so it's an inference. The question says "combined turnover of Sotheby's and Christie's in 2023". Since we can calculate it via the given 2024 numbers and the percentages, but the question might require exact figures. However, the article mentions that in 2022, their combined was 8+8.4=16.4B. But 2023's numbers are inferred. Since the question is about 2023, and the article doesn't explicitly state the 2023 numbers, maybe N/A? Or perhaps the user expects the inferred value. But the instructions say to use only the article's facts. Since the article doesn't give 2023 numbers directly, answer N/A.

9. The former Christie's executive who pioneered dinosaur skeleton sales and later advised on finance: The article mentions Doug Woodham as a former Christie's executive advising on art finance. But dinosaur sales were pioneered by Sotheby's? The text says Christie's started handbag auctions in 2014, and Sotheby's is now offering dinosaur fossils. The question mentions "dinosaur skeleton sales"—the article says Christie's had to catch up with Sotheby's offering like dinosaur skeletons. The person who pioneered handbag sales at Christie's in 2014 is Doug Woodham. The question says "pioneered dinosaur skeleton sales"—so maybe not him. The article doesn't mention who pioneered dinosaur skeleton sales. So answer N/A.

10. The shift to luxury began coinciding with Salvator Mundi's 2017 sale. The article mentions the 2017 sale, but the shift started when? The article says Sotheby's and Christie's started luxury sales in response to the downturn. The article mentions the 2017 record, but the shift to luxury started in the downturn of the last two years (as of 2024, so 2023 and 2022). The article states that in 2014 Christie's introduced handbag auctions. So maybe the shift to luxury began in 2014, but the question ties it to Salvator Mundi's 2017 sale. The article doesn't explicitly state that the shift began in 2017. The article says "the auction houses are making major bets on selling..." due to the downturn in 2024. The handbag auctions started in 2014, so the answer would be 2014? But the question says coinciding with Salvator Mundi's 2017 sale. Since the shift to luxury goods (like handbags) started in 2014, which is before 2017, the answer might be N/A. Alternatively, if the question is when the shift to luxury began in response to the downturn, but the downturn is recent. The article says "the auction houses are making major bets on selling..." now (2024). The shift to luxury started earlier (2014 for handbags), so the answer might be N/A because the question links it to 2017's sale. The article doesn't say the shift began in 2017. So answer N/A.
