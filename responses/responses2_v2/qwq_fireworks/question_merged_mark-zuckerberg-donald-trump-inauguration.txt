Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based strictly on the provided article. I need to make sure I don't look anywhere else and only use the information given. Let's go step by step.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which Republican donor partnered with Zuckerberg at Mar-a-Lago to discuss DEI policy changes. The article mentions Zuckerberg went to Trump's Mar-a-Lago and that he hosted a party with Miriam Adelson and Todd Ricketts. Wait, the question specifies "at Mar-a-Largo where tech leaders discussed DEI policy changes." Wait, the DEI section in the article says West Point ended clubs due to Trump's DEI ban. The Mar-a-Lago meeting isn't linked to DEI in the text. The partners at the reception are Adelson and Ricketts, but the question is about the Mar-a-Lago meeting. The article says he went to Mar-a-Lago but doesn't mention a Republican donor there. So maybe N/A?

Wait, the question says "partnered with Zuckerberg to organize the pre-inauguration dinner at Mar-a-Lago where tech leaders discussed DEI policy changes." The article says the dinner was the black-tie reception on Jan 20, hosted by Zuckerberg, Adelson, and Ricketts. The DEI part is a separate section mentioning West Point. The article doesn't link the Mar-a-Lago visit to the dinner or DEI discussions. So maybe the question conflates events. Since the article doesn't say who partnered with him at Mar-a-Lago specifically for DEI, the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many student organizations did West Point eliminate? The DEI section says "ended a dozen student clubs." A dozen is 12. So the answer is 12.

3. **Question 3:** Total monetary contribution by Meta to Trump's inaugural committee? The article says some companies donated without guaranteed seats, but doesn't mention Meta's contribution. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Which tech CEO declined their invitation after board backlash? The article mentions Cook, Bezos, Musk, Zuckerberg. It says Zuckerberg hosted, Cook is expected on the dais, Bezos might be there. No one is mentioned as declining. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** When did Trudeau raise concerns with Meta about minerals? The article says Trudeau talked with business leaders about Canada's minerals being behind Trump's comments, but doesn't mention a specific time or Meta. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** What role did Ricketts propose for USAID in the migrant facility? The article mentions USAID closure by Trump, and migrants in Guantanamo. But Ricketts' role isn't stated here. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** How many First Amendment cases did Trump file against media? The article says lawsuits against CBS and Des Moines Register, so two. Answer: 2.

8. **Question 8:** Which Al Qaeda detainees were relocated? The article says migrants are held in the same prison as those accused of being Al Qaeda members, but doesn't name any specific detainees. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** What security measures did Apple implement for Cook? The article doesn't mention Apple's security measures for Cook's appearance. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Who oversaw coordination between Meta's policies and West Point's clubs? The article links Zuckerberg's changes and West Point's DEI ban, but no one is named as overseeing it. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Which tech leader is seated despite distancing from previous events? The article says Zuckerberg didn't attend previous inaugurations but is now hosting. So answer: Mark Zuckerberg.

12. **Question 12:** Who made headlines for changes after election despite not hosting before? The article says Zuckerberg had changes since the election and hadn't hosted before. So again, Zuckerberg.

13. **Question 13:** Which agency Trump targeted for closure? The USAID section says Trump called for its closure. Answer: U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

14. **Question 14:** Whose reps declined comment on their role despite involvement? Bezos' reps didn't return requests. So Jeff Bezos.

15. **Question 15:** Which military academy ended clubs? West Point.

16. **Question 16:** Whose leadership is linked to minerals and territorial comments? Trudeau discussed Canada's minerals and Trump's state comment. So Trudeau.

17. **Question 17:** Whose lawsuits against media lack merit but intimidate? The article says Trump's cases against CBS and Register lack merit but are effective. So Donald J. Trump.

18. **Question 18:** Which prison held migrants like Guantanamo? The article states Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. So Guantanamo Bay prison.
