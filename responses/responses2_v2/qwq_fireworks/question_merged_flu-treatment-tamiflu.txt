Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict instructions. Let's start with the first question.

1. The first question asks about the percentage of flu-related deaths among patients who didn't receive Tamiflu within 48 hours. The article mentions that there's debate on whether Tamiflu prevents deaths, but it says some evidence suggests it may reduce death risk in hospitalized adults when taken early. However, there's no specific percentage given for deaths among those not taking it in time. So I should answer N/A here.

2. The second question is about which medical center did clinical trials comparing recovery times. The article doesn't mention any specific medical center conducting such trials. It references Dr. Schaffner from Vanderbilt and others, but no trial info. So N/A again.

3. The third question asks for the average reduction in hospital stay for elderly patients. The article states Tamiflu can speed recovery by about a day but doesn't specify hospitalization length reduction. So N/A.

4. Fourth question: number of hallucinations in Japanese kids. The article mentions rare reports in Japan but no specific number. So N/A.

5. Fifth question: dosage schedule recommended by Dr. Schaffner. The article doesn't specify his recommended dosage, just mentions it's not a cure. N/A.

6. Sixth question: demographic with highest nausea rate per Mount Sinai research. The article cites Dr. Liu from Mount Sinai but the nausea stats are from Dr. O'Leary, and the demographic isn't specified. So N/A.

7. Seventh question: resistance in nursing home residents. The article talks about using Tamiflu in outbreaks but doesn't mention resistance rates. N/A.

8. Eighth: weeks of CDC data for Xofluza in pregnancy. The article says CDC doesn't recommend Xofluza for pregnant women but no data timeframe. N/A.

9. Ninth: time difference between Tamiflu and Relenza. The article compares the drugs but no specific time difference. N/A.

10. Tenth: state with highest bird flu cases treated. No states mentioned. N/A.

11. Eleventh question: antiviral for someone with flu symptoms and heart disease. The CDC recommends Tamiflu for those with chronic conditions like heart disease. So answer Tamiflu.

12. Twelfth: medication causing hallucinations. The article says Tamiflu has rare cases of hallucinations in kids. So Tamiflu.

13. Thirteenth: treatment for nursing home outbreak with avian and seasonal flu. The article says Tamiflu is recommended for bird flu and in nursing homes during outbreaks. So Tamiflu.

14. Fourteenth: antiviral for under 2 and chronic conditions. The CDC recommends Tamiflu for under 2. Xofluza is for 12+ except some kids. So Tamiflu again.

15. Fifteenth: treatment for dual flu and Covid with rapid test. The article mentions Tamiflu for flu, but since it's a dual test, the advice is to ask about Tamiflu. So Tamiflu.

16. Sixteenth: IV antiviral for under 6 months. The article lists Rapivab as IV for 6 months+. So Rapivab.

17. Seventeenth: drug blocking virus spread with 1 day benefit. The article says Tamiflu does this. So Tamiflu.

18. Eighteenth: hospitalizations number. The article states 160,000 hospitalizations. So 160000.

19. Nineteenth: drug not for pregnant/breastfeeding. The article says Xofluza isn't recommended. So Xofluza.

20. Twentieth: best preventive measure. The article emphasizes flu shots over Tamiflu. So flu shot.
