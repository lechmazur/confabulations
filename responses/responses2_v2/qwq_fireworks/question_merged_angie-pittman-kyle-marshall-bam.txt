Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by going through each question and cross-referencing the article.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks which choreographer used a direct quote from Audre Lorde about darkness and tribal aesthetics with white facial markings. The article mentions Angie Pittman quoting Audre Lorde in the "Night" section. The tribal aesthetics and white marks are mentioned in Kyle Marshall's "Joan" with Edo Tastic's design. Wait, but the quote is from Pittman. The tribal part is in Marshall's piece. So the answer might be Angie Pittman for the quote and Kyle Marshall for the tribal. But the question combines both elements. Wait the question is asking for the choreographer who incorporated both the quote and the tribal aesthetics with white facial markings. But Pittman's piece has the quote, and Marshall's has the tribal elements. Since they are separate performances, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait no, the question says "incorporated a direct quote from Audre Lorde about the transformative power of darkness into a performance involving tribal aesthetics and white facial markings?" But Pittman's performance's "Night" section has the quote, but the tribal aesthetics are part of Marshall's "Joan". So the answer would be N/A because those elements are in separate works. Wait, the question is phrased as "a performance involving tribal aesthetics..." but the tribal part is in Marshall's piece. So the answer is N/A? Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The article says Pittman's work has the quote, and Marshall's has the tribal aesthetics. So the choreographer who did both would be N/A. Wait the question is asking for a single performance that includes both elements. Since they are in different pieces, the answer must be N/A. Wait but the question might be a trick, but I have to check again.

Wait, the article says: Pittman's "Night" section quotes Audre Lorde. Then, in Marshall's "Joan", the costuming is tribal with white marks. So the answer is N/A because the elements are in different performances. But the question says "a performance involving tribal aesthetics..." which is part of Marshall's work, but the quote is from Pittman. So the answer is N/A.

Wait, but maybe the question is a trick? Let me see again. Wait the first part: "incorporated a direct quote from Audre Lorde about the transformative power of darkness into a performance involving tribal aesthetics and white facial markings?" The performance in question must have both the quote and the tribal elements. Since Pittman's performance has the quote but not the tribal marks (those are in Marshall's), the answer is N/A. Wait but maybe I missed something. Let me check the text again.

Looking back: "Pittman's partially improvised work [...] 'Night' [...] quotes Audre Lorde about the dark, ancient places of possibility [...] The tribal aesthetic is in Marshall's 'Joan' with Edo Tastic's design. So the answer is N/A for question 1.

Wait, but maybe the question is a bit different. Let me check the exact wording. The question says "transformative power of darkness" which matches the Audre Lorde quote about "dark, ancient places of possibility". So that's Pittman's work. The tribal aesthetics with white marks are in Marshall's. So the answer is N/A. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me proceed and come back.

2. **Question 2:** The question is about which historical figure's writings on Afrofuturism did Angie Pittman reference during the "Night" section, which also used a sample from "I Be So Glad When the Sun Goes Down". The article says Pittman paraphrased Sun Ra, the Afrofuturist jazz musician. Wait the first paragraph mentions: "Angie Pittman said those words onstage Saturday, paraphrasing the Afrofuturist jazz musician Sun Ra." So the answer is Sun Ra. Wait the question is about the "Night" section? Wait the quote from Sun Ra was in the beginning, in the "Day" section perhaps? Wait the article says: "The end of the world and a martyred saint might sound bleak, but the program [...] was instead a thrilling combination [...] Pittman's [...] work [...] The first part [...] 'Day' [...] gradually, fragments of song [...] accumulating into the spiritual [...] In 'Night', the choreographer dons a cape [...] Pittman explicates ideas [...] The crash [...] turns out to be a sample of clanking labor in the work song [...] "I Be So Glad When the Sun Goes Down." So the sample is in "Night". The reference to Sun Ra was in the initial quote ("It's after the end of the world. Don't we know that yet?") which was part of Pittman's opening, perhaps in "Day". The "Night" section has the quote from Audre Lorde and the vampire reference. Wait the historical figure's writings on Afrofuturism referenced in "Night" would be... the question is asking for a historical figure whose writings on Afrofuturism were referenced. The only Afrofuturist mentioned is Sun Ra, but he's a musician. The quote in "Night" is Audre Lorde, but she's not about Afrofuturism. Wait, the question says "writings on Afrofuturism". The only Afrofuturist mentioned is Sun Ra. But the quote from him was in the opening. The question's sample is from the labor song, which is part of the "Night" section. The historical figure here would be Sun Ra, but he's a musician, not a historical figure in the sense of a writer? Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait the question says "historical figure's writings on Afrofuturism". The only possible is Sun Ra. Even though he's a musician, the question might accept him. So answer: Sun Ra.

3. **Question 3:** The composer whose 1981 cello piece was used in a work compared to Brown's "Grace" in terms of cumulative impact. The article mentions Julius Eastman's "The Holy Presence of Joan d'Arc" used in Kyle Marshall's "Joan". The comparison to Brown's "Grace" is in the last paragraph: "Ronald K. Brown's dance, 'Grace,' has become an enduring classic [...]". The article says of "Joan": "the cumulative impact is strong." So the composer is Julius Eastman.

4. **Question 4:** Which vampire film did Kyle Marshall reference in "Joan" to parallel Joan of Arc's martyrdom? The article says Pittman mentioned Wesley Snipes in "Blade" as their favorite vampire. Wait the question is about Kyle Marshall's "Joan". The article says Pittman's "Night" section references "Blade" (Wesley Snipes). So maybe the question is mixing up the choreographers. Wait the question says Kyle Marshall referenced a vampire film in his "Joan" choreography. But the article doesn't mention Kyle Marshall referencing a vampire film. The vampire reference is in Pittman's work. So answer N/A.

Wait the question says "Kyle Marshall referenced in his choreography for 'Joan' drawing parallels between its protagonist and Joan of Arc's martyrdom?" But the vampire reference is in Pittman's "Night" section. So the answer is N/A.

5. **Question 5:** How does the article connect Maria Tallchief's centennial to resistance themes in the festival? The article mentions Maria Tallchief's celebration in her centennial year by NYC Ballet, but the only connection to resistance is in the festival's works. The article doesn't explicitly link her celebration to the festival's themes. The question is about connection made in the article. Since the article just lists her centennial celebration in the same paragraph as other mentions (West Coast Swing, Baryshnikov, etc.), there's no explicit connection. So answer N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The sound design element that made the reviewer think live gospel singers were present in "Day" section. The article says: "Cody Jensen's sound design is so vivid that I turned to look for the singers." The gospel harmonizing is a recording by Ther'Up.Y. The sound design element causing this is the vivid sound design of Cody Jensen, so the answer is Cody Jensen's sound design. Wait the question asks for the specific element. The article says "the gospel harmonizing begins, but it's a recording [...] Cody Jensen's sound design is so vivid [...]". The element would be the recording by Ther'Up.Y, but the question is about Jensen's sound design. The answer is "Cody Jensen's sound design" or the vividness? Wait the question is "specific element of Cody Jensen's sound design [...] caused [...]". The article says the sound design made the reviewer think live singers were there. The element is the vividness of the sound design, but perhaps the specific element is the recording's clarity? The answer might be the recording by Ther'Up.Y, but the question specifies Cody Jensen's sound design. The article says Jensen's sound design made it seem like live singers. So the answer is Cody Jensen's sound design (as the element).

7. **Question 7:** Choreographer who emphasizes costuming for revolution and uses aerosol spray to reveal light planes, and quotes Afrofuturist inspirations. The article says Pittman mentions costuming's importance for the revolution. Also, in "Night", Pittman uses an aerosol canister to reveal light planes. They also quote Sun Ra (Afrofuturist). So answer is Angie Pittman.

8. **Question 8:** Work set to Eastman's 1981 cello piece with tribal aesthetics and white face details. That's "Joan" by Kyle Marshall. The article says "tribal aesthetic [...] white marks on their faces like helmet chin straps."

9. **Question 9:** Performance where the artist transitions from gospel in "Day" to a heel drop with a clanking labor sound. The article says in "Day" the heel drop's thump is accompanied by a metallic crash, which is a sample from "I Be So Glad..." So the performance is "Black Life Chord Changes" by Pittman.

10. **Question 10:** Choreographer using Audre Lorde's quote and a vampire film reference (Blade) in one segment. That's Angie Pittman in "Night" section.

11. **Question 11:** Which piece uses the work song sample for the heel drop. The article says the clanking labor sound is from "I Be So Glad..." in Pittman's "Black Life Chord Changes".

12. **Question 12:** Choreographer at BAM Fisher with gospel and sound design. That's Angie Pittman's "Black Life Chord Changes".

13. **Question 13:** Dancer with white circle on one eye in a work inspired by resistance and Eastman's music. The article says Syd Worthy has a white circle around one eye as the Joan figure in Marshall's "Joan".

14. **Question 14:** Celebrated figure honored in centennial by NYC Ballet and linked to modern trends. Maria Tallchief is mentioned in the same paragraph as West Coast Swing and Baryshnikov. The question connects her to the themes of resistance? The article doesn't explicitly link her celebration to the festival's themes, but the question says "highlighted in the article". The answer is Maria Tallchief.

15. **Question 15:** Mikhail Baryshnikov left USSR 50 years ago and champions esoteric art. The article says "Mikhail Baryshnikov insists on using his huge fame to bring attention to difficult, esoteric art. 50 years since he left the Soviet Union".

16. **Question 16:** Choreographer whose work merges saint and Afrofuturist themes with purple neon. That's Angie Pittman's "Black Life Chord Changes" which has a purple neon strip. The saint reference is Joan of Arc (though that's Marshall's work?), but the question says "martyred saint" and Afrofuturist themes. The article says Pittman's work references Sun Ra (Afrofuturist) and the program combines "martyred saint" (Joan) but the question is about the choreographer's own work. Wait the question says "merging ideas of a martyred saint with Afrofuturist themes". The program as a whole combines both, but each piece is separate. Pittman's work has the Afrofuturist elements, and Marshall's has the Joan (martyred saint) but his work is about resistance to slavery and colonialism. The question's description might be about Pittman's work which also has the purple neon. The article says Pittman's work is part of the program that combines the themes. The question is about the choreographer whose piece does this. Since the question mentions "martyred saint", which is part of the program's theme but each piece is separate. Wait the first paragraph says the program was a combination of resisting oppression through creativity, with Pittman's work (Afrofuturist) and Marshall's Joan (martyred saint). So the choreographer whose work merges both? But each work is separate. The question might be referring to the program as a whole, but the question asks for a choreographer. Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait the question says "merging ideas of a martyred saint with Afrofuturist themes". Pittman's work has the Afrofuturist elements (Sun Ra), and the program includes both, but her piece doesn't mention Joan. So the answer is N/A? Wait the question says "martyred saint" and "Afrofuturist themes". The only choreographer with Afrofuturist is Pittman. The "martyred saint" is in Marshall's "Joan", so the answer would be N/A. But the question might be referring to the festival's overall theme? The question specifies "choreographer’s dual-structured work", so the work must be by one choreographer. Since Pittman's work doesn't have the saint reference, answer is N/A. Wait the question says "merges ideas of a martyred saint with Afrofuturist themes". Since the two are separate works, the answer is N/A. But maybe the question is a trick, thinking of the overall program? The question says "choreographer’s dual-structured work", so it must be a single choreographer's piece. Therefore, N/A. Alternatively, maybe the "martyred saint" is part of Pittman's paraphrase of Sun Ra? The opening quote was "It's after the end of the world. Don't we know that yet?" which might relate to the end times, but the saint is Joan in Marshall's piece. So answer N/A. Hmm.

Wait the question says "merging ideas of a martyred saint with Afrofuturist themes and incorporating a strip of purple neon into the stage design". The purple neon is in Pittman's "Day" section. The Afrofuturist themes are hers, but the martyred saint (Joan) is in Marshall's work. So the answer is N/A. But maybe the question is referring to the festival's combination? But the question specifies "choreographer’s dual-structured work", so it's N/A. Alternatively, perhaps the question is mistaken, but per instructions, I must answer as per the text. So N/A.

Wait let me recheck the article's first paragraph: The program combines "the end of the world and a martyred saint" but each piece is separate. The purple neon is in Pittman's work. So the choreographer who has the purple neon is Pittman, but their work doesn't mention the saint. Therefore, N/A. So the answer is N/A.

Now compiling all answers:

1. N/A (Pittman's quote and Marshall's tribal marks are separate)
2. Sun Ra
3. Julius Eastman
4. N/A (vampire ref is Pittman, not Marshall)
5. N/A (no explicit connection)
6. Cody Jensen's sound design
7. Angie Pittman
8. "Joan" (by Kyle Marshall)
9. "Black Life Chord Changes"
10. Angie Pittman
11. "Black Life Chord Changes"
12. Angie Pittman
13. Syd Worthy
14. Maria Tallchief
15. Mikhail Baryshnikov
16. N/A (the merging is in the program, not a single choreographer's work)
