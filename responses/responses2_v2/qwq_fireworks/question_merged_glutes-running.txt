Okay, I need to answer these questions based strictly on the article provided. Let me go through each question one by one and check the text for the answers.

1. **After how many months of physical therapy did the author report being able to complete a full marathon without experiencing any shin pain?**
   - The article says she had 18 months of sprains and then went to physical therapy. The PT session led to her being able to jog again after three months of rebalancing. But the question is about a full marathon? Wait, the article mentions she did a half-marathon initially, and after PT, she could jog. The article says after three months more (from the PT start), she could "break into a manageable jog." There's no mention of a full marathon, so maybe the answer is N/A. Wait the question says "full marathon" but the original injury was from a half-marathon. The answer might be N/A because the article doesn't mention a full marathon. So answer N/A.

2. **Which medical professional first diagnosed the author's gluteal amnesia during her initial hospital visit following the half-marathon injury?**
   - The orthopedist saw her first after the injury. The gluteal amnesia was diagnosed by the physical therapist, not the orthopedist. The orthopedist just fixed the shin. So the answer is the physical therapist. The question says "initial hospital visit" which was the orthopedist. The gluteal amnesia was diagnosed later by the PT. So the first diagnosis of gluteal amnesia was by the PT, so the answer is Physical therapist.

3. **What was the name of the LinkedIn influencer whose running advice initially motivated the author to sign up for the half-marathon?**
   - The article mentions "writers and LinkedIn influencers" but doesn't give a specific name. So N/A.

4. **How many different neon-colored running gear items did the author purchase before beginning her training program?**
   - The text says she "binge-purchased gear in the requisite neons" but doesn't specify the number. So N/A.

5. **What temperature was recorded on the day of the half-marathon that contributed to the icy conditions mentioned in the article?**
   - The article mentions "icy conditions" but doesn't state the temperature. So N/A.

6. **Which brand of inflatable ball did the physical therapist recommend for the author's balance exercises?**
   - The article says "balancing weights in my hands while standing on an inflatable ball" but no brand mentioned. N/A.

7. **How many minutes did the author's partner spend helping her with daily mobility tasks during her recovery period?**
   - The article mentions he helped her "hobble from bed to fridge for weeks afterward" but no time specified. N/A.

8. **What was the total distance in miles the author had run during her training program before attempting the half-marathon?**
   - The article says she "crashed through a training program" and finished the half-marathon (13 miles). But the total distance in training isn't given. N/A.

9. **During which month of 2023 did the author's depressive episode lead her to register for the race?**
   - The article says "winter of 2023" but not the exact month. So N/A.

10. **What was the duration in seconds that the author was instructed to hold the leg lift position during her gluteus maximus burnout exercise?**
    - The article says "hold it there until you feel like you're about to pass out and die" but no exact time. So N/A.
