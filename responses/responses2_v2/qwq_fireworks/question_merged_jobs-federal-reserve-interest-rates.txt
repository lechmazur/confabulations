Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and strictly follow the instructions. Let me start by going through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks about a former Fed official who ran international finance and predicted payroll growth below 100k. Scanning the article, I remember Steven Kamin is mentioned as someone who previously ran the international finance division. He said the Fed would worry if monthly payrolls consistently hovered below 100k. So the answer is Steven Kamin.

2. **Question 2:** This is about the percentage point increase in consumer inflation expectations from the University of Michigan surveys. The article states the latest survey showed a full-percentage-point increase from the previous reading to 4.3%. The increase is 1 point. But the question specifies "according to Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari's analysis." Wait, the article says Kashkari mentioned the central bank was in a good place to wait, but the inflation expectation increase is from the University of Michigan, not his analysis. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "according to Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari's analysis"—but the article doesn't link Kashkari to the inflation expectation data. So the correct answer here would be N/A? Hmm, but the article says the University of Michigan survey showed a 1% increase. The question says "according to Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari's analysis"—but the article doesn't attribute that data to him. So the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The article mentions the University of Michigan survey's increase, but not tied to Kashkari's analysis. So yes, N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Total jobs created from Nov to Jan after revisions. The article says November and December were revised higher by 100k total. January had 140k. So original Nov-Dec numbers plus the 140k? Wait, the article says "previous months' totals were revised higher. In November and December, 100,000 more jobs were created than initially estimated." So the original Nov-Dec numbers were X, and after revision, they added 100k. The January number was 140k. So total over three months would be (original Nov + original Dec + Jan) + 100k. But the article doesn't give the original numbers, just that the revisions added 100k. Since we don't have the original numbers, we can't calculate the total. The question asks for the total after revisions, but without the original data, it's impossible. So answer N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Thomas Barkin's quantitative threshold for "solid" vs "overheating". The article quotes him saying the economy is "solid, but not overheating." But there's no mention of a specific numerical threshold. So answer N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Fed regional president who linked immigration to construction wages. Julia Coronado is mentioned as a former Fed economist, not a current president. The article says she's concerned about immigration's impact, noting that immigrants are "complements, not substitutes" in construction. But the question asks for a Fed regional president. The presidents mentioned are Mary Daly (SF Fed), Thomas Barkin (Richmond), Neel Kashkari (Minneapolis). Julia Coronado isn't a current president, so answer N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Jon Faust's mathematical model. The article mentions Jon Faust as a Center for Financial Economics adviser to Powell, but doesn't specify a model he developed. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Months of unemployment increases before the Fed's double cut. The article says "monthly jobs growth had slowed and the unemployment rate was steadily ticking higher. In a bid to preserve the economy's strength, the Fed took the unusual step of lowering interest rates by double the magnitude..." But it doesn't specify how many months the unemployment rate was increasing. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Percentage of companies with over 100 employees submitting layoff notices in December. The article mentions Samuel Tombs' estimate of a 5% increase in layoffs compared to December's level, based on data tracking written notices. Wait, the question is about the percentage of companies, but the article says "a 5 percent increase compared with December's level" in layoffs. But the 5% is the increase in layoff notices, not the percentage of companies. So answer N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Mary C. Daly's cited metric. She said "People can get jobs, and employers can find workers," implying job availability and hiring rates. The article doesn't specify an exact metric like the unemployment rate or job openings. But maybe "the number of Americans out of work and filing for weekly benefits" is mentioned as low. Wait, the exact quote is "People can get jobs, and employers can find workers," which might relate to the job-finding rate or job openings. The question asks for the primary metric she cited. Since the article doesn't name a specific indicator, maybe N/A? Or perhaps "the number of job seekers and employers finding workers" but that's not a standard metric. Alternatively, maybe the unemployment rate? The article says the unemployment rate ticked down, but that's separate from her statement. Hmm, tricky. Maybe N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Neil Dutta's timeframe for rate cuts. The article says Dutta said "the Fed never have so much time," but doesn't give a specific timeframe. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Pantheon's projected layoff increase vs Fed's view. Samuel Tombs estimated a 5% increase in layoffs. The Fed's view is that it's just a note of caution. So the answer is 5%.

12. **Question 12:** Fed's action last month based on consumer sentiment. The first paragraph says the Fed paused cuts last month. The consumer sentiment survey showed a souring, but the Fed's action (pausing) was last month. So the answer is paused rate cuts.

13. **Question 13:** Layoff increase from Pantheon vs Daly's view. The article states Pantheon's 5% increase. The Fed's view (Daly's optimism) doesn't mention this, so the answer is 5%.

14. **Question 14:** Unemployment rate in January. The article says the unemployment rate "ticked back down to 4 percent" in January. So 4%.

15. **Question 15:** Revised jobs in Nov-Dec considering immigration. The article says November and December were revised up by 100k total. Julia Coronado's point about immigration's impact isn't tied to the job numbers. So the answer is 100,000.

16. **Question 16:** Policy causing inflation mentioned with Kashkari's prediction. The Trump policies like tariffs are mentioned as causing inflation. Kashkari predicted rates would be "modestly lower by year-end." The question asks for the policy type, so tariffs.

17. **Question 17:** Magnitude of Fed's rate cut in response to initial concerns. The article says they lowered rates by double the typical moves. The usual is 0.25%, so double would be 0.5%.

18. **Question 18:** Metric increasing since summer besides hiring rate. The article mentions "the share of unemployed Americans who have been out of work for about six months or longer has also steadily risen." So long-term unemployment.

19. **Question 19:** Initial hiring in January before revisions. The article states January hiring slowed to 140k, but previous months were revised higher. So the initial pace was 140k? Wait, the January number is the reported one, but maybe the initial estimate was different. Wait, the article says "The pace of hiring in January slowed more than expected, to 140,000 new positions, but previous months' totals were revised higher." So the January number was reported as 140k, but the question asks for the initial pace before revisions. The article doesn't mention an initial estimate for January; it just says the revised previous months. So perhaps the initial January number was as reported, so 140k. But the question says "before revisions"—maybe the initial estimate was higher? Not sure. The article says January's pace was 140k, but maybe the "more than expected" implies the expectation was lower, but the actual was 140k. Hmm. Since the article doesn't give an initial estimate for January's jobs, just the final number, answer N/A? Or the answer is 140,000 as the reported number. The question says "initial pace before revisions"—if the 140k is the revised number, but the article doesn't mention an initial figure, then N/A. Wait, the article says "the pace of hiring in January slowed more than expected, to 140,000 new positions"—so the actual number is 140k, which was lower than expected. The "previous months' totals were revised higher" refers to Nov and Dec. The January figure isn't revised yet, so the initial pace is 140k. So answer 140,000.

20. **Question 20:** Percentage point increase in inflation expectations from University of Michigan. The article states the survey showed a full-percentage-point increase to 4.3%, so the increase is 1 percentage point. Answer 1.
