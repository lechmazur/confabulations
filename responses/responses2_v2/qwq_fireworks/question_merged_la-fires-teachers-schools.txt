Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to go through each question carefully and find the exact information from the article provided. Let me start with the first question.

1. Which union president linked the potential decline in school enrollment to the destruction caused by the Palisades fire while discussing the long-term impacts on extracurricular activities?

Looking at the article, there's a part where Mr. Gardner (Jonathan Gardner, president of United Teachers of Pasadena) mentions that many students lost their homes, leading to possible enrollment declines. He also talks about extracurricular activities losing "color" due to teachers not being able to stay nearby. So the answer here should be Jonathan Gardner.

2. What historical disaster did Scott Mandel incorrectly cite as causing greater teacher displacement than the current wildfires when comparing organizational responses?

The article mentions Scott Mandel comparing the current fires to the 1994 Northridge earthquake. He says that while a few teachers lost homes in the earthquake, it wasn't on the same scale as now. The question is about the disaster he cited, so Northridge earthquake.

3. Which public figure’s tour of fire-damaged areas was directly tied to the insurance commissioner’s proposal to eliminate itemization requirements for wildfire claims?

The article's last section mentions Kamala Harris touring the area, and another part talks about the insurance regulator's proposal. However, the question connects the tour to the insurance policy. The article doesn't explicitly link Harris's tour to the insurance change, so maybe N/A?

Wait, the question says "directly tied". The article states that "California's top insurance regulator wants insurance carriers to pay..." and Kamala Harris's tour is in a separate paragraph. Unless there's a connection made in the text, but I don't see it. So maybe N/A?

4. How many teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District were reported to have lost homes in the Eaton fire based on cross-referenced evacuation zone data?

The article says Eaton fire affected Pasadena, while Palisades fire affected LAUSD. The LAUSD union counted nearly 150 teachers lost homes in their area (Palisades). The Eaton fire's impact on LAUSD teachers isn't mentioned. So N/A.

5. What irreplaceable item from Rebecca Mitsuse’s classroom was mentioned as lost alongside her personal teaching materials in the Altadena fire?

Rebecca's lost items include books, notebooks, and a student's note. The note is from a student 20 years ago. The question specifies a classroom item. The books and notebooks are teaching materials. The student note is personal. The answer should be the student's note.

6. Which school district’s closure this week was attributed to the Palisades fire destroying multiple elementary schools, according to displaced staff?

The article says Pasadena schools closed this week, while LA schools reopened. The Palisades fire destroyed schools in LAUSD. Wait, the question says closure due to Palisades fire. The LA district's two schools were destroyed but they reopened except those two, which moved. The closure mentioned is Pasadena's, but that's from the Eaton fire. The LA district didn't close entirely. So maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "attributed to the Palisades fire destroying schools". The LA district's closure isn't mentioned, but the two schools were moved. The closure was Pasadena's, but that's due to Eaton. So answer N/A?

Wait the article says "The Pasadena school district is closed this week, but nearly all schools in the Los Angeles school district reopened on Monday. Students and teachers at two elementary schools that were destroyed by the Palisades fire..." So the Palisades fire destroyed LA schools, but LA district reopened except those two. The closure of LA schools isn't stated. The closure is Pasadena's due to Eaton. So the question is which district's closure was due to Palisades? Answer N/A.

7. What role does Cecily Myart-Cruz hold in relation to Scott Mandel’s efforts to coordinate housing assistance for displaced teachers in the Eaton fire zone?

Cecily is president of UTLA, and Scott is a regional chair. The article says Scott Mandel is a regional chair who called teachers in his area. There's no mention of Cecily's role in his efforts. So N/A.

8. How many Pasadena Unified employees were under mandatory evacuation orders during the Palisades fire, according to district spokesperson statements?

The article mentions LAUSD had over 300 employees under evacuation orders for their area (Palisades?), but Pasadena's evacuation orders aren't specified. The question is about Palisades fire affecting Pasadena? The Eaton fire is in Pasadena. The Palisades fire is in LA. So N/A.

9. Which teacher’s undamaged home in Pasadena allowed them to host displaced students temporarily, as noted in the article’s housing solutions section?

Rebecca's partner teacher's house was undamaged. The partner is a math/history teacher living in Pasadena. The article says students can go to him, but doesn't say he's hosting them. Maybe N/A?

Wait, the article says "He lives in Pasadena, and although fire had come within a few blocks of his home, she said, it escaped damage." Rebecca's partner's home was safe. The question is which teacher's home allowed hosting students. The article doesn't explicitly state he's hosting, just that students can go to him for support. So N/A?

10. What policy change did Kamala Harris advocate for during her Pacific Palisades tour to address the emotional toll of inventorying lost belongings?

The article's section on the insurance commissioner's proposal mentions eliminating itemization. Kamala's tour is in a separate section. Unless the question is conflating, but the article doesn't link Harris to that policy. So N/A.

11. In the narrative, which educator—described as having a 20‐year teaching history and experiencing the loss of both her personal residence and a meaningful student note—is implicitly linked to the sentiment “Life has to keep moving forward” following the Eaton fire?

The quote "Life has to keep moving forward" is from Rebecca Mitsuse, who has been teaching for 20 years and lost the student note. So Rebecca Mitsuse.

12. Who is the regional union chair who drew a parallel between the Northridge earthquake—cited with 60 deaths and $35 billion in damages—and the current wildfire disaster, suggesting that the recent events have surpassed that earlier catastrophe?

Scott Mandel is the regional chair who made that comparison. He said the earthquake's teacher displacement was less than now. So Scott Mandel.

13. Which middle school English teacher and college and career adviser, noted for her criticism of the pace of insurance claims processing, found temporary refuge with her brother after losing her home in Altadena?

LoriAnne Denne is described as a middle school English teacher and college/career adviser. She stayed with her brother and found the claims process overwhelming. So LoriAnne Denne.

14. In the school district affected by the Eaton fire, what percentage of the total teachers and staff were reported to have lost their homes, based on the federal statistics provided?

Pasadena had 300 employees out of 1500 (federal stats). 300/1500 is 20%. So 20%.

15. Within the Los Angeles school district described in the article, how many teachers and staff members did the union report as having lost their homes amid the wildfire devastation?

The LAUSD union counted nearly 150. The answer is nearly 150, but the question says "how many"—so "nearly 150" but since it's a count, maybe 150? The article says "nearly 150", so answer "nearly 150" but the instructions say prefer sentence fragments. Maybe just 150? Wait, the exact quote is "nearly 150 teachers and staff members whose homes were lost". So the answer is nearly 150. But since the question asks for the number, perhaps "nearly 150" or "150". But the instructions say to answer directly. So "nearly 150".

16. Referring to concerns about diminished extracurricular activities, what fraction of Pasadena school employees was originally noted as residing within the district, thereby enabling shorter commutes to after-school programs?

The article says "roughly half of Pasadena school employees lived inside the district". So half, or 50%.

17. Which metropolitan school district resumed classes on Monday despite facing significant displacement challenges, including hundreds of staff living under mandatory evacuation orders?

Los Angeles Unified School District reopened on Monday. The evacuation orders mention over 300 employees under orders, but classes resumed. So LAUSD.

18. What change in work scheduling was implemented for those teachers in the Los Angeles district whose homes were lost in the wildfires, as mentioned in the article?

Teachers displaced were given the week off. So "the week off".

19. After the Palisades fire destroyed certain elementary school facilities, where were students reported to have resumed classes later in the week?

They moved to two nearby schools. The answer is "two nearby schools".

20. Which former high-ranking national official was noted as touring the fire damage in Pacific Palisades while meeting with local officials as part of post-fire recovery efforts?

Kamala Harris, former VP, did this tour. So Kamala Harris.

Now I'll go through each question again to ensure accuracy and check the answers against the article text.
