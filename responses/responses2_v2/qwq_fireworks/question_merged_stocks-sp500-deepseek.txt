Okay, let's tackle each question one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge.

1. The first question asks about Softbank's stock increase percentage on Tuesday. The article mentions that the Nikkei 225 fell 1.4% with Softbank dropping about 5%. Wait, the question says "increase", but the article states Softbank dropped 5%. So the answer should be N/A because there's no increase mentioned, only a drop.

2. The second question is about a regulatory change mentioned by Seema Shah alongside inflation and tariffs. The article says she mentioned "stubborn inflation and the prospect of hefty tariffs". The regulatory change isn't explicitly stated here. The question might be referring to tariffs as a regulatory factor. But the question specifies "regulatory change", so maybe "hefty tariffs" is the answer. Let me check again. The text says "prospect of hefty tariffs that could weigh on spending...", so the answer is "hefty tariffs".

3. The third question asks which non-tech sector had a 3.6% increase like the tech sector. The article states that the tech sector led the S&P 500 with a 3.6% rise, but eight of the other ten sectors were lower. It doesn't mention any other sector with the same percentage. So the answer is N/A because there's no other sector mentioned with 3.6%.

4. The fourth question is about DeepSeek's additional feature challenging Nvidia. The article says DeepSeek can match advanced chatbots using fewer expensive chips. That directly challenges Nvidia's chip dominance. The answer is "using far fewer expensive computer chips".

5. The fifth question refers to the Fed's action alongside unchanged rates. Lauren Goodwin mentions Chair Powell's post-FOMC press conference being low-profile. The specific action is his comments after the rate decision. The answer is "comments from Jerome H. Powell after the Fed's rate decision".

6. The sixth question asks about a contradictory trend in sector performance. The article states the tech sector is the only one with negative year-to-date returns but it dragged the S&P up on Tuesday. So the contradiction is that despite negative YTD returns, it boosted the index. The answer is "the tech sector is the only one with negative year-to-date returns but led the S&P 500 higher on Tuesday".

7. The seventh question is about the company with a delayed earnings report affecting AI growth assessment. Nvidia's earnings are not scheduled until end-February, so the answer is "Nvidia".
