Question 24: What term for untapped resources?

He used "balance sheet" and "assets". The term from the quote is "balance sheet" but the question asks for the term for the resources. The article says "assets". Wait, the exact quote: "America's financial 'balance sheet'... assets". The term for the resources would be "assets" or "balance sheet". The question says "term to describe America’s untapped natural resources", so "assets" might be better. But the question's phrasing might prefer "balance sheet" as the metaphor. Let me check the text again. The article says he said "balance sheet" and "assets". The question is about the term he used for the resources, so "assets" or "balance sheet". The exact quote: "We have all this debt... but we never talk about the assets... it's our responsibility to get a return". The term for the resources as part of the metaphor is "assets" as part of the balance sheet. The answer might be "assets". Wait, the question says "term he invoked to describe America’s untapped natural resources", so "assets" is the term. However, the metaphor is "balance sheet". Hmm. The question might want the metaphor term, which is "balance sheet". The user might expect the answer to be "balance sheet" as the metaphor. Let me check the exact wording again: "viewed America's public lands... as part of the country's financial 'balance sheet'". So the term is "balance sheet". The question is asking for the metaphor used to portray the lands/waters, so "balance sheet".
