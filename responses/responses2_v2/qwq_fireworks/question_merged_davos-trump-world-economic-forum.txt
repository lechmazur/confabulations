Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and answer each exactly as per the instructions. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks about the initiative the Salesforce leader proposed to address hot maritime temperatures. The article mentions Marc Benioff (Salesforce CEO) wanting to enlist Trump in an effort to protect oceans. So the answer should be "protect the world's oceans."

2. The second question is about the percentage of electricity data centers might use by 2028. The article says a report backed by the DoE states data centers could account for up to 12% by 2028. So 12%.

3. The third question refers to the agreement threatened by Salesforce's CEO. The text says Benioff worked with Trump on the trillion trees plan, but the question mentions the founding director of Columbia's Center. Wait, the article says Jason Bordoff mentioned the Paris accord being pulled out by Trump. The question asks which agreement Bordoff mentioned as threatened by Benioff? Wait, no. Wait, the question says "threatened by the actions of the chief executive of Salesforce." Wait, Benioff is the CEO of Salesforce, but the threat to the Paris accord was from Trump. Maybe the question is confusing. Let me check again. The question says the agreement threatened by the actions of Benioff? That doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I misread. The question says: "Which international agreement did the founding director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University mention as being threatened by the actions of the chief executive of Salesforce?" Wait, the chief executive of Salesforce is Benioff, but the article says Trump is the one pulling out of Paris. The director (Bordoff) mentions that Trump pulling out is not helpful. So maybe the question is wrong? But according to the article, the Paris accord is the one threatened by Trump. The question might be a trick. Since the question attributes the threat to Benioff, but the article doesn't say that. Since the answer must be based solely on the text, if the question's premise is incorrect, then answer N/A. Wait, let me check again. The question says the director mentioned the agreement being threatened by Benioff's actions. The article says Benioff wants to work with Trump on oceans. The director's quote is about Trump pulling out of Paris. So the answer here would be N/A because Bordoff didn't mention Benioff's actions affecting Paris. Alternatively, maybe I misread. Let me check the exact quote: "Jason Bordoff... 'It is certainly not helpful if the U.S. backs away from the Paris process...'". The US backing away is Trump's action, not Benioff's. So the question's premise is wrong. Therefore, answer N/A.

4. The fourth question: U.S. Forces are preparing which facilities, mirroring where migrants are held (Guantanamo), to house 30k migrants? The article says they're preparing a tent city. The migrants are in Guantanamo, but the new facility is a tent city. The question asks what type of facility mirrors the location (Guantanamo). The answer is "tent city" but the question might be about the type. The article says "preparing a tent city to house as many as 30,000 migrants." So the answer is "tent city."

5. The fifth question: Which governmental organization's closure was prompted by the same individual (Trump) who wanted to leave Paris? The article mentions Trump called for closure of USAID. So USAID.

6. Sixth question: Which publication facing a lawsuit from Trump (who threatens tariffs) is identified as targeted for harassment? The article says media lawsuits against CBS and Des Moines Register lack merit but are effective harassment. So either CBS News or Des Moines Register. The question says "publication," so both are possible. The question might want one. The article mentions "CBS News and The Des Moines Register" so maybe either is correct. Since the question asks for a publication, either would work, but need to pick one. Wait, the question says "the same individual threatening steep tariffs"â€”the tariffs are from Trump's actions. The lawsuits are separate. The answer is either, but since the question says "a publication," perhaps the answer is "CBS News" or "The Des Moines Register." The article lists both, so maybe the answer is either. But the question might want both? Wait, the question says "which publication," so perhaps one. Let me check the exact wording: "two lawsuits against CBS News and The Des Moines Register lack legal merit. But they now also realize that the lawsuits are proving effective..." So the answer would be both, but since the question asks for one, perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait no, the question says "a publication," so either is acceptable. But the question is phrased as "which publication," so maybe the first one listed. But the user might expect both? However, instructions say if the question asks for two and the article lists one, answer N/A. Here the question is singular. Since the article lists both, perhaps the answer is either, but the user expects one. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "CBS News" as the first mentioned. Alternatively, the question might have a typo. Hmm, but I'll go with "CBS News" as one of them.

7. Seventh question: Specific action by West Point leaders that critics say contradicts diversification. The article says DEI section mentions West Point ended 12 clubs, which critics say contradicts diversification efforts. So the action is "ending a dozen student clubs."

8. Eighth question: Primary focus last year at WEF, shifting from current Trump focus. The article says last year climate was on the back burner. So the focus was not climate, but what was it? The question says the current focus is on Trump, so last year's was something else. The article says last year climate was back burner, so maybe other topics like AI? But the question is asking for the primary focus. The article doesn't explicitly state last year's focus, just that climate wasn't the focus. Since the question asks for the primary focus, but the article only says climate was back burner, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "primary focus of discussion... last year, reflecting a shift away from the current emphasis on Trump." Since current is Trump, last year's was something else, but the article doesn't say what exactly. The only info is that climate was back burner. So maybe the answer is N/A because it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the primary focus was something else, but the article doesn't name it. So N/A.

Wait, the article says: "Last year, climate was on the back burner at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting. This year it will likely be the same, despite the efforts..." So the primary focus last year was not climate. The question asks what was the primary focus. Since the article doesn't mention what it was, answer N/A.

9. Ninth question: Which leader initiated a trillion tree plan in Davos during Trump's first term? The article says Benioff worked with Trump to plant a trillion trees five years ago. So the leader is Trump. The question says "remembered for initiating... policies that might include strong executive actions on environmental protections?" Wait the question says "the same individual who expressed intentions to withdraw from the Paris Accord?" Wait no. The question says "Which U.S. leader, remembered for initiating a trillion tree plan... described as the force behind policies that might include strong executive actions on environmental protections?" Wait the leader here is Trump, since Benioff worked with him. But the question says "the force behind policies that might include..." but Trump is the one pulling back on environmental protections. Wait the question might be tricky. The first part is about the trillion tree plan, which Trump did. The second part says "remembered for... policies that might include strong executive actions on environmental protections?" Trump's policies are the opposite. But the question's phrasing is confusing. Wait the question says "remembered for initiating a trillion tree plan... described as the force behind policies that might include strong executive actions..." Maybe it's Al Gore? No. The trillion tree plan was with Trump. The question is asking for the leader who did the tree plan, which is Trump. So answer is "Donald J. Trump."

10. Tenth question: Which agreement is implied to be undermined by an administration abandoning multilateral cooperation? The article says Trump wants to leave Paris, so the answer is "Paris climate accord."

11. Eleventh question: Prominent CEO noted for previous attempt to collaborate with a rival administration (Biden) on oceans, now hoping for bipartisan with Trump. The article says Benioff tried with Biden but was rebuffed, now hoping Trump will support. So the CEO is Benioff.

12. Twelfth question: Who argues that exclusive focus on fossil fuels creates a moral hazard? The article says Benioff said focusing on reducing fossil emissions is a "moral hazard," distracting from broader issues. So the answer is "Marc Benioff."

13. Thirteenth question: Which grouping had more renewable than fossil fuels last year? The article says in Europe, wind and solar produced more than fossil fuels for the first time last year. So "European Union."

14. Fourteenth question: Which Asian nation is leading in solar but still largest coal consumer? China is mentioned as largest installer/exporter of solar but also largest coal consumer. So "China."

15. Fifteenth question: Government agency targeted for closure by Trump's administration? The article says Trump called for closure of USAID. So "U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)."

16. Sixteenth question: Detention facility linked to terrorism suspects holding migrants now? Guantanamo Bay is mentioned for holding migrants, same as where Al Qaeda suspects were. So "Guantanamo Bay."

17. Seventeenth question: Military academy ending clubs due to DEI ban? West Point is mentioned in the DEI section. So "West Point."
