Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article provided.

1. **Question 1**: The experimental treatment using a patient's blood plasma to heal tissue is mentioned in the part about Craig Linsley. The article says he received platelet-rich plasma therapy. So the answer is platelet-rich plasma therapy.

2. **Question 2**: The article states there are as many as 800 clinics in the U.S., but it doesn't specify how many offer the same services as Hooke. The question asks for the exact number, which isn't provided, so N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Joe Nevin's motivation was wanting to know if he was healthy, not a specific condition like Tait's cholesterol. The article doesn't mention a similar condition, so maybe N/A? Wait, the article says Joe Nevin's first visit found a kidney tumor. But his initial reason wasn't a condition but the desire to know his health. So the answer might be N/A because the question asks for a condition similar to Tait's (high cholesterol). Since Joe's reason wasn't a condition, it's N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Dr. Livingston is associated with the American College of Radiology and American College of Preventive Medicine, which recommended against full-body MRIs. The question asks for the organization connected to her. The answer is American College of Radiology and/or American College of Preventive Medicine. Since the question asks for the organization mentioned in connection with her, the answer is both, but the question might want one. Wait, the article says "American College of Radiology and the American College of Preventive Medicine currently recommend against the practice." So both are mentioned with her. The question asks for "organization," but the answer requires both. However, the question specifies "the organization," so maybe the first one? Wait, the question says "which organization, mentioned in connection with Dr. Catherine Livingston, has issued a recommendation..." Since both are mentioned together, but the question is singular, perhaps list both. Wait, the answer should be both, but the question uses "organization" (singular). Hmm. Wait the exact text says: "the American College of Radiology and the American College of Preventive Medicine currently recommend against the practice." Since Dr. Livingston is on the committee of the latter, maybe the answer is the American College of Preventive Medicine. Wait the article says she is on the committee of the American College of Preventive Medicine. The recommendation is from both organizations. But the question asks for the organization mentioned in connection with her. Since she's part of the latter, but the recommendation is from both. The question is a bit ambiguous. The answer should include both, but since the user wants the answer in the format given, maybe list both as per the article. Wait the question says "organization" but the answer is two. Since the user wants exact answer, perhaps the answer is "American College of Radiology and American College of Preventive Medicine". But the user wants the exact wording from the text. The answer should be both as per the text. Let me check again. The exact quote: "the American College of Radiology and the American College of Preventive Medicine currently recommend against the practice." So both organizations are mentioned in connection with her. The question says "organization" (singular), but the answer requires both. Since the user's instructions say if the answer can't be logically inferred, write N/A. Wait, the question is asking for "the organization, mentioned in connection with Dr. Catherine Livingston, has issued..." Since the recommendation is from both, but she is associated with one (American College of Preventive Medicine). The article says she is on the committee of the latter. So maybe the answer is American College of Preventive Medicine. Alternatively, since both are mentioned together, perhaps the answer should list both. Hmm. The question might want both. Since the user's example includes "N/A" when exact info is missing, but here the article explicitly states both, so the answer is both. So the answer is "American College of Radiology and American College of Preventive Medicine".

5. **Question 5**: Craig Linsley spends between $5k-$10k annually. The question asks for the annual cost. The article states "$5,000 and $10,000 annually". Since the exact figure isn't specified, but the range is given. The question might want the range. The user's instructions say to answer as per the text. The answer should be "between $5,000 and $10,000" but since the question asks for the annual cost, the answer is that range. But the user wants a direct answer. Since the article says "spends between $5,000 and $10,000 annually", the answer is that range.

6. **Question 6**: Joe Nevin's tumor was found via imaging tests. The article mentions at Human Longevity, the evaluation includes CT, MRI, DXA. The specific scan isn't named, but the tumor was found during his first visit. The exact scan isn't specified. The question asks for the type of scan. The article doesn't specify which scan found the tumor, so N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The clinic in Manhattan where Craig goes is Extension Health. The article says "At Extension Health, a clinic in Manhattan..."

8. **Question 8**: Plasma exchange costs $12k per session. The article states "$12,000 for a single session at Extension Health".

9. **Question 9**: Dr. Korenstein is the senior medical director at Mount Sinai Solutions, which oversees a concierge program similar to Human Longevity. The question asks her position, which is Senior Medical Director.

10. **Question 10**: Hooke's membership fee for Tait isn't given. The article mentions Human Longevity's top tier is $19k, but Hooke's cost isn't stated. The question asks Hooke's fee. Since the article doesn't state Hooke's membership fee, N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The two organizations are American College of Radiology and American College of Preventive Medicine, as per the text.

12. **Question 12**: The article contrasts Extension Health (offering unproven therapies like peptides, ozone, etc.) with Mount Sinai Solutions (concierge care). The answer is that Extension uses unproven therapies while Mount Sinai offers concierge. The question asks how Kuo's approach differs. The answer is "offering unproven therapies" but need exact wording. The article says "some have questioned whether... therapies actually benefit" and "no evidence for most treatments". The exact difference is that Extension offers experimental treatments like peptides and ozone, while Mount Sinai's program is concierge primary care. The answer should be that Extension offers unproven therapies, while Mount Sinai's is more conventional. The question asks how Extension differs from Mount Sinai in terms of treatments. The answer is "offering unproven therapies such as hyperbaric oxygen, plasma exchange, and ozone therapy, along with peptides and hormones".

13. **Question 13**: The article mentions peptides for inflammation, skin, hair, nails, stamina. But the question asks for a peptide noted for dual benefits on metabolic and cognitive. The text says "peptides that are supposed to help with inflammation and which, according to Mr. Linsley, also improve his skin, hair and nails, as well as his overall stamina." No mention of metabolic and cognitive. The article also mentions Human Longevity uses peptides including Ozempic (which is a GLP-1 agonist for diabetes, affecting metabolism and has some cognitive links). But the article says Ozempic is part of their treatments, but the patient's outcomes don't specify cognitive benefits. The question's answer might be Ozempic, but the article doesn't explicitly state dual benefits. Since the question requires a peptide noted for both, and the text doesn't specify that, the answer is N/A.
