Okay, I need to answer these 20 questions based strictly on the provided article. Let me go through each one carefully.

1. The first question asks which of Foreman's plays at the Paris Opera explored themes of mental illness through a radio show about elephants. The article mentions "Elephant Steps" as an opera about a radio show, but it was premiered at Tanglewood and reviewed at Hunter College. However, the Paris Opera is mentioned in the context of his directing "Die Fledermaus". Wait, the question is about a play at the Paris Opera. The article says he directed "Die Fledermaus" there. But the play about the radio show and elephants is "Elephant Steps". But the Paris Opera isn't linked to that play. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question is specifically about a play at the Paris Opera that deals with mental illness via a radio show. Since "Elephant Steps" was the radio show one but not at Paris Opera, the answer might be N/A.

Wait, maybe I misread. The question is about a play at the Paris Opera. The article says he directed "Die Fledermaus" there, which is a Strauss opera, not related to elephants or mental illness. So the answer is N/A here.

2. The second question is about the size of the SoHo apartment where he wrote "Permanent Brain Damage" while battling insomnia in the early 1970s. The article states he bought a 3,600-square-foot loft in SoHo in 1970. Since "Permanent Brain Damage" was from 1996, but the apartment was his since 1970, the size is 3,600.

3. The third question asks the philosophical concept explored with Jonas Mekas that won an Obie in 1973. The collaboration with Mekas is mentioned in films, but the Obie in 1973 was for the Ontological-Hysteric Theater itself, not a film. The philosophical concept might be related to the theater's name, "Ontological-Hysteric", which refers to metaphysical study and hysterics. But the question is about his collaboration with Mekas. Wait, the article says he made film shorts in the 70s with Mekas, but the 1973 Obie was for the theater. So maybe the answer is N/A, since the Obie in 1973 was for the theater, not their collaboration. Or perhaps the concept is "ontological-hysteric" but the question is about the collaboration with Mekas. Since the article doesn't link Mekas to the 1973 Obie, answer is N/A.

4. The fourth question asks which play had Kate Manheim as a doctor examining existence through patient interactions at St. Mark's. The article says Kate is his wife and appeared in his plays, but the specific play isn't mentioned. The play "The Cure" deals with patient-doctor relations and won an Obie in 1987. Since St. Mark's was the church where the theater was housed, maybe "The Cure" is the answer. The question mentions St. Mark's in the Bowery as the location. So answer is "The Cure".

5. The fifth question is the budget of the Hunter College production reviewed by Schonberg as "very chic" in 1970. The article mentions "Elephant Steps" at Hunter College in 1970, but no budget is given. So N/A.

6. The sixth question: How did managing apartment buildings influence the staging of "Rhoda in Potatoland"? The article says his first job managing apartments gave him a flexible schedule to pursue projects. It doesn't mention how that influenced staging techniques. So N/A.

7. The seventh question asks the attendance for the opening night of "Old-Fashioned Prostitutes" at the Public Theater in 2013. The article mentions the play opened there but no attendance figures. N/A.

8. The eighth question: Which German philosopher's writings inspired the set design elements of strings and poles in "Bad Boy Nietzsche!"? The play's set elements are described in a 2004 review as "strings and poles that segment the stage". The play's title is "Bad Boy Nietzsche!" about Nietzsche's breakdown. So the philosopher is Nietzsche. Answer: Nietzsche.

9. The ninth question: Running time of the film "Strong Medicine" adaptation. The article says he adapted "Strong Medicine" to film in 1981 but doesn't mention running time. N/A.

10. Tenth: Number of baby dolls in "King Cowboy Rufus..." to symbolize the Bush admin. The article mentions "vulnerable baby dolls" in the set description but doesn't specify quantity. N/A.

11. Eleventh: The fellowship at 58 was the MacArthur "genius grant". The text says he received it in 1995 at 58. So answer: MacArthur fellowship.

12. Twelfth: Which work is identified by his collaboration with a composer (Silverman) and a Hunter College production reviewed as "chic" by Schonberg? That's "Elephant Steps".

13. Thirteenth: Play with a title suggesting futuristic tech and memory, concise. The article mentions "Total Recall" (1970) as concise and resonant. So answer: Total Recall.

14. Fourteenth: Opera linked to a 19th-century composer (Strauss) at a European venue. The Paris Opera's "Die Fledermaus" by Strauss. Answer: Die Fledermaus.

15. Fifteenth: Final play he directed, "Old-Fashioned Prostitutes..." as noted. The question is about his final play he produced and directed himself. The article says that was "Old-Fashioned Prostitutes (A True Romance)". Answer: Old-Fashioned Prostitutes (A True Romance).

16. Sixteenth: Film from 2012 about a daily occurrence, returning to movies after 70s. The article mentions "Once Every Day" in 2012. Answer: Once Every Day.

17. Seventeenth: Distinctive facial feature gone later: the mustache. The text says he had a walrus mustache early, later it was gone. Answer: Walrus-style mustache.

18. Eighteenth: Academic credential after undergrad and property management. He got an M.F.A. from Yale School of Drama. Answer: M.F.A. from Yale School of Drama.

19. Nineteenth: Final film, 70 minutes, grainy B&W, provocative scene. "Mad Love" (2018) is described as such. Answer: Mad Love.

20. Twentieth: Marriage to high school friend who became film critic, divorced in 1972. That's Amy Taubin. Answer: Amy Taubin.
