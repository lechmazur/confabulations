Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information given and don't make any assumptions beyond that.

1. **Question 1**: The Pantone color linked to a spooky video game (mentioned as Limbo) and a creepy whisper is referenced in the song "Bittersuite." The article says Eilish assigned Pantone 296 C to the darker part of the song. Since "Chihiro" is the song named after the Spirited Away protagonist, but the question is about the song that shares the name. Wait, actually, "Chihiro" is the song named after the protagonist. But the Pantone color for "Bittersuite" is 296 C. However, the question is about the song that shares the name with Chihiro. Wait, the article says "Chihiro" is the song named after the protagonist, so maybe the answer is Pantone 296 C? Let me check again. The article says "Bittersuite" turns blue with Pantone 296 C. The song "Chihiro" isn't directly linked to a Pantone color, but the question is about the song named after Chihiro. Since the article doesn't mention a Pantone color for "Chihiro," maybe it's N/A. Wait, no—the question says the song that shares its name with the Spirited Away protagonist. The song "Chihiro" is named after her. But the article doesn't mention a Pantone color for "Chihiro." The only Pantone colors mentioned are for "Bittersuite" (296 C) and another song. So perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, no—the question says "inspired by a spooky video game and a creepy whisper." The article mentions "Bittersuite" references Limbo (spooky game) and the whisper "I'll never tell what I'm saying." So the song in question is "Bittersuite," which is assigned Pantone 296 C. But the question is about the song that shares the name with Chihiro (which is "Chihiro"), so maybe there's confusion here. Since "Chihiro" isn't linked to a Pantone color, the answer is N/A? Wait, but the question says "the song that shares its name with the Spirited Away protagonist" which is "Chihiro," but the Pantone color isn't mentioned for it. Therefore, the answer should be N/A. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The article says "the song 'Chihiro,' named for the young heroine of 'Spirited Away.'" The Pantone colors are discussed in the context of "Bittersuite" and "Blue." So unless "Chihiro" has a Pantone color, which it's not mentioned, the answer is N/A. Hmm, maybe I need to re-express. Wait, the question is asking for the Pantone color assigned to the song named after Chihiro. Since the article doesn't mention a Pantone for "Chihiro," the answer is N/A.

Wait, but the question says "inspired by a spooky video game and a creepy whisper." The spooky video game is Limbo, mentioned in the context of "Bittersuite," which is assigned Pantone 296 C. The whisper is part of "Bittersuite." So maybe the question is mixing elements. The song in question is "Bittersuite," which has the Pantone 296 C. However, the song named after Chihiro is "Chihiro," which isn't linked to that Pantone. Therefore, the question might have a trick here. The answer would be N/A because the song "Chihiro" isn't linked to a Pantone color in the text. So I'll go with N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The influence of Lana Del Rey's "Blue Jeans" includes alligators. The article states that in the video, Lana swims with alligators and a hot guy. Eilish's early sketches included water and "goos," which might be alligators? The question asks for an underwater creature featured in her sketches, so "goos" could be alligators. The answer is alligators.

3. **Question 3**: The song referenced in "Lunch" is Tupac's "Hit 'Em Up." The question also mentions a similar setting to Coldplay's "The Scientist" (which involved reverse lyrics) inspired a scrapped concept for "Birds of a Feather." The scrapped concept was the reverse lyrics idea, inspired by "The Scientist." The answer is "Hit 'Em Up" by Tupac.

4. **Question 4**: The structural inspiration includes "Because the Internet" by Childish Gambino, mentioned as a formative album for younger generations. "Chihiro" is linked to "Spirited Away," but the album that shares a theme with "Chihiro" (maybe doors or water?) would be the Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper's" or others. Wait, the question asks which album inspired "Hit Me Hard and Soft" and also shares a theme with "Chihiro." The article says "Spirited Away" inspired "Chihiro," but the structural inspiration includes "Because the Internet." However, "Spirited Away" isn't an album. The album that shares a thematic element with "Chihiro" (like doors or journeys) might be "Sgt. Pepper's" or "The White Album," but the question specifies the one that shares with "Chihiro's" theme. Since "Chihiro" is about doors from "Spirited Away," maybe the album that also has interconnected themes is "Because the Internet" or another listed. Wait, the article says the duo cited "Because the Internet" as a formative album for younger generations. The theme of interconnectedness is shared between "Hit Me Hard and Soft" and these albums. Since "Chihiro" is part of the album's themes (doors, etc.), the answer might be "Because the Internet" by Childish Gambino, as it's mentioned as one of the formative albums that inspired the interconnectedness.

5. **Question 5**: The visual element present in both the album cover and another album (formative for younger generations) that represents being trapped by fame. The album cover has a door and water. The formative albums include "Because the Internet" (Childish Gambino), "Comfort Eagle" (Cake), "Viva La Vida" (Coldplay). The door on the cover could be the element. The article mentions Finneas describes Eilish as a prisoner of fame needing secure places. The door on the album cover might symbolize being trapped, so the answer is "a door" or "open door." The question asks for the element present in both the album cover and another formative album's theme. Wait, the formative albums like "Because the Internet" might not have doors, but the article says the "Hit Me Hard and Soft" cover has a door. The question is about the element present in both the album cover and another formative album. Since "Because the Internet" is formative, but the article doesn't mention doors there. Alternatively, maybe the water? But the formative albums might not have water. Alternatively, the "doors and water" are the elements on the cover. The question says "formative album for younger generations" which includes "Because the Internet," "Comfort Eagle," "Viva La Vida." Maybe "Viva La Vida" has a connection? Alternatively, the "door" is on the album cover and maybe in "Because the Internet" there's a similar motif. The article doesn't specify, so perhaps the answer is "doors" as the element on the cover and maybe in "Spirited Away," but that's a film. Since the question specifies formative albums, maybe the answer is "doors" because the album's cover has a door, and "Because the Internet" might not, but the question is tricky. Alternatively, "water" is present in the album cover and maybe in another album? The article mentions "Because the Internet" but not water. The answer might be "a door" as the element on the cover and perhaps "Because the Internet" has a theme of interconnectedness but not a door. Hmm, maybe the correct answer is "doors" as the visual element present in both the album cover and the thematic elements of "Because the Internet" (since interconnectedness can be like doors leading to other parts). Alternatively, maybe the answer is "water," but the formative albums might not. Alternatively, the "door" is the element on the cover and maybe in "Spirited Away," but that's a film. Since the question says formative albums for younger generations, the answer is likely "doors" as the visual element (since the cover has a door and the theme of doors is part of the album's concept, which was inspired by "Spirited Away" and others). So the answer is "a door."

6. **Question 6**: The object in the "Lunch" video inspired by hip-hop and recurring in the cover art. The "Lunch" video has oversized sports jerseys. The cover art has a door and water, but the recurring motif symbolizing complexities could be the door or the jersey. The question says "recurring motif in the album's cover art." The cover art's main image is Eilish underwater with a door. The jersey is in the video, but the cover art's main elements are door and water. The article mentions "striped tie" in one image, but maybe the recurring motif symbolizing human existence is the water? Or the door? The question specifies "symbolizing the complexities of human existence" as described by Finneas. The article says "doors and water" represent fear and uncertainty. So the answer is "water" or "doors." The question asks for the object in both the video and cover art. The "Lunch" video's clothing (jersey) and the cover's door/water. Wait, the question says "object... also a recurring motif in the album's cover art." The cover art's recurring elements are doors and water. The "Lunch" video's clothing is the jersey. But the question says the object in the video (inspired by hip-hop) and the cover art. Maybe the answer is "door" as the cover's element and the jersey isn't part of the cover. Alternatively, maybe the "striped tie" mentioned in the cover image? The article mentions Eilish wears a striped tie in one image. But the question is about the "Lunch" video's clothing (jersey) and the cover's recurring motif. Since the article says the cover has doors and water, and the "Lunch" video uses oversized jerseys, maybe the answer is "oversized sports jersey" but it's not in the cover art. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing it. Alternatively, the "tie" is part of the cover art, but the question's focus is on the song "Lunch" and the motif symbolizing complexities. The article says "doors and water" represent fear and uncertainty, which are complexities. The answer would be "doors" or "water." Since the question says "object" (singular), perhaps "door" is the answer because it's a visual element present on the cover and the "Lunch" video's theme might involve doors? Wait, no. The "Lunch" video's clothing is the jersey, but the question is about the object that symbolizes complexities. The article states "doors and water" are the symbols. The answer is "doors" or "water." Since the question asks for the object present in both the video and cover art, maybe the "door" is on the cover and the "jersey" isn't. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is "water" because "Hit Me Hard and Soft" cover has water, and the "Lunch" video isn't about water. Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe the correct answer is "doors" since the cover has a door, and the song "Chihiro" references doors from "Spirited Away," but the question links to Finneas's description of being trapped by fame. The article says "doors and water" symbolize fear and uncertainty. Since the question specifies "object... symbolizing the complexities of human existence," which Finneas mentioned, the answer could be "doors" or "water." The question says "present in both the music video for 'Lunch' and cover art." The "Lunch" video's setting isn't water, so maybe the answer is "doors." Alternatively, maybe it's "water" but I'm not sure. Let me check again. The article says "doors and water" are recurring images. The cover has both, and the "Lunch" video's theme might not include doors but the article doesn't specify. Hmm, maybe the answer is "doors" since the cover has it and the "Lunch" video's theme isn't about doors. Alternatively, maybe the "door" is part of the cover and the question's "object" refers to that. I'll go with "doors" as the answer.

7. **Question 7**: The song title referenced in "Blue" lyrics that shares a name with a track using a string motif reused by Finneas. The article says "Blue" has lyrics referencing previous songs. The string motif from "Skinny" is reused in "The Greatest" bridge. So the song is "Skinny" because its string motif is reused in "The Greatest," which is the one referenced in "Blue." Wait, the question says the song title referenced in "Blue" is the same as the one that had the string motif. The article says "Finneas reuses the string motif from 'Skinny'... and matches the melody for the bridge of another track, 'The Greatest,' bringing the album full circle." So "Skinny" is the original song, and "The Greatest" uses it. But the question asks which song's title is in "Blue's" lyrics. The article says "Eilish rewrote the lyrics to the first verse so that each line references a previous song on the album." The tenth song is "Blue," which references "Skinny" (first song) and others. The string motif is from "Skinny," so the answer is "Skinny."

8. **Question 8**: The earlier album made during global isolation (Covid) shares its title with a phrase describing the underwater imagery's emotion. The article mentions "Happier Than Ever" was made during the quiet of Covid. The underwater imagery on "Hit Me Hard and Soft" cover represents feeling "drowning in the complexity of being a human." The phrase "Happier Than Ever" doesn't directly describe drowning. Wait, maybe the "emotional state evoked by the underwater imagery" is "drowning in complexity," but the album title from the pandemic is "Happier Than Ever." The question says the title shares with a phrase describing that emotion. Since the underwater imagery's feeling is drowning (fear and uncertainty), but the album title "Happier Than Ever" doesn't match. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The article says "Hit Me Hard and Soft" was the first time she felt perspective, implying "Happier Than Ever" was during isolation. The question's answer must be "Happier Than Ever" as the earlier album made during isolation, and the emotional state from the underwater imagery is "drowning in complexity," but the title doesn't match. Wait, the question says the album's title shares the phrase describing the emotion. The emotion is "drowning in complexity," but the album title "Happier Than Ever" is the one from the pandemic. Since there's no direct match, maybe it's N/A. Alternatively, maybe the title "Hit Me Hard and Soft" has a song named after the emotion? No. Wait, the article says the underwater imagery represents "I was drowning in the complexity of being a human." The phrase "Happier Than Ever" might contrast with that, but the question asks for the album title that shares the phrase describing the emotion. Since there's no exact match, maybe the answer is "N/A." Alternatively, perhaps the "emotional state" is "being a prisoner of fame," but the album title is "Happier Than Ever." The article doesn't link the title to the emotion, so answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "shares its title with a phrase describing the emotional state evoked by the underwater imagery." The underwater imagery's emotion is "drowning in complexity of being human." The phrase "Hit Me Hard and Soft" is the album title, but that's the current one. The earlier album during isolation is "Happier Than Ever," whose title doesn't match. Thus, N/A.

Wait, the article says "Happier Than Ever" is the title of a song and album. The emotional state from the cover's underwater imagery is "drowning in complexity," but the album title "Happier Than Ever" doesn't describe that. So the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the song "Happier Than Ever" has a connection to the underwater imagery? The article mentions its video is in a downpour, not underwater. Hmm, so N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The clothing in "Lunch" and "Birds of a Feather" videos. The article says "Lunch" features oversized sports jerseys. The "Birds of a Feather" video's description mentions "over-sized basketball jersey" in the studio image. The answer is "oversized sports jersey."

10. **Question 10**: The artistic medium mentioned in Eilish's early work and Lana Del Rey's video that inspired the album's original underwater concept. The article says Eilish's early work includes sketches of liquids and water. Lana's "Blue Jeans" video influenced her. The original concept for the album cover was "being naked in the bottom of the ocean," which references Nirvana's "Nevermind" (baby in water). The artistic medium here is "sketches" or "videos." The original concept's inspiration was Nirvana's album cover (a visual artwork). The question asks for the medium mentioned in connection with Eilish's early work and Lana's video. The article says "I've just always been really attracted to liquid in videos and also in my drawings," so the medium is "sketches/drawings" and "music videos." The original concept was inspired by Nirvana's album cover (visual artwork). The question's answer is "sketches" (since the original concept's inspiration is visual, but the question asks for the medium mentioned in her early work and Lana's video. The article mentions "sketches" as her early work's medium and the video from Lana. The artistic medium connecting both is "sketches" (her own) and "music videos" (Lana's). The question asks for the medium that inspired the original concept. The original concept was inspired by Nirvana's cover (visual artwork), but the question's first part is about Eilish's early work (sketches) and the video (Lana's). The answer might be "music videos" but the original concept's inspiration is Nirvana's visual. Alternatively, the artistic medium mentioned in connection with her early work is "sketches," which also influenced the original concept (since she mentioned sketches of water). The answer is "sketches."

11. **Question 11**: The scrapped video concept for "Birds of a Feather" was inspired by a Coldplay song's style. The article says the scrapped idea involved reverse lyrics, inspired by Coldplay's "The Scientist." So the answer is "The Scientist."

12. **Question 12**: The object on "Nevermind" cover referenced by Eilish's original concept. Nirvana's "Nevermind" has a baby in water with a dollar bill on a fishhook. Eilish's original concept was "being naked in the bottom of the ocean," similar to the baby. The object is the "dollar bill on a fishhook" or just the "dollar bill." The article says "lured by a dollar bill dangling on a fishline." So the object is the "dollar bill."

13. **Question 13**: The Pinterest mood board for "Birds of a Feather" has flocks of birds and a contradictory natural element. The article mentions "a man on a beautiful beach who happens to be on fire." The contradictory element is "fire" alongside birds. So the answer is "fire."
