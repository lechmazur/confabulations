Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the provided article. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked and avoid any assumptions.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which major department store chain partnered with Jazzercise in the late 1970s. Scanning through the Jazzercise section, the article mentions that Jazzercise was the second-fastest growing franchise after Domino's Pizza by 1982, but there's no mention of a department store. So, answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Lilias Folan's weight loss claim. The article states she credited yoga with curing her depression and helping her lose weight but doesn't specify the number of pounds. So, N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The San Diego studio where Judi Sheppard Missett first taught. The article says she was based in San Diego and started Jazzercise there, but the exact studio name isn't given. So, N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Olympic athlete endorsing Jogbra. The article mentions the Jogbra's introduction in 1978 but doesn't name an endorser. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Percentage of households owning Jane Fonda's video by 1983. The article states that by 1985, a third had VCRs, but not the exact percentage for 1983. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Medical journal with the heart attack study. The text mentions a book by a former Air Force physician, but not a journal. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Retail price of Nike's waffle shoe in 1974. The article doesn't mention the price. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Calories burned in Fonda's workout. The article doesn't specify calorie numbers. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Celebrity who opened the first co-ed gym in 1977. The article mentions Arnold Schwarzenegger's influence but not a specific celebrity opening a gym that year. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Membership fee at Fonda's studio. No mention of fees. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** VCR ownership when Fonda's book was a bestseller. The article says by 1985, a third had VCRs, but the book was 1981. It mentions 2.5% in 1980 and a third by 1985, so maybe 2.5% in 1981? But the question is about the time of the book's success. The article states that in 1980, 2.5% had VCRs, so by 1981 it might have been slightly higher but not specified. Since it's not exact, N/A.

12. **Question 12:** The Austrian's son who believed in the uterus myth. The article says women were told that exercise could cause uterus issues, but the question refers to someone believing that. The text mentions Natalia's book stating that belief, but the "shaggy-haired son" is Arnold Schwarzenegger. Wait, the question is about who believed the uterus myth? The article says that before the 70s, some thought exercise caused uterus issues, but the Austrian's son (Schwarzenegger) is associated with bodybuilding. The question might be a trick. The answer is N/A because the person in question (Arnold) didn't believe that; the myth was what others believed. The question's premise is incorrect, so N/A.

13. **Question 13:** PBS show by Jazzercise's creator. The article says Jazzercise's creator was Judi Sheppard Missett, but the PBS show mentioned is "Lilias, Yoga and You" hosted by Lilias Folan. So the question's details don't match. The answer is N/A because the show was by Lilias, not Judi.

14. **Question 14:** Best-selling video by the Cincinnati housewife. The housewife is Lilias Folan, but the best-selling video was Jane Fonda's. The question is mixing two people. So N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Book co-written by Bowerman and the cardiologist. The article says Bill Bowerman and Dr. Waldo Harris wrote "Jogging". The other book mentioned is "Aerobics" by the Air Force doc, but the question asks for a book co-written by both? The answer is "Jogging".

16. **Question 16:** First all-women's road race. The article mentions the first all-women's road race in Central Park, 1972. The same city (NYC) where Yoga Journal was founded by Northern Californians. So the name is the Central Park race, so answer: "the first all-women's road race in Central Park" but the question asks for the name. The article doesn't name it, just refers to it as "the first all-women's road race in Central Park, 1972". So the answer is N/A because there's no specific name given.

17. **Question 17:** Broadway hit that inspired Jazzercise. The article says Jazzercise was inspired by movies like "Saturday Night Fever" and the Broadway smash "A Chorus Line". The answer is "A Chorus Line". The Olympics city where she opened her studio? The studio was in San Diego, but the Olympics was in LA 1984. The question asks for the Broadway show's name, so "A Chorus Line".

18. **Question 18:** Bodybuilder mentioned with Carla Dunlap and featured in People's 1977 cover. The article mentions Lisa Lyon and Carla Dunlap as bodybuilders. The People cover was about jogging with Farrah Fawcett and Lee Majors. The question's bodybuilder is not mentioned here. Arnold is mentioned but not linked to that cover. So N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Domino's Pizza sales in 1982. The article states Jazzercise was second to Domino's in franchise growth, but not the sales figure. N/A.

20. **Question 20:** Progressive activist married to Jane Fonda who forbade lifting in 1950s. The activist is Tom Hayden, mentioned as Fonda's husband. The part about forbidding lifting refers to 1950s coaches, not Hayden. The question combines two facts: Tom Hayden is the spouse, but the forbidding part is from the article's note on 1950s coaches. The answer is Tom Hayden.
