Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any external knowledge. Let me start with the first question.

1. **Which specific trade agreements with European Union countries did Jamieson Greer help negotiate during his time as Robert Lighthizer's deputy?**  
The article mentions Greer negotiated with China, Canada, Mexico, and other countries. The EU isn't specifically named here. So the answer is N/A.

2. **How many billions of dollars in agricultural exports were affected by the retaliatory tariffs from Canada and Mexico according to Senator Cortez Masto's testimony?**

3. **What percentage reduction in the U.S. trade deficit did Greer predict would result from implementing Trump's universal tariff plan?**  
The article states Greer said the tariff should be studied to see if it reduces the deficit but doesn't mention a percentage. N/A.

4. **Which major American manufacturing company's CEO testified alongside Greer at the Senate Finance Committee hearing?**  
The article doesn't mention any CEOs testifying with Greer. N/A.

5. **What role did Howard Lutnick play in negotiating the previous trade deals with China during Trump's first term?**

6. **How many USTR staff members in the Geneva office were reassigned to Brussels under the restructuring plan Greer proposed?**  
No numbers are given about staff reassignments. N/A.

7. **What was the total dollar value of Canadian imports affected by Trump's threatened 25% tariff before he paused the action?**  
The article mentions tariffs on Canada and Mexico, but the value isn't specified. However, it says China had $400B tariffs. But the question is about Canada. Since the article doesn't state the Canadian figure, N/A.

8. **Which specific provisions of the first-term trade deals with Mexico did Greer identify as requiring immediate review?**  
The article says he would review compliance with trade deals but doesn't specify provisions. N/A.

9. **What timeline did Greer present to the Senate committee for completing his proposed restructuring of the international trading system?**  
He mentioned a "relatively short window of time," but no specific timeline. N/A.

10. **How many years did Greer serve as legal counsel for Cleveland-Cliffs before joining the Trump administration?**  
The article lists Cleveland-Cliffs as a client but doesn't mention years. N/A.

11. **Based on the commentary across different sections, which former trade representative and mentor is implied to have directly influenced the nominee’s approach toward restructuring global trade?**  
The article mentions Robert Lighthizer as his former boss, so Lighthizer is the answer.

12. **Considering the president's near-imposition on two neighboring nations, what percentage tariff was he reported to have almost applied to goods from these partners before pausing the action?**  
The article states Trump almost imposed 25% on Canada and Mexico, so 25%.

13. **Referring to the discussion of numerical values associated with trade measures, what monetary figure is mentioned in connection with the additional tariff affecting a major trading partner?**  
The $400 billion of Chinese imports with a 10% tariff is mentioned. So $400 billion.

14. **Within the broader context of shifting international aid and economic policies, which government agency, known for its role in humanitarian efforts, was indicated by the president as a target for closure?**  
The article says Trump called for closing USAID. Answer USAID.

15. **Given the debate over control of trade policy highlighted in the article, which nominee’s role is questioned due to the president’s plan to delegate trade strategy to an official from the commerce department?**  
The article mentions Howard Lutnick as the commerce secretary pick in charge of trade policy. The nominee in question is Greer, since his role's autonomy is unclear. So Greer.

16. **Drawing from the candidate’s background that intertwines legal practice with industry service, which professional title from his past is emphasized as reinforcing his qualifications for altering trade relationships?**  
He was a trade lawyer and partner at King & Spalding. The title emphasized is "trade lawyer."

17. **Linking his early career to his later trade negotiations, in which theater of military engagement did the candidate see service before entering the field of trade law?**

18. **Identifying the official who associated uncertain trade policies with a direct impact on local commerce, which senator specifically recounted a setback experienced by a small business as a consequence of these policies?**  
Senator Cortez Masto mentioned a business losing a project. Answer Cortez Masto.

19. **In the president’s social media declaration of priorities, which one of the three economic sectors—manufacturing, agriculture, or services—is implicitly earmarked for expansion along with the goal of opening export markets?**  
The quote says "defending American Manufacturing, Agriculture, and Services," so all three. But the question asks which is "earmarked for expansion." Since all three are listed, but the question wants one, maybe all three? Wait, the question says "one of the three" so maybe they want all three? Wait, the article says "defending American Manufacturing, Agriculture, and Services," so all three are mentioned. The question asks which one is earmarked, but since all three are listed, perhaps the answer is all three? But instructions say answer with N/A if not exact. The question says "which one of the three", so maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, looking back: The question says "which one of the three economic sectors... is implicitly earmarked for expansion along with the goal of opening export markets?" The quote includes all three, so the answer is all three. But the question expects one, so maybe it's N/A. Wait, the exact quote: "defending American Manufacturing, Agriculture, and Services, and opening up Export Markets everywhere." So each of the three sectors is mentioned. The question asks which one is earmarked. Since all three are listed, maybe the answer is N/A because it's all three, not one. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting one of the three, but the article lists all three, so maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick, but according to the instructions, if the question asks for one and the article lists all three, then N/A. Because the question says "which one of the three", so the answer is N/A.

Wait, but maybe the question is phrased as "which one of the three" but actually the answer includes all three. Since the question is phrased as "which one of the three... is implicitly earmarked", and the article lists all three, the correct answer would be all three. But the options are three sectors, so the answer can't be all three. Since the question asks for one, but the article mentions all three, then the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking which one is part of the list, so the answer is all three, but the format requires a single answer. Since the question is "which one of the three", the correct answer is N/A because all three are listed, not one. So I'll put N/A.

Wait, the exact quote from the article: "Jamieson will focus the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative on reining in the Country's massive Trade Deficit, defending American Manufacturing, Agriculture, and Services, and opening up Export Markets everywhere," So all three sectors are mentioned. The question asks which one is "earmarked for expansion along with the goal of opening export markets". The answer would be all three, but since the question requires one, it's N/A. Alternatively, maybe "manufacturing" because it's listed first? But that's assuming. Since the question is asking for one of the three, but the article lists all three, the answer is N/A.

20. **Integrating multiple parts of the testimony, which overarching trade strategy mentioned by the nominee is suggested for further examination as a tool to mitigate the long-standing trade imbalance?**  
Greer said Trump's universal tariff should be studied to reduce the trade deficit. So the strategy is imposing a universal tariff on all imports.
