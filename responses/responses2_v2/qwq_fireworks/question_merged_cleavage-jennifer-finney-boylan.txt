Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each question strictly based on that.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions Boylan as a "one-woman clearinghouse of information about endocrinologists, electrolysis, support groups and voice changing techniques." But it doesn't specify any particular endocrinologist's name. So, answer N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The article states, "Boylan describes a moment of reckoning in a changing room. A size 12 dress is too snug; she needs a size 14. Cue regret, ennui and soul searching. It's a relatable scene... The problem wasn't that she'd gained almost 50 pounds in 25 years." The 50 pounds is directly mentioned here, so the answer is 50.

3. **Question 3**: The article says she was the subject of documentaries but doesn't name any. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The article mentions she taught at Colby College, but her transition happened when she was 44. However, the article doesn't specify the year she was at Colby. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Richard Russo accompanied her to Neenah, Wis., for her gender-affirming surgery. So the procedure is gender-affirming surgery.

6. **Question 6**: The article says she stopped trying to change her voice. It doesn't mention which technique was most successful before that. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The article mentions her daughter getting into Vassar but doesn't state the graduation attendance. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: She appeared on Larry King Live, but the number of episodes isn't specified. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The article doesn't mention the advance payment amount. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The article doesn't mention a chapter about the Medium essay backlash. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: "Mad Honey" is called a best-seller but exact sales numbers aren't given. N/A.

12. **Question 12**: The dress size mentioned is 12 initially. So 12.

13. **Question 13**: Originally called "Both Sides Now," which the article states. The musical reference might be Grateful Dead, but the title is given as "Both Sides Now."

14. **Question 14**: The article doesn't specify the year Zai came out. N/A.

15. **Question 15**: The article lists GLAAD and PEN America but no others. So N/A.

17. **Question 17**: The article doesn't mention a dog breed. N/A.

18. **Question 18**: The article doesn't state any specific award for Richard Russo. N/A.

19. **Question 19**: The support groups are mentioned but no specific name. N/A.
