Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by skimming through the questions again to get an idea of what's being asked.

Question 1: Which vaccine's discontinuation in the 1990s due to severe side effects like seizures directly contributed to the resurgence of whooping cough outbreaks among adolescents despite its higher efficacy?

The article mentions that the older pertussis vaccine used whole cells and caused reactions like fevers and seizures. The newer version introduced in the 1990s is acellular and has less side effects but doesn't prevent infection as effectively. The article says that the newer formulation might be why more adolescents are getting whooping cough. Wait, the question is about discontinuation of the old vaccine. The old one was replaced, so the answer is the whole-cell pertussis vaccine. But the question says "discontinuation in the 1990s"—since the new version replaced it, maybe the answer is the older vaccine. The article says the new one was introduced in the 1990s, so the discontinuation of the old one (whole-cell) caused the problem. So the answer is the whole-cell pertussis vaccine. But the question asks for the name of the vaccine that was discontinued. The article refers to it as the "original vaccine" or "whole cells from the bacteria". The answer should be "the whole-cell pertussis vaccine" but the question might expect "the older vaccine" but perhaps the exact name. Alternatively, maybe "the pertussis vaccine" but the question specifies the discontinuation of the one with severe side effects. The article says "the vaccine relied on whole cells from the bacteria that cause whooping cough. It was potent but harsh, often setting off high fevers and seizures." So the answer is the whole-cell pertussis vaccine. But the question says "discontinuation"—since it was replaced by the acellular version, so the answer is the whole-cell pertussis vaccine. 

Question 2: What percentage of measles cases in 2023 occurred in adults over 50 who had received only one dose of the M.M.R. vaccine, according to the C.D.C. data referenced?

Looking in the article: "Of the 284 measles cases recorded among Americans last year, 11 percent were in people who had received one or two doses of the vaccine. That may help explain why 27 percent of cases were adults older than 20." The question asks specifically about adults over 50 with one dose. The article mentions "adults older than 20" (27% of cases were in this group), but doesn't break it down to over 50 or specify one dose. So the answer would be N/A because the question specifies "adults over 50" and "received only one dose"—the article doesn't give that exact data. 

Question 3: Which U.S. president's healthcare policy changes in the 1980s were explicitly blamed for the rubella outbreak that led to Elsa Sjunneson's congenital condition?

The article states: "Anti-vaccine campaigns have often targeted the M.M.R. vaccine... The past offers a preview: In the late 1980s, budget cuts by the Reagan administration brought down vaccination rates..." and Elsa's mother was infected in 1985. So the president is Reagan. 

Question 4: What congenital syndrome affecting vision and hearing was caused by the 1985 mumps outbreak in New York City?

Wait, the article says Elsa's mother was infected with rubella, not mumps. The question says mumps, but the text mentions rubella. The article states: "Her mother was infected with rubella during an outbreak in New York City in 1985... congenital rubella syndrome, or C.R.S." So the answer is congenital rubella syndrome. But the question mentions mumps, which is incorrect. Since the question has an incorrect premise (mumps instead of rubella), the answer is N/A. Wait, but the article says rubella. The question says "mumps outbreak", which is wrong. Therefore, since the question's premise is wrong, answer is N/A.

Question 5: Which disease's vaccine contains a live virus that prevents its administration to pregnant women, resulting in birth defects comparable to those seen in pre-vaccine-era polio epidemics?

The article says: "rubella, or German measles, can be dangerous for pregnant women and their babies. Yet pregnant women cannot be immunized against the disease because the vaccine contains a weakened live virus. These days, they are typically not at risk... If you've got nonimmune mothers catching rubella, then you have the lifelong complications of blindness and deafness and everything else." The birth defects are from rubella, and the vaccine's live virus prevents its use in pregnancy. The question asks for the disease, which is rubella. The comparison to polio is not mentioned, but the question's wording is okay as the article does mention birth defects. So the answer is rubella.

Question 6: How many unvaccinated school-aged children in California were hospitalized during the 2024 whooping cough outbreak due to exposure from undervaccinated peers?

The article states "In California alone, the disease struck 2,000 people between January and October last year. More than 60 infants younger than 4 months were hospitalized in the state. One died." The question asks about school-aged children in California hospitalized. The article mentions "More than 60 infants" were hospitalized, but doesn't specify school-aged children's numbers. The total cases in California were 2,000, but the question is about hospitalized school-aged. Since the article doesn't specify the number for school-aged children, answer is N/A.

Question 7: What was the primary reason cited in the 2015 study for measles accounting for 50% of all pediatric deaths in the U.S. prior to vaccine introduction?

The article says: "A 2015 study estimated that before widespread vaccination, measles may have accounted for as many as half of all infectious disease deaths in children." The reason is that measles cripples immune defenses, leaving the body vulnerable to other pathogens. The article states "The virus cripples immune defenses, leaving the body vulnerable to other pathogens." So the primary reason is the immune suppression leading to other infections. The answer is "immune suppression" or "crippling immune defenses". The question asks for the primary reason, so the article's exact wording is "The virus cripples immune defenses..." so the answer is "immune suppression" or "crippling immune defenses". The answer should be "immune suppression".

Question 8: Which bacterial infection's resurgence in adults is attributed to the replacement of whole-cell vaccines with acellular formulations in the 2000s, according to Dr. Edwards' research?

The article mentions Dr. Edwards discussing pertussis (whooping cough): "Experts now believe this is one reason that more adolescents than young children have become infected with whooping cough during outbreaks in recent years. 'That was really the first hint' of declining vaccine immunity, Dr. Edwards said." The replacement was the acellular vaccine introduced in the 1990s, leading to issues in adolescents. The bacterial infection is pertussis. So the answer is pertussis.

Question 9: What is the estimated annual global death toll from congenital rubella syndrome today, based on the article's comparison to pre-vaccine mortality rates?

The article says "worldwide, rubella is the leading vaccine-preventable cause of birth defects." But the pre-vaccine era death toll isn't given. The article mentions that before vaccines, measles killed 2.6 million annually, but for rubella, it only says it's leading cause of birth defects. The question asks for today's death toll. The article doesn't state current numbers, so answer is N/A.

Question 10: In the discussion of vaccination policy failures and differing vaccine formulations, which outbreak mentioned in the article is linked to the switch from a whole-cell to a newer vaccine formulation that, despite being less reactive, may lead to increased cases among vaccinated adolescents?

The pertussis outbreak is linked to the switch to the acellular vaccine leading to more cases in adolescents. The article says "Experts now believe this is one reason that more adolescents than young children have become infected with whooping cough during outbreaks in recent years." So the answer is whooping cough (pertussis).

Question 11: Reflecting on the account of congenital complications and community protection, which disease is directly implicated in causing lifelong birth defects as illustrated by Elsa Sjunneson’s personal story?

The article clearly states Elsa's condition is from rubella, so the answer is rubella.

Question 12: Based on epidemiological modeling referenced in the article, which age group—considered too young to be fully vaccinated—is predicted to experience the most dramatic increase in cases if immunization rates continue to decline?

The article says "cases would rise most dramatically in infants — who are too young to be fully vaccinated — and in children ages 5 to 15." So the answer is infants.

Question 13: Drawing on historical events interwoven with current trends, which disease outbreak from the late 1980s, exacerbated by federal budget cuts, is discussed as having infected over 55,000 Americans?

The article mentions "In the late 1980s, budget cuts by the Reagan administration brought down vaccination rates... The fallout was swift. From 1989 through 1991, measles infected more than 55,000 Americans..." So the disease is measles.

Question 14: Considering both modern vaccination challenges and the high transmissibility noted in the article, which disease is described as being so contagious that one infected individual may pass it on to up to 18 others?

The article says "measles is extraordinarily contagious, lingering in the air for up to two hours after an infected person has left the room. Each infected person can spread the virus to as many as 18 others." So the answer is measles.

Question 15: Integrating information on waning immunity and CDC statistics in the article, which vaccine is associated with 11 percent of recorded cases occurring in individuals who had received one or two doses?

The article states: "Of the 284 measles cases recorded among Americans last year, 11 percent were in people who had received one or two doses of the vaccine." So the answer is the M.M.R. vaccine (since it's for measles, mumps, rubella).

Question 16: Weaving together the account of vaccine-induced side effects and epidemiological shifts, which vaccine—once known for triggering high fevers and seizures—has a modern formulation whose limitations are now linked with outbreaks among adolescents?

The older pertussis vaccine (whole-cell) caused fevers/seizures. The newer acellular version is linked to outbreaks in adolescents. The answer is the pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine.

Question 17: Considering the discussion on controversial vaccine ingredients versus their immunological benefits, which ingredient, often blamed for allergies by detractors, is stated in the article to actually enhance the immune response?

The article's last paragraph mentions: "Aluminum in Vaccines: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump's nominee for health secretary, has blamed the ingredient for allergies and other illnesses. Scientists say it actually bolsters the immune response." So the answer is aluminum.

Question 18: Based on the synthesis of past vaccination successes with emerging epidemic risks, which disease does the article suggest may resurface in all age groups should immunization rates continue to fall?

The article's first paragraph says "preventable infectious diseases will resurface in all age groups, experts say." But the question asks which specific disease. The article mentions measles, mumps, rubella, and pertussis as examples. But the question might refer to measles as the most mentioned. Wait, the article says "if immunizations continue to fall... preventable infectious diseases will resurface in all age groups... even adults who were vaccinated decades ago may find themselves vulnerable to what are now considered childhood diseases." The answer could be measles, but the question is which disease. The article says "measles may have accounted for as many as half of all infectious disease deaths in children before vaccines." But the question asks which disease the article suggests may resurface in all age groups. The article doesn't single out one, but the question might refer to measles as a primary example. Alternatively, the answer is "measles" because it's highlighted as a major concern. Alternatively, the article says "preventable infectious diseases" generally, but the question asks for a specific one. Since the question says "which disease", perhaps measles. Alternatively, the first example given is pertussis. Wait, the first example is pertussis (whooping cough) with 32,000 cases. The answer could be measles, but the article mentions "measles, mumps and rubella" as childhood diseases. The question's answer might be "measles" as it's a prominent example. Alternatively, the question might refer to all, but the answer needs to be specific. Wait, the article says "preventable infectious diseases will resurface in all age groups, experts say." So it's not one disease but several. The question asks "which disease", so perhaps the most emphasized one is measles. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "measles" because it's mentioned as the one experts worry most about (the article says "experts tend to worry most about a resurgence of measles"). So the answer is measles.

Question 19: Reflecting on current immunization levels and potential risks to school children, which approximate percentage level for M.M.R. vaccination during the 2023–24 school year is mentioned as being insufficient for complete community protection?

The article states: "for the 2023-24 school year. That means about 280,000 school children remain susceptible to these diseases, raising the risk of outbreaks in schools and other public spaces." The previous rates were "roughly 95 percent" and the current is below 93%. So the answer is 93 percent (since it's "dipped below 93% nationwide"). The question asks for the approximate percentage level mentioned as insufficient. The article says "dipped below 93 percent nationwide for the 2023-24 school year." So the answer is 93%.
