Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and answer exactly what's asked without assuming anything else.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks about the percentage of Tesla's total revenue from energy storage products that had a 60% quarterly increase. The article mentions that sales of battery storage products soared 60% from the third quarter and more than four times from a year earlier. However, there's no mention of the percentage of total revenue these products contributed. Since the question is about revenue percentage, and the article doesn't provide that figure, I should answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** This is about BYD's energy storage capacity in 2024. The article states that Tesla's battery products could store 11 gigawatt-hours, but it doesn't mention BYD's numbers. So, N/A here.

3. **Question 3:** The article says Tesla sales fell in the US, Europe, and China during the first nine months. But it doesn't specify which European country had the steepest decline. Without that detail, N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The average selling price in China during Q4 isn't provided. The article gives delivery numbers but not pricing info. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Number of autonomous driving patents filed by Tesla in 2024? The text talks about investors focusing on autonomous tech but doesn't mention patents filed. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Percentage of Trump's campaign funding from Musk's $250M. The article states Musk contributed $250M to elect Trump but doesn't say how much that was of the total campaign funds. Can't calculate, so N/A.

7. **Question 7:** How many GM models were introduced? The article lists GM as a competitor but doesn't specify the number of models. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Production cost reduction for the $25k car? The article mentions the planned price but no cost reduction figures. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Market share lost to Volkswagen in Europe? The text says Tesla's sales declined in Europe but doesn't specify Volkswagen's gain or the exact market share loss. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Number of humanoid robots manufactured? The article mentions Tesla is developing them but gives no production numbers. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The drop in global deliveries from 2023 to 2024. The numbers given are 1,808,581 in 2023 and 1,789,226 in 2024. Subtracting gives 19,355. So the answer is 19,355.

12. **Question 12:** Energy capacity from Q4 battery sales increase. The article states that sales were enough to store 11 gigawatt-hours. But the question is about the additional sales compared to previous quarters. It says sales in Q4 were 60% higher than Q3 and four times Q4 2023. However, the 11 GWh is the total capacity for that quarter, not the increase. Since the question asks for the "additional" from the increase, but the text doesn't specify the exact additional capacity, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says "enough to store 11 gigawatt-hours of energy" in the fourth quarter. But the question is about the additional sales in Q4. Hmm, maybe the 11 GWh is the total for that quarter, so the answer is 11? But the question is phrased as "the amount of energy capacity provided by the additional sales". The text says "sales of those products soared 60% from the third quarter, and more than four times from a year earlier... enough to store 11 gigawatt-hours." So the 11 GWh is the total for Q4, not the increase. Since the question is about the additional sales, which would be the difference from the previous quarter, but we don't know Q3's number. The article only states that Q4 was 60% higher than Q3. If Q3's sales were X, then Q4 is 1.6X. The total in Q4 is 11 GWh, so the additional would be 0.6X. But without knowing X, we can't compute it. So answer N/A.

Wait, the article says "Sales of those products soared 60 percent from the third quarter, and more than four times from a year earlier, Tesla said, enough to store 11 gigawatt-hours of energy." So the 11 GWh is the total for the fourth quarter. The question is asking for the amount from the additional sales. Since the 11 GWh is the total, not the increase, but maybe the answer is 11? Or is the question trying to trick us? The wording is tricky. The article says the sales (in quantity) increased, but the energy capacity stored is 11 GWh. The question asks for the "amount of energy capacity provided by the additional sales in the fourth quarter". Since the total is 11, but we don't know the previous quarter's number, so we can't find the difference. Therefore N/A.

13. **Question 13:** The rival noted for rapid expansion in both battery and hybrids, nearly closing the gap with Tesla. The article mentions BYD sold 1.76M EVs and 2.49M hybrids, and that BYD nearly caught up to Tesla. So the answer is BYD.

14. **Question 14:** The political figure associated with regulatory changes for self-driving tech. The article says investors bet on Trump removing obstacles, and Musk supported him. So the answer is Donald J. Trump.

15. **Question 15:** Planned starting price for the 2025 Tesla car. The article states $25,000, so that's the answer.

16. **Question 16:** The number of vehicles delivered in Q4 2024, which was their best. The text says 495,570.

17. **Question 17:** Musk's contribution to the political figure's election. The article says Musk spent over $250 million to help elect Trump. So $250 million.

18. **Question 18:** The factor increase in battery sales Q4 2024 vs same quarter previous year. The article states "more than four times from a year earlier". So the answer is four times (or more, but the question asks for the factor, so "four times").

19. **Question 19:** Effect of removing federal programs on competitors vs Tesla. The article says Musk claims it would hurt competitors more. So the answer is "hurt competitors more than Tesla".

20. **Question 20:** Competitor with modern designs and lower prices. The article mentions BYD, GM, Kia-Hyundai, VW, BMW. The specific mention of "newer designs and lower prices" is in the sentence: "carmakers like BYD... often with models that have newer designs and lower prices." So BYD is the answer here, but wait, the question says "which competitor is portrayed as challenging Tesla's dominance by offering models with more modern designs and lower prices?" The article states that "BYD, which has nearly caught up to Tesla... often with models that have newer designs and lower prices." So yes, BYD is the answer here. Wait, but the sentence actually says "carmakers like BYD in China, General Motors, Kia-Hyundai, Volkswagen and BMW have challenged Tesla's dominance, often with models that have newer designs and lower prices." So the answer could be any of those, but the question is which one? The article mentions BYD as having nearly caught up, so maybe BYD is the best answer here. Alternatively, the question might be looking for the general list, but the question says "which competitor", so the first one listed? But the question is about the competitor that is noted for that. The key phrase is "newer designs and lower prices" is in the same sentence as all the listed companies. Since the question is about a specific competitor mentioned in the article as challenging with those factors, but the article doesn't single out one; it's a list. Wait, the article says "BYD, which has nearly caught up to Tesla as the world leader... But carmakers like BYD... have challenged Tesla's dominance, often with models that have newer designs and lower prices." So the "newer designs and lower prices" applies to all the listed companies, but the question is asking for the one that's portrayed as doing that. Since the question is in the context of the article, the first example given (BYD) is the one that's also noted for nearly catching up. But maybe the answer is BYD? Or perhaps the question is looking for BYD because it's the first mentioned in the list and has the most info. Alternatively, since the question is in the article, maybe the answer is BYD. Let me check again. The article says "BYD... have challenged Tesla's dominance, often with models that have newer designs and lower prices." So BYD is part of the group, but the phrase is for all the listed companies. However, the question is asking for which competitor is portrayed as challenging with those factors. Since the question is in the article, and the answer is in the list, but the exact wording says "carmakers like BYD... have challenged... newer designs and lower prices". So the answer could be any of those, but the question is singular. The article doesn't single out one, so maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "which competitor is portrayed as challenging...", but the article lists multiple. The first one mentioned is BYD, which is also the one that nearly caught up. Since the question is about a competitor that is "noted for" those factors, perhaps BYD is the intended answer here. Alternatively, maybe the answer is BYD because the article specifically mentions BYD's sales numbers. Let's go with BYD.
