Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the provided article. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked and avoid making inferences beyond the text.

1. **How many billions of dollars worth of Ozempic and Wegovy did Denmark export to the United States in 2023?**  
The article mentions that Novo Nordisk makes Ozempic and Wegovy, and that Denmark's exports to the US include packaged medicines, but there's no specific figure given for Ozempic/Wegovy. The total exports to the US are $11 billion, but it's not broken down by drug. So answer N/A.

2. **Which Danish pharmaceutical company announced plans to relocate its headquarters to Virginia near their new carbon-neutral facility?**  
The article says Lego has a new carbon-neutral facility in Virginia, but not Novo Nordisk. The question mentions a pharmaceutical company, so Novo Nordisk isn't mentioned as relocating HQ. Answer N/A.

3. **What percentage of Denmark's total GDP growth came from exports of immunological products to the United States?**  
The article states that Novo Nordisk accounted for all of Denmark's economic growth. Immunological products are part of that, but the exact percentage isn't specified. Since it's all the growth, maybe 100%, but the question specifies "exports of immunological products to the US"—but the article says "all of the country's economic growth" from Novo Nordisk, which is involved in those exports. So maybe 100%? Wait, but the question is about exports of immunological products to the US specifically. The article says "Denmark's exports of immunological products... growing exponentially" but doesn't tie it to GDP percentage. The article says Novo Nordisk's growth contributed all of Denmark's economic growth. Since Novo is a major part of those exports, perhaps the answer is 100%? But the question is about exports to the US, not total exports. Hmm. The article says "all of the country's economic growth" from Novo, so maybe the answer is 100%? But I need to check again. The article says "Novo Nordisk... has recently accounted for half of Denmark's private sector job growth and all of the country's economic growth". So the GDP growth is 100% from Novo. Since Novo's products include immunological products (like Ozempic, etc.), which are exported, but the question is about exports to the US. The article doesn't specify the percentage of GDP from US exports of immunological products, just that immunological exports are a major part. Since the question asks for the percentage of GDP growth from those exports, and Novo's total contribution is all the GDP growth, and Novo's main product is those drugs, perhaps the answer is 100%. But maybe the question is trickier. Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A because it's not explicitly stated as a percentage. The article says "all of the country's economic growth" from Novo, so if Novo's exports (including to US) are the source, then yes. But the question specifies "exports of immunological products to the US"—maybe the answer is 100%? Or N/A? Hmm. Let me check again. The article says "Denmark's exports of immunological products... growing exponentially", but the exact percentage of GDP growth from that is not given. Since the article says all economic growth is from Novo, which makes those products, but not specifically their exports to the US. So maybe N/A.

4. **When did Trump first propose the tariff-for-Greenland exchange during his previous presidency?**  
The article says Trump made the statement on Monday (the news conference mentioned was recent, but the article doesn't give a specific date. It mentions "on Tuesday" and "on Wednesday" in the context of the same event. Since it's about the president-elect, this is during his upcoming presidency, not his previous one. So answer N/A.

5. **How many manufacturing facilities does Novo Nordisk currently operate within the United States?**  
The article states Novo is increasing US production but doesn't give the number of facilities. Answer N/A.

6. **What was the European Commission's official response regarding potential retaliatory tariffs against American pharmaceutical imports?**  
The article says the Commission's spokesman said they were preparing for implications but didn't mention retaliatory tariffs on US pharma. The European Commission's response was that Trump's comments were hypothetical and they were preparing for all possibilities. The question is about retaliatory tariffs against American pharmaceuticals, but the article doesn't mention that specific response. The answer is N/A.

7. **Which Danish hearing aid manufacturer dominates the U.S. market share according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity data?**  
The article says Denmark is the leading supplier of hearing aids to the US but doesn't name the company. Answer N/A.

8. **What military concessions did Denmark offer in response to Trump's territorial demands?**  
The article doesn't mention Denmark offering military concessions. Answer N/A.

9. **How much would Trump's proposed tariffs increase the retail price of Lego products manufactured in Denmark?**  
No specific percentage or figure given. Answer N/A.

10. **Which NATO provision did Trump cite when justifying the strategic importance of acquiring Greenland?**  
The article doesn't mention any specific NATO provision. Answer N/A.

11. **In addition to threatening tariffs on Denmark, which other country's statehood did President-elect Trump propose during the same news conference where he discussed retaking the Panama Canal?**  
The article says he suggested making Canada an American state. Answer: Canada.

12. **Which Danish medical instrument mentioned in the article is directly tied to the country's status as the leading supplier of a product that the European Commission claims would destabilize U.S. trade if tariffs were imposed?**  
The article mentions medical instruments as an export but doesn't link any specific instrument to the Commission's statement. Answer N/A.

13. **How many jobs did Novo Nordisk create in Mexico last year as part of its strategy to circumvent potential U.S. tariffs, according to the European Commission's rebuttal to Trump's threats?**  
The article mentions Lego's Mexico factory but not Novo Nordisk's job numbers there. Answer N/A.

14. **Which agricultural product exported from Denmark to the U.S. saw a 30% increase in 2023 due to trade agreements that Trump's proposed tariffs would nullify, according to the Peterson Institute analysis?**  
The article doesn't mention a 30% increase in any agricultural product. Answer N/A.

15. **According to the article, is Greenland presented as a territory with self-rule within Denmark or as a member state of a broader Nordic alliance?**  
The article states Greenland is an autonomous territory within Denmark. Answer: self-rule within Denmark.

16. **Considering the discussion on pharmaceutical exports, which weight-management drug produced by the Danish company is highlighted as contributing to the soaring demand in the U.S. market?**  
The article mentions Ozempic and Wegovy as popular weight-loss drugs. Answer: Ozempic and Wegovy (but the question asks for one? Or both? The article says "the popular weight-loss drugs" so both. But the answer should be both? Or the question might accept either. Wait the question says "which weight-management drug" (singular), so perhaps Ozempic and Wegovy as a combined answer. The article says "the popular weight-loss drugs" (plural), so maybe list both. The answer would be Ozempic and Wegovy.

17. **Within the discussion of trade balances, what figure in billions is given for the value of goods that Denmark exports to the United States?**  
The article states Denmark sent over $11 billion worth of goods in 2023. Answer: 11.

18. **Linking national security concerns with international trade, which nation is targeted by a potential tariff due to its association with a major firm producing popular weight-loss medications?**  
Denmark, because Novo Nordisk (a Danish firm) makes those drugs. Answer: Denmark.

19. **Amid details about multinational supply chains and environmental initiatives, which U.S. state is mentioned as hosting a carbon-neutral manufacturing facility for a famed toy producer?**  
Virginia (Lego's new facility). Answer: Virginia.

20. **Referring to the asymmetry in trade, what is the number in billions associated with U.S. exports of industrial goods to Denmark that might be confused with the higher Danish export value?**  
The article says the US sends Denmark over $5 billion in goods, including industrial machinery. The Danish exports are $11B. The question asks for the US exports figure. Answer: 5.

21. **In the context of Mr. Trump’s broader tariff strategy and criticism over trading imbalances, which neighboring country is singled out as a target for serious tariffs along with Denmark?**  
The article mentions Mexico and Canada. The question asks for a neighboring country (to the US). Canada and Mexico are both neighbors. The question says "in addition to threatening tariffs on Denmark" and the same news conference where he discussed retaking the Panama Canal, he also reiterated a threat to Mexico and Canada. So the answer would be Mexico and Canada, but the question asks for one. Wait the question says "which neighboring country" so either. The article says "reiterated a threat to put 'very serious tariffs' on Mexico and Canada". Since both are neighbors, but the question might expect both? The answer format requires a single answer. The question says "which neighboring country", so perhaps both? But the options are singular. The article mentions both, so maybe "Mexico and Canada". But maybe the question wants one, but the article says both. The exact question: "which neighboring country... along with Denmark?" The article says "threatening tariffs on Mexico, China and other countries globally, in addition to Denmark". Wait, the exact quote from the article: "Mr. Trump also reiterated a threat to put 'very serious tariffs' on Mexico and Canada, complained about the U.S. trade deficit with Canada and the European Union, and floated an idea to rename the Gulf of Mexico 'the Gulf of America.'" So the answer is Mexico and Canada. But the question says "which neighboring country", so perhaps Mexico and Canada. But the answer should be one? The question might have a typo, but according to the article, both are mentioned. Since the question says "which neighboring country", perhaps the answer is Mexico and Canada, but since the options are singular, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait the question says "which neighboring country" (singular) but the article lists two. So since the question expects one, but there are two, the answer would be N/A? Or maybe pick one? The article says "Mexico and Canada", so maybe "Mexico and Canada" as the answer. Let me check the exact text again. The article says: "On Tuesday, the president-elect also reiterated a threat to put 'very serious tariffs' on Mexico and Canada..." So both are mentioned. The question is asking for a neighboring country (plural in the answer), but the question says "which neighboring country", so maybe the answer is Mexico and Canada. However, the user instructions say to answer exactly as per the text. Since the question is singular, but the answer has two, perhaps N/A? Or maybe the question allows multiple? The instructions say "if the question is specifically asking about exactly how many students started in the major of Chemistry at Harvard if the article only talks about how many graduated (since some could have dropped out or transferred in). Similarly, you should simply answer "N/A" if the question is about a name of somebody's son, yet the article states that this person only had daughters..." So if the question expects one and there are two, answer N/A? Alternatively, the question may have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is Mexico, as it's mentioned first. But I need to check. The question says "which neighboring country is singled out as a target..." but the answer includes two. Since the question allows only one, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is correct and the answer is both. But the format requires a single answer. Hmm. Let me see the exact question again: "which neighboring country is singled out as a target for serious tariffs along with Denmark?" Since both Mexico and Canada are neighboring countries, the answer is Mexico and Canada. But since the question uses "which neighboring country" (singular), but the answer requires two, so maybe N/A. Wait the question says "along with Denmark", so the other countries besides Denmark. Since Mexico and Canada are both mentioned, but the question asks for "which neighboring country", perhaps the answer is Mexico and Canada. However, the answer must be in one tag. Maybe the answer is Mexico and Canada (as a combined answer). Let me check the instructions: "if the question asks you to list two people who did something, but the article only lists one person, you should answer 'N/A'". Here the question asks for one, but the article lists two. So maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question allows multiple. The user instructions didn't specify that, so to follow strictly, answer N/A. But the article explicitly mentions both, so maybe the answer is Mexico and Canada. Since the question is about neighboring countries (plural in reality), but the question uses "country", perhaps the correct answer is Mexico and Canada. So I'll put both.

22. **Based on comments regarding the growth of certain exports, which category of medicinal products is described as having experienced exponential growth in shipments from Denmark?**  
The article says "Denmark's exports of immunological products... have been 'growing exponentially'". Answer: immunological products.

23. **Anticipating a collective reaction, which supranational organization is mentioned as likely to retaliate in the event that tariff measures against Denmark are actually implemented?**  
The European Union (E.U.). The article says "the E.U.-wide response" and mentions the European Commission. Answer: European Union.

24. **When justifying the strategic interest in acquiring an island for security reasons, which U.S. leader is noted as referencing the navigational routes of Russian and Chinese ships?**  
President-elect Donald Trump. The article states: "Mr. Trump argued on Tuesday that U.S. ownership of Greenland was a national security issue, given the paths charted by Russian and Chinese ships." Answer: Donald Trump.
