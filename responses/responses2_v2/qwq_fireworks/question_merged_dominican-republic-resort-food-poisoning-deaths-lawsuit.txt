Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. 

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks for the specific pathogen identified in the autopsies. The article says the autopsies didn't identify the pathogen. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The lawsuit names the resort, Transat Tours Canada, and "other companies". The article mentions Wyndham as the owner of the brand, but it doesn't specify other suppliers like a seafood company. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The article mentions 10 American tourists died in 2019, not 2023. Since it's asking for 2023, the answer is N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The family called again "later that afternoon" after waking up vomiting. The timeline isn't exact hours. So N/A.
