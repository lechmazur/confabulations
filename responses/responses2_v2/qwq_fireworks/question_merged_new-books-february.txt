Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not assume anything else.

1. **Question 1:** The question is about a Bay Area professional dominatrix who wrote a memoir involving a strip club and searching for a missing ex. Looking through the article, Newell's second novel "Ruth" is described as about a stripper in SF, written by someone who is a dominatrix. The missing ex is part of the mystery. So the answer is Newell.

2. **Question 2:** Tony Horwitz's widow, Brooks, took four years after his death to complete the manuscript. The text says "Four years later, she journeyed..." so the answer is 4.

3. **Question 3:** Bill Gates' mother's role is mentioned as teaching him probabilities via card games. The article states his grandmother taught him, not his mother. Wait, noâ€”the text says "under the tutelage of a grandmother who'd intuitively mastered probabilities..." So the answer would be N/A because it's the grandmother, not the mother.

4. **Question 4:** The French noblewoman was orphaned at 3 and heir to a fortune. The article doesn't specify the year she inherited, just that she was 3 when orphaned. Since the inheritance would happen upon her parents' death (orphaned), but the exact year isn't given. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** In Ali Smith's novel, the siblings Briar and Rose are labeled Unverifiables. The question asks which character discovers this. The text says "the siblings must navigate... discovering... small means of resistance." So the answer is Briar and Rose, but the question might expect one name. Wait, the novel's title isn't given, but the siblings are the main characters. The answer is the siblings, but the question says "character", so maybe just the name given: Briar and Rose. But the question might expect one, but the article says "the siblings" so perhaps "Briar and Rose".

6. **Question 6:** The Brooklyn writer and professor exchange emails about Nietzsche. The article says "prolonged emails about unconsummated love and Nietzsche." It doesn't specify the number of exchanges. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Kureishi's memoir is about paralysis after a fall in Rome. The injury was from a fall leading to paralysis. So the medical condition is paralysis from a fall.

8. **Question 8:** The siblings in Ali's novel are in a surveillance state. The article says "discovering small means of resistance and hope" but doesn't specify the season. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Anne Tyler's novel has a homeless cat during the wedding spa day. The text mentions "Throw in a homeless cat..." so the answer is a cat.

10. **Question 10:** Rivera Garza's novel has men castrated and murdered. The article says "a series of men are castrated and murdered." It doesn't specify the number, so N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The question links two books: one with convent mice and surveillance, another with feminist poetry. The convent story is Wood's (Booker nominee), and feminist poetry is in Rivera Garza's. But the question asks which author's work combines both? Wait, the question says "despite these elements appearing in separate books?" So maybe it's asking which author has both? But they are separate authors. Wait, the question is phrased as "which author's work combines..." but the elements are in different books. So perhaps N/A? Or maybe it's a trick, but the answer might be N/A because they are in different books.

12. **Question 12:** The memoir about Tasmanian isolation is Brooks'. The other book with government conspiracies is TJ Klune's novel (alien encounters). So the answer is TJ Klune's novel.

13. **Question 13:** The dominatrix's novel (Newell) has a stripper and a subplot with aliens and car chases? Wait, the alien part is from Klune's book. The question asks which author's novel has both. But Newell's is about the stripper, Klune's has aliens. So no author combines both. So N/A?

14. **Question 14:** The novel set in 1990s D.C. with apartheid parallels is Francis-Sharma's, which has 1996 Johannesburg and 2018 D.C. So the D.C. part is the 2018 setting, so the answer is Francis-Sharma's novel.

15. **Question 15:** The February 25 release connecting aerobiology and castration murders. Aerobiology is Zimmer's book, and castration murders are Rivera Garza's. They are separate books. The question says "which author's work" but they are different authors. So N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Kureishi's memoir about paralysis is linked to measles analysis by Ratner. The question says which author's memoir is erroneously linked to measles (which is Ratner's topic). So the answer is Kureishi.
