Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer strictly based on that. Let me start with the first question.

1. **What percentage of Paradise residents who lost their homes in the 2018 Camp fire eventually returned to rebuild in the same location?**  
The article mentions Eric Reinbold, the police chief of Paradise, who rebuilt after the Camp Fire. But it doesn't give a percentage of residents who returned. So the answer is N/A.

2. **How many emergency room visits for anxiety disorders were recorded in California specifically attributed to the Palisades and Eaton fires?**  
The text says studies found increased ER visits after wildfires in California, but it doesn't specify numbers for these specific fires. So N/A.

3. **Which Hindu deity statue did Dr. Eisenman place outside his home before evacuating during the Palisades fire?**  
The article mentions Shabnam Melwani placed a statue of Lord Ganesh. Dr. Eisenman isn't associated with this action. So N/A.

4. **What was the average property value of homes destroyed in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood during this fire event?**  
No property values are mentioned. N/A.

5. **How many therapy sessions did Jane Brown attend to cope with the trauma of watching her mother's condominium burn down?**  
The article doesn't mention Jane attending therapy. N/A.

6. **What time did firefighters first notify Shabnam Melwani to evacuate her Pacific Palisades residence?**  
The text says firefighters told her to evacuate, but no specific time. N/A.

7. **How many pieces of artwork from Mrs. Kameny's 1959 wedding collection were destroyed in the fire?**  
The article mentions artwork was lost but doesn't specify the number. N/A.

8. **Which psychological disorder showed the highest prevalence rate among Fort McMurray residents in the follow-up study?**  
The study mentions about a third had depression, anxiety, substance-use disorder, or PTSD. It doesn't specify which was highest. N/A.

9. **What was the average response time for emergency services to reach affected areas in the Pacific Palisades during the first 24 hours of the fire?**  
No response time data provided. N/A.

10. **How many residents from Chino provided temporary housing for evacuees from the Pacific Palisades area?**  
The article says Mrs. Kameny evacuated to Chino, but no number of residents helping. N/A.

11. **What percentage of residents in Paradise, California, were still experiencing psychological distress a decade after the Camp Fire, mirroring the long-term impact seen in the Australian bush fire study?**  
The Australian study had 4% after a decade. The article doesn't say Paradise's rate, but the question asks for mirroring that percentage. Since the Camp Fire was in 2018 and the article is current, it's too recent for a decade study. So N/A.

12. **How many years did Eric Reinbold and his family live in Chico before moving back to Paradise, mirroring the percentage of Fort McMurray residents dealing with mental health issues a year after their wildfire?**  
Eric lived in Chico for five years. The Fort McMurray study had a third with issues. The question asks for years mirroring the percentage. Since the percentage is a third (approx 33%), but the answer is 5 years. The question might be a trick, but the article states 5 years. So the answer is 5. Wait, but the question says "mirroring the percentage of Fort McMurray residents...", which is 33.3%, so maybe 5 years isn't a percentage. The question might be confusing. But the article says "five years before deciding to rebuild", so the answer is 5. So answer is 5.

13. **What Hindu deity, known as the remover of obstacles, did Shabnam Melwani fear she would lose, similar to the family photos and artwork lost by Iris Kameny?**  
The article says she took a statue of Lord Ganesh. So answer is Lord Ganesh.

14. **In what city did Iris Kameny seek refuge, reflecting the location where Eric Reinbold's family initially evacuated after the Camp Fire?**  
Iris evacuated to Chino. Eric's family went to Chico. So answer is Chino.

15. **What specific item, purchased around the time of Iris Kameny's marriage in 1959, did Kamala Harris examine during her tour of the fire damage in Pacific Palisades?**  
The article doesn't mention Kamala Harris examining any specific item. N/A.

16. **What was the name of the fire that destroyed Eric Reinbold's home, mirroring the fire that threatened Shabnam Melwani's residence?**  
Eric's home was destroyed by the Camp Fire. The fire threatening Shabnam was the Palisades fire. So the answer is Camp fire.

17. **Besides anxiety and depression, what other mental health condition did Jonathan Sury's research on Hurricane Sandy find was prevalent among residents whose homes sustained only minor damage, similar to the issues faced by a third of Fort McMurray residents?**  
The article mentions PTSD along with anxiety/depression in both cases. So PTSD.

18. **What role did Eric Reinbold hold in Paradise, mirroring the profession of Dr. David P. Eisenman, who commented on the lasting psychological harm of wildfires?**  
Eric is the police chief. Dr. Eisenman is a physician. So the role is Police Chief.

19. **What specific type of building, similar to the one lost by Iris Kameny, did California's top insurance regulator suggest should receive full policy payouts without itemization after the wildfires?**  
Iris lost a condominium. The article says "homes" in general. The regulator mentions "destroyed homes" so answer is homes.

20. **What was the primary focus of Emily Schmall's reporting, mirroring the research area of Jonathan Sury at the Columbia Climate School?**  
Emily focuses on climate and health. Jonathan is at the National Center for Disaster Preparedness related to climate. So answer is climate and health.
