Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the given article and strictly follow the instructions. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks which venture capital firm led by Trump supporters completed mineral surveys of Disko Island in 2021. The article mentions KoBold Metals, a company where Marc Andreessen, Sam Altman, and Jeff Bezos (all Trump supporters) are investors through their VC firms. The text says KoBold Metals surveyed Disko Island in 2022. Wait, the question says 2021, but the article says 2022. Since the article states 2022, the answer would be N/A because the year doesn't match. Wait, but maybe I misread. Let me check again. The article says KoBold Metals surveyed Disko Island in 2022. So the answer for 2021 is N/A. But the question specifies 2021. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: How many millions did Critical Metals secure after discussions with Howard Lutnick's team? The article says Critical Metals was told to shelve their request until the new administration. So they didn't secure any yet. The answer is N/A because there's no mention of an amount secured.

3. **Question 3**: What rare earth mineral deposit prompted Peter Leidel's contributions? The article mentions Leidel's company has a mining project but doesn't specify the mineral. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: When did Trump Jr. first propose the Puerto Rico trade? The article says in 2019, Trump floated the idea in his first term, as per the book "The Divider." The question is about Trump Jr.'s proposal. The article says Trump himself mentioned it, not Trump Jr. So the answer is N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Which Danish company partnered with KoBold? The article doesn't mention a Danish company partnering with KoBold. It just says KoBold is based in the U.S. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Total value of Biden's State Department contracts? The article mentions interest in a graphite project but no specific amount. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Miles of roads Critical Metals committed to build? The article doesn't mention road construction plans. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Percentage stake Cantor had in Critical Metals via Series B? The article doesn't specify the percentage. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Chinese company prompting Trump's necessity declaration? The article mentions concern over China's dominance but doesn't name a specific company. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Export-Import Bank's financing amount? The article says they expressed interest but no figure. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Role of Export-Import Bank for Greg Barnes's involvement? The article says U.S. officials wanted the material to go to the U.S., so maybe the Bank's role is financing. But the exact answer? The question is about securing Greg's continued involvement. The answer might be "financing" but the article says "expressed interest in financing a graphite project." Since Greg sold his stake to Critical Metals, maybe the Bank's role is to fund the project, thus keeping Greg involved indirectly. The answer could be "financing" but the exact phrasing in the article says "expressed interest in financing a graphite mining project operated by a British company." The Tanbreez mine is part of Critical Metals, so maybe the answer is "financing." But the question is phrased as what role did they play in securing Greg's involvement. The article says Greg sold his stake, so maybe the Bank's role is to fund the project, which would keep it viable. The answer might be "financing the project" but the exact words in the article: "U.S. Export-Import Bank expressed interest in financing a graphite mining project..." So the answer is "financing" but need to check. The question asks what role the Bank would play in securing Greg's continued involvement. Since Greg sold his stake, maybe his continued involvement isn't there, so N/A? Hmm. Alternatively, the answer is "financing" as per the Bank's role. The article says "Greg Barnes... sold his stake in the Tanbreez mine... to Critical Metals... U.S. officials made clear they wanted the material to go to the U.S." So the Bank's role might be to provide financing, so the answer is "financing." But the question is about securing Greg's continued involvement. Since he sold his stake, maybe the answer is N/A. The question is tricky. The article doesn't explicitly state the role in securing his continued involvement. So N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Percentage of Yorktown's project held by KoBold investors? The article doesn't mention the percentage. N/A.

13. **Question 13**: What action Denmark might take similar to West Point's move? The article says West Point ended clubs due to Trump's D.E.I. ban. If the U.S. provides defense, Denmark might do something similar, but the article doesn't connect. N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Number of individuals besides Lutnick who contributed and mine in Greenland. The article mentions Marc Andreessen, Sam Altman, Jeff Bezos (via their companies in KoBold). They donated to Trump's re-election or inaugural. The mining companies are KoBold and Critical Metals. So these three individuals (Andreessen, Altman, Bezos) are mentioned as investors in KoBold, which is active in Greenland. So three people. The question says "hold leadership positions in companies actively mining." The article says KoBold explored minerals in Greenland. Are they actively mining? The article says "explored for minerals and metals in Greenland." So maybe not actively mining yet. The article mentions Critical Metals plans to start in 2026. So KoBold's status is unclear. If "actively mining" requires current operations, then maybe not. But the question says "mining in Greenland" which includes exploration. The answer would be three. But need to check: the article says "either as individuals or through their companies, all three have donated... and are investors in KoBold Metals, a privately held company based in Berkeley, Calif., that has explored for minerals and metals in Greenland." So they are investors in a company that explored. So they qualify. So the answer is 3. But the question says "hold leadership positions in companies actively mining." The article doesn't say they hold leadership positions in those companies. They are investors via their VC firms. So maybe they aren't in leadership roles. The question is tricky. The article says "all three are investors in KoBold Metals," but leadership positions? Not specified. So maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "hold leadership positions in companies actively mining." The article doesn't mention their leadership roles in those companies, just that they are investors. So the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the companies are actively mining? The article says KoBold "has explored" so not active mining. So the answer is N/A.

15. **Question 15**: What U.S. territory did Trump propose offering Denmark for Greenland's graphite rights? The article mentions Trump floated trading Puerto Rico for Greenland in 2019. The question asks about a similar exchange for graphite rights. The article says the same deal was mentioned, so the answer is Puerto Rico.

16. **Question 16**: What clean energy tech was the focus? The article says rare earths are essential for electric vehicles, wind turbines, solar panels. The question is about Greg Barnes's discussions. The article states officials wanted the material for the U.S. to undercut China. The specific tech mentioned in the context is rare earths for clean energy. The answer could be "electric vehicles" or "wind turbines" or "solar panels." The question asks for the primary focus. The article says "the Biden administration's push for clean energy might benefit their rare-earth mining efforts, given that rare earths are essential components in electric vehicles, wind turbines and solar panels." So the primary focus might be all three, but the question asks for the specific type. Since the question says "primary focus," but the article lists them together, maybe it's N/A. Alternatively, the answer is "electric vehicles" as the first mentioned. But the article doesn't specify which was the focus. So N/A.

17. **Question 17**: What was the stated value of the CEO's contribution to Trump? Peter Leidel donated $315,000 according to federal records. The CEO of the company that acquired Tanbreez is Tony Sage (Critical Metals' CEO). Wait, Greg Barnes sold his stake to Critical Metals. The CEO of Critical Metals is Tony Sage. The question is about the CEO of the company that acquired Tanbreez, which is Critical Metals. The article says Leidel donated $315k. The question is about the CEO's contribution. The CEO is Sage, but the article doesn't mention his contributions. Leidel is the investor in Yorktown, not the CEO of Critical Metals. So the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "the CEO of the company that acquired the Tanbreez mine" which is Critical Metals' CEO Tony Sage. The article doesn't mention Sage's contributions, only Leidel's. So answer is N/A.

18. **Question 18**: What body did State Department consult besides the Export-Import Bank? The article says the Export-Import Bank expressed interest, but State Department officials discussed with Greenland's natural resources. The question asks what body they consulted. The article doesn't mention another body. Maybe the article says "State Department officials traveled to the island to discuss its natural resources," so they might have consulted with local Greenlandic bodies, but the question asks for a U.S. governmental body. The article doesn't specify another one. N/A.

19. **Question 19**: What infrastructure deficiency did KoBold address in 2022? The article says Greenland has "paucity of roads and other infrastructure." KoBold's 2022 survey: the article doesn't mention them addressing roads. So N/A.

20. **Question 20**: What action did Commerce Department take regarding tariffs for the tent city? The article mentions Lutnick would oversee tariffs and trade policy, but there's no mention of specific actions taken regarding the tent city. N/A.
