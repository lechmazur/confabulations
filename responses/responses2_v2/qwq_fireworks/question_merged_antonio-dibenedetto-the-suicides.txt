Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks about the title of the newspaper where the protagonist of "The Suicides" worked alongside Di Benedetto. The article mentions that Di Benedetto was a reporter at the provincial newspaper Los Andes in Mendoza. The protagonist of "The Suicides" is a reporter, but does it say he worked at the same newspaper? The article says Di Benedetto worked at Los Andes, but there's no mention of the protagonist's workplace. So the answer might be N/A. Wait, the question says "who worked alongside Di Benedetto". Since Di Benedetto worked at Los Andes, maybe the protagonist also worked there? But the article doesn't explicitly state that. Hmm, tricky. Let me check again. The article says: "Di Benedetto was a reporter at the provincial newspaper, Los Andes." The protagonist of "The Suicides" is a reporter, but there's no direct link to Los Andes. So probably N/A.

2. "Zama" was published eight years before "The Silentiary" (since "The Silentiary" was published in 1964, "Zama" would be 1956). The question asks the decade Di Benedetto wrote "Zama". 1950s. The article says "Zama" was published in 1956, so the decade is the 1950s. Answer is 1950s.

3. The question refers to a notorious outlaw that Zama pursued, similar to one described by Bolaño in "2666". The article mentions "2666" has factual accounts of brutality. But which outlaw? The article doesn't name the outlaw Zama pursued, so N/A.

4. The friend of the "Silentiary" protagonist is described as a half-mad visionary who charges into any fray. The question asks his profession. The article says he's a friend but doesn't mention his job. N/A.

5. Di Benedetto was put in front of a firing squad four times. The reporter in "The Suicides" was assigned three articles (three suicides). The question asks how many times Di Benedetto was put before a firing squad. The article says four. So answer is 4.

6. The protagonist of "The Suicides" frequents boxing matches. The article says Di Benedetto also visited these. So answer is boxing matches or boxing arenas? The question asks the type of establishment. The article states: "attending boxing matches where he can 'clamor for violence and destruction.'" So the establishment is boxing matches/venues. The answer is boxing matches or boxing arenas? Maybe "boxing matches" is the event, but the establishment would be a boxing venue. But the exact term used is "boxing matches". The question says "type of establishment", so perhaps boxing arenas. But the article says "attending boxing matches", so the establishment is where they are held. Maybe the answer is boxing arenas. Wait, the article says "attending boxing matches" so the establishment is a boxing arena. But maybe the question is looking for "boxing matches" as the answer. Hmm. The article says "attends boxing matches", so the establishment is where the matches take place, like a boxing ring or arena. But the exact term isn't given. The answer might be "boxing matches" but the question asks for the establishment. Maybe "boxing matches" is acceptable. Alternatively, "venues" but the text says "attending boxing matches", so the establishment would be a place where boxing happens. Since the article doesn't name it, maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "establishment", so perhaps the answer is "boxing arenas" but the article doesn't specify. Alternatively, the article says "attending boxing matches", so the establishment is where the matches are held. Since the exact term isn't given, maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "establishment, frequented by the belligerent protagonist of 'The Suicides', did Di Benedetto also visit in Mendoza?" The article says Di Benedetto was in Mendoza and that the reporter (protagonist) attends boxing matches. So the establishment is boxing matches/venues. Since the article doesn't name it beyond "boxing matches", the answer is "boxing matches".

7. The question asks what literary prize Di Benedetto won similar to Han Kang's. The article says Han Kang is a Nobel laureate, but Di Benedetto isn't mentioned as winning any prize. So N/A.

8. The protagonist of "The Suicides" is 33 when assigned the task. The article says Rusty Sabich is 77 in "Presumed Guilty" and the protagonist is 33, which is the same age as his father when he died. The question asks the age when assigned the task, which is 33. The second part says "an age that also marked a significant turning point for Rusty Sabich in 'Presumed Guilty'". The article states Rusty Sabich is 77 now, but his turning point age is not given. The question is asking the age of the protagonist, which is 33. So answer is 33.

9. The city in "The Silentiary" is unnamed. Di Benedetto lived in Mendoza. The question asks the name of the city in "The Silentiary". The article says "a city in Latin America" that's unnamed. So the answer is N/A. But the question says "plagued by noise" where Di Benedetto spent his life (Mendoza). But the city in the story is unnamed. So N/A.

10. The first book of the trilogy is "Zama", as stated in the article. The question asks the name of the first book translated by Esther Allen. Yes, so answer is Zama.

11. The dedication "to the victims of expectation" is on "Zama", as per the article. So the answer is Zama.

12. The description of a colonial bureaucrat whose wages aren't paid and inner barbarism is Zama. The question asks which narrative figure, so Zama.

13. The article says "Zama" is the one with the midlevel functionary in the 1790s, so that's the work with bureaucratic despair. Answer: Zama.

14. The statistical studies about suicide and contradictory expressions are in "The Suicides". The question asks which narrative is examined, so The Suicides.

15. The life event influencing his work was being arrested, tortured, and put before firing squads during the military government. The article says his experience under state terror influenced his writing. So answer: being arrested/tortured by the military or specifically "arrested by the military government, tortured, and put in front of a firing squad four times".

16. The translator is Esther Allen, as stated.

17. The environment with noise is "The Silentiary", where the narrator is tormented by noise. The question asks which narrative environment, so The Silentiary.

18. The core emotional condition is "the psychological danger of harboring hope where there is none", or "furious nihilism". The article says "the psychological danger of harboring hope where there is none is Di Benedetto's binding subject". So the core is "harboring hope where there is none" or "furious nihilism". The question says "core of Di Benedetto’s characters" is their "furious nihilism" or "charisma and repulsion". Wait, the article says "characters' furious nihilism" and "the psychological danger... hope where there is none". The question asks which emotional condition is core. The binding subject is hope's futility, so maybe "furious nihilism" is the answer. The question says "core emotional condition", so the answer is "furious nihilism".

19. The method of weaving philosophical riffs to shield from futility. The article says "ingenious weavers of philosophical riffs designed to shield themselves from the curse of futility". So the device is "philosophical riffs".

20. The element triggering the narrator's unraveling is the noise (chattering radios, etc.). The question asks which element is implicated as the initial trigger. The first paragraph mentions "noise" as the trigger. Answer: noise.
