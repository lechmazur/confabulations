Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. The first question asks which Republican president first suggested putting Perle Mesta on a postage stamp. The article mentions Nixon, Ford, and Carter all argued to get her on a stamp. Since Nixon is a Republican, and the question specifies a Republican president, Nixon would be the answer. But wait, Carter is a Democrat. So the first of the Republican ones listed is Nixon. So answer: Nixon.

2. The second question is about how many Russian leaders' names Mesta mispronounced during her diplomatic mission. The text says she was "mangling the names of Russian leaders" when she went behind the Iron Curtain. But it doesn't specify the number. Since the count isn't given, answer N/A.

3. The third question asks the final box office revenue of "Call Me Madam" after its $1 million advance. The article mentions the advance was a record $1 million but doesn't state the final revenue. So N/A.

4. The fourth question is about a menu item from Mesta's parties served at Kennedy's White House. The article says Gordon dug through menus but doesn't mention a specific item used later. So N/A.

5. The fifth question asks the name of the female friend who influenced Mesta's ERA advocacy. The text says "thanks to a female friend, she became an early advocate..." but doesn't name her. So N/A.

6. The sixth question is the number of guests at her largest "Mesta Fiesta". The article mentions gatherings "could stretch to the thousands" but doesn't give an exact number. So N/A.

7. The seventh question is about a diplomatic crisis she resolved in Luxembourg. The article states she was dispatched there by Truman, but critics called her an ignoramus. No specific crisis mentioned. Answer N/A.

8. The eighth question: original actress in "Call Me Madam" before Ethel Merman. The article only mentions Ethel Merman starred, no other name. So N/A.

9. The ninth question: circulation number of McCall's when her article was published. The article mentions she wrote for McCall's but no circulation number. N/A.

10. The tenth question: years she served as chairwoman of a bipartisan committee. The text doesn't mention her tenure length here. N/A.

11. Eleventh question: political figure she declined to support in 1960, leading to a rift with Jackie. The article says she refused to support JFK in 1960, leading to a rift with Jackie (then Kennedy). So answer: John F. Kennedy.

12. Twelfth question: dismissive moniker for Mesta. The nicknames given include "the old bag of wind". That's the derisive one. So answer: "the old bag of wind".

13. Thirteenth: age at death correcting earlier reports. The article states she died at 92, nine years older than reported. So correct age is 92.

14. Fourteenth: government agency targeted for closure by a political figure. The article mentions Trump called for closing USAID. So USAID.

15. Fifteenth: term for her shifting political endorsements. The text says "two-party Perle" (later "no-party Perle"). So answer: "two-party Perle".

16. Sixteenth: who remarked on her not knowing intellectual integrity. The article says "Cafritz sniffed" about that. So Gwen Cafritz.

17. Seventeenth: musical production about her. "Call Me Madam" is mentioned as the musical based on her, with Ethel Merman. So answer: "Call Me Madam".

18. Eighteenth: foreign city where she was tear-gassed. The article mentions Saigon during protests. So Saigon.

19. Nineteenth: her brief artistic ambition. She aspired to be an opera singer. So opera singer.

20. Twentieth: state she aligned with later, not her original upbringing. Born in Michigan, then moved to Oklahoma. She preferred Oklahoma. So Oklahoma.
