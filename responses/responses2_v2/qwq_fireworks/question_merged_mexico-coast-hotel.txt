Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I don't look anywhere else except the text given. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question is about a rug design by a fashion designer inspired by hand-painted bowls from Abidjan's market and later influenced by Dakar and Copenhagen. The article mentions Victor Glemaud's rug collection. The specific design mentioned is Bietry, which has a geometric pattern and floral border. So the answer should be Bietry.

2. The T List newsletter is mentioned to be sent every Wednesday. The first paragraph says "Sign up here to find us in your inbox every Wednesday." So the day is Wednesday.

3. The hotel near Puerto Escondido is Hotel Humano in Brisas de Zicatela. The article describes it as a three-level property with concrete and earthy textures, and the town is south of Puerto Escondido. The answer is Hotel Humano.

4. The stand-collar chore coat named after the founder is Il Conte. The article states "Il Conte (the Count), a stand-collar chore coat named in honor of the house's founder..." So the coat's name is Il Conte.

5. The fabric collection inspired by Edo period aesthetics is Between Heaven and Earth. The designer Sean Leffers's collection includes katazome florals and traditional patterns like peonies. The answer is Between Heaven and Earth.

6. The Jaipur restaurant in the palace is Sarvato. The article mentions Sarvato Bhadra becoming a restaurant under Sawai Padmanabh Singh, with a tasting menu served in brass tiffin boxes. So the name is Sarvato.

7. The banana tree fiber used in the rugs is abaca. The article says the rug's materials include flatweave wool or abaca from banana tree bark. The answer is abaca.

8. The signature cocktail at Sarvato is the Maharaja Martini. The article states the cocktail uses Ciroc, dry vermouth, and pickled mango brine. So the answer is Maharaja Martini.

9. The number of rooms in Hotel Humano is 39. The article says "39-room, three-level property." The answer is 39.

10. The artist featured in the Superhouse exhibition is Dan Friedman. The article discusses his exhibition "Why Shouldn't I Have Fun All Day?" and his connection to Keith Haring. The answer is Dan Friedman.

Now I need to check each answer again to ensure they are all directly from the text and nothing inferred beyond that. Let me verify each point quickly.

1. Bietry is correct as per the rug section. Yes.
2. Wednesday is stated. Correct.
3. Hotel Humano in Brisas de Zicatela. Correct.
4. Il Conte is mentioned as the coat's name. Right.
5. Between Heaven and Earth matches the Edo period inspiration. Yes.
6. Sarvato is the restaurant in Jaipur. Correct.
7. Abaca from banana bark. Yes.
8. Maharaja Martini with the listed ingredients. Correct.
9. 39 rooms explicitly stated. Yes.
10. Dan Friedman's exhibition. Correct.

All answers are directly from the article. None require inference beyond the text. I think that's all.
