Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful and only use the information given. Let's start with question 1.

1. The first question asks about venture capital funding DeepSeek secured before Liang's pivot. The article mentions that the hedge fund made strong returns and attracted billions, but after pivoting, DeepSeek's funding isn't specified. The SoftBank example is about OpenAI, so the answer is N/A since the article doesn't state DeepSeek's specific funding before pivoting.

2. Question 2 is about market share captured by DeepSeek's pricing. The article says they undercut competitors and forced price cuts, but there's no percentage given. So N/A here.

3. For question 3, the literary genre of the literature buffs. The article mentions literature buffs were hired but doesn't specify the genre. So N/A again.

4. Question 4 asks the alternative strategy after closing the main product. The article states DeepSeek originated as a side project. So the answer is the side project, which Peter Alexander called their "side project."

5. Question 5 wants another Chinese tech co-founder like Pony Ma. The article compares Liang to Pony Ma of Tencent, so no others mentioned. So N/A, since the question asks besides Pony Ma and there's no one else listed.

6. The side project's name isn't given, just that it was a side project. The name isn't mentioned, so N/A.

7. The year Liang predicted superhuman AI isn't stated. The article says he believes it's around the corner but no specific year. N/A.

8. Regulatory pressure beyond the crackdown isn't detailed. The article mentions regulatory pressures leading to closure but doesn't specify the type. N/A.

9. Liang's thesis was at Zhejiang University, so that's the answer.

10. Peter Alexander's reason for closure in 2024 is that the main product had to shut down, but the reason isn't specified beyond regulatory pressures. The article doesn't give a specific reason like a ban or rule, so N/A.

11. The non-traditional roles hired are literature buffs, as stated.

12. The hedge fund was co-founded in the late 2010s. The exact year isn't given, so N/A.

13. The article compares DeepSeek's approach to OpenAI, so that's the answer.

14. The management style is like Pony Ma of Tencent.

15. The lesson was moving away from quick returns to long-term goals, as stated in the article.

16. The industry outside tech/finance isn't mentioned. The thesis was on surveillance, which is tech. So N/A.

17. The market shift was competitors lowering prices due to DeepSeek's pricing. The question asks for the shift, which is price cuts by rivals. But the answer should be the effect, like price wars or forced cuts. The article says "forcing larger rivals into their own price cuts" so the market shift is price competition. But the exact term used is "price cuts forced", so the answer is that rivals had to cut prices. However the question asks what occurred, which is the price competition. The article says "DeepSeek undercut its Chinese competition... forcing larger rivals into their own price cuts". So the shift is that rivals had to lower prices. But the question asks for the market shift, so the answer would be "price cuts by competitors" but the exact phrasing in the article is "forcing larger rivals into their own price cuts". The question asks "what significant market shift occurred", so the answer is that competitors were forced to cut prices. But the article doesn't use a specific term like "price war", so maybe the answer is "competitors were forced into price cuts". But the question requires a direct answer. The article says "DeepSeek undercut its Chinese competition last year by offering its model at bargain prices, forcing larger rivals into their own price cuts". So the shift is the competitors' price cuts. The answer is "rivals lowered prices" or similar. But the exact answer needs to be from the article's wording. The question is "what significant market shift occurred in China's A.I. sector...", so the answer is "larger rivals had to cut prices". The article's exact phrase is "forcing larger rivals into their own price cuts". So the shift is that competitors were forced into price cuts. The answer is "larger rivals made price cuts" but need to use the exact words? The article says "forcing larger rivals into their own price cuts". The market shift is that the rivals had to cut prices. So the answer would be "competitors lowered their prices" but the article says "forcing larger rivals into their own price cuts". The answer should be "larger rivals made price cuts" but the exact wording isn't given. Wait, the question asks "what significant market shift occurred...", so the answer is "price competition" or "price cuts by competitors". Since the article says that DeepSeek's pricing caused rivals to cut prices, the market shift was that competitors had to lower their prices. The article doesn't use a specific term, so the answer is "competitors were forced into price cuts" but the question might want "price cuts by rivals". However, the exact answer must be from the text. The article says "forcing larger rivals into their own price cuts". So the shift is that the rivals cut prices. The answer is "rivals cut prices" but the question wants the market shift's name. Since the article doesn't name it, maybe N/A? Wait, no, the question is asking for the event that occurred, which is the price cuts. The answer is "competitors were forced to cut prices". But the question might want the answer as "price competition" but that's inferred. Alternatively, the article states that the shift is the price cuts. The answer is "rivals lowered prices" but the exact phrase from the text is "forcing larger rivals into their own price cuts". So the answer is "larger rivals made price cuts".

Wait, but the question is phrased as "what significant market shift occurred...", so the answer is "competitors reduced their prices" but the exact wording from the article is "forcing larger rivals into their own price cuts". So the market shift is that rivals had to lower their prices. The answer is "larger rivals made price cuts".

18. The regulatory change on speculative trading in 2023. The article says "Beijing's tightening grip on speculative trading" motivated the pivot. The exact regulatory change isn't named, so N/A.
