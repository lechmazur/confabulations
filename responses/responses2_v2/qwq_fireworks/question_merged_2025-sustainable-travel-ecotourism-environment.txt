Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. I need to be careful and make sure I don't assume anything beyond what's written.

1. The first question asks which local charity in Quebec City is funded by the Kind Traveler's program. The article mentions the Kind Traveler platform funds local charities with guest stays, but it doesn't specify which one in Quebec City. Since Quebec City is listed as a travel destination but not linked to the charity's name, the answer is N/A.

2. The second question is about how many travelers in the Booking.com survey participated in home-swapping through Kindred. The survey data talks about percentages wanting to leave places better or valuing sustainability, but there's no data on actual participation numbers for Kindred. So N/A here too.

3. The third question asks for the percentage of StayAltered's hosts in Northern Ireland and South Africa. The article says StayAltered operates in 30+ countries across six continents, but no specific numbers for those regions. Without exact figures, answer N/A.

4. The fourth question is about when Abara's expanded program launches in Canada. The text mentions Abara's trips near the US-Mexico border and other regions, but there's no mention of Canada or a 2025 month. So N/A.

5. The fifth question asks who founded Tourism Cares' map initiative that Vincie Ho collaborated on. The article says Tourism Cares created the map, but doesn't mention the founder or if Vincie Ho was involved in its creation. She's from RISE, so unless stated, it's N/A.

6. The sixth question is the duration of RISE's first course in Yogyakarta. The article mentions RISE offers online classes and an e-book, but not the duration of any specific course in Yogyakarta. So N/A.

7. Seventh question: How many Invisible Cities guides were in Telos Group's programs. The tours are listed separately, but no overlap is mentioned. N/A.

8. Eighth question: Minimum travelers for Migrant Tour in Venice. The article doesn't specify numbers for group sizes. N/A.

9. Ninth: Which Barbadian rum distillery partnered with Unseen Tours. The text mentions Barbados' rum but no specific distillery linked to Unseen Tours. N/A.

10. Tenth: Percentage of sustainable travelers who took RISE classes. The survey says 83% care about sustainable travel, but there's no data linking them to RISE's classes. N/A.

11. Eleventh question asks for the number of unique platforms aiming to reduce short-term rental issues. The platforms mentioned are Kind Traveler (donation model), StayAltered (community booking), and Kindred (home-swapping). All three are distinct, so the count is 3.

12. Twelfth question combines StayAltered and Kindred's focus on reducing rental issues. Since both are explicitly mentioned as addressing short-term rental impacts, together they make 2 platforms.
