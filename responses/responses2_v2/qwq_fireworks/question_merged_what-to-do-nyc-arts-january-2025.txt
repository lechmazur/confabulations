Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer strictly based on that. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The show mentioned in the article that features a character exploring cultural identity with hip-hop and traditional Chinese dance. The article talks about the Nai-Ni Chen Dance Company's performance, specifically "Lion in the City," which combines hip-hop with the traditional Lion Dance. So the answer should be that show's name. Wait, the question is about a Broadway show. Wait, looking back, the Broadway shows listed later include "Hell's Kitchen," which is based on Alicia Keys' life. The Nai-Ni Chen Dance Company's performance is in Queens, not Broadway. Wait, maybe I missed a Broadway show? Let me check again. The Broadway shows listed are "Gypsy," "Oh, Mary!," "Gypsy," "Hell's Kitchen." The Nai-Ni Chen is in Queens. Hmm, maybe the question is a trick. The article says the dance company's performance includes "Lion in the City," which is part of their Lunar New Year show. The question specifies a Broadway show, but the article doesn't mention any Broadway show with that. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. The Broadway shows mentioned are under the "Critic's Pick" sections. The Nai-Ni Chen isn't there. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says "the Nai-Ni Chen Dance Company will celebrate with a series of family-friendly performances comprising works that exemplify its acclaimed blend of cultural traditions and modern dance." The specific piece is "Lion in the City," inspired by the traditional Lion Dance, here flavored with hip-hop. Since that's a dance performance, not a Broadway show, the answer would be N/A for Broadway shows. So question 1 is N/A?

Wait the user's first question says "Broadway show mentioned in the article features a character who performs both hip-hop and traditional Chinese dance..." But the Nai-Ni Chen isn't a Broadway show. The Broadway shows listed don't mention that. So answer is N/A.

Wait, maybe I missed another part. Let me check again. The article's last part under "Critic's Picks" includes shows like "Gypsy," "Oh, Mary!," etc. The only one related to cultural identity might be "Hell's Kitchen" which is about Alicia Keys' life, but the article mentions her coming-of-age story. The dance piece in Queens is the only one with the blend. So question 1's answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Number of dog breeds specifically named as performing in agility demos. The article says the Javits event has over 150 breeds, but does it name any? It mentions examples like Chihuahuas and Leonbergers, but in the context of breeds present, not specifically in agility. The question is about those in the agility demonstrations. The text says "demonstrations -- dogs running agility courses..." but doesn't name specific breeds there. So the answer is N/A because they aren't named.

3. **Question 3**: Admission price for children under 12 at the Lunar New Year event. The article says "Tickets start at $10" for the Javits event? Wait, no, the Lunar New Year event is the Nai-Ni Chen one. The Nai-Ni Chen event's tickets are $20. The article says "Tickets for this weekend are $20 through kupferbergcenter.org." It doesn't mention a different price for children. So the answer is $20 unless there's a child discount. Since it's not specified, maybe the price is same for all. So answer is $20.

Wait the Javits event (dog breeds) mentions "Tickets start at $10. Children can also catch..." but the Lunar New Year is the Nai-Ni Chen one in Queens. So the answer is $20.

4. **Question 4**: Comedian from Bell House improv who performed at the old UCB Theater. The Bell House show includes comedians like Neil Casey, Jon Gabrus, etc., but the article mentions that the original UCB was in a Gristedes in Manhattan (razed). The article says "you can still see those comics in Dan Black's 'The Ultimate Improv Show'..." implying that the comics from the old UCB are now in this show. The names listed in the Bell House show include Nicole Byer, D'Arcy Carden, etc. The UCB's current home is on 14th Street. The question is which of the Bell House performers was at the original UCB. The article says "many of today's top sitcom stars and character actors honing their skills at cheap (or free) improvisational shows in the basement of a Gristedes in Manhattan that the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater was calling home at the time. The building... was razed... but you can still see those comics in Dan Black's... which is coming to New York this weekend." So the comedians in the Bell House show were part of that old UCB. The names listed in the Bell House performers include Neil Casey, Jon Gabrus, etc. The question is which one was there. The article doesn't name specific individuals from the old UCB, just that the current show includes those comics. Since all the listed performers are part of that group, but the question asks for a specific one, but the text doesn't name any individual as being from the old UCB, except maybe Dan Black? Wait, the article says "those comics" refers to the ones in the Bell House show. Since the question is asking for a comedian from the Bell House show who was at the old UCB, but the article doesn't specify which ones were there. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says "you can still see those comics in Dan Black's...", so the performers listed (like Nicole Byer, D'Arcy Carden, etc.) are the ones from the old UCB. Since the question asks for one of them, but the text doesn't name any specific individual's past at UCB, except that they were part of that group. So perhaps the answer is N/A because it's not specified which one. Wait, but the question might be trickier. The original UCB was in Gristedes, and the current UCB is on 14th St. The Bell House show includes people from that original group. The question asks for a comedian from the Bell House show who performed at the old UCB. Since all the listed performers are part of that group, but the article doesn't name any individual's past there, so the answer can't be given. So N/A?

Wait, maybe the article mentions some of them? Let me check again. The article lists the performers as Dan Black, Nicole Byer, D'Arcy Carden, Neil Casey, Jon Gabrus, Bobby Moynihan, Brandon Scott Jones, Paul Welsh. The original UCB had "many of today's top sitcom stars and character actors" who were there. The question is which of these was part of that. Since the article doesn't explicitly name any, but implies that all the performers in the Bell House show are from that group, but the question requires a specific name. Since there's no specific name given, the answer is N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Time of the final performance of "The Ultimate Improv Show" on Saturday night. The Bell House shows have Abbi Jacobson on Friday at 10pm, and Janeane Garofalo on Saturday at 7:30pm. So the Saturday performances are at 7:30pm. The final on Saturday would be the 7:30pm show. So answer is 7:30 p.m.

6. **Question 6**: How many Tony Awards did Alicia Keys' musical win? The article says "this jukebox musical, which won two Tonys." So answer is 2.

7. **Question 7**: Duration of Takuya Nakamura's performance. The article doesn't explicitly state the duration. It mentions that his show is part of a sold-out event, but the duration isn't given. The event starts at 7 p.m., but no end time. So answer N/A.

Wait, maybe the duration is inferred from the venue's typical shows? The article says "the show is sold out" but doesn't give time length. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Original ticket price for abortion access benefit before donations. The article says "Tickets are $25, with the option to make an additional donation." So original price is $25.

9. **Question 9**: Who directed both Broadway shows mentioned as "Critic's Pick"? The Critic's Picks include "Gypsy" directed by George C. Wolfe, "Oh, Mary!" by Michael Greif, "Hell's Kitchen" directed by Michael Greif. Wait, looking at the listings:

- "Gypsy" is directed by George C. Wolfe.
- "Oh, Mary!" (the Mary Todd Lincoln play) is directed by Trip Cullman? Wait, the first Critic's Pick after "Last Chance" is "Through June 28..." which is "Oh, Mary!" directed by Trip Cullman? Wait, let me check the article again.

Looking back:

The Critic's Picks sections:

- "Running time: 1 hour 40 minutes. Second Stage... directed by Trip Cullman..." – that's the first one, the dysfunctional family dramedy. Then the next is "Through June 28..." which is "Oh, Mary!" directed by Trip Cullman? Wait no, the second Critic's Pick says "Through June 28 at the Lyceum Theater... directed by Trip Cullman"? Wait, no, the second one is "Oh, Mary!" and says "Escola stars... directed by Trip Cullman"? Wait, the first Critic's Pick after "Last Chance" is the dramedy with Zachary Quinto, directed by Trip Cullman. The next is "Through June 28..." which is "Oh, Mary!" directed by Trip Cullman? Wait, the article says:

First Critic's Pick (after "Last Chance"):

"Running time: 1 hour 40 minutes. Second Stage... directed by Trip Cullman..." (the dysfunctional family one).

Next:

"Through June 28 at the Lyceum Theater... This comedy by Cole Escola... directed by Trip Cullman..." Wait, no, maybe I misread. Let me check again.

The article's Critic's Picks sections:

After the "Last Chance" section:

1. "Running time: 1 hour 40 minutes. Second Stage... directed by Trip Cullman..." (the Christmas dramedy).

2. "Through June 28 at the Lyceum Theater... This comedy by Cole Escola ("Difficult People")... directed by Trip Cullman, who staged the play last winter..." Wait, no, the second one says "Escola stars as a sozzled, stage-struck Mary Todd Lincoln... directed by Trip Cullman?" Wait, the text says: "Escola stars as a sozzled, stage-struck Mary Todd Lincoln -- a very loose cannon largely ignored by her husband (Conrad Ricamora)... Read the review. Critic's Pick" — the direction is not mentioned here. Wait, maybe I missed the director. Let me parse again:

The second Critic's Pick (the Mary Lincoln one):

"Through June 28 at the Lyceum Theater, Manhattan; ohmaryplay.com. Running time: 1 hour 20 minutes. Channeling... this comedy by Cole Escola ("Difficult People") began as a fizzy Off Broadway hit. Escola stars... Read the review. Critic's Pick"

So the director isn't mentioned here. The first Critic's Pick's director is Trip Cullman. The next one's director isn't stated. The third Critic's Pick is "Gypsy" directed by George C. Wolfe. The fourth is "Hell's Kitchen" directed by Michael Greif.

The question asks who directed both of the Critic's Picks mentioned. But there are multiple Critic's Picks. The user says "both Broadway productions mentioned as Critic's Pick". Maybe the user refers to all Critic's Picks, but the question says "both", implying two. Let me count the Critic's Picks in the article:

- The dysfunctional family dramedy (directed by Trip Cullman)
- The Mary Lincoln play (no director mentioned in the text provided? Wait, the first paragraph of that entry says "Escola stars..." and the direction isn't mentioned. Wait, looking again:

The entry says "Trip Cullman, who staged the play last winter at Berkeley Rep, directs..." — that's the first Critic's Pick (the Christmas dramedy). The second Critic's Pick (Mary Lincoln) doesn't mention director. The third is "Gypsy" directed by George C. Wolfe. Fourth is "Hell's Kitchen" directed by Michael Greif. Fifth is the Met exhibition, but that's not a Broadway show. The Whitney exhibit also not. The question is about Broadway shows that are Critic's Picks. So the Broadway Critic's Picks are:

1. The dramedy (directed by Trip Cullman)

2. The Mary Lincoln play (director not mentioned here)

3. "Gypsy" (George C. Wolfe)

4. "Hell's Kitchen" (Michael Greif)

So the question asks who directed both of the Critic's Picks. Since there are multiple, but the question says "both", maybe the user is referring to two that have the same director. Looking for directors who directed two. The only possible is Trip Cullman directed the first one and maybe another? The Mary Lincoln play's director isn't stated, so perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the "Gypsy" is directed by George C. Wolfe, and "Hell's Kitchen" by Michael Greif. Since the question asks who directed both, but no single person directed two, the answer would be N/A. Unless there's a director I missed. Let me check again.

Wait, in the entry for "Gypsy" it says "Directed by George C. Wolfe". The entry for "Hell's Kitchen" says "Directed by Michael Greif". The first Critic's Pick (the dysfunctional family) is directed by Trip Cullman. The Mary Lincoln one doesn't mention director. So no two shows were directed by the same person. Thus the answer is N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Brooklyn venue for Takuya Nakamura's "Cosmic Jungle" performance. The article says the venue is Public Records in Brooklyn. So answer: Public Records.

11. **Question 11**: The live show at Bell House paying tribute to the lost UCB space. The article says "The Ultimate Improv Show" is where those comics from the old UCB are now performing. So the name of the show is "The Ultimate Improv Show".

12. **Question 12**: Benefit event with Guerilla Toss and Dazegxd supporting reproductive justice. The abortion access benefit at Bowery Ballroom mentions those artists. So the event is the "Third Annual Abortion Access Benefit".

13. **Question 13**: Dramedy about dysfunctional family Christmas in CT. That's the first Critic's Pick, directed by Trip Cullman. The title isn't given, but the article says it's by Leslye Headland ("Russian Doll") and is a dramedy about a dysfunctional clan gathering for Christmas. The article doesn't give the title. Wait, the title might be mentioned in the entry. Let me check again:

The entry says: "Second Stage leans right into holiday-season angst with this dramedy by Leslye Headland ("Russian Doll") about a dysfunctional clan gathering for Christmas in Connecticut..." — the title isn't provided in the text. The article only refers to it as "this dramedy" but doesn't give a title. So the answer is N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Guest from a practical jokes series at Bell House. The monologuists include Joe Gatto from "Impractical Jokers". So answer is Joe Gatto.

15. **Question 15**: Company under a digital brand launching stand-up. The article mentions "Disney, under the banner of Hulu, has entered the stand-up comedy game..." So answer is Hulu (under Disney).

16. **Question 16**: New dance work in Queens' Lunar New Year show. The article says the Nai-Ni Chen show introduces "Dances of the Golden Snake" by Ying Shi, which is the new work. So answer: Dances of the Golden Snake.

17. **Question 17**: Exhibition exploring African American engagement with ancient Egypt. The Met exhibition "Black Refractions: Highlights from the African American Collection" isn't mentioned, but the article has an exhibition at the Met titled "Black Refractions" or another? Wait, the article's exhibitions:

- The Met has an exhibition "This magnificent glow-in-the-dark exhibition..." which is about early Italian religious art. Then another at Whitney about Alvin Ailey. The third Met exhibition is "This unusual and audacious exhibition... spotlighting a propensity in American culture... attachment to ancient Egyptian culture, myth and spirituality..." So that's the one. The title isn't given, but the description matches. The question asks for the name, but the article doesn't name the exhibition. It just describes it. So answer N/A? Wait, the description says "This unusual and audacious exhibition spotlights..." but the title isn't provided. The user might expect the name, but since it's not given, answer N/A. Alternatively, maybe the name is inferred from the description, but the article doesn't state the title. So N/A.

Wait the Met's other exhibition is "Black Refractions: Highlights from the African American Collection" but that's the first one. The third one is the Egyptian one. The article says "Through Feb. 17 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art... This unusual and audacious exhibition spotlights a propensity in American culture hiding in plain sight: the attachment, among Black artists, musicians and intellectuals, to ancient Egyptian culture, myth and spirituality." The title isn't mentioned, so the answer is N/A.

18. **Question 18**: Live show at Bell House as homage to the old UCB venue. The article says "The Ultimate Improv Show" is where those comics from the old UCB are performing now, so the show's name is the answer.
