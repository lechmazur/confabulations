Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions beyond that.

1. The question is about the juggler's method. The article says the juggler posed trivia questions about U.S. presidents instead of juggling. So the answer is trivia questions about U.S. presidents.

2. The Mar-a-Lago station had shrimp, steak, salad with Thousand Island dressing, and McDonald's delivery. The question asks for the snack cake. Wait, the article mentions "snack cakes and other appetizers were passed around" but doesn't specify which at the Mar-a-Lago station. Since McDonald's is mentioned separately, maybe the snack cakes are just general. The question says "most likely served at the Mar-a-Lago station"â€”since the station's main items are listed as shrimp, steak, etc., maybe the snack cakes aren't part of that station. So maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "Snack cakes and other appetizers were passed around, and larger bites were served at stations. (The Mar-a-Lago station had shrimp, steak and salad with Thousand Island dressing; there was also a food delivery from McDonald's.)" So the snack cakes are separate from the Mar-a-Lago station's main items. The question asks what type of snack cake was served at the Mar-a-Lago station. Since the station's main items are shrimp, steak, etc., the snack cakes might not be part of that station. So the answer is N/A.

3. The gift bags had small bottles of Moet champagne. The question says if Wang arrived before Adelson, would it change? The article says the gift bags had Moet regardless. So the answer is Moet.

4. The question asks for the estimated value per person of appetizers before main courses. The article doesn't provide any numerical values or estimates, so N/A.

5. The question is how many times Vance consulted Thiel during the party. The article says Vance stayed less than 30 minutes but doesn't mention consultations, so N/A.

6. MAGA hats were red, as mentioned in the text: "red MAGA hats".

7. The question refers to the Luddite Teens article, which is in the same text. The article says Donald Trump Jr. posted a similar thought to his followers on X. X is the platform, so the answer is X (now Twitter).

8. The McDonald's delivery is mentioned, but the specific item isn't listed. The article just says "food delivery from McDonald's". Since the main station items are shrimp, steak, etc., the McDonald's part is vague. So N/A.

9. Which two billionaires worked together at the same company before Trump? The article mentions David Sacks and Peter Thiel as college friends at Stanford, but not same company. Wait, Sacks is a co-host with Thiel. The article says Sacks is an incoming admin official and a college friend from Stanford. Maybe they worked together at PayPal? Because Thiel co-founded PayPal. Sacks was also involved in PayPal. The article doesn't explicitly state that, but maybe inferred? Wait, the article says "David Sacks, an incoming administration official from Silicon Valley and a college friend of Mr. Thiel from their days at Stanford." So unless they worked together at a company, like PayPal, but the article doesn't say that. So the answer is N/A unless there's another pair. The article mentions the Winklevoss twins (crypto investors), but they're not mentioned as working together with anyone else. Maybe Thiel and Zuckerberg? But Zuckerberg is on Meta's board with Thiel, but that's not before Trump. Hmm. The only pair mentioned as having a prior connection is Sacks and Thiel as college friends, but not same company. So maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "David Sacks is an incoming administration official from Silicon Valley and a college friend of Mr. Thiel from their days at Stanford." So they were at Stanford together but not necessarily the same company. So maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "previously worked together at the same company". Since the article doesn't mention that, it's N/A.

10. The juggler asked trivia questions about U.S. presidents, but the specific question isn't given. So N/A.

11. The question is about a 2024 Senate candidate backed by David Sacks. The article says Sacks is a co-host and an incoming admin official, but doesn't mention backing any 2024 candidates. Thiel backed Vance in 2022, but Sacks' backing isn't mentioned. So N/A.

12. The temperature on the sidewalk where reporters waited is mentioned as "the temperature dropped" but no exact number. So N/A.

13. The question is which VC at the party collaborated with Sam Altman on a bipartisan AI initiative. The article mentions Altman is CEO of OpenAI, but there's no mention of collaborations with other attendees on AI regulation. So N/A.

14. Number of Secret Service agents isn't specified. The article says most attendees (except Zuckerberg) were screened, but how many agents? N/A.

15. Ted Cruz's conversation with reporters didn't mention a specific policy. The article says Cruz mentioned "noon on Monday" as the best part, possibly referring to Trump's inauguration. No specific policy proposal is named. So N/A.

16. The rare vintage item from Didier Ludot's sale in the gift bags? The article mentions gift bags had Moet and MAGA hats, but nothing about Ludot's items. The Ludot part is in a different section (Luddite Teens article), but that's about a Paris shop closing. The party's gift bags didn't include that. So N/A.
