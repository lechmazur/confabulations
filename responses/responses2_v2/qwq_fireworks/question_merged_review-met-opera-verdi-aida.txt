Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by going through each question and finding the relevant parts in the text.

1. **How many performances of *Aida*, directed by the same person who directed *La Traviata* in "preposterous Disney princess crinolines," are scheduled at the Metropolitan Opera this season?**  
   The article mentions Michael Mayer directed *La Traviata* with Disney princess crinolines. It says the new *Aida* has 65,000 seats to sell this season. The question is about the number of performances. Since 65,000 seats divided by the Met's typical seating (around 4,000 per performance) would be about 16 performances. But the article says "65,000 seats to sell this season alone," so maybe the exact number isn't given. Wait, the question is about how many performances are scheduled. The text doesn't state the number of performances directly, only seats. So maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "65,000 seats to sell this season alone"—if they mean total seats available, but we don't know how many performances that equates to. The answer might be N/A because the number of performances isn't specified. Wait, the question is about the number of performances directed by Mayer this season. The article says "the company rang in the new year with a new version of Verdi's Pharaonic classic *Aida*... which has 65,000 seats to sell this season alone." But the number of performances isn't stated. So answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe the question is trickier. The question asks how many performances of *Aida* directed by the same director (Mayer) are scheduled. The article mentions that the production has 65,000 seats, which is the total available for the season, but the number of shows isn't given. So answer is N/A.

2. **What prop, reminiscent of a character from a popular television show starring Fred Armisen, was used by the archaeologist to symbolize the uncovering of the opera's narrative?**  
   The article mentions "an Indiana Jones fedora" worn by the archaeologist. The TV show referenced in the article with Fred Armisen is "Blue Man Group Farewell" where he had a drumming gig. Wait, the question says the prop is reminiscent of a character from a show with Fred Armisen. The Indiana Jones hat is a prop, but the show with Fred Armisen is mentioned in a different section. The article says "A Blue Man Group Farewell: Over 34 years, the show gave Fred Armisen a drumming gig..." So the prop is the Indiana Jones fedora, but the question links it to a prop from Fred Armisen's show. Wait, maybe the fedora is the prop, but the question says "reminiscent of a character from a show starring Armisen". The Blue Man Group is the show, but their characters are blue men. The fedora isn't from that. Maybe the question is a trick. The only prop mentioned for the archaeologist is the Indiana Jones fedora. The other part about Fred Armisen's show is a distractor. The answer is the Indiana Jones fedora.

3. **Besides *Madama Butterfly*, what other opera did Judit Kutasi, known for her role as the jealous princess, likely perform, based on her stage presence described in the review?**  
   Judit Kutasi is the mezzo-soprano singing Amneris. The article says she "wandered in from a performance of *Madama Butterfly*" implies that her portrayal here (stabbing herself) is like that opera. But the question is asking for another opera she's likely performed, based on her stage presence. The text doesn't mention other roles she's done. So N/A? Wait, the question is phrased as "likely perform" but the text only mentions her role here. Maybe the answer is N/A.

4. **What aspect of Verdi's original composition was altered in Mayer's production to align with Edward Said's critique, specifically during the scene where antiquities are paraded?**  
   Edward Said's critique is about Western exploitation of non-Western cultures. The article says during the Triumphal March, instead of Egyptians bringing conquered treasures, the archaeologists parade the antiquities, which could be seen as war booty. So the change is that the paraders are archaeologists instead of Egyptians, making the antiquities their loot. The aspect altered is who is parading the antiquities—changed from Egyptians to archaeologists.

5. **What type of animal, traditionally featured in Met productions and symbolic of the grandeur mentioned in relation to *Die Frau Ohne Schatten*, was notably absent from this production, despite the director's attempt to appeal to new audiences?**  
   The article mentions "the onstage menagerie has been vanishing" and "not a horse in sight". Also, the reviewer says "I'm fine with taking the horses out of *Aida*" and mentions *Die Frau Ohne Schatten* as an example of old-style grandeur. So the animal is horses.

6. **What design element, common to both the previous *Aida* production and the current one, and also featured in the sets of *Lucia di Lammermoor*, contributed to the "stagy and stale" feel, according to the reviewer?**  
   The article says "the visuals are dominated by weathered hieroglyphs, even if they're no longer painted on" (now projections). The previous production had hieroglyphs painted on. Also, *Lucia di Lammermoor* was updated to a postindustrial setting, but the hieroglyphs are common to both *Aida* versions and maybe *Lucia*? Wait, no. The design element common to both is hieroglyphs. The previous *Aida* had painted hieroglyphs, current uses projections but still hieroglyphs. So the element is hieroglyphs.

7. **What theatrical element, choreographed by the same person responsible for the dances in the Rat Pack Las Vegas version of *Rigoletto*, was described as "awkwardly thrusting" in this production of *Aida*?**  
   The choreography by Oleg Glushkov is mentioned as "awkwardly thrusting". The director is Michael Mayer, who did the Rat Pack *Rigoletto*. Since the question links the choreographer to that version, the answer is the choreography (dances) by Glushkov.

8. **What specific financial strategy, similar to those employed by presidential campaigns and aimed at maintaining the Met's traditional audience, was reflected in the choice of Susan Hilferty's costume designs?**  
   The production's strategy is described as "desperate not to lose its base while trying to appeal to new voters with a veneer of freshness". The costumes are described as "Cecil B. DeMille-style" by Susan Hilferty. So the strategy is balancing old and new, which is like a presidential campaign's strategy. The costumes are part of maintaining the traditional look (base) while adding new elements. The specific strategy is maintaining traditional elements while adding a veneer of freshness.

9. **What aspect of Piotr Beczala's performance, specifically mentioned in his opening aria, was later attributed to a health issue announced after the performance of *Ainadamar* by Angel Blue?**  
   The article says Beczala was "ailing, unaccountably performing... From his labored opening aria... announced at the end of intermission that he was recovering from a bad cold." The aspect was his "labored" singing in the opening aria, attributed to his cold. The question mentions "performance of *Ainadamar*" but Angel Blue's struggle with *Ainadamar* is mentioned as her past role. The answer is his "labored" singing.

10. **What change in the staging, directly impacting the setting of the act featuring the Nile by moonlight, was implemented to reduce the overall running time of the opera to that of a Blue Man Group performance?**  
    The article says eliminating the second intermission meant Act III (Nile scene) and Act IV are continuous, so the Nile scene is in the same temple as Act IV. The change is making Acts III and IV continuous without a curtain, so the setting isn't changed but the location remains the same temple instead of a different one. The answer is that the Nile scene is set in the same temple as Act IV, eliminating a set change to save time.

11. **Which ancient civilization is indirectly reimagined by the modern archaeologist’s narrative framing in Mayer’s production of the opera?**  
    The opera is about ancient Egypt and Ethiopia. The archaeologist frames it as discovering an Egyptian temple. So the civilization is ancient Egypt.

12. **Which beam of illumination is described as revealing richly colored hieroglyphs in the temple scene?**  
    The article says the archaeologist "holds it up to a shaft of light. Suddenly the walls fill in with richly colored hieroglyphs". The beam is a shaft of light.

13. **Which operatic character is portrayed by a singer who was reportedly recovering from a cold during the performance?**  
    Piotr Beczala was singing Radames, the Egyptian warrior. He was ill.

14. **Which traditional stage element, once featuring live animals, is completely absent in this reworked version of the opera?**  
    The article says "not a horse in sight" and mentions the menagerie vanishing. So horses.

15. **Which iconic headwear does the modern-day archaeologist wear during the prelude to introduce the ancient narrative?**  
    Indiana Jones fedora.

16. **Which early film director’s style is evoked in the costumes that dominate the visual design of the production?**  
    Cecil B. DeMille-style costumes by Susan Hilferty.

17. **Which administrative decision altered the structure of the opera by eliminating a break between acts?**  
    The Met's administration allowed the elimination of the second intermission, making Acts III and IV continuous.

18. **Which conductor is credited with providing an energetically paced, though blunt, musical performance during the staging?**  
    Yannick Nézet-Séguin.

19. **Which influential scholar's ideas about Western portrayals of non-Western cultures are subtly echoed in the production's framing?**  
    Edward Said.

20. **Which character’s portrayal is uniquely altered by a final act of self-inflicted injury during the blackout?**  
    Amneris stabs herself, as if from *Madama Butterfly*. The character is Amneris.
