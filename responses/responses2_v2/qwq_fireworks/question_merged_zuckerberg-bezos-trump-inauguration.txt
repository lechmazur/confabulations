Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and strictly follow the instructions. Let me start by going through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** What role did Jenn Piepszak, who is succeeding Daniel Pinto, decline "at this time" at DAZN?

The article mentions that Jenn Piepszak became the C.O.O. of JPMorgan's core commercial and investment bank but wasn't interested in succeeding Dimon. The question asks about DAZN, but the text doesn't mention DAZN in relation to Piepszak. So this must be N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How much money, in total, did Elon Musk save by failing to disclose his Twitter ownership stake, according to the lawsuit filed by Paul Atkins?

The SEC lawsuit says Musk bought $150 million worth of shares at a lower price. The answer is $150 million.

3. **Question 3:** What percentage of Meta employees were laid off after Mark Zuckerberg's announcement, prompted by the praise from Trump and other conservatives regarding Meta's relaxed restrictions on speech?

The article states Meta plans to lay off 5% of employees. The layoffs are linked to performance cuts, but the question ties it to Trump's praise. The percentage is 5%.

4. **Question 4:** Besides Elon Musk, who else is expected to have office space in the White House complex and oversee matters including aviation safety and autonomous vehicles?

Sean Duffy, Transportation Department pick, oversees those matters. The article mentions Musk as cost-cutting czar with White House space. So Duffy is the answer.

5. **Question 5:** What was the name of the event featuring Snoop Dogg that was organized by Miriam Adelson, Tilman Fertitta, and Todd Ricketts, with tickets starting at $5,000?

The "Inaugural Crypto Ball" is mentioned, but the organizers listed here aren't the ones in the article. The organizers of the reception are Adelson, Fertitta, and Ricketts, but the event with Snoop is the Crypto Ball. The question mixes details; the event by those organizers is a reception, not the Crypto Ball. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** What specific action did the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau take against Capital One, mirroring the S.E.C.'s unusual demand that Musk repay his windfall?

The CFPB sued Capital One for cheating depositors out of $2 billion in interest. The SEC wanted Musk to repay gains, so the action is a lawsuit.

7. **Question 7:** What was the name of the act introduced by Senator Ed Markey that President-elect Donald Trump supported, which would give TikTok 270 days to divest from ByteDance?

The article says Trump opposed the ban. The act is the "Extend the TikTok Deadline Act." The question mentions Trump supported it, but the text says he opposed the ban. Since the act gives more time, Trump supported opposing the ban, so the answer is the act's name.

8. **Question 8:** What position at BlackRock did Mark Wiedman forfeit $8 million in stock options to pursue, after expressing a desire to leave six months prior, according to Larry Fink?

Wiedman was head of global client business. The question asks the position he left. The answer is "head of global client business" but the question specifies "position at BlackRock"—so "head of global client business" is correct.

9. **Question 9:** What was the name of the Chinese app dominating downloads, mentioned in the same section as Rashida Jones' departure from MSNBC, that is facing a potential ban in the United States?

The section mentions "Red Note" as the Chinese app dominating downloads. TikTok's ban is discussed, but the app in question here is Red Note.

10. **Question 10:** What was the name of the longtime Trump advisor, mentioned in the same section as Coca-Cola's commemorative gift, who is hosting a pre-inauguration event and stated the need to align with the "world order"?

David Urban is the advisor quoted about the "world order" in the same section as Coca-Cola's gift. So David Urban.

11. **Question 11:** Which business leader of a major social media company has been reported to have made multiple visits to Mar-a-Lago and later adjusted his company’s moderation policies in ways that garnered praise from Trump?

Zuckerberg made multiple visits and adjusted Meta's policies, earning Trump's praise. So Mark Zuckerberg.

12. **Question 12:** Integrating references to political fundraising, corporate influence, and technological innovation, which entrepreneur known for electric vehicles is portrayed as supporting Trump’s cost-cutting agenda and is also highlighted for being involved in autonomous vehicle discussions?

Elon Musk is the electric vehicle entrepreneur supporting Trump, involved in autonomous vehicles (Transportation Department questions mention him).

13. **Question 13:** What record-setting monetary figure is noted for the Trump inaugural fund?

The article states the fund surpassed $170 million, a record. So $170 million.

14. **Question 14:** Which chief executive is mentioned as warning his staff about extensive performance-based cuts amid a tech rivalry?

Zuckerberg warned about performance-based cuts due to AI competition. So Mark Zuckerberg.

15. **Question 15:** Which beverage company leader is noted for presenting a commemorative inaugural bottle to Trump?

Coca-Cola's CEO James Quincey gave Trump a Diet Coke bottle. So James Quincey.

16. **Question 16:** Which major banking institution’s leadership transition is described by noting that its co-chief operating officer is not considering the top executive role?

JPMorgan's COO Jenn Piepszak isn't interested in succeeding Dimon. So JPMorgan.

17. **Question 17:** Which executive is indirectly connected with both a high-profile SEC lawsuit and priorities in overseeing autonomous vehicles?

Elon Musk is involved in the SEC lawsuit and autonomous vehicles via Transportation Department (Sean Duffy's role, but Musk's company is involved in autonomous tech).

Wait, the question says "indirectly connected". The SEC lawsuit is about Musk, and autonomous vehicles are part of Transportation Department's questions to Sean Duffy. But the connection is that Musk's involvement with autonomous vehicles (as Tesla's CEO) is part of the oversight Duffy would handle. However, the question asks for an executive connected to both. Since Musk is the subject of the lawsuit and his company is part of the oversight, but the executive overseeing it is Duffy. Hmm, maybe the answer is Musk? Or Duffy? The article says Sean Duffy would oversee autonomous vehicles. The SEC lawsuit is against Musk. The question says "indirectly connected"—so Musk is connected to both via his roles. So answer: Elon Musk.

18. **Question 18:** Which senator is mentioned as the candidate expected to face questions on foreign affairs and is seen as part of discussions around tariff policies?

Marco Rubio, chosen as Secretary of State, faces questions on Middle East, Ukraine, China, which are foreign affairs. Tariff policies are part of Trump's agenda but the question ties to Rubio's role. So Marco Rubio.

19. **Question 19:** Which billionaire co-founder from an infrastructure investment firm was added to the board of an artificial intelligence organization?

Adebayo Ogunlesi from Global Infrastructure Partners joined OpenAI's board. So Adebayo Ogunlesi.

20. **Question 20:** Which European nation is referenced as engaging in discreet military and economic discussions with the United States concerning Greenland?

Denmark is mentioned negotiating deals with the U.S. related to Greenland. So Denmark.
