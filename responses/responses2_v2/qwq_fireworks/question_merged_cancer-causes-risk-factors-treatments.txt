Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and follow the instructions strictly. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks for the percentage of cancers attributed to cigarette smoking, sun exposure, alcohol use, and excess body weight combined, factors that directly damage DNA. The article mentions that 40% of cancers can be attributed to modifiable risk factors, including smoking, sun exposure, alcohol, and excess weight. However, the question specifies "directly damage DNA." The article says these factors might affect cancer risk through inflammation, not directly damaging DNA. So the answer might be N/A because the 40% is for modifiable factors, but the question's premise about DNA damage might not align. Wait, the article says "if such exposures affect our cancer risk, they likely do so by provoking inflammation—not by directly damaging DNA." So the 40% includes factors that don't directly damage DNA. Since the question asks for factors that directly damage DNA, but the article says these don't, the 40% isn't the right answer here. So answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Dr. Sohal mentioned CAR T-cell therapy being effective for a cancer that's now manageable like diabetes. The article states CAR T-cell therapy is effective for blood cancers. The question asks what he mentioned. The exact quote from Dr. Sohal was about gastrointestinal cancers, but the answer here is blood cancers as per CAR T's use. Wait, the article says "CAR T-cell therapy, which has been most effective at treating blood cancers." So the answer is blood cancers. The question mentions Dr. Sohal's example? Wait, the example given in the text for the diabetes comparison is from Dr. Sohal. The text says: "Certain cancers used to be 'death sentences,' Dr. Sohal said. Now they are more akin to diabetes..." So the specific cancer isn't named here, but CAR T is for blood cancers. Maybe the answer is blood cancers.

3. **Question 3**: Dr. Rathmell mentioned an environmental factor disproportionately affecting Black people leading to higher pancreatic cancer. The article says Black people have higher rates of lung cancer due to air pollution. The question is about pancreatic cancer. The article mentions pancreatic cancer linked to diet-induced microbiome imbalance. The specific factor from Rathmell? Wait, the article states: "Black people... exposed to disproportionately high levels of air pollution; they also have higher rates of lung cancer..." The question asks about pancreatic cancer. Since the article doesn't link Black people's higher rates of pancreatic cancer to pollution, answer N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Dr. Cheung's research on metastasis via dead cells. The article says: "dead and dying cells within a tumor might create an environment that makes it easier for living tumor cells to get out and spread." So the answer is creating a favorable microenvironment.

5. **Question 5**: Dr. Demetri's treatment involving toxins killing healthy and cancer cells targeting microbiome imbalance. The article says "chemotherapy -- which delivers toxins that kill healthy cells..." The microbiome issue is linked to diet causing inflammation, but the treatment for that isn't specified. The question says "primary treatment... targeting the microbiome imbalance caused by unhealthy diets?" The article doesn't mention chemotherapy specifically for that, so N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Infection prevented by vaccination reducing risk of cancers treatable with stem cell transplants. The article mentions HPV vaccination reduces cervical cancer. The question is about Dr. van den Brink, but the text says "get vaccinated for HPV". So HPV is the answer.

7. **Question 7**: PM 2.5 linked to colon cancer via inflammation from diet. The article says PM 2.5 increases lung and breast cancer. The colon link is via diet and microbiome. So N/A, since PM 2.5 isn't linked to colon cancer in the text.

8. **Question 8**: Normal cells transferring contents to tumor cells. The article says "immune cells might transfer their contents to tumor cells..." So immune cells.

9. **Question 9**: Engineered T cells in checkpoint inhibitors. The article says checkpoint inhibitors are separate from CAR T. CAR T is engineered T cells. The question asks about checkpoint inhibitors, which use existing T cells but don't engineer them. The answer might be N/A. Wait, the text says "checkpoint inhibitor therapies used to treat lung and skin cancers... They can also engineer T cells..." So CAR T is a different therapy. The question asks what's used in checkpoint inhibitors. The answer would be T cells but not engineered? The question says "engineered immune cells" used in checkpoint inhibitors. The article says CAR T is engineered, so answer N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Dietary component directly damaging DNA. The article says "exposures affect our cancer risk... by provoking inflammation—not by directly damaging DNA." So the answer is none, but the question asks what they thought caused mutations. The article says "scientists searched for chemicals... caused genetic mutations. But... do so by provoking inflammation." So the premise is that they thought it was direct DNA damage, but the question asks what dietary component does that. The article doesn't name one, so N/A.

11. **Question 11**: PM 2.5 linked to lung and breast cancer via inflammation. The article states PM 2.5 increases risk of lung and breast cancers through inflammation. So PM 2.5.

12. **Question 12**: Molecular modifications from aging, diet, etc. The article says epigenetic changes are a major driver. So epigenetic changes.

13. **Question 13**: Lifestyle factor causing microbiome imbalance leading to colon/pancreatic cancer. The article mentions "unhealthy diet" as causing microbiome imbalance leading to colon/pancreatic cancers. So unhealthy diet.

14. **Question 14**: Racial group with higher exposure to pollutant linked to lung cancer. The article says Black people have higher exposure to air pollution and higher lung cancer rates. So Black people.

15. **Question 15**: Airborne pollutant thought to damage DNA but actually causes inflammation. The article says PM 2.5 induces inflammation, not direct DNA damage. The question's premise is that it's sometimes mistakenly thought to damage DNA. So PM 2.5.

16. **Question 16**: Process involving dead cells facilitating metastasis. The article says dead cells create a favorable environment. So creating a favorable microenvironment.

17. **Question 17**: Age for HPV testing via vaginal samples. The article says "Starting at 30..." so 30.

18. **Question 18**: Immunotherapy effective for blood cancers. The answer is CAR T-cell therapy.

19. **Question 19**: Largest contributor to cancers. The article states cigarette smoking is the biggest. So cigarette smoking.

20. **Question 20**: Cells co-opted to form blood vessels. The article mentions immune cells helping form blood vessels. The specific group is immune cells, but more precisely, the text says "normal cells... immune cells... generating blood vessels." So immune cells.
