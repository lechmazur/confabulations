Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the provided article. 

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions Terry's hotline is busy but doesn't provide specific numbers per day. So, N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The text doesn't mention a former actress introducing her to rescue work. It says she started in 2004 due to past experiences. So, N/A.

3. **Question 3**: No specific hummingbird name is mentioned as the one that taught her techniques. The names given are Raisin, Cactus, Sugar Baby, Charlie. So, N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The article says slow-motion shows their wings but doesn't mention minutes of footage. So, N/A.

5. **Question 5**: No university partnership is mentioned. The focus is on Sally Aitken's documentary. So, N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Survival rate percentage isn't provided. The article talks about burying some but no stats. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The article doesn't mention a rare species not found in LA. Just general hummingbirds. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The article doesn't state how long it took to develop the feeding formula. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Number of species isn't listed. Only that they have names but no count. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The article mentions chaos, abuse, and addiction in her past. She credits these experiences for her empathy. So, "abuse and addiction".

11. **Question 11**: The article says their flight is like "magical realism". No other genres mentioned. So, "magical realism" and maybe another? Wait, the quote is "magical realism" and she says "trigger those ideas, those feelings... nothing else like them." Only one genre is named. So, maybe only one? The question asks for two, but the article only lists one. So N/A?

Wait, the exact quote is: "they beat 50 times per second, a fact that makes the birds seem like something out of 'magical realism.'" So only magical realism is mentioned. The question asks for two, so since only one is there, answer N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Started in 2004, the film is in theaters now (assuming current context as when the article was written, which isn't given, but the article mentions Tom Green's return with Amazon projects. The article's date isn't specified, but the film is current. If the article is from 2023, then 2023-2004=19 years. But the article doesn't state the current year. However, the question says "given the article's mention of her starting the center in 2004 and the film's release year being implied by current context?" The article mentions the film is in theaters, so maybe 2023? But without exact info, can we infer? The question says to use the article's context. The article doesn't give the current year, so perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the article's own text: "the film's release year being implied by current context?" The article is written by Alissa Wilkinson, a Times critic. The article mentions Tom Green's projects on Amazon Prime, which might be a 2023 reference. But without exact years, can't calculate. So N/A? Or maybe the question expects 2023 minus 2004=19, but since we don't know the exact release year from the text, answer N/A.

Wait, the article says "this film by Sally Aitken follows..." and "in theaters". The article itself is a review, so the film is currently in theaters. The article doesn't state the current year, so we can't compute the years. Therefore, answer N/A.

13. **Question 13**: The article lists Raisin, Cactus, Sugar Baby, and Charlie. Sunflower isn't mentioned. So answer Sunflower.

14. **Question 14**: The article mentions she buries them when they die, but the medical procedure? It says she tends to them with care, but specifics? The article says "nursing them back to health", but the exact procedure isn't named. Maybe feeding? Or something else. The article doesn't specify a medical procedure by name. So N/A.

15. **Question 15**: The article ends with Tom Green's projects on Amazon Prime. The film's distribution isn't mentioned, but the question suggests that the closing references imply the platform. Since Tom Green's on Amazon, maybe the film is too? But the article doesn't state that. So N/A.

16. **Question 16**: The article says her past included chaos, abuse, and addiction. It links her experiences to her empathy. The question asks for the traumatic event linked to starting the center. The article says "Maybe that's the reason that I came to the hummingbirds," referring to her past experiences (abuse, addiction, chaos). So the traumatic event is "abuse" or "childhood abuse" or "chaos, abuse and addiction". The exact traumatic event? The article says "chaos, abuse and addiction" in her younger years. The question asks for the event linked to her decision. Since all three are mentioned as part of her past, but the question asks for "medical condition"? Wait, the question says "medical condition from Masear's past". Wait, the question is: "What specific medical condition from Masear's past..." but the article mentions abuse and addiction as experiences, not medical conditions. Unless "addiction" is considered a medical condition. If so, then "addiction". But the question specifies "medical condition", so maybe N/A because the article doesn't mention a medical condition, just experiences like abuse and addiction. The wording is tricky. The article says "experiences developed in her an empathy..." so the traumatic events are abuse and addiction (which could be considered as part of her past experiences, not necessarily medical conditions). Since the question specifies "medical condition", which isn't explicitly stated, so N/A.

17. **Question 17**: The themes explored are her past (addiction recovery implied?), the rescue work, and inter-species empathy. The article mentions her past with chaos, abuse, addiction leading to empathy, so addiction recovery might be part of that. Climate change isn't mentioned. So the one not explored is "climate change impacts on hummingbirds".

18. **Question 18**: The article doesn't mention an unpublished memoir. It talks about her life story told in the film. So N/A.
