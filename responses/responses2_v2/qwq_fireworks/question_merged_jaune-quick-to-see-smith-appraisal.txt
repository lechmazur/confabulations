Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the given article and follow the instructions strictly. Let me read through each question carefully and check the article for answers.

1. **First question**: How many years did it take for Smith's Submuloc Society to influence the Whitney's retrospective? The article mentions the Submuloc Society was formed in the early 1990s. The Whitney retrospective was in 2023. But does the article say the Submuloc directly influenced the Whitney show? It says the Submuloc led to projects like "Paper Dolls" and exhibitions, but not directly the Whitney retrospective. So maybe this is a stretch. The question asks for the time between the society's formation and the Whitney's decision. The article doesn't link them directly. So answer N/A.

2. **Second question**: Smith's grandmothers traded using mule-drawn salt trains. The question asks what type of trading mirrored the "Women of Sweetgrass" exhibition. The article says Smith's grandmothers traded with Metis/Cree, sharing beneficial goods. The exhibition was a collective of Native women artists. The trading was about sharing goods reciprocally. So the specific type is "mule-drawn salt trains trade" but the question wants the type that mirrored the exhibition's artistic exchange. The answer might be "sharing beneficial goods" but need to check. The article says "sharing beneficial goods or properties to make others' lives better, but reciprocally we benefit, too." The exhibition was a collective showing, so the type of trading would be "mule-drawn salt trains trade" but the question asks for the type that mirrored the exhibition's artistic exchange. Maybe "cultural exchange" or "reciprocal trade." Wait, the question specifies "specific type of trading" that Smith's grandmothers engaged in. The article says "my grandmothers ran mule-drawn salt trains into Canada to trade with the Metis/Cree peoples." So the specific type is "mule-drawn salt trains trade." The "Women of Sweetgrass" was an exhibition of art by Native women, which is an artistic exchange. The question is asking what the grandmothers' trading mirrored that. The article says that interconnectedness was a principle from her heritage, so the trading was about sharing goods reciprocally. The exhibition was about collective artistic work. The answer might be "mule-drawn salt trains trade" but the question says "specific type of trading that directly mirrored the artistic exchanges seen in..." The artistic exchanges were collaborative, so the trading was reciprocal. The answer is "mule-drawn salt trains trade." But the question wants the type, so maybe "salt trade" or "mule-drawn salt trains trade."

3. **Third question**: The governmental body similar to the one that operated the Institute (Bureau of Indian Affairs) that was responsible for Columbus quincentennial. The article says the Submuloc Society opposed the U.S. government's celebratory narrative of Columbus's quincentennial. The federal body responsible would be the federal government, maybe the National Park Service or another agency. The question asks for the governmental body similar to the BIA. The BIA is part of the Department of Interior. The quincentennial was a national event, so maybe the National Endowment for the Humanities or another federal agency. But the article doesn't name the specific body. The question says "similar in function to the one that operated the Institute," which was the BIA. The answer would be "the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs" but that's the same as the one mentioned. Wait, the question asks for the governmental body responsible for the Columbus celebrations that Smith opposed. The article says the U.S. government was pushing the celebratory narrative. The specific body isn't named. So answer N/A.

4. **Fourth question**: The year the congressional staff member drafted the legislation. The article says Smith connected with a congressional staff member who wrote legislation to turn the institute into a nonprofit, introduced as an amendment to a House education bill. The bill passed in 1986. So the year would be 1986. The question asks the year the staff member drafted it. The article doesn't say the drafting year, only that the bill passed in 1986. So the answer is 1986.

5. **Fifth question**: Artistic medium similar to Joan Mitchell that Smith used in "Paper Dolls." The article says Smith was influenced by Joan Mitchell's paintings and Robert Rauschenberg's combines. The "Paper Dolls" are watercolor and graphite drawings. Joan Mitchell used painting, so the medium here would be watercolor. The answer is "watercolor."

6. **Sixth question**: National symbol depicted in "The King of the Mountain" alongside the American flag, also in "Paper Dolls." The article mentions in "The King of the Mountain" there are national flags and a pile of skulls. The "Paper Dolls" have a "Flathead headdress." The headdress is an Indigenous symbol. The question asks for a national symbol central to both works. The American flag is in "The King," but the question asks for another symbol central to both. The headdress might be a Native symbol, but the national symbols of America. Wait, the question says "national symbol" like the American flag. The article says Smith used Indigenous imagery like the canoe and buffalo as national symbols. In "The King," the flags include American, but the other symbols? Maybe the headdress isn't a national symbol but an Indigenous one. The question might be referring to the flags, but the American flag is already mentioned. Alternatively, the "canoe" and "buffalo" are her symbols. The "Paper Dolls" have a Flathead headdress. The article says she used Indigenous imagery like canoe and buffalo as national symbols. So maybe "buffalo" or "canoe" is the answer. In "The King of the Mountain," the flags are planted, but the article doesn't mention buffalo there. The "Paper Dolls" have a headdress, which is Indigenous. The question says "national symbol" like the American flag, so perhaps "buffalo" since it's a symbol she used. The answer is "buffalo" or "canoe." Looking back: "The King of the Mountain" includes national flags, but the question asks for another symbol. The article says she used Indigenous imagery like canoe and buffalo as symbols. The "Paper Dolls" have the headdress, which might not be a national symbol. The buffalo is a national symbol she used. So the answer is "buffalo."

7. **Seventh question**: Name of the first Native arts nonprofit Smith helped before the Institute. The article mentions Forge Project as a nonprofit, but Smith's involvement? The article says Candice Hopkins works at Forge Project, which was inspired by Smith's "Women of Sweetgrass." But the question asks for a nonprofit Smith helped establish before her involvement with the Institute. The article says she curated "Women of Sweetgrass" in 1985, which was at the American Indian Community House. The article doesn't mention her establishing a nonprofit before that. The answer is N/A.

8. **Eighth question**: Element from Joan Mitchell and Rauschenberg that Smith used, mirroring the earthy palette. The article says Smith borrowed from Joan Mitchell's paintings and Rauschenberg's combines. The earthy palette is mentioned as part of her work which Steinhauer says might look old-fashioned. The element common to both Mitchell and Rauschenberg could be "painting" or "combines." But the earthy palette is her own. The question asks for an element they both had that Smith incorporated. The article says she used an earthy palette. Joan Mitchell's paintings might have vibrant colors, but the earthy palette is Smith's. Maybe "layered imagery" or "mixed media." Rauschenberg's combines used mixed media. Mitchell's style is abstract expressionism. The earthy palette is Smith's, so perhaps the element is "mixed media" but the question says mirroring the earthy palette. Maybe "painting techniques" but not specific. The answer might be "earthy palette" but that's her own. The question says "element of Joan Mitchell's paintings, also present in Rauschenberg's combines" that Smith used. Maybe "use of color" or "abstract forms." The article doesn't specify, so N/A.

9. **Ninth question**: Educational institution benefiting from the letter-writing campaign. The campaign was for the Institute's transition to nonprofit, which passed in 1986. The question asks another institution besides the Institute. The article doesn't mention another institution benefiting. The answer is N/A.

10. **Tenth question**: Role of the congressional staff member analogous to the coyote. The coyote is a trickster and teacher. The staff member helped Smith change the institute's status, acting as a facilitator or enabler. The role would be "trickster" or "agent of change." The article doesn't explicitly state, but since the coyote is a trickster, maybe "trickster" but need to see. The staff member's role was to help pass the legislation, so maybe "catalyst" or "intermediary." The question asks for a role analogous to coyote's, which is a trickster. The answer might be "trickster" but not sure. The article says Smith connected with the staff member who wrote the legislation. The staff member's role in the narrative was to facilitate the change, perhaps acting as an enabler or intermediary. Since coyote is a trickster, maybe "intermediary" but not exactly. The answer might be N/A.
