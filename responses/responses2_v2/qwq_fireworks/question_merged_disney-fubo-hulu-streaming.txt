Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the given article and follow the strict format. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question is about Lara Trump's new show and a precedent involving a close relative of a sitting Vice President. The article mentions Lara Trump hosting a show on Fox News as the first case of a close relative of a sitting president on a major news channel. The question asks for a precedent related to a VP's relative. Since the article doesn't mention anything about a VP's relative, the answer is N/A.

2. The question asks how many digital-only subscribers The New York Times added in the quarter before reaching 11.4 million, assuming consistent growth. The article states they added 350k to reach 11.4 million, but we don't know the prior quarter's number. So N/A.

3. Trump Media is offering investment products aligned with the "patriotic economy," but the article doesn't specify the exact product. So N/A.

4. The American Economic Liberties Project is mentioned as pushing the Trump admin to monitor Venu, but there's no timeline for Disney's divestment from them. N/A.

5. The question asks for the news outlet falsely accused by Trump of getting paid for positive coverage, similar to Disney/Fubo. The article says Politico was accused but records show payments for subscriptions. So the answer is Politico.

6. Advocacy groups want the Trump admin to monitor Venu, but the article says the Justice Dept filed a brief. The question asks what action mirrors Politico's model. Not sure, but the settlement didn't involve regulatory action yet, so N/A.

7. Fubo's rivals are listed as YouTube TV, Charter, and Comcast. Excluding YouTube, that's 2. The answer is 2.

8. The entity merging with Hulu is Fubo, which resolved the litigation. So Fubo.

9. The executive chairman who challenged Venu and tried to buy Paramount is Edgar Bronfman Jr.

10. The article starts with "Just a week into 2025," so the settlement is in 2025.

11. The Justice Department filed a friend-of-the-court brief and can still sue. So DOJ.

12. The total paid by the three companies is $220 million.

13. The executive redirecting investments is Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief.

14. The Trump administration is mentioned as being urged by groups to monitor Venu.

15. The analyst from LightShed is Richard Greenfield.

16. The cable news outlet with Lara Trump's show is Fox News. The question mentions a context linked to Fubo, but the article doesn't connect them, so maybe Fox News is the answer.

17. The market value after the stock surge is $1.7 billion.

Wait, let me check each again:

Question 6: The question asks what specific regulatory action the Trump admin took prior to the settlement that mirrors Politico's subscription model. The article says advocacy groups are pushing the Trump admin to monitor, but the settlement didn't involve any action yet. The friend-of-the-court brief was from the Justice Dept, not the Trump admin's action. So N/A.

Question 16: The question says "mistakenly tied to the Fubo settlement," but the article mentions Fox News in a separate context. Since the question asks for the outlet that might be mistakenly linked, maybe it's Fox News, but the article doesn't say they're connected. The answer is Fox News.

Okay, proceeding with these answers.
