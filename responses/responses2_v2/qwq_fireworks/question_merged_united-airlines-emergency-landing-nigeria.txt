Okay, let me start going through each question one by one, making sure I only use the information from the provided article. 

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks for the total number of people requiring hospital treatment according to Nigerian authorities, the airline, and the Federal Airports Authority. The article mentions that Nigerian authorities and United said six were treated. However, the Federal Airports Authority specified four passengers and two crew had serious injuries, totaling six. The other 32 had minor injuries and were discharged. So the answer should be 6.

2. **Question 2:** The second question is about which flight recorder is crucial for determining the cause. The former investigator mentioned the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. But the question asks for a single one. Wait, the question says "single flight recorder is expected to provide crucial data". The article says they'll download the flight data recorder and interview crew. But the answer might need to pick one. Wait, the exact quote was: "They're going to download the flight data recorder and they're going to interview the flight crew and also listen to the cockpit voice recorder." The question asks for the single one expected to provide data. Hmm, maybe both are needed, but the question says "single", so perhaps the flight data recorder? Or maybe the answer expects the cockpit voice recorder? Wait, the question says "analysis by the former accident investigator and description of the incident". The investigator mentioned both recorders. The question might be looking for the flight data recorder, as it records technical data. Alternatively, maybe the answer is both, but the question specifies "single", so maybe I need to check again. Wait, the question says "what single flight recorder", so the answer might be either. Wait the article says they'll download the flight data recorder and listen to the cockpit voice. Since both are used, but the question is phrased as "what single... is expected to provide crucial data", perhaps it's the flight data recorder. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the flight data recorder because the technical issue would be in there. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the cockpit voice recorder because the article mentions listening to it. Wait, the question says "determining the cause of the unexpected descent". The flight data recorder would have flight parameters, while the cockpit voice records crew conversations. Maybe both are needed, but the question wants one. The article mentions both, but perhaps the answer is the flight data recorder? Or maybe the answer is both, but the question says "single". Wait, maybe the answer is the "flight data recorder" as it's mentioned first. Wait, the exact quote from the investigator: "They're going to download the flight data recorder and... listen to the cockpit voice recorder." So the question is about the one that provides crucial data. Since both are used, but the question wants a single, maybe the answer is "flight data recorder" because it's about technical issues. Alternatively, the question might accept either, but since it's the first one mentioned, perhaps that's the intended answer. Hmm. Wait, the question says "analysis by the former accident investigator and description of the incident". The investigator's analysis would use both. But the question asks for the single one. Maybe the answer is "flight data recorder".

3. **Question 3:** The third question is about the scene depicted in social media images. The article says "Video and images on social media show the distress and disarray on the plane, with passengers speaking over one another as food and meal trays are strewed throughout the cabin." So the answer is "food and meal trays strewed throughout the cabin".

4. **Question 4:** The fourth question asks if the aircraft had maintained cruising altitude 30 minutes longer, what explanation forced the return. The article states the flight returned due to the technical issue. The question is hypothetical, but the article's reason is the technical issue. So the answer is "technical issue and unexpected aircraft movement".

5. **Question 5:** The fifth question is about the difference between the airline and Nigerian authorities' descriptions of injuries. The airline called the six injuries "minor", while Nigerian authorities said "serious". The answer is "airline: minor vs Nigerian: serious".

6. **Question 6:** The sixth question refers to the professor's recommendation. The professor said passengers should stay in seatbelts as much as possible, even when the light is off. So the answer is "stay in seatbelts".

7. **Question 7:** The seventh question is about the duration after takeoff when the descent happened. The article says the episode happened about 90 minutes after takeoff. So answer is "90 minutes".

8. **Question 8:** The eighth question asks which recording device is critical for analyzing pilot conversations. The cockpit voice recorder. The article mentions listening to the cockpit voice recorder. So answer is "cockpit voice recorder".

9. **Question 9:** The ninth question is about the plane's physical state. The Nigerian authority said it didn't sustain major damage. So answer is "no major damage".

10. **Question 10:** The tenth question asks which tech entrepreneur is noted for a retrospective approach. The article mentions Bill Gates taking a break from the future to examine his past and philanthropy. The answer is "Bill Gates".

Now, let me check each again to ensure accuracy.

1. Total requiring hospital treatment: The Federal Airports Authority said four passengers and two crew had serious injuries, so 6 total. The other 32 had minor and were discharged. So yes, 6.

2. The flight data recorder is mentioned first as providing data, but the question says "single". The article mentions both, but the question might expect the flight data recorder for technical data. Alternatively, maybe the answer is both, but the question says "single". Wait, maybe the answer is the "flight data recorder" because the technical issue is a mechanical problem, so flight data would be key. But the question might want both, but since it's a single, perhaps the answer is "flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder" but that's two. The question says "single", so maybe the answer is "flight data recorder".

Wait, the question says "what single flight recorder is expected to provide crucial data". Since both are needed, but the question asks for one, perhaps the correct answer is "flight data recorder" because it's about the technical cause. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "flight data recorder" as the first part of the process. Hmm, perhaps the answer is "flight data recorder".

3. The scene is "food and meal trays strewed throughout the cabin" as per the text.

4. The reason for returning was the technical issue, so that's the answer.

5. The difference is minor vs serious.

6. Stay in seatbelts.

7. 90 minutes.

8. Cockpit voice recorder for conversations.

9. No major damage.

10. Bill Gates.

All answers seem to align with the text. Let me check the article again for question 4. The flight was forced to return due to the technical issue. The question is hypothetical: if it had continued 30 minutes longer, the reason for return is still the technical issue. So the answer is the technical issue.

Alright, I think I have all the answers.
