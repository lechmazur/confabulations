Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and answer exactly what's asked.

1. **Question 1**: Ivory Loh recommends how many weeks of consistently eating breakfast to retrain hunger cues? Let me check the article. There's a quote from her: "I tell clients to try three weeks of consistently eating something." So the answer is 3 weeks.

2. **Question 2**: Which two macronutrients must be combined in breakfast for stable blood sugar? The article says "protein, fiber and fat" but asks for two. Wait, the exact quote from Lindsay Malone says "some combination of protein, fiber and fat." Wait, the question says "two macronutrients" but the article lists three. Wait, the question might be a trick here. Wait, the question says "two macronutrients" but the article mentions three (protein, fiber, fat). Hmm. Wait, maybe the question is wrong? Wait, no, the user wants the exact answer from the article. Wait the article says "protein, fiber and fat" so the two might be protein and fiber? Or maybe the user made a mistake. Wait, the question says "two" but the article lists three. Since the user says to answer exactly, perhaps it's a mistake but the article lists three. Since the question asks for two, but the article says "some combination of protein, fiber and fat"—maybe the answer is protein and fiber? Or maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, no, the article mentions three, so maybe the user made an error. Wait, the question says "two macronutrients" but the article says three. So perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, but the question says "based on the article's discussion of ideal morning nutrition"—the ideal includes all three. Since the question is asking for two, but the article lists three, the answer would be N/A. Wait, but maybe the user made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct and the article actually lists two. Wait, let me check again. The first paragraph says "a morning meal -- ideally some combination of protein, fiber and fat". So three components. So the question is asking for two, but the article says three. Therefore, the answer would be N/A? Or maybe the question is wrong. Hmm. Wait the user says if the question's premise is incorrect, answer N/A. Since the article lists three, but the question asks two, the answer would be N/A. Wait, but maybe the user intended to ask for three? Wait no, the question is as written. So I have to answer N/A here. Wait, but maybe the question is a trick. Wait, perhaps the answer is "protein and fiber" but the article includes fat as well. Hmm, this is a problem. Let me check again. The exact quote is "some combination of protein, fiber and fat". Since the question asks for two, but the article lists three, the answer can't be given, so N/A. Wait, but maybe the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the question is correct, and I misread. Let me confirm. The article says "protein, fiber and fat"—three. The question asks for two. So answer N/A. 

Wait, but maybe the question is correct and I'm missing something. Let me check again. The article says "protein, fiber and fat"—three. The question asks for two. Since the article doesn't mention two, but three, the answer is N/A. But maybe the user wants two of them. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe "protein and fiber" are the two, but the article includes fat as part of the ideal. Wait, the question says "two macronutrients" so perhaps the answer is N/A. Hmm. I'll go with N/A for question 2.

Wait, but let me check again. The user says "two macronutrients explicitly stated"—the article lists three. So no, the answer is N/A. 

3. **Question 3**: The article mentions that skipping breakfast leads to heavy snacking after dinner, and what physiological mechanism is damaged? The text says "Having your body take on more digestion when it should be resting can lead to worse sleep and weight gain, she added." So the physiological mechanism is digestion during rest time. The question asks what mechanism is damaged. The answer is "worse sleep and weight gain", but the question is about the mechanism. Wait, the mechanism is "digesting when it should be resting". The answer is the digestion during rest leading to those issues. The question says "what specific physiological mechanism does it claim this habit directly damages over time?" So the mechanism is digestion during rest time, but the answer should be the effect. The article says the habit leads to worse sleep and weight gain. Wait, but the question is about the mechanism being damaged. The mechanism causing the problem is the body's ability to rest properly. The article states that digestion during rest time leads to worse sleep and weight gain. So the damaged mechanism is the body's ability to rest. But the exact wording in the article is "your body takes on more digestion when it should be resting can lead to worse sleep and weight gain". The mechanism is digestion interfering with rest. The question asks what mechanism is damaged. The answer is "the body's ability to rest" but the article says it leads to worse sleep and weight gain. Hmm. The question is about the physiological mechanism that is damaged. The article says "having your body take on more digestion when it should be resting can lead to worse sleep and weight gain". So the mechanism being damaged is the body's digestion-rest balance. But the answer must be from the text. The article says the problem is "your body takes on more digestion when it should be resting", which directly leads to worse sleep and weight gain. The question asks what mechanism is damaged. The mechanism here is the body's rest process, but the exact wording is "digesting when it should be resting". The answer is the digestive process during rest, but the article says the habit leads to worse sleep and weight gain. Wait, the question is phrased as "what specific physiological mechanism does it claim this habit directly damages over time?" The mechanism here is the body's ability to rest properly. But the article states the consequences are worse sleep and weight gain. The mechanism causing those is digestion during rest. So the answer is the body's ability to rest, but the article's wording is "digesting when it should be resting". The answer would be "digesting when it should be resting" but the question asks for the mechanism that is damaged. Alternatively, the answer is "worse sleep and weight gain" but those are the outcomes. Hmm. Wait, maybe the question is about the physiological process disrupted. The article says "having your body take on more digestion when it should be resting can lead to worse sleep and weight gain". The mechanism being damaged is the body's rest process. But the answer must be from the text. The exact wording for the mechanism is "digesting when it should be resting". So the answer is "digesting when it should be resting".

4. **Question 4**: The article uses a communication metaphor for hunger cues. Ivory Loh's analogy: "It's as if your body is texting you, calmly, and you don't answer. So then it starts calling, then speed dialing. By the time you pay attention, it's an urgent yell." The metaphor is texting, then calling, then speed dialing. The technological analogy is "texting, calling, speed dialing" but the question asks for the specific metaphor. The answer is "texting" followed by "calling" then "speed dialing", but the main analogy is the body's communication like texting and escalating. The question asks for the technological analogy used. The answer is "texting" and "calling", but the main one is "texting". Wait, the question says "specific technological analogy". The main analogy is comparing hunger cues to a phone's communication (text, call, speed dial). The answer is "texting" and the progression, but the question asks for the specific analogy. The answer is "texting" and "calling" but the key part is the metaphor of escalating messages. The article says "texting... then calling, then speed dialing". The specific analogy is "texting" and the progression, but the question wants the metaphor. The answer is "texting, then calling, then speed dialing". But the question says "specific technological analogy" so maybe the first part: "texting". Or the entire sequence. Wait, the question is asking for the technological analogy used. The answer is the body is texting you, then calling, etc. The main analogy is using communication methods (texting, calling). The answer is "texting" but the full analogy includes all steps. The question says "specific technological analogy", so perhaps the main one is "texting". Alternatively, the entire process is the analogy. The article says "texting you, calmly, and you don't answer. So then it starts calling, then speed dialing." The metaphor is the escalating communication methods. The answer is "texting, then calling, then speed dialing" but the question wants the specific analogy. The main one is "texting", but maybe the answer is "texting and calling". Alternatively, the question wants the first part. The exact words used are "texting" and "calling", so the answer is "texting, calling, and speed dialing" but the question might accept "texting" as the initial step. Hmm. The article uses the metaphor of escalating communication methods. The answer is the "texting" analogy, but the question asks for the specific metaphor. The answer is "texting" followed by more urgent calls, but the exact phrase used is "texting". Alternatively, the answer is the entire sequence. But the question asks for the "specific technological analogy", which is the comparison to texting and then calling. The answer is "texting, then calling, then speed dialing". But the user wants the answer in a sentence fragment or words. The exact quote uses "texting" as the first step, so maybe the answer is "texting".

Wait, the question says "specific technological analogy does Ivory Loh use to describe escalating hunger signals?" The analogy is the body's signals start as a text, then escalate to calls, then speed dialing. The main analogy is comparing the body's hunger cues to a phone's communication methods. The answer is "texting" as the initial step, but the full analogy includes all steps. However, the question asks for the analogy used for escalating signals. The answer is "texting, calling, and speed dialing" but perhaps the key part is "texting" as the starting point. Alternatively, the metaphor is "texting" and the progression. Since the question asks for the technological analogy, the answer is the entire process, but the user might want the first part. Alternatively, the answer is "texting" as the first step. Hmm. The exact quote is "texting you, calmly, and you don't answer. So then it starts calling, then speed dialing." The analogy is using communication methods like texting, then calling, then speed dialing. The question asks for the specific analogy, so the answer is "texting, calling, and speed dialing" but the user might want the entire sequence. Since the question says "specific technological analogy", maybe the main one is "texting" but the full answer is needed. However, the user wants a direct answer. Let me check the exact quote again. The metaphor is the body is "texting", then "calling", then "speed dialing". The answer is the entire sequence, but perhaps the question wants the first part. Wait, the question is about the escalating signals, so the answer is the escalating messages (text, call, speed dial). The answer should be "texting, then calling, then speed dialing". But the user wants it in words, so maybe "texting" is part of it, but the full analogy is the progression. Since the question is about the metaphor used to describe escalating hunger signals, the answer is the entire sequence. However, maybe the answer is "texting" as the initial method. Alternatively, the question is looking for "texting" as the first step. Hmm, I'll go with "texting, calling, speed dialing".

Wait, the article says "texting... then calling, then speed dialing." So the answer is "texting, then calling, then speed dialing". The exact terms are the key here. The question wants the technological analogy, so the answer is "texting, calling, and speed dialing".

5. **Question 5**: What exact percentage of daily calories are consumed through late-night snacking? The article says "you might eat a third of your calories snacking after dinner," so the percentage is 1/3, which is 33.3%. But the article says "a third", so the exact answer is "a third" but the question asks for percentage. So 33%. But the article says "a third of your calories", so the answer is 33%.

6. **Question 6**: Which late-night behavior causes the body to digest into morning, leading to excessive snacking? The article states "If you eat or snack close to bedtime, your body could still be digesting from the night before." So the behavior is eating or snacking close to bedtime. The question asks for the specific behavior, so the answer is "eating or snacking close to bedtime".

7. **Question 7**: The expert's recommended weeks to restore hunger signals when eating breakfast consistently? Ivory Loh says "try three weeks of consistently eating something." So the answer is 3 weeks. This is the same as question 1, but the user might have two questions here. Wait, question 1 is about Ivory Loh's recommendation. Question 7 is "reflecting on the professional advice within the article, what is the number of consecutive weeks recommended by one expert to help restore the body’s habitual hunger signals when breakfast is consistently consumed?" The expert is Ivory Loh with 3 weeks. So the answer is 3.

8. **Question 8**: Leftover dish mentioned as acceptable breakfast substitute? The article says "Eat leftover spaghetti and meatballs from the night before." So the answer is "spaghetti and meatballs".

9. **Question 9**: Who is served a formal meal in front of a makeup mirror? The article says "my husband and I serve our high schooler food in front of her makeup mirror, like she's royalty, to make sure she eats." The person is the high schooler (the user's daughter). The answer is "the high schooler" or "her". The article refers to "our high schooler", so the answer is "the high schooler".

10. **Question 10**: Dairy-based ingredient in coffee providing fat? The article says "Coffee can initially suppress your appetite and give you a bit of energy, especially if you drink it with milk, which provides a little fat." The answer is "milk".

11. **Question 11**: Beverage problematic during fasting because it causes burning sugar instead of fat? The article says "True fasting does not permit a glass of orange juice, for example; your body will start burning the sugar instead of fat, negating the goal." So the beverage is "orange juice".

12. **Question 12**: Coconut-based jam for toast? The article mentions Ivory Loh's example: "he usually eats 'a hearty toast' with toppings like cottage cheese or kaya, a coconut jam popular in Southeast Asia." The jam is "kaya".

13. **Question 13**: Registered dietitian associated with a prominent university mentioned in connection with fasting practices? The article says "Ms. Malone, an instructor in the department of nutrition at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine" and "Ms. Malone said. True fasting does not permit a glass of orange juice..." So the expert is Lindsay Malone from Case Western. The question asks for the registered dietitian associated with a prominent university (Case Western is a prominent university). The answer is "Lindsay Malone".

14. **Question 14**: Late-evening practice disrupting rest, leading to snacking? The article says "If you eat or snack close to bedtime, your body could still be digesting from the night before. A pattern forms: You skip breakfast but make up for missed calories later in the day. ... Having your body take on more digestion when it should be resting can lead to worse sleep and weight gain, she added." The practice is "eating or snacking close to bedtime".

15. **Question 15**: Physiological response when coffee's energy fades without addressing hunger? The article says "You start your day, become distracted and don't notice that the coffee boost has worn off. Hours later, you're famished. ... you play catch-up with convenient comfort foods." The response is "famished" leading to overeating. The exact term used is "famished" and then "play catch-up with convenient comfort foods". The question asks for the eventual response, so "famished" or "overeating". The article says "you're famished. ... you play catch-up with convenient comfort foods." The answer is "overeating" but the direct physiological response is "famished". The question says "physiological response", so "famished".

Now, compiling all answers:

1. 3
2. N/A (since the article lists three macronutrients, not two)
3. digesting when it should be resting
4. texting, then calling, then speed dialing
5. 33% (but the article says "a third", which is exactly 33.3%, so maybe "a third" is better? The question asks for percentage, so 33%)
6. eating or snacking close to bedtime
7. 3
8. spaghetti and meatballs
9. the high schooler
10. milk
11. orange juice
12. kaya
13. Lindsay Malone
14. eating or snacking close to bedtime
15. famished

Wait for question 5: The article says "you might eat a third of your calories snacking after dinner," so the percentage is a third, which is 33.3%, so the exact answer is "a third" but the question asks for percentage, so 33.3% or 33%. Since the article says "a third", the exact answer is "a third" but the question wants a percentage. Since it's a third, that's 33%. The article doesn't specify a decimal, so 33% is acceptable.

Question 2: The article says "protein, fiber and fat", so three, but the question asks for two. Therefore, N/A.

Question 4: The answer is the metaphor of texting, then calling, then speed dialing.

Question 14 and 6 are the same answer: "eating or snacking close to bedtime".

Question 15: The physiological response is being famished, which is the hunger feeling leading to overeating. The question asks for the response when the coffee wears off, so "famished".

Now, proceed to format the answers correctly.
