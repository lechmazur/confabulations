Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the given article and answer exactly what's asked. Let me start with question 1.

1. The first question asks which PBS documentary about disability politics led to Cohen's MS diagnosis. The article mentions he was working on a PBS documentary about the politics of disability when he was diagnosed in 1973. The exact title isn't given, but the article says he was helping create a documentary for PBS about the politics of disability. Wait, the article says "a documentary for PBS about the politics of disability" but doesn't name it. Hmm, so the answer might be N/A because the title isn't provided. Wait, the question says "directly led to his initial MS diagnosis." Since the diagnosis happened while he was at PBS, maybe the documentary's name is implied here? The article doesn't state the title, so I think the answer is N/A.

2. The second question: How many years after his father's MS diagnosis did Cohen start experiencing symptoms? The article states Cohen's father had MS, but there's no info on when the father was diagnosed. The article only mentions that his father and grandmother had MS. Since we don't know when his father was diagnosed, this is N/A.

3. Third question: Title of Cohen's third memoir about colon cancer. The article mentions his first memoir is "Blindsided," the second is "Strong at the Broken Places," and the third isn't named. Wait, the article says "subsequent books" but doesn't name a third memoir. So the answer here would be N/A because the third memoir's title isn't provided. Wait, the first book is "Blindsided," which includes his colon cancer. The second is "Strong at the Broken Places," which is about others. The question is about a third memoir focusing on colon cancer? The article doesn't mention a third memoir, so N/A.

4. Fourth question: Which network executive apologized years later for discriminating? The article says Cohen learned years later from "that executive" (the CBS News executive who hired him in 1979) that if he had been honest about his condition, he wouldn't have been hired. The executive didn't apologize, but revealed the truth. The question asks who apologized. The article doesn't mention an apology, so N/A.

5. Fifth question: During which presidential campaign did his eyesight force him to step down. The article mentions he worked on the CBS Evening News in 1988 covering the Bush interview during the presidential campaign. Later, he was ousted over the Bush interview criticism. The article says he left CBS after being removed from his role. The question is about stepping down due to eyesight. The article says his eyesight worsened, but the reason for leaving CBS was being fired over the criticism, not eyesight. So the answer is N/A because the reason for stepping down wasn't due to eyesight but his criticism of Dan Rather.

6. Sixth question: Medical treatment protocol he credited. The article doesn't mention any specific medical treatments he used. It says he lived in denial and didn't let it stop him, but no treatment is named. So N/A.

7. Seventh question: Total Emmys for international conflicts at CBS. He won two Emmys for CBS Evening News reports, but the article doesn't specify if they were for international conflicts. The article mentions he covered Poland, Lebanon, El Salvador. The Emmys were for reports on the Evening News, but the exact number for international conflicts isn't stated. The third Emmy was for a PBS segment. The question is about CBS's international coverage. The article says two Emmys while at CBS, but we can't confirm if both were for international conflicts. So N/A because it's not specified.

8. Eighth question: Name of the prison where they stole the electric chair. The article says he stole the electric chair from an abandoned prison but doesn't name it. So N/A.

9. Ninth question: Which book stayed on NYT bestseller list the longest. The article says "Blindsided" spent several weeks on the list. The other books aren't mentioned regarding their time on the list. Since only "Blindsided" is noted as being on the best-seller list, the answer is "Blindsided: Lifting a Life Above Illness".

10. Tenth question: South African officials' response to his criticism. The article states when he wrote that Western media should leave South Africa, the government sought assurances from CBS that Cohen spoke for himself. So the response was seeking assurances, so the answer is they sought assurances CBS that he spoke for himself.

11. Eleventh question: Network criticized in the op-ed with Dan Rather. The article says the 1987 op-ed (co-written with Rather) warned about CBS News under Tisch. So the network is CBS.

12. Twelfth question: Memoir with a chapter on the electric chair prank. The article says "Blindsided" includes his early life, including the prank. The question is which book includes the chapter on the prank. The answer is "Blindsided: Lifting a Life Above Illness".

13. Thirteenth question: Chronic illness in "Strong..." that mirrored his blindness. The book profiles people with ALS, lymphoma, Crohn's, muscular dystrophy, bipolar. Which of these causes legal blindness? Muscular dystrophy is a muscle disorder. ALS (Lou Gehrig's) can affect mobility but not vision. Maybe none? Wait, the article says Cohen had legal blindness from MS. The question asks which illness in the book mirrored his blindness. The article doesn't mention any in the profiles causing blindness. So N/A? Or perhaps the answer is none, so N/A.

14. Fourteenth question: Emmy Awards for Iran-Contra coverage. The article mentions he won Emmys for Evening News reports but doesn't link any to Iran-Contra. The Iran-Contra interview was part of his criticism, but the Emmy wins aren't tied to that specific event. So N/A.

15. Fifteenth question: CBS executive who hired him in 1979 unaware of MS. The article mentions the executive who hired him in 1979 later told him he wouldn't have been hired if he knew. The name isn't given, so N/A.

16. Sixteenth question: PBS series with Peabody Award alongside Moyers. The article says the 1989 Emmy was for a segment in "The Public Mind With Bill Moyers", which won a Peabody. So the series name is "The Public Mind With Bill Moyers".

17. Seventeenth question: CNN documentary about a presidential candidate. The article says he produced a 1992 CNN documentary about Bill Clinton during his presidential run. So the answer is Bill Clinton.

18. Eighteenth question: Symptom that caused dropping a coffeepot. The article says he noticed numbness in his leg, but the coffeepot dropping is linked to "for no reason," implying an unexpected loss of control. The symptom is likely the numbness or loss of motor control from MS. The article says "I dropped a coffeepot for no reason. I fell off a curb for no reason. I noticed a little numbness in my leg." So the symptom is numbness in the leg, but the dropping was due to an unexplained reason, maybe muscle weakness or numbness. The question asks what symptom led to dropping the coffeepot. The article directly states "numbness in my leg" as a symptom, so that's the answer.

19. Nineteenth question: Columbia degree obtained in 1976. He got a master's from Columbia Journalism School in 1976. The answer is Master's in Journalism.

20. Twentieth question: Cause of acute respiratory failure. Meredith Vieira stated his death was caused by acute respiratory failure. The article says the cause was that, but doesn't specify the underlying reason (like MS complications). The question asks what was the primary cause as stated by her. The article says "acute respiratory failure" was the cause, so that's the answer.
