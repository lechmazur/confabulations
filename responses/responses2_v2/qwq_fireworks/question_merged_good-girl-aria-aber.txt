Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let's start with question 1.

1. The first question asks how many awards Aria Aber won for her poetry collection before writing "Good Girl." The article mentions that Aber's first book was a poetry collection and that she's published "astonishing poems" read many times. But there's no mention of awards. So the answer is N/A.

2. The second question compares Nila's life aspect to Rusty Sabich's challenges. The article says Rusty is in "Presumed Guilty," but the key point here is Nila's desire for self-destruction. The text states her father's disapproval and societal pressures (racism, etc.) as factors. The aspect that fuels her self-destruction would be the pressure to conform to being a "good girl" and facing racism. The question mentions Rusty's challenges but the article doesn't link them directly. Maybe the answer is the political, racial, and socioeconomic forces, but the question's phrasing is tricky. Wait, the question says "mirroring Rusty Sabich's challenges in 'Presumed Guilty'". Since the article only mentions Rusty's new case, but doesn't connect Nila's issues to his, maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, need to check again. The article says Nila's issues include her father's disapproval and racism. Since the question is about what fuels her desire, the answer is the political, racial, and socioeconomic forces. So maybe the answer is "political, racial and socioeconomic forces exceeding her control" but the question wants the aspect that mirrors Rusty's challenges. Since the article doesn't link them, maybe it's N/A. Wait, the article says "Rusty Sabich... is taking on a new case in 'Presumed Guilty.'" The question says "mirroring Rusty Sabich's challenges in 'Presumed Guilty'". Since the article doesn't state what those challenges are, perhaps the answer is N/A. But the question might be trying to link the legal issues, but Nila's problem isn't legal. So N/A.

Wait, maybe I misread. The article says Nila's father is a refugee from Afghanistan and expects her to be a good girl, and she faces racism. The aspect that fuels her self-destruction is her hunger to ruin her life due to those pressures. The question is asking which aspect mirrors Rusty's challenges. Since Rusty's challenges aren't detailed, maybe the answer is N/A. Let me note that and proceed, but maybe I'll come back.

3. The third question asks what type of camera Nila used. The article says she wants to be a photographer but doesn't mention the camera type. So N/A.

4. The fourth question is the year Karim moved to Berlin. The article mentions he's a refugee from Afghanistan and lives in the apartment with swastikas, but no year given. N/A.

5. The Quran story Nila references is about an archangel cutting out the heart to clean it. Han Kang's "We Do Not Part" deals with remembering atrocities. The specific Quran detail is the heart being cut and cleaned. The article says Han Kang explores why atrocities must be remembered. So the answer is the heart being cut out and washed. But the question asks for the specific detail in the Quran story that Han Kang also explores. Since Han Kang's book is about remembering atrocities, the connection might be the idea of cleansing or remembering past sins. However, the Quran story's detail is about the heart, so maybe "the cutting out and washing of the heart" but the article doesn't say Han Kang uses that exact detail. The question says "specific detail in the Quran story... does Han Kang also explore". Since the article only mentions that Han Kang's novel delves into remembering atrocities, but the Quran story's detail is about purification, maybe it's N/A. Alternatively, the article says "the remembrance of atrocities" which could link to the Quran story's idea of cleansing. But the Quran story isn't about atrocities, it's about personal sin. So maybe N/A.

6. The literary magazine in the African publishing renaissance. The article mentions a "new ecosystem... including literary magazines" but doesn't name one. So N/A.

7. The bus's final destination is her home apartment. The article says she rides the bus home to the apartment she shares with her father. So the answer is "the apartment she shares with her father" or just "her father's apartment". The question asks for the destination symbolizing return to being a dokhtare khub. The answer should be the apartment.

8. The name of Nila's boyfriend. The article says she lies to him about her family and he's a dissolute older man, but no name given. N/A.

9. Substance similar to Scott Turow's fictional drug. The article mentions Turow's legal thriller but doesn't mention a drug. So N/A.

10. Original title of the novel before "Good Girl". The article doesn't mention a previous title. N/A.

11. The artistic pursuit she moves to beyond her lifestyle. The article says she moves toward art (photography) and community/political action. The question asks what she embraces, so "photography".

12. The internal fear confessed after a night. The article says she's afraid of being inside her own head when sobering up. So the fear is "being inside her own head".

13. Abbreviated name: She goes by Nila instead of Nilab Haddadi. So "Nila".

14. The symbol defacing the building: swastika graffiti. The article says the building is defaced by swastikas. So "swastika".

15. Father's country: Afghanistan. The article states he's a refugee from Afghanistan.

16. Influential writer referenced for creating spaces for marginalized. The article mentions James Baldwin's quote about making a place to fit. So "James Baldwin".

17. Empathogenic club drug: The article lists MDMA, ketamine, 2C-B, etc. MDMA is an empathogen. So "MDMA".

18. The term for the ideal virtuous daughter: "dokhtare khub".

19. Literary medium before novel: poetry collection. The article says her first book was a poetry collection.

20. Publisher's price: $29 as per the end of the article.

Now going back to question 2. The question says "mirroring Rusty Sabich's challenges in 'Presumed Guilty'". The article says Rusty is taking on a new case in "Presumed Guilty" but doesn't detail his challenges. Since the question links Nila's aspect to Rusty's challenges, but there's no info on what those challenges are, so the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the aspect is her legal issues, but she's not in legal trouble. So N/A.

Similarly, question 5: the Quran story detail is the heart being cut out and washed. Han Kang's novel is about remembering atrocities. The connection might not be direct, so N/A.
