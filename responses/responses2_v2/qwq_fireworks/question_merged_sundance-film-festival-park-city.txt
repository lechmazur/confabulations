Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information given and answer precisely.

1. **Question 1**: Which major film studio executive expressed concerns about Boulder's infrastructure capacity during the Sundance discussions?  
   The article mentions "Others ask whether Boulder has the infrastructure to support a growing festival." But it doesn't name a specific executive. So, N/A.

2. **Question 2**: How many jobs would Cincinnati gain according to the economic impact projections for hosting Sundance?  
   The article states that in Park City, the festival created 1,730 jobs. But there's no info on Cincinnati's job numbers. So, N/A.

3. **Question 3**: What percentage of Park City's art galleries reported increased sales during previous Sundance festivals?  
   The article doesn't mention art galleries' sales percentages. Ryan Williams is an art dealer, but his quote doesn't give a percentage. N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Which former Utah governor lobbied for keeping Sundance within the state's borders?  
   No mention of any governor's involvement. The article talks about local businesses and residents, but no governor. N/A.

5. **Question 5**: What was the average hotel room rate increase in Park City during the 2024 Sundance festival compared to regular ski season rates?  
   The article says "Hotel prices skyrocket," but no specific percentage or figure is given. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: How many screening venues would Salt Lake City need to construct to accommodate the festival's relocation?  
   The article doesn't mention the number of venues required. It just says Salt Lake is a candidate with some events in Park City. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: What transportation improvements did Boulder propose in their bid to host Sundance?  
   No details on Boulder's proposals are provided beyond the question of infrastructure. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Which major corporate sponsor threatened to withdraw if the festival moves to a different state?  
   The article doesn't mention any corporate sponsors threatening to leave. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: What percentage of Handle restaurant's annual revenue came from private Sundance events in the previous year?  
   The article says Handle had 8 private meals during Sundance but no percentage given. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: How many Park City businesses signed the petition opposing the festival's potential move to Cincinnati?  
   The article doesn't mention any petition numbers. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Which local business owner, known for offering luxury ride services during the festival week and mentioned as facing an anticipated 30% decline in annual revenue if the event departs Park City, is referenced in the article?  
   The article mentions Hudson Valeriano as the owner of Rio Transportation, who expects a 30% loss. That's the answer.

12. **Question 12**: How many full-time residents were reported to live in Park City?  
   The article states "Park City, Utah, with 8,200 full-time residents." So 8,200.

13. **Question 13**: Which venue—named in a way that evokes ancient history—is cited as the location where filmgoers were admitted at the start of the festival weekend?  
   The Egyptian Theater is mentioned. That's the answer.

14. **Question 14**: Among the cities considered for hosting the festival's ancillary events while still retaining some presence in Park City, which nearby urban center, only 45 minutes away, is highlighted?  
   Salt Lake City is 45 minutes away and part of the option. So Salt Lake City.

15. **Question 15**: What is the name of the organizational body responsible for the decision to explore alternative locations for the festival, based on the notion that the event has “outgrown” its longtime home?  
   The Sundance nonprofit (the nonprofit behind Sundance) is mentioned. The article says "the nonprofit behind Sundance... announced that it was exploring..." So the Sundance Institute or the nonprofit organization. The exact name isn't given beyond "the nonprofit," but the festival is called Sundance, so maybe just "the Sundance Institute" is acceptable? Wait, the article says "the nonprofit behind Sundance" so the answer is "the nonprofit" but maybe the official name is the Sundance Institute. The article doesn't explicitly name it beyond "the nonprofit," so perhaps the answer is "the Sundance Institute" if that's the known name. Wait, the exact text says "the nonprofit behind Sundance, the pre-eminent festival for independent film held for the past 40 years in Park City, Utah, announced that it was exploring..." The actual name might be the Sundance Institute, which is common knowledge, but the article doesn't state it. Since the question asks for the organizational body based on the article, the article refers to it as "the nonprofit," but perhaps the answer is "the Sundance Institute" as the standard name. Hmm, but according to the instructions, only the article's facts can be used. Since the article doesn't give the name beyond "the nonprofit," maybe the answer is "N/A". Wait, but the question says "based on the notion that the event has 'outgrown' its home." The article says "the nonprofit behind Sundance... announced..." So the organizational body is "the nonprofit" but the exact name isn't given here. Therefore, maybe the answer is "the nonprofit" but the question asks for the name. Since the article doesn't specify beyond "nonprofit," perhaps it's N/A. Wait, the first paragraph says "organizers" and "the nonprofit behind Sundance." The article doesn't give the formal name, so the answer would be N/A? Wait, the question says "the organizational body responsible for the decision," which is the nonprofit. Since the article refers to it as "the nonprofit," maybe that's acceptable. But the question asks for the name. Since the article doesn't provide the exact name beyond "nonprofit," perhaps the answer is "N/A". Alternatively, maybe the Sundance Film Festival's organizing body is the Sundance Institute, which is common knowledge, but the article doesn't state that. Hmm, tricky. The article's exact wording is "the nonprofit behind Sundance." Since the question asks for the name, and the article doesn't give it, the answer should be N/A. Wait, but the question might expect "the nonprofit" as the answer? The instructions say to use only the text. The article says "the nonprofit behind Sundance" so the organizational body is "the nonprofit" but that's not a name. Since the name isn't given, the answer is N/A. But maybe the Sundance Institute is the correct answer. Wait, perhaps the article refers to it as "the nonprofit" but the actual name is known, but according to the instructions, I can only use the article. So since the article doesn't name it, the answer is N/A. Wait, but the first sentence says "organizers" and the nonprofit is the one making the decision. The article's first paragraph says "organizers" but later refers to "the nonprofit." The question is asking for the organizational body's name. Since the article doesn't give the name beyond "the nonprofit," the answer is N/A. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check again. The article says "the nonprofit behind Sundance, the pre-eminent festival..." so the answer is "the nonprofit" but the question wants the name. Since the name isn't provided, N/A. Alternatively, maybe "the Sundance Institute" is acceptable if that's the standard name, but the article doesn't state it. So I'll go with N/A here. Wait, no—the article says "the nonprofit behind Sundance," so perhaps the answer is "the nonprofit organization" but the question wants the name. Since the name isn't given, it's N/A.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The question says "the organizational body responsible for the decision to explore alternative locations for the festival, based on the notion that the event has 'outgrown' its longtime home?" The article says "the nonprofit behind Sundance... announced that it was exploring..." So the nonprofit is the body. Since the question asks for the name, but the article doesn't give it, it's N/A. So answer N/A.

16. **Question 16**: Which restaurateur and caterer, whose business benefited from hosting several exclusive meals during the festival and described the potential permanent departure as “a massive bummer,” is mentioned in the article?  
   Meagan Nash is the one quoted saying "a massive bummer." So her name is the answer.

17. **Question 17**: Which candidate city for relocating the festival—despite concerns about whether its infrastructure can support such an event—is mentioned alongside the possibility of hosting a smaller-scale presence?  
   Boulder is mentioned with the question about infrastructure. The Salt Lake option includes a smaller presence in Park City. Wait the article says "Salt Lake City, just 45 minutes away, along with a smaller presence in Park City; Boulder, Colo.; and Cincinnati." So the cities are Salt Lake (with some in Park City), Boulder, and Cincinnati. The question is which candidate city has concerns about infrastructure. The article says "Others ask whether Boulder has the infrastructure to support a growing festival." So Boulder is the one with infrastructure concerns, and the option with Salt Lake includes a smaller presence in Park City. Wait the question is asking which city is mentioned alongside the possibility of a smaller presence? The article says "Salt Lake City, just 45 minutes away, along with a smaller presence in Park City" — so Salt Lake is part of the option where Park City has a smaller presence. The question is which city (among the candidates) is mentioned with that possibility. The answer would be Salt Lake City, but the question is phrased as "candidate city... mentioned alongside the possibility of hosting a smaller-scale presence." Since the Salt Lake option includes a smaller presence in Park City, then the candidate city is Salt Lake City. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Park City, but the question says "candidate city for relocating the festival"—so the main host would be Salt Lake, but the question is about the city that's part of the option with a smaller presence in Park City. Wait the question says "candidate city... mentioned alongside the possibility of hosting a smaller-scale presence." The Salt Lake option is one of the three, which includes a smaller presence in Park City. So the candidate city is Salt Lake City. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Park City, but Park City is the current location. The three candidates are Salt Lake, Boulder, and Cincinnati. The Salt Lake option includes a smaller presence in Park City, so the city mentioned with that is Salt Lake. So the answer is Salt Lake City. But the question is asking for the candidate city (i.e., the new location) that is mentioned with a smaller presence. Wait the article says "Salt Lake City, just 45 minutes away, along with a smaller presence in Park City" — so Salt Lake is the main, and Park City has a smaller part. So the candidate city here is Salt Lake. The question is which city (among the candidates) is mentioned with that. The answer is Salt Lake City. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the city that has concerns about infrastructure. But the question specifically mentions "alongside the possibility of hosting a smaller-scale presence". So the answer is Salt Lake City.

18. **Question 18**: In the discussion of potential new locations, what characteristic of the political climate in the candidate states was questioned for its compatibility with the festival’s tradition of promoting diverse voices?  
   The article states "considering the states' conservative political leanings don't align with Sundance's commitment to celebrating diverse voices in an inclusive environment." So the characteristic is conservative political leanings.

19. **Question 19**: Which individual, quoted for highlighting the “magic” brought by international diversity during the festival and described as the son of a former mayor, expressed his discontent over the idea of the festival’s relocation?  
   Ryan Williams is the son of a former mayor and said the quoted part about the magic and diversity. So his name is the answer.
