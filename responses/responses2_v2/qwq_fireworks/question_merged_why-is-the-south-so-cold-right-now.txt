Okay, I need to go through each question one by one, making sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question is asking for the consulting firm that employs the atmospheric scientist who believes disruptions to the polar vortex have increased due to climate change. The article mentions Judah Cohen as an author of a 2021 study and that he works at Atmospheric Environmental Research, which is a consulting firm doing climate research. So the answer should be Atmospheric Environmental Research.

2. The second question is about the percentage increase in cold-related deaths specifically in Austin during this week's blast. The article says "at least two deaths related to the cold have already been reported in Austin, Texas." But there's no information on the percentage increase there. The overall U.S. deaths doubled over two decades, but Austin's specific percentage isn't given. So N/A.

3. The third question asks about another transportation disruption in southern Louisiana due to the blizzard warning. The article states the blizzard warning caused grounded flights in Houston and mentions the cold spell could bring heavy snow. The only other disruption mentioned is flights grounded in Houston, but the question is about Louisiana. Wait, the first sentence says the blizzard warning is in southern Louisiana, and besides Houston flights, maybe the article mentions another? Let me check again. The article says "grounded flights in Houston" and "first-ever blizzard warning to southern Louisiana". The question asks for another transportation disruption in Louisiana caused by the blizzard. The article doesn't mention any other specific transportation issues there beyond the blizzard warning itself. Hmm, maybe the article doesn't have that info, so N/A.

4. The fourth question is about what weather phenomenon other than blizzards the NASA director anticipated in Florida and Texas as the planet warms, despite decreasing snow. The article says total snow is expected to decrease, but what else? The article mentions heavy snowfall from Northeast to Gulf Coast, but that's part of the current event. The director's quote is about snow decreasing, but maybe more extreme cold events? Wait, the article says "escalating dangers of plunging temperatures" but the question is about a weather phenomenon other than blizzards. The article doesn't mention other phenomena like ice storms or freezing rain specifically. Hmm, maybe the answer is not present. Wait, the article says "plunging temperatures" but not a specific weather term. Maybe N/A?

Wait, let me re-read the article. The exact quote from Gavin Schmidt is: "What we anticipate is that, as things get warmer, you can expect is a decrease in the total amount of snow over time." The question is asking for another phenomenon besides blizzards that might become more common. The article doesn't mention another phenomenon, so maybe N/A. Wait, but the article mentions cold air outbreaks. The question says "specific weather phenomenon other than blizzards" that would become more common. But the article states that cold outbreaks might be increasing in frequency (per Cohen's study) but Hausfather says severe cold events aren't increasing. Since the question is about what the NASA director anticipated, which is total snow decreasing. The director didn't mention another phenomenon, so maybe N/A. Hmm.

5. The fifth question asks what specific warning the National Weather Service might issue for New Orleans, where snow sticking is rare, beyond blizzard warnings. The article mentions blizzard warnings for Louisiana, but the question is about another type. The article doesn't specify other warnings like frost warnings or something else. So N/A.

6. The sixth question is about the jet stream's direction when it returns to typical pattern. The article says jet stream winds typically blow from west to east. If a traveler is in Austin and caught in the jet stream, the direction would be west to east, so propelled eastward. So answer is eastward.

7. The seventh question asks for a geographical feature, other than the Arctic, that had a similar warming trend. The article says the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the globe. The "rest of the globe" is the answer? But the question specifies a feature. Maybe the Northern Hemisphere? Wait, the article doesn't mention another specific region. The 2021 study links Arctic changes to the jet stream. Maybe the question is expecting "the rest of the globe" but since it's a feature, maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "the Arctic, which is warming twice as quickly as the rest of the globe", so the rest of the globe is the other region. So the answer is the globe. But the question says "geographical feature other than the Arctic itself". So the answer is the globe? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps there's no specific feature mentioned. The article doesn't name another region, so maybe N/A.

Wait, the question says "what specific geographical feature, other than the Arctic itself, experienced a similar, albeit less pronounced, warming trend". The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the globe. So the rest of the globe is the answer. But "globe" is not a geographical feature. Maybe the question expects "Northern Hemisphere"? The article doesn't specify that. The article only mentions the rest of the globe. Since the question says "geographical feature", maybe N/A.

8. The eighth question asks which organization besides Berkeley Earth might disagree with increasing cold outbreaks. The article mentions Zeke Hausfather from Berkeley Earth says cold events aren't robustly increasing. The other side is Judah Cohen from Atmospheric Environmental Research. So the organization that disagrees would be Atmospheric Environmental Research, but the question is asking for an organization that disagrees with the assertion that cold outbreaks are increasing, which Hausfather's group does. Wait, the question says "disagree with the assertion that cold air outbreaks are increasing in frequency". The assertion is made by Cohen. The article says "Dr. Cohen argued in a 2023 study that, since 2000, cold air outbreaks have been increasing in frequency, but not enough yet to be considered a trend." Hausfather from Berkeley Earth says "we just don't see robust increases in severe cold events". So the organization that disagrees with the assertion (that cold outbreaks are increasing) is Berkeley Earth. But the question says "other than Berkeley Earth", so maybe N/A? Wait, the question is phrased as "what organization, other than Berkeley Earth, might disagree with the assertion that cold air outbreaks are increasing... based on the presented data about overall decreasing cold events since the mid-20th century". The data says since 1960s, cold events decreased overall. So any organization that uses that data would disagree. The article mentions Gavin Schmidt from NASA, but he talks about snow. The question is about the frequency of cold outbreaks. The only other person is Cohen's side, but the question is about who disagrees with the assertion (Cohen's view). The answer would be Berkeley Earth. But the question says "other than Berkeley Earth", so maybe N/A? Wait, maybe the answer is NASA? No, the article doesn't say NASA's stance on cold outbreaks. The only other is the article's own data: since the overall trend since 1960s is decreasing, then any organization using that data would disagree. But the question is asking for an organization besides Berkeley Earth. The article doesn't mention another organization with that view. So perhaps N/A.

9. The ninth question asks what weather event preceded the current blast, which residents in Louisiana recall as last significant snow. The article says "The last time I remember it snowing was right before Katrina in 2004, but it wasn't anything significant. It hit the ground and melted." So the answer is the snowfall before Katrina in 2004.

10. The tenth question asks beyond cold outbreaks, what other climatic shift did Cohen predict from the warming Arctic. The article mentions the 2021 study by Cohen suggests changes in the Arctic could be stretching the polar vortex and making the jet stream wobbly, leading to more disruptions. The question is about another shift besides cold outbreaks. The answer might be the wobbly jet stream or changes in weather patterns. The article says "escalating dangers of plunging temperatures" but the question is for another shift. The article states the study links Arctic changes to the jet stream's wobbliness, so maybe the answer is increased jet stream wobbliness or altered jet stream patterns. The question says "long-term climatic shift directly related to warming Arctic", so "changes in the jet stream's stability" or "more wobbly jet stream". But the exact wording in the article: "changes in the Arctic... could be stretching the polar vortex and making the jet stream more wobbly." So the answer is a more wobbly jet stream.

11. The eleventh question is which study by Cohen contradicts the overall trend of decreasing cold events since 1960s by saying cold outbreaks increased since 2000. The article states "Dr. Cohen argued in a 2023 study that, since 2000, cold air outbreaks have been increasing in frequency, but not enough yet to be considered a trend." So the study is the 2023 study. But the question says "contradicting the overall national trend since the mid-20th century" (which is decreasing). The 2023 study by Cohen is the one that says since 2000, there's an increase. The 2021 study was about the jet stream. So the answer is the 2023 study.

12. The twelfth question asks how the article reconciles Hausfather's view (no increase in severe cold) with CDC data on doubling deaths. The article says Hausfather says "we just don't see robust increases in severe cold events" but CDC data shows deaths doubled. The article doesn't explicitly reconcile them, but maybe the answer is that the article presents both facts without direct reconciliation. The question might expect "N/A" since it's not addressed. Wait, the article states that deaths have doubled, but Hausfather says severe cold events aren't increasing. The article might suggest that even if events aren't increasing, their impact could be worse (like more vulnerable populations or other factors). But the question is how the article reconciles them. The text doesn't explicitly do that, so N/A.

13. The thirteenth question asks about contradictory evidence regarding climate change and snowfall. The article mentions total snow decreasing (Schmidt) but the current event has heavy snow. So the contradiction is between decreasing total snow over time vs. current heavy snow events. The answer would be that while total snow is expected to decrease, individual heavy snow events can still occur. But the question is phrased as contradictory evidence. The article states both: "total snowfall is also expected to decrease" but the current event has heavy snow. So the answer is that while total snow is expected to decrease, extreme snow events like blizzards can still happen, which is a contradiction between long-term trends and individual events. The exact answer might be "extreme snow events can still occur despite decreasing total snowfall".
