Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article provided.

1. **How many years did it take for Willis Freeman to travel from South Carolina to Massachusetts with Old Mo after Moses inscribed the hidden message?**  
   The article mentions Willis carried Old Mo with him on his "dangerous escape to freedom," but doesn't specify the time taken. So, N/A.

2. **What prestigious international award did Soh Freeman win for his photograph of his daughter, Ebby, after Baz's death?**  
   Wait, the article says Ebby was in a bloodied photo that won an international award. But it's Ebby's father, Soh? Wait, the text says: "a photograph of young Ebony in bloodied clothing won an international award." The article doesn't mention who took the photo. The question assumes Soh took it, but the text doesn't say that. So the answer is N/A because it's not stated who took the photo.

3. **What legal precedent did Isabella 'Sojourner' Bliss Freeman set, given her top honors at both universities and her career as an attorney?**  
   The article states she's an attorney and has top honors but doesn't mention any legal precedent she set. So N/A.

4. **What was the name of the head of the banking family that Henry Pepper, the rising young star, belonged to?**  
   Henry is from "an old banking family," but the name isn't given. So N/A.

5. **Besides the Freemans and the Blisses, what other family is mentioned as owning land in Massachusetts since the 1600s?**  
   The article says both Freeman and Bliss families owned land since the 1600s. The question asks for another, but none are mentioned. So N/A.

6. **In what year did Martin Oldham, the owner of the pottery and brickworks, pass away, leaving Moses to carve "MO" on Old Mo?**  
   No year is provided for Oldham's death. N/A.

7. **What natural disaster prompted Ebby to flee Connecticut for the French countryside?**  
   The text says she fled after her public breakup with Henry, not a natural disaster. So N/A.

8. **What specific military rank did Willis Freeman achieve during his escape to freedom?**  
   The article doesn't mention any military rank for Willis. N/A.

9. **What innovative farming technique...**  
   The article doesn't discuss farming techniques. N/A.

10. **What was the title of the first book Charmaine Wilkerson published before "Black Cake"?**  
    The article states "Black Cake" was her 2022 debut, so there was no first book before that. Thus, N/A.

11. **Original purpose of Old Mo before secret messages?**  
    The article says it was a 20-gallon stoneware jar made by Moses. The original purpose would be for storage, but the text doesn't specify beyond that. Wait, maybe the article says it was crafted by an enslaved potter for the pottery works. The original purpose as a stoneware jar would be functional, like storage. But the question might need a specific answer. The article doesn't state another purpose, so perhaps N/A? Wait, the article says "the Freemans read the 'MO' as Moses' 'veiled reference to himself.' Inspired by a hidden message Moses inscribed on the bottom of Old Mo, his fellow laborer Edward 'Willis' Freeman... carried the jar with him on his dangerous escape to freedom. In the home Willis later made with his wife and children in Massachusetts, Old Mo became a community repository for secret messages..." So before it was used for messages, it was a functional jar. But the question asks for the original purpose. Since the article doesn't state a different original purpose beyond being a jar made by Moses, maybe the answer is N/A, unless "stoneware jar" counts, but that's the object itself, not its original use. The question might be expecting "storage" but the article doesn't specify. So N/A.

12. **How does Henry's family business connect to Old Mo's origins?**  
    The text doesn't link Henry's banking family to Oldham's pottery. So N/A.

13. **Explicit evidence that Moses carved his own initials?**  
    The article states that the Freemans read "MO" as Moses' reference to himself, implying it was his initials. The explicit evidence given is that he inscribed his own initials under the lip, possibly for his owner Martin Oldham, but the family interprets it as Moses'. So the answer is "The Freemans read the 'MO' as Moses' veiled reference to himself."

14. **Agricultural crop central to Oldham's pottery?**  
    The article mentions Oldham's pottery and brickworks relied on enslaved people. No crop is mentioned as central. N/A.

15. **Secondary character who witnessed Baz's murder?**  
    The article doesn't mention any witness. N/A.

16. **Soh Freeman's profession before being a mother/volunteer?**  
    The text says she's an attorney. So her profession was attorney. Wait, the question says before becoming a full-time mother and volunteer. The article says "attorney and mother. Lifelong volunteer." So maybe attorney is her profession. The answer is "attorney."

17. **Number of generations using Old Mo for messages?**  
    The article says "six generations in Ebby's family, both enslaved and free" and that Willis started it. If Willis is the first, then up to Ebby's generation would be 6 generations actively using it. So the answer is 6.
