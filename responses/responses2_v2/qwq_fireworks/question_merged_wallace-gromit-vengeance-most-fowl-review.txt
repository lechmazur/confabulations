Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not anything else. Let me start with the first question.

1. How many years did Feathers McGraw spend in prison between "The Wrong Trousers" and his escape in this new film?  
The article mentions that Feathers was sent to a zoo after the 1993 short "The Wrong Trousers," and the new film is "Vengeance Most Fowl" which is part of the latest release. Since the article says it's been nearly two decades since "The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" (2005), but the new film isn't dated. However, the question is about the time between 1993 and his escape now. The article doesn't specify the exact years, so maybe N/A? Wait, but the article says "Feathers was sent to the slammer... in this case a zoo... plots a new illegal venture." It doesn't give a specific time frame between 1993 and the new film. So answer N/A.

2. Which character first discovers that Norbot has been reprogrammed by Feathers McGraw to carry out the heist?  
The article says Gromit peruses the morning paper, but doesn't mention who discovered the reprogramming. The text says "after Wallace and Gromit helped snare him... Feathers plots a new venture that draws in Wallace, Gromit, Norbot..." but doesn't specify who first noticed. So N/A.

3. What was the name of Wallace's failed invention business venture that led to his financial troubles mentioned in the morning paper?  
The article mentions Wallace frets over bills, but the text says "the Wallaby Street house now resembles a Rube Goldberg funfair. Wallace is chuffed by his latest creation..." There's no mention of a named failed business venture. N/A.

4. During which season does the main action of "Vengeance Most Fowl" take place, as evidenced by the garden scenes?  
The article says Norbot is a garden gnome and the movie's start has "amusing, shadowy start" but no season is mentioned. The garden scenes might imply spring/summer, but the text doesn't specify. N/A.

5. What book was Gromit reading when he first noticed suspicious activity around Norbot?  
The article says Gromit reads "Crime and Punishment" by Fido Dogstoyevsky, but when he first notices? The text doesn't specify the exact moment. N/A.

6. How many previous Wallace and Gromit films are referenced by name in Chief Inspector Mackintosh's case files?  
The article mentions "The Wrong Trousers" and "The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" by name. If the case files reference these, but the text doesn't say how many are in the case files. N/A unless explicitly stated. The article says "reunites Wallace and Gromit with an old adversary from 'The Wrong Trousers'", so maybe 1? But the case files might have more. The article doesn't specify, so N/A.

7. What type of cheese does Wallace offer to Norbot during their first interaction?  
No mention of cheese offered here. The article mentions Wallace likes toast with tea, but not cheese in this context. N/A.

12. Which previous Wallace & Gromit film is directly referenced as the inspiration for Norbot's garden gnome design, aside from "A Grand Day Out"?

13. In which scene does Wallace’s fingerprint visibly appear on Norbot’s circuitry, highlighting the stop-motion animation’s tactile authenticity?  
The article mentions "I don't remember seeing any fingerprints dotting their forms this time around" so no fingerprint on Norbot. Answer N/A.

14. What is the name of the second magazine featured in Practical Inventor’s cover line alongside "Mad Scientist Monthly," as part of Wallace’s reading material?  
The article says "Incorporating Mad Scientist Monthly" on Practical Inventor's cover. So the magazine's name is Practical Inventor. The question asks for the second magazine, but only one is mentioned. N/A.
