Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. 

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions the expanded voucher program but doesn't specify which school districts saw the highest percentage increase in private school enrollment. It says about 20,000 students will be eligible next year, but no data on percentage increases is given. So answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The text states that Trump's executive orders on immigration led Lee to add the immigration bill. However, there's no mention of how many Republican legislators cited these orders as their reason. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The flood relief funding is mentioned as "millions of dollars" but the exact amount isn't specified. The article doesn't give a total dollar figure. Answer N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The article says Democrats questioned whether private schools would meet public standards, but there's no list of schools that agreed to this. No specific schools named, so N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The existing sanctuary city policies are already illegal, but the article doesn't state how many officials were charged before. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The requirement is that half the students must be low-income or have disabilities. The question asks about the budget percentage, but the article doesn't mention budget allocation percentages for disabilities specifically. Answer N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The article mentions some districts opposed the expansion but doesn't say any changed their stance to get bonuses. The $2000 bonuses require districts to pass a resolution affirming participation. No number given, so N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The new immigration office works with federal authorities but the criteria for prioritizing cases aren't detailed. No info, so N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The Senate passed with 20 votes. Assuming a simple majority, total senators? The article doesn't specify the total number in the Senate. Without knowing total, can't calculate opposition. Answer N/A.

12. **Question 12**: The first year is $350M, but the article says costs will increase annually. However, it doesn't provide a five-year total. N/A.

13. **Question 13**: The requirement for bonuses is passing a resolution affirming participation in the voucher program. The answer is passing such a resolution.

14. **Question 14**: Half of the students must be from low-income or have disabilities. So 50%.
