Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article provided. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question is asking about the Hawaiian spiritual guide who influenced Ray's teachings before his appearance in "The Secret." The article mentions that Ray spoke of lessons from a Peruvian shaman and a Hawaiian spiritual guide. But it doesn't give the name of either. Since the name isn't provided, the answer should be N/A.

2. Next, how many participants completed "Spiritual Warrior" before 2009? The article says he presented it several times, but there's no number given. So N/A here.

3. The consulting firm after Covey's influence. The text says he founded Quantum Consulting. That's directly stated, so answer is Quantum Consulting.

4. The month when "Harmonic Wealth" hit the NYT list. The article mentions it was published in 2008 and reached the list, but the specific month isn't given. So N/A.

5. Temperature monitoring system in the sweat lodge. The article doesn't mention any specific system used, so N/A.

6. The church denomination of Ray's father in Oklahoma. The article says his father was a preacher, but doesn't specify the denomination. So N/A.

7. Fasting time before the sweat lodge. The article mentions extended fasting but no exact minutes. N/A.

8. The Peruvian shaman's name. Again, the article just mentions a Peruvian shaman without a name. N/A.

9. Entry-level session cost. The article says he had a hierarchy of courses, with Spiritual Warrior at $10,000, but doesn't mention the entry-level price. N/A.

10. Average attendance after Oprah. It says his crowds went from hundreds to thousands after Oprah, but no average number given. N/A.

11. Sweat lodge dome material. The structure was a round wood frame covered in tarps. So the primary material is tarps.

12. Permanent disabilities from the incident. The article mentions 21 taken to hospital, 3 died, but doesn't say how many had permanent disabilities. N/A.

13. Celebrity endorsing after release. The article says he was upfront discussing the event and agreed to be interviewed but doesn't mention another celebrity endorsement. N/A.

14. Father's self-help book title. The article says Gordon Ray was a preacher, and James was inspired by his charisma, but no book title is mentioned. N/A.

15. Native American tribe's practices. The article doesn't specify any particular tribe, just refers to sweat lodge as a general spiritual practice. N/A.

16. Hours in the lodge before collapse. The article states participants spent hours in the sweat lodge, but exact hours before collapse aren't given. N/A.

Alright, I think that covers all questions. Let me double-check each to ensure I didn't miss any details.
