Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by skimming through the questions again to see what each is asking for, then refer back to the article for each.

1. **Question 1**: The percentage increase in market value Nvidia had over two years. The article says "revenue has jumped more than 200 percent to $126 billion, while the total value of the company has rocketed 700 percent as of Friday's market close, peaking at $3.62 trillion in November." Wait, the question asks for the market value increase, not revenue. The 700% increase in total value (market value) over two years is mentioned. So the answer should be 700%.

2. **Question 2**: The AI system that caused Apple to lose top position to Microsoft last year. The article states, "Last year, Microsoft replaced Apple as the world's most valuable company for its early push into A.I." The system mentioned as Apple's recent one is Apple Intelligence, but the question is about what caused Apple to lose before that. The article mentions "OpenAI, which has been on a yearslong money-raising frenzy, is said to be in talks with the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an investment of up to $25 billion." But the key point here is that Microsoft's AI push caused them to overtake Apple. The system that made Microsoft top might be related to their AI efforts, but the question specifies the system that caused Apple to lose. Wait, actually, the article says "Last year, Microsoft replaced Apple as the world's most valuable company for its early push into A.I." So the AI system's name isn't mentioned here. Wait, but the next part says "Nvidia surged past both companies to claim the crown." Maybe the system isn't named here. Wait, the question is about the system that caused Apple to lose to Microsoft. The article says Microsoft's early push into AI, but the specific system name? The article mentions ChatGPT as OpenAI's, but Microsoft uses that. However, the question asks for the name of the AI system that caused Apple to lose. Since the article doesn't name it, maybe it's N/A. Wait, the article says "Microsoft replaced Apple as the world's most valuable company for its early push into A.I." So maybe the answer is the AI push itself, but the question asks for the system's name. Since the article doesn't specify a system name here, perhaps N/A. Wait, but the article mentions "ChatGPT" as OpenAI's, which Microsoft uses. Maybe that's the key. The article says OpenAI's release of ChatGPT in late 2022 was a key point. So maybe ChatGPT is the system that led to Microsoft's push. But the question says "the name of the AI system that caused Apple to briefly lose its top market position to Microsoft last year?" The article says Microsoft's early push into AI caused it. But the system's name is ChatGPT? The article says "OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022." Since Microsoft partnered with OpenAI, maybe the system is ChatGPT. But the article doesn't explicitly say that ChatGPT was the system responsible for Microsoft overtaking Apple. Hmm, tricky. The question might be expecting ChatGPT here, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the article mentions another system. Let me check again. The article says "the maker of ChatGPT" which is OpenAI. The article's exact quote is: "Microsoft replaced Apple as the world's most valuable company for its early push into A.I." The AI system's name isn't given here. So maybe the answer is N/A? But the article might imply that the push was due to ChatGPT. Since the user instructions say to answer exactly as per the text, and the text doesn't name the system, I should put N/A here. Wait, but the question might be a trick. Let me check again. The article says "Nvidia surged past both companies to claim the crown. But there are signs that it may not hold that position for long." Wait, the question is about the system that caused Apple to lose to Microsoft. The article doesn't name the system, so the answer is N/A. Wait, but the article says "for its early push into A.I." without specifying a system. So I have to go with N/A here.

3. **Question 3**: The trade show where Huang made his statement. The article says "At the CES technology trade show in January, Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, said..." So the answer is CES.

4. **Question 4**: The total revenue over two years. The article states "revenue has jumped more than 200 percent to $126 billion" so the total revenue is $126 billion.

5. **Question 5**: The investment amount OpenAI is seeking from SoftBank. The article mentions "OpenAI, which has been on a yearslong money-raising frenzy, is said to be in talks with the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an investment of up to $25 billion." So $25 billion.

6. **Question 6**: The peak market value in November. The article says "peaking at $3.62 trillion in November." So the answer is 3.62 (trillion).

7. **Question 7**: The research firm with CEO Daniel Newman. The article says "Daniel Newman, chief executive of Futurum Group, a tech research firm." So Futurum Group.

8. **Question 8**: The capability Apple disabled. The article says "this month, it disabled one of the signature capabilities -- aggregating and summarizing news notifications -- after customers and companies complained that its software was misrepresenting news reports." So the answer is aggregating and summarizing news notifications.

9. **Question 9**: Percentage decrease in August. The article says "It (Nvidia's stock) had been volatile and tumbled in August by more than 10 percent over reports the company would delay shipping its newest artificial intelligence chip." So the answer is 10%.

10. **Question 10**: The Chinese company is DeepSeek, as per the article's title and mentions.

11. **Question 11**: The Chinese startup is DeepSeek again.

12. **Question 12**: The percentage drop in share price was 17%, as stated in the first paragraph.

13. **Question 13**: The market share for specialized chips is 90%.

14. **Question 14**: The concept is Scaling Laws. The article says "the concept known in the industry as Scaling Laws has begun to fall out of favor."

15. **Question 15**: The month when Huang made his statement was January (from CES in January).

16. **Question 16**: The organization seeking SoftBank's investment is OpenAI.

17. **Question 17**: The peak valuation was $3.62 trillion.

18. **Question 18**: The first semiconductor company mentioned after DeepSeek's impact was Broadcom, as the article lists "Broadcom, Micron Technology and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Inc."

19. **Question 19**: The organization whose chatbot caused Nvidia's growth is OpenAI (ChatGPT's release in late 2022 led to Nvidia's rise).

20. **Question 20**: The tech giant that regained lead with AI for smartphones is Apple, but the article says "Apple is back in the lead after it released its own A.I. system called Apple Intelligence for iPhones." Wait, the question asks which company's launch caused Apple to regain the lead over Nvidia? Wait, the article says "Apple is back in the lead after it released..." So the system was Apple's own, so the answer is Apple's AI system, but the question is about the company that launched it. The question says "which tech giant’s launch of an AI solution for smartphones..." so the answer is Apple. But the question is phrased as "which tech giant’s launch..." so Apple is the answer.
