Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me read through the questions again and then check the article for each answer.

1. **Question 1**: How many dollars did Gaiman give Katherine Kendall to pay for therapy? The article mentions that Gaiman gave her $60,000. The location is Raleigh, but the question specifies "volunteering at one of his book events in Raleigh, N.C." The article says she met him in Asheville, but the question says Raleigh. Wait, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check again. The article states Katherine Kendall was in Asheville, N.C., but the question says Raleigh. The article's correction at the end says she lives in Raleigh, not Asheville. Wait, the article says she met him in Asheville, but her current residence is Raleigh. The question says she was volunteering in Raleigh. Since the article says she met him in Asheville, the question's premise might be wrong. So the answer would be N/A because the location in the question is incorrect. Wait, but the question says "who he met while she was volunteering at one of his book events in Raleigh, N.C." The article states she met him in Asheville. Therefore, the question's premise is incorrect. Therefore, answer N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The bookstore in Wichita, Kansas, whose owner decided to keep selling Gaiman's work but not promote heavily. The article mentions Watermark Books in Wichita, owned by Sarah Bagby. The other bookstore was Curious Iguana in Frederick, Md. So the answer is Watermark Books.

3. **Question 3**: Besides "American Gods" and "The Graveyard Book," another work by Gaiman published by DC Comics. The article mentions DC Comics published "The Sandman," so that's the answer.

4. **Question 4**: Amanda Palmer's spouse's profession. The spouse is Michael Chabon, who is a writer. The article says "the married writers Ayelet Waldman and Michael Chabon hosted Gaiman's wedding." So his profession is writer.

5. **Question 5**: City where Kendra Stout filed police report. The article says she filed a police report in October. The exact city isn't mentioned, only that she had a UTI incident in 2007. The question asks where she filed, but the article doesn't specify the city. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Podcast by Tortoise Media where accounts surfaced. The article says "accounts began to surface last summer, when multiple women came forward on a podcast produced by Tortoise Media." The name of the podcast isn't given, so answer N/A.

7. **Question 7**: What amount did Gaiman offer Stout? The article mentions he gave Kendall $60k to "make up some of the damage," but for Stout, the article doesn't mention an amount. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Accuser who described the "culture of secrecy" and mentioned promotional events as hunting ground. The article quotes Katherine Kendall as saying, "Neil's works were his bait, and promotional events were his hunting ground," so she's the one. The question says "who met him in Asheville" â€“ yes, she did. So answer Katherine Kendall.

9. **Question 9**: Magazine that published the article by Lila Shapiro. The article starts by mentioning New York magazine, so that's the answer.
