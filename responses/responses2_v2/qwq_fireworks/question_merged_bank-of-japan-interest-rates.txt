Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions beyond what's written.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks for the percentage increase in base pay during the 2023 shunto negotiations. The article mentions that Japan's largest business group agreed to the biggest wage increases since 1991, but it doesn't specify the exact percentage. Since the exact number isn't provided, the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The second question is about how many consecutive quarters of GDP growth Japan had before the March 2023 rate hike. The article states that private consumption picked up in recent quarters after a prolonged slump that stretched across the previous four quarters. Wait, but the timing here might be tricky. The March 2023 hike is mentioned, but the slump was four quarters before the recent pickup. However, the exact quarters before the rate hike aren't clearly stated. The article says the economy shrank by 0.2% in 2024, but that's after the rate hikes. Since the text doesn't specify the quarters before March 2023, I think this is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Asks which industries showed the strongest wage growth due to negative rates. The article mentions that negative interest rates were implemented in 2016 but doesn't specify which industries responded most. The text talks about "zombie" companies but not their industries. So N/A here.

4. **Question 4:** Total government bonds and corporate debt purchased during QE from 1999-2024. The article says the Bank bought more bonds and debt to flood markets, but no total amount is given. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Number of zombie companies eliminated after the rate increase. The article suggests higher rates might weed them out, but there's no specific number. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Governor Ueda's projected productivity growth rate. The article quotes Ueda talking about economic growth and deflation chances but doesn't mention productivity growth rate numbers. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Demographic cohort with highest consumer spending increase after 2023 wage hikes. The text doesn't specify any particular demographic group. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Percentage of businesses passing on import costs to consumers. The article states officials encouraged companies to pass on higher import prices, but no percentage is given. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Months for private consumption to recover post-negative rates. The article mentions a prolonged slump across four quarters before recent pickup, but exact months since negative rates started (2016) aren't calculated here. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Proportion of largest corporations exceeding wage recommendations. The article says the largest agreed to the biggest increases but doesn't state a proportion exceeding recommendations. N/A.

Hmm, I need to check each again to ensure I didn't miss any details. Let me scan through the article again quickly.

For question 1, the article says "the biggest wage increases since 1991" but no percentage. So yes, N/A.

Question 2: The article mentions "private consumption... picked up in recent quarters after a prolonged slump that stretched across the previous four quarters." The rate hike in March 2023 would be part of the timeline, but the four quarters of slump are before the pickup. However, the question is about the number of quarters of growth before the hike. Since it was a slump (negative growth) before, the growth quarters prior might not be mentioned. The article doesn't state consecutive growth quarters before the hike, so N/A.

All others seem to not have specific numbers. So all answers are N/A except maybe none. Wait, let me check again for question 10. The article says "Japan's largest business group agreed to the biggest wage increases since 1991" but doesn't mention exceeding recommendations. So N/A.

Alright, all answers are N/A except maybe I missed something? The article does say "the largest wage increases since 1991" but that's the context for the shunto, but the percentage isn't given. So yes, all answers are N/A.
