Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks which French team Wembanyama played for when he scored his first 50-point NBA game against the Wizards. The article mentions he was with the San Antonio Spurs when he scored 50 points against the Wizards. Since the Spurs are an NBA team, the French team he played for before the NBA would be Metropolitans 92, but the question specifies the NBA game. Wait, the first 50-point game was in the NBA with the Spurs. So answer is San Antonio Spurs? Wait, but the question says "French basketball team" when he played the game. Wait, no—the game was in the NBA, so he was with the Spurs. But the question says "French team", so maybe it's a trick? Wait, no. The article says he was with the Spurs when he scored 50 points. The French team was Metropolitans 92, but that's before the NBA. The question is about his NBA game, so the answer must be N/A because the Spurs are not a French team. Wait, the question is phrased as "when he scored his first 50-point NBA game against the Washington Wizards?" The team he was on during that NBA game was the Spurs. Since the question is about the French team he was on during that game, which he wasn't, so the answer is N/A.

Wait, no. Wait the first 50-point NBA game was with the Spurs, so the French team isn't involved here. The question might be a trick. So answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many coefficients? The article says Wembanyama mentioned the word "coefficients" during his whiteboard analysis. But the exact number isn't stated. The question is how many coefficients he included. Since it's not specified, answer N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Primary reason Chris Paul learned French? The article says Chris Paul is learning French via Duolingo "so he can try to speak to Wembanyama in his native language." So the reason is to communicate with Wembanyama. The agents didn't cite this; the text says Paul's reason. The question says "according to Wembanyama's agents"—but the article doesn't mention agents citing that reason. The agents are mentioned in a different context (declining offers). So the answer might be N/A because the agents didn't state that reason. Wait, the question says "according to Wembanyama's agents"—but the article says Paul's reason is to speak to him. The agents didn't say that. So answer N/A.

4. **Question 4:** How many local players did he defeat? The article mentions he played a few games in the park but doesn't specify the number of players defeated. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Percentage increase in social media engagement in France? The article states his jersey increased Spurs' popularity in France "dramatically" but doesn't give a percentage. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Which NBA veteran did Barcode consult? The article mentions Kyle Kuzma was a co-founder of Barcode. So the answer is Kyle Kuzma.

7. **Question 7:** Mathematical formula? The article says he plotted ideas for three theoretical players (A, B, C) and suggested a graph over a chart. But the formula isn't named. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Number of favorite fantasy novels? The article says he loves reading fantasy novels but doesn't specify how many. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Total value of declined deals? The article mentions he turned down millions but doesn't give a total. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** European legend he credits? The article mentions Dirk Nowitzki, Giannis, Jokic, etc., but no mention of Wembanyama crediting any of them. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Numerical ranking? The article says he became the first player in NBA history to have those stats in 100 games. So the answer is 1st.

12. **Question 12:** Visual representation he decided on? The article says he suggested a graph instead of a chart and bar graph. Wait, the initial system used a chart ranked by makes. He thought a graph (maybe line graph) would be better, including week-to-week changes. The question says after rejecting a bar graph. The article says he wanted a graph instead of a chart. So the answer is graph.

13. **Question 13:** Final score of exhibition game? The article mentions the two games combined 73 points, but not individual scores. N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Model of car? The article says Medjana's tiny Smart car. So Smart.

15. **Question 15:** French luxury brand? Louis Vuitton is mentioned. Answer is Louis Vuitton.

16. **Question 16:** Location in NYC park? The article says southwest corner of Washington Square Park. Answer is southwest corner.

17. **Question 17:** Dollar amount offered? The article mentions $1 million for an hour, but it was an offer his agents declined. So $1,000,000.
