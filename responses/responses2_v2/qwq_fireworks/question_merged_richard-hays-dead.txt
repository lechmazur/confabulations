Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let's go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The first part asks which Yale faculty member introduced Hays to theological concepts influencing his views. The article mentions William Sloane Coffin as the chaplain at Yale who influenced him. So the answer should be William Sloane Coffin.

2. **Question 2:** Years after diagnosis to finish the book. The article says his cancer was discovered in 2015, and the book was published in September 2023 (since he died in Jan 2024). So 2023 - 2015 = 8 years. But wait, the diagnosis was in 2015, and the book was written as he knew he was dying. The article says he died in Jan 2024, so the manuscript was completed in 2023. So 8 years. But the exact time from diagnosis (2015) to completing the book (2023) is 8 years. So answer 8.

3. **Question 3:** The Bible passage cited in 1996 book. The article mentions Paul's speech in Romans about women practicing "unnatural" intercourse and men consumed with passion. So Romans 1:26-27.

4. **Question 4:** Denomination's conference where he announced his change. The article doesn't mention a specific conference. It says he wrote in his last book and spoke at a gathering in Dallas (Baptist News Global account), but that's not a denomination's conference. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** N.T. Wright's response to 2023 reinterpretation. The article says Wright praised the 1996 book but doesn't mention his response to the 2023 book. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Female theologian whose work he credited. The article doesn't name any specific female theologian. It mentions his son co-authored the book. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Total LGBTQ students in his classes. The article says he got to know gay students but doesn't give a number. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Oklahoma City church for final sermon. The article mentions he had a conversion experience at an Oklahoma City church, but the final sermon's location isn't specified. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Copies of the 1996 book used in seminaries. No numbers given. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Medical treatment for remission. The article says he and his wife read Psalms nightly during treatment. It doesn't specify the protocol. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Yale faculty who praised then denounced. The article mentions R. Albert Mohler from Southern Baptist, not Yale. N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Unpublished manuscript title. The article doesn't mention any unpublished manuscript. N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Years after retiring to collaborate with daughter. The book was co-authored with his son Christopher, not daughter. The article says he retired in 2018 and the book was published in 2023. So 5 years, but since the collaborator is his son, the answer is N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Old Testament prophet cited. The article mentions Ephesians but not an Old Testament prophet. N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Christopher B. Hays' position at Emory. The article says Christopher is his son but doesn't mention his position. N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Nashville Methodist congregation endorsing him. Not mentioned. N/A.

17. **Question 17:** Lecture series title at Southern Baptist. The article doesn't mention this. N/A.

18. **Question 18:** Dissertations supervised on Romans 1:26-27. No number given. N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Psalm verse in final sermon. The article mentions Psalm 118. So Psalm 118.

20. **Question 20:** Honorary doctorate from Louisville. Not mentioned. N/A.
