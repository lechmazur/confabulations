Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions that the live show drew a few hundred viewers and later thousands on YouTube. It doesn't specify the exact number before winning the award, so the answer is N/A. Wait, actually, the question is about the viewers before winning the prize. The article says "a few hundred viewers (and later, thousands on YouTube)" so maybe the live had a few hundred. But the question is about how many tuned in to watch the live performance on YouTube before winning. The answer would be "a few hundred" but the question might want a number. Since it's "a few hundred" and not exact, maybe N/A? Hmm. The instructions say if it's not a precise number, then N/A. The article says "a few hundred" which is approximate, so exact number not given. So answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The article states Oosterveen played Polonius. There's no mention of him originally planning to play another role before switching. The text says "Crane (who plays Hamlet) and Oosterveen (Polonius)", so maybe they didn't switch roles. The question says "originally planned to play before switching roles" but there's no info on role switches. So answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The article says Sam Crane was inspired by his son's YouTube gaming videos. It doesn't mention a specific channel name. So answer is N/A.

4. **Question 4:** They recorded hours of gameplay, including an interpretive dance routine. The article says "hours" but not how many. Since the number isn't specified, answer is N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The Vinewood Bowl's architecture modifications? The text mentions they used the Vinewood Bowl as the site but doesn't say they altered it. So answer is N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The article doesn't mention any scenes cut due to platform limitations. It says they had a rocket launcher interruption but not a cut scene. Answer N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The pandemic lockdown period when they developed the concept. The article says 2021. So duration? It just says during a 2021 lockdown, but how long? The article doesn't specify the duration, so N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The professional voice actor for Ophelia? The article doesn't mention who played Ophelia, only that some were strangers or trained actors. No name given. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Time of day for "to be or not to be" soliloquy. The article says Grylls looked at light changes but doesn't specify the time. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Takes required for the blimp jump. The article mentions "determining how best to jump from a building onto a blimp" but doesn't say how many takes. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The Vinewood Bowl is modeled after the Hollywood Bowl. The primary filming location's real-life venue is the Hollywood Bowl. So answer is Hollywood Bowl.

12. **Question 12:** The in-game event that disrupted the performance, causing deaths except the blimp pilot. The text says "the blimp exploded and everybody died, but apart from that, everything was OK". So the event was the blimp explosion.

13. **Question 13:** The award recognizing NPC use. The article mentions they won the innovation award at the Stage Awards. But does it specify that the award was for using NPCs? The article says "innovation award" and mentions NPCs as silent witnesses. The question asks which award recognized that technical innovation. Since the Stage Awards innovation prize is the one they won, that's the answer.

14. **Question 14:** How did the dance choreography influence Hamlet staging? The article says they experimented with a dance routine first, which might have influenced their approach. But the text doesn't explicitly state how. The article says "they began experimenting, recording hours of their gameplay... After a YouTube video... gained traction, they decided to run with Hamlet." So maybe the experimentation led to confidence or techniques, but the article doesn't specify the influence. So N/A.

15. **Question 15:** The real-world theater company in Chicago with RSC. The last paragraph says Royal Shakespeare Company is working with Chicago Shakespeare Theater. So answer is Chicago Shakespeare Theater.

16. **Question 16:** Why did Crane miss his wife's birthday? The article says Grylls confronted him after he skipped her birthday because of online rehearsals. So the reason is online rehearsals for the production.

17. **Question 17:** The platform for the livestream commentary. The article says they did a livestream commentary of a soccer game on a casino rooftop, and a YouTube video gained traction. So the initial platform was their own livestream (maybe Twitch? But the article doesn't say the name of the platform, just mentions YouTube later). The question is which platform initially hosted? The article says "livestream" but doesn't name it. So N/A.

18. **Question 18:** Live viewers at the final performance. The article says "a few hundred viewers (and later, thousands on YouTube)". So the live had a few hundred, but exact number isn't given. N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Aspect of the game environment for contemplative tone. The article says Grylls looked at light, landscapes, and NPCs. The answer is "light and how it changed, all the different landscapes and also the nonplayable characters" but needs to be concise. The question asks what aspect, so maybe "lighting and NPC presence" but the exact phrase from the text is "the light and how it changed, all the different landscapes and also the nonplayable characters". The answer is "light, landscapes, and NPCs" but the article's exact wording: "looking at the light and how it changed, all the different landscapes and also the nonplayable characters". So the aspect is the light, landscapes, and NPCs. The answer should be "light, landscapes, and nonplayable characters" but the question asks "what aspect", so the key aspect mentioned is the light and NPCs. Alternatively, the answer is "light and how it changed" and "nonplayable characters" but the exact answer as per the text's emphasis on "the light and how it changed, all the different landscapes and also the nonplayable characters". The question asks "what aspect of the game's environment did... emphasize to create a contemplative tone?" The answer would be "light, landscapes, and non-playable characters" but maybe the primary one is light. Wait, the article says "looking at the light and how it changed, all the different landscapes and also the nonplayable characters" so the aspects are light, landscapes, NPCs. The answer should be those three elements. But the question might want the main one. The article says "the light and how it changed" is part of what she looked at. The answer is "light and how it changed" but the question might want the exact terms. Alternatively, the answer is "lighting effects and non-playable characters" but the article says "the light and how it changed, all the different landscapes and also the nonplayable characters". The answer should be the combination, but the question asks for "aspect", so maybe the key elements are light and NPCs. However, the exact answer is the three aspects mentioned. Since the question is about the aspect she emphasized, the answer is "light, landscapes, and non-playable characters". But need to check the exact wording. The article states: "looking at the light and how it changed, all the different landscapes and also the nonplayable characters". So the answer is "light, landscapes, and non-playable characters".
