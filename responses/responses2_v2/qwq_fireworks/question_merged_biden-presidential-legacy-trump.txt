Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information given and strictly answer each question as per the instructions. Let's start with the first question.

1. **Question 1:** Which Republican senator led the bipartisan effort with Biden to pass the infrastructure bill that ultimately failed due to Trump's intervention?

Looking through the article, the infrastructure section mentions that Biden "forged a bipartisan agreement in the most partisan of eras." However, the part about the failure due to Trump's intervention refers to the immigration deal, not the infrastructure bill. The infrastructure bill passed, so the question might be mixing up details. The article doesn't name a specific Republican senator leading the infrastructure effort. It just says he got Republican votes. Since there's no name provided, the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many Afghan civilians were successfully evacuated during the final 48 hours of the U.S. withdrawal from Kabul airport?

The article mentions the chaotic withdrawal and the Taliban taking over, but there's no specific number given for evacuees in the final 48 hours. The text only states that 13 U.S. troops died in a suicide bombing and images of Afghans chasing planes were embarrassing. No numerical data here, so N/A.

3. **Question 3:** What was the total dollar amount of weapons shipments halted by Biden to Israel during the Gaza conflict?

The article says Biden "halted a weapons shipment" at one point but doesn't specify the amount. Since the exact dollar figure isn't provided, the answer is N/A.

4. **Question 4:** During which month did Hunter Biden's presidential pardon occur, leading to Democratic backlash?

The article states that Biden pardoned his son Hunter, but the exact month isn't mentioned. It only says he did so despite vowing not to. Month not specified, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** What percentage of Biden's infrastructure projects were completed by the time he left office?

The infrastructure section mentions that many projects were still pending, but no percentage is given. The answer is N/A.

6. **Question 6:** How many classified documents did the special counsel investigation discover in Biden's Delaware home?

The article says the special counsel investigation resulted in no criminal charges but doesn't mention the number of documents found. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** What was the monthly reduction in illegal border crossings after Biden implemented his executive actions in the final summer?

The article states that after Biden used executive power, illegal crossings fell to levels even lower than when Trump left office. However, it doesn't provide a specific monthly reduction percentage or number. Hence, N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Which European NATO member country's prime minister first proposed Sweden and Finland's joint admission during Biden's presidency?

The article mentions Biden expanding NATO to admit Sweden and Finland but doesn't specify which country's prime minister first proposed their joint admission. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** How many times did Biden and Netanyahu speak directly during the 72-hour period before the final Gaza ceasefire agreement?

The article discusses the ceasefire but doesn't mention the number of direct conversations between Biden and Netanyahu in that timeframe. Answer is N/A.

10. **Question 10:** After Biden's fumbling performance at the June debate, what specific type of authoritarian rule, similar to the one in Afghanistan, did Biden accuse Trump of wanting to impose on the United States?

The article says Biden accused Trump of wanting to be a dictator, referencing Trump's talk about being a dictator on Day 1. The specific type mentioned is "dictatorship," so the answer is dictatorship.

11. **Question 11:** In light of the bipartisan agreement on infrastructure, how many acres of land were shielded in the two national monuments created in Nevada during Biden's final days?

The article states that Biden created two national monuments in California, not Nevada, shielding over 800,000 acres. Since it's Nevada vs California, the answer is N/A.
