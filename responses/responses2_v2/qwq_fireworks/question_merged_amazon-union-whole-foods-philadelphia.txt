Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and answer strictly based on that. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks which former Amazon warehouse worker now in produce initiated the union drive. Looking through the article, there's a mention of Ed Dupree in the produce department who worked at an Amazon warehouse. Also, Ben Lovett is mentioned as leading the organizing. Wait, the question specifies "former Amazon warehouse worker who now works in produce". Ed Dupree is in produce and previously worked at an Amazon warehouse. Ben Lovett might be the leader, but the question is about the former warehouse worker in produce. So Ed Dupree is the answer.

2. **Question 2**: How many Whole Foods stores in Philadelphia got the pay raise except the unionizing one? The article says the union accused Whole Foods of excluding the store's employees from a pay raise given to "all its other workers in the Philadelphia area". So "all other" implies that except the one store, so the answer is "all other" but the question asks for a number. Wait, maybe the question is how many stores? The article doesn't specify the total number of stores in the area, just says "other workers", so the answer might be N/A. Wait, the union says they excluded the store's employees from a raise given to "all its other workers in the Philadelphia area". So the number is all except that one store. But the question is how many stores? Since the article doesn't state the total number of stores in the area, it's N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The budget surplus amount before Amazon's acquisition. The article mentions a program that offered a portion of the store's budget surplus was scrapped, but the exact amount isn't given. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The union rep who filed the NLRB complaint. The article states that UFCW Local 1776 filed the charges, so the representative would be Wendell Young IV, since he's the president mentioned. The question asks who filed, so the answer is UFCW Local 1776, but the question specifies the "union representative", so Wendell Young IV.

5. **Question 5**: Percentage of 300 workers who signed cards. The article says "a majority" signed, but doesn't give a percentage. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Higher starting wages demanded compared to $16. The article says workers want higher starting wages above $16, but doesn't specify by how much. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: When Khy Adams first applied. The article says she had wanted to work there for years when she got the job in August. But no exact application date is given. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Previous health insurance rate for part-time workers. The article says part-time workers lost the ability to buy health insurance, but it doesn't state the previous rate. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Other Philadelphia grocery chains unionized by UFCW. The article doesn't mention other chains, only Whole Foods and Amazon's other sectors. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Number of unfair labor charges filed. The article says "filed unfair labor practice charges" (plural?), but it mentions at least one (the terminated employee). But maybe only one charge? The question is about how many. The article says "unfair labor practice charges" (plural) but only one example is given. Since it's plural but not quantified, maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing Whole Foods of firing an employee..." and also mentions the pay raise exclusion. So maybe two charges? But the exact number isn't stated. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Which union rep accused management of unfair treatment regarding the pay raise. The article says Wendell Young IV (president of UFCW 1776) said, "They're treating them differently." So the answer is Wendell Young IV.

12. **Question 12**: Employee who fulfills online orders and stopped wearing a pin. Audrey Ta is mentioned as fulfilling online orders and stopped wearing her union pin. So Audrey Ta.

13. **Question 13**: Long-tenured employee wanting to restore profit-sharing. Rob Jennings has worked there nearly two decades and mentioned wanting to bring back the scrapped program. So Rob Jennings.

14. **Question 14**: Produce worker with Amazon warehouse background believing union could rebalance power. Ed Dupree is in produce, worked at Amazon warehouse, and the quote about chipping away at Amazon's power. So Ed Dupree.

15. **Question 15**: Political figure appointing NLRB counsel hindering unions. The article mentions President Trump appointing a new NLRB general counsel. So Donald Trump.

16. **Question 16**: Benefit still offered to part-time workers. The article says part-time workers get in-store discounts and 401(k). So either one. The question asks for "which one", so the answer is "in-store discounts and a 401(k) plan" but the question might want one, but since both are mentioned, perhaps list both? But the question says "which one of the benefits", so pick one. The article lists "other benefits like in-store discounts and a 401(k) plan", so either is correct. Since the question is phrased to pick one, maybe "in-store discounts" or "401(k) plan". The answer should be both, but since it's a list, maybe "in-store discounts" as the first one mentioned? Wait, the question says "which one of the benefits", so perhaps it's expecting both? But the answer format requires a single answer. The article says "like in-store discounts and a 401(k) plan" so the answer would include both, but the question asks for "which one", so maybe it's N/A? Wait no, the question says "which one of the benefits", so the answer is "in-store discounts and a 401(k) plan". But the instructions say to answer in sentence fragments or words. Maybe the answer should be "in-store discounts and 401(k) plan".

17. **Question 17**: Which agency received the charges? The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).

18. **Question 18**: Labor organization representing the workers. The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Local 1776.

19. **Question 19**: Corporate acquisition that led to changes. Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017.

Now, let me check each again for accuracy.

1. Ed Dupree is correct as the former warehouse worker in produce.

2. The article says "accusing the chain of excluding the store's employees from a pay raise that had been given this month to all its other workers in the Philadelphia area." So "all other workers" implies all other stores in the area. But how many stores? Since it's not specified, the answer is N/A because the question asks for a number of stores, not "all others".

3. N/A, no amount given.

4. UFCW Local 1776 filed, but the question asks for the representative. The president is Wendell Young IV.

5. Majority, not percentage. N/A.

6. No amount specified. N/A.

7. No application date given. N/A.

8. No rate mentioned. N/A.

9. No other chains named. N/A.

10. The article mentions two charges? The firing and the pay raise exclusion. So maybe two charges. But the text says "filed unfair labor practice charges" (plural) but doesn't specify the number. Since it's plural but not counted, maybe N/A? Or the answer is "2" but the text doesn't say. So N/A.

11. Wendell Young IV.

12. Audrey Ta.

13. Rob Jennings.

14. Ed Dupree.

15. President Trump.

16. The benefits are "in-store discounts and a 401(k) plan". Since the question asks for "which one", but there are two, but the answer should list both as they are the benefits mentioned. The question might expect both, but the instructions say if the question asks for two and only one is given, answer N/A. Here the question asks "which one of the benefits", so perhaps it's expecting one, but both are listed. Maybe the correct answer is "in-store discounts and 401(k) plan".

17. NLRB.

18. UFCW Local 1776.

19. Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017.
