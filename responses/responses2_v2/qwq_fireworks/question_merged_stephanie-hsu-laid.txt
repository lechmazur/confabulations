Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which New York theater company Stephanie Hsu performed with before moving to LA. The article mentions she was in New York for 11 years and worked on "Nora From Queens," but there's no mention of a theater company. So N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many episodes of "Laid" were completed before the writers' strike? The article says the strike happened, causing Hsu to waver, but doesn't mention episode count. N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The farm's name where she learned sustainable agriculture. The article states she worked on a farm in college but doesn't name it. N/A.

4. **Question 4:** When did she start the Chilly Willies club? The article says she has a club with friends but no date. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Temperature threshold for winter swimming. The article mentions swimming in January but no specific temp. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Copies of "Emergent Strategy" bought. It says she bought "stacks" but not exact numbers. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Duration of white rice abstinence. She mentions a "period" before the pandemic but no duration. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Character in "Nora From Queens." The Daniels directed an episode she was in, but her role isn't named. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Month she got the call from Khan about "Laid." No specific month given. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Years between Oscar nom (2023) and leaving NY during Covid. She left during Covid (2020), so 2023-2020=3 years? Wait, the article says she moved out during Covid, which started in 2020. The nomination was in 2023, so 3 years. But need to confirm. The article says she moved during Covid, so maybe 2020, so 3 years passed until 2023. Answer: 3?

11. **Question 11:** Title of the work about community organizing. The book is "Emergent Strategy" by Adrienne Maree Brown. The question is answered directly here.

12. **Question 12:** Artistic duo from Queens that made her go to LA. The Daniels (Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert) directed her in "Nora From Queens," leading her to LA. So answer is the Daniels.

13. **Question 13:** Comedian who encouraged her about Khan. Ali Wong recommended working with Khan, so Ali Wong.

14. **Question 14:** Club name for winter plunges. The club is Chilly Willies.

15. **Question 15:** Metropolis contrasting Hollywood. She mentions New York where you're valued even if nobody. So New York.

16. **Question 16:** Fate of the protagonist's exes in "Laid." The premise says all exes are dying. Answer: dying.

17. **Question 17:** Poorly handled communication. She's bad at texting, wants a landline. So texting.

18. **Question 18:** Years in NYC that valued individuals. She lived there 11 years.

19. **Question 19:** Internal quality she ignites in January. The quote: "Even if it's January, I will find the fire in me to do it." So "fire."

Wait, checking each again for accuracy.

For question 10: The Oscar nomination was in 2023. She left NYC during the pandemic (Covid started in 2020, so she left around then). The question asks how many years between the nomination and her leaving. Wait, the question is phrased as "how many years passed between Hsu's Academy Award nomination and her decision to leave New York during Covid?" The nomination was in 2023, leaving was during 2020. That would be negative, but the question is the time between the two events. Since the nomination was after leaving, it's impossible. Wait, the article says "in 2023 for 'Everything Everywhere All at Once.'" She moved out during the pandemic (2020), so the years between 2020 and 2023 is 3 years. But the question is between the nomination (2023) and her leaving (2020). The time between is 3 years, but the order is nomination after leaving. The question might be phrased as "how many years passed between the nomination and her decision to leave," which would be negative, but since the article says she left during the pandemic (2020) and the nomination was 2023, the correct answer is 3 years between the events, but the question's wording might be tricky. However, the exact answer is the time between her leaving (during pandemic, say 2020) and 2023 is 3 years. So answer 3.
