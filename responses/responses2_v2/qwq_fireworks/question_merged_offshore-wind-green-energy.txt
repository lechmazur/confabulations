Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information in the text and answer exactly what's asked without adding any extra details. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks which European country's government recently acquired Vestas. The article mentions Vestas as a Danish wind turbine maker but doesn't say any government acquired them. So the answer is N/A.

2. Equinor's renewable division profit in Q4 2024? The article states Equinor had a $100 million loss in renewables that quarter. So the increase would be negative, but the question is about an increase. Since it's a loss, maybe the answer is N/A because it's a loss, not an increase.

3. Percentage of Orsted's East Coast projects remaining after Trump's policies. The article says they backed away from some projects but are still committed to two in New York and Rhode Island. However, there's no percentage given, so N/A.

4. Stock value increase in Danish krone after CEO replacement. The article says Orsted's stock had fallen over 50% but rose on the day of the announcement. However, no specific amount is given, so N/A.

5. Total value of canceled US projects leading to Errboe's appointment. The article mentions write-offs leading to the CEO change but doesn't specify the total value. So N/A.

6. Major tech company partnering with Orsted for data centers. The article doesn't mention any tech company partnering, so N/A.

7. Interest rate threshold that triggered withdrawal from NJ. The text mentions higher interest rates as a factor but doesn't specify a threshold. N/A.

8. GW capacity of Vestas's US onshore orders for 2025. The article states orders through this year and next but no specific GW number. N/A.

9. Market share Equinor gained after investing in Orsted. The article says Equinor bought 10% of Orsted but doesn't mention market share gained. N/A.

10. US state's regulatory changes causing largest write-off. The write-offs are linked to projects off New Jersey and NY, but the largest isn't specified. Maybe New Jersey? The article says they backed away from NJ projects. Let me check. The article says "delays, inflation and higher interest rates" led to backing away from some projects, notably NJ. The write-off is mentioned in the context of those projects. So maybe New Jersey? The question asks which state's regulatory changes caused the largest write-off. But the article says the write-off was due to those projects being abandoned. However, regulatory changes aren't specifically tied to a state here. The Trump administration's stance is mentioned as complicating NY and RI projects, but the write-off might be from NJ projects. The article says "the fourth quarter of 2024" loss was due to write-offs from those projects. Since the NJ projects were abandoned, perhaps New Jersey's regulatory issues? The question states "regulatory changes," but the article says "President Trump's aversion" as a factor. Since the write-off is from abandoned projects, maybe the state is New Jersey. But the question is about the regulatory changes causing the largest write-off. The article doesn't explicitly link it to a specific state's regulations, but the projects off NJ were part of the write-off. So I'll go with New Jersey. Wait, but the write-off is because they backed away from projects, not necessarily due to a state's regulatory change. The article says "delays, inflation and higher interest rates" caused them to back away from NJ projects. The regulatory changes mentioned are from the Trump administration affecting NY and RI. Hmm, this is tricky. The write-off is from the abandoned projects, which were in NJ. So maybe the answer is New Jersey. But the question is about regulatory changes. The article doesn't explicitly state that NJ's regulations caused it, but maybe the Trump policies are federal. The question says "US state's regulatory changes," but the Trump policies might be federal. Since the article doesn't specify a state's regulatory changes leading to the write-off, perhaps the answer is N/A. Let me check again. The write-off is from the projects they backed away from, notably NJ. The reasons for backing away were delays, inflation, interest rates. The regulatory changes (Trump's stance) affected NY and RI, but the write-off is from the NJ projects. Since the question is about regulatory changes in a state causing the write-off, and the write-off was due to other factors (not state regulations), maybe the answer is N/A. So I'll put N/A here.

11. Stock price increase after Equinor's investment. The article says Orsted's stock had declined but rose on Thursday (when Equinor's investment was mentioned). But no percentage is given. The article mentions Equinor bought a 10% stake in October, and Orsted's stock rose on the day of the CEO announcement (which was after the investment). The exact percentage isn't stated, so N/A.

12. Alternative energy Equinor's CEO suggested was better. The article says Equinor's overall earnings came from oil and gas in Norwegian waters. The CEO mentioned the energy transition is slower, so maybe oil and gas. The question is what alternative energy source was performing better. Since oil and gas are traditional, not alternative, but the answer might be oil and gas. The question specifies "alternative energy source," so maybe N/A because oil and gas aren't alternative. Hmm, the question might be looking for something else. The article says Equinor's earnings were from oil and gas, so the CEO might suggest those are performing better. But the question asks for an alternative energy source, so perhaps N/A.

13. Number of projects Orsted committed to after abandoning NJ. The article says they're still committed to completing two projects off NY and RI. So the answer is 2.

14. Regulatory hurdle related to the blood filter treatment. The article mentions a start-up's unproven blood filter in Antigua, but that's unrelated to offshore wind projects. The question is mixing two different parts of the article. Since the blood filter part is separate, there's no connection, so N/A.

15. Vestas' revenue in billions of euros. The article says Vestas had 6.1 billion euros in revenue. So 6.1.

16. Equinor's spending reduction in billions. The article says Equinor cut spending from $10B to $5B, so reduction is $5B.

17. Type of on-shore facility driving Vestas' orders. The article mentions land-based wind farms for uses like data centers. So on-shore wind turbines or land-based wind farms. The exact term from the text: "land-based wind turbines".

18. Equinor's adjusted earnings from Danish waters? Wait, the article says "largely from oil and gas in Norwegian waters" giving adjusted earnings of $7.9 billion. The question mentions Danish waters, but the text says Norwegian. So the answer is N/A because it's Norwegian, not Danish.

19. Percentage of Orsted Equinor acquired in October. The article states Equinor acquired a 10% stake in October. So 10%.
