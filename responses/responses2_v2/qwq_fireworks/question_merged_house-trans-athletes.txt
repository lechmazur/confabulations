Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly as per the instructions. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. The first question asks which state's representative argued that the legislation would prevent radical leftists from dismantling Title IX by referencing their recognition of more than two genders. Scanning through the article, I remember a part where Greg Steube is mentioned. He said something about the radical left dismantling society's core by recognizing more than two genders. His state is Florida. So the answer is Florida.

2. The second question is about the percentage of Trump's ad budget on transgender issues. The article states that Trump spent over $37 million, nearly 20% of their ad budget. So the answer is 20%.

3. The third question is which Democrat who voted "present" had previously abstained. The article mentions Don Davis of North Carolina voted "present," and he didn't vote on it last year. So the answer is North Carolina.

4. The fourth question asks how many transgender NCAA athletes Bonamici cited. The text says 10, so that's straightforward.

5. The fifth question is about the Republican who introduced a bathroom measure. That's Nancy Mace from South Carolina.

6. The term Democrats used to rebrand the bill was "Child Predator Empowerment Act."

7. The judge who struck down Biden's efforts was in Kentucky, so the answer is Kentucky.

8. The question about how many Democrats who supported the bill previously voted against it. The article says Henry Cuellar opposed it last year, so that's one. The answer is 1.

9. The former Division I female athlete is Lori Trahan from Massachusetts.

10. The enforcement mechanism Republicans mentioned was birth certificates. Walberg said they'd check birth certificates.

11. The ruling by Kentucky's judge affected Biden's plans, so the answer is Kentucky.

12. Walberg's enforcement method was birth certificates again, so same as question 10.

13. The number of Democrats who joined Republicans: two (Cuellar and Gonzalez), so 2.

14. The Congresswoman incorrectly described was Lori Trahan. The article corrects that she's the only female Division I athlete, not just any.

15. The campaign with $37M on ads was Trump's 2024 campaign.

16. The alternative name is "Child Predator Empowerment Act."

17. The law they claimed to reinforce was Title IX.

18. The Texas Democrat who switched was Henry Cuellar.

19. The Representative who called it a "mean, cruel, bullying tactic" was Jim McGovern.

20. The measure on bathrooms was introduced by Nancy Mace.

Wait, let me check each again to ensure accuracy. For question 8, the question says "how many Democrats who supported the bill in the House had also voted against it during the previous Congress?" The article says Cuellar opposed it last year, so he's one. The other two (Gonzalez and Davis) didn't vote before. So the answer is 1. 

Question 18: The Texas-based Rep who opposed before but supported now is Cuellar. Yes.

Everything else seems correct. I think that's all.
