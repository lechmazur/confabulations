Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **First question**: The total value of Claire's paintings sold at the 2013 exhibition. The article says Francois Pinault bought all her work at the show, and the next morning her life changed. But the article doesn't mention the total value. However, later it mentions a painting sold for $870,000 in 2021, but that's a different time. So this question's answer is N/A.

2. **Second question**: The cathedral's name. The article clearly states it's Notre-Dame. So answer: Notre-Dame.

3. **Third question**: Number of children in the modified painting. The article says she modified a painting of children with blue-gray paint, but doesn't specify how many. So N/A.

4. **Fourth question**: The Paris gallery where she first exhibited. The article mentions she was at Ecole des Beaux-Arts and Cooper Union, but not a specific gallery name. N/A.

5. **Fifth question**: Month in 2023 Macron visited. The article says he signed off during a visit in 2023, but no month is given. N/A.

6. **Sixth question**: Biblical scene the finalists depicted. The committee asked them to paint the Pentecost. So answer: Pentecost.

7. **Seventh question**: Years she worked as a telemarketer. The article says she worked as a telemarketer in Paris before her breakthrough, but doesn't specify how many years. N/A.

8. **Eighth question**: Price of the miners painting. The article mentions a painting of debutantes sold for $870k, but not miners. N/A.

9. **Ninth question**: Specific chapel for "tongues of fire". The article says the windows are for six of seven chapels, but doesn't name the chapel for that scene. N/A.

10. **Tenth question**: Kamala Harris's recommendations. The article says she toured damage but doesn't mention her recommendations. N/A.

11. **Eleventh question**: Material for sketches. The article says she used plexiglass for her sketches. Answer: plexiglass.

12. **Twelfth question**: Color in sketches. The competition required neutral white light, so maybe white? But the question asks for a color like ash. The article says she used ink on plexiglass, but the ash-like streaks were from blue-gray paint on another piece. The sketches might use different colors, but the competition's mandate was white light. Not sure, maybe N/A?

Wait, the question says "what color reminiscent of the ash-like streaks... did she use in her sketches". The ash was from blue-gray paint on the children's painting, but the sketches for the windows were on plexiglass with ink. The article says the ink displayed differently, but the committee required "respect the beautiful, neutral white light". So maybe the color was white? Or N/A because the ash was on another painting. Hmm. Probably N/A.

13. **Thirteenth question**: Fellowship for New York study. She was an exchange student at Cooper Union. So answer: Cooper Union.

14. **Fourteenth question**: Initial proposed biblical theme. The article says the committee assigned Pentecost, but no mention of another theme. N/A.

15. **Fifteenth question**: Other medium considered. The article says she considered a contemporary touch but doesn't mention other mediums. N/A.

16. **Sixteenth question**: Tree symbolizing resilience. The article doesn't mention any specific tree. N/A.

17. **Seventeenth question**: Psalm number for "tongues of fire". The article mentions the Pentecost and a biblical sentence, but no specific psalm. N/A.

18. **Eighteenth question**: Architectural element from her studio. No info on her studio's damage affecting the design. N/A.

19. **Nineteenth question**: Insurance regulator's name. The article mentions California's top insurance regulator, but no name. N/A.

20. **Twentieth question**: Technique from modeling days. She modeled for art classes and worked as a telemarketer. The technique related to press might be something else. The article says she used a press to transfer designs. Maybe "modeling" isn't a technique. Wait, the question asks what technique she used in early modeling work. But she was a model, so maybe that's not a technique. The press technique is part of her current work. The question is about what she did before her breakthrough. The answer might be N/A, but maybe "modeling" is the answer? The question says "technique reminiscent of the press", so maybe "modeling" isn't it. Hmm. The article says she used a press for transferring designs. The question asks what she used in early modeling work. Since she was a model, maybe that's not a technique. So N/A.

Wait, the question says "technique reminiscent of the press used for transferring her designs to paper, did Tabouret employ in her early modeling work..." So maybe she didn't use a press in modeling. The modeling was just posing. So N/A.
