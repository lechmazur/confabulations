Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to go through each question carefully and make sure I only use the information given in the article. I'll start with the first question.

1. **Dosage of lamotrigine for the author of "Hell Gate Bridge"**: The article mentions Barrie Miskin wrote the memoir "Hell Gate Bridge." It says she took lamotrigine (Lamictal) along with restarting her antidepressant. But the article doesn't specify the dosage. So the answer should be N/A.

2. **Fourth symptom on Cambridge Depersonalization Scale**: The article lists examples like feeling like a robot, losing bodily sensations, and a flat world. The fourth one isn't listed in the text. The article says there are 29 items, but only three examples are given. So N/A.

3. **Defense mechanism from cannabis use**: Dr. Simeon mentions that D.D.D. can be a defense against intolerable experiences. The question asks if the author of "Please Stop..." used cannabis instead of hallucinogens, what mechanism would be triggered. The article says Mr. Abugel's episode was triggered by pot leading to panic. So the defense mechanism is dissociation as a response to panic/anxiety. The answer would be dissociation, but the exact term used in the article is "defense system" or "detaching." The article says "part of the mind's defense system." So answer: defense mechanism (dissociation).

Wait, the question is asking for the defense mechanism term. The article states: "Researchers have hypothesized that depersonalization/derealization might be part of the mind's defense system." So the defense mechanism is the mind's defense system, which is dissociation. The answer should be "dissociation" as the mechanism. But the question says "according to Dr. Simeon," so maybe "defense system" or "detachment." Let me check again. The exact quote: "Your body and your mind are telling you something... You're having an intolerable experience, essentially, from which you then have to detach." So the mechanism is dissociation/detachment. The answer is "dissociation" or "detachment." The article uses "detaching" so maybe "detachment." Alternatively, the defense mechanism is "dissociation." The question says "defense mechanism... triggered, leading to a similar outcome as Mr. Abugel's." Since his was triggered by pot causing panic, the mechanism is the same as Dr. Simeon's explanation. The answer should be "dissociation."

4. **Years between editions of "Feeling Unreal"**: First edition 2006, second in 2023. 2023-2006 = 17 years. The co-author is Dr. Simeon and Jeffrey Abugel (the wellness coach). So 17 years.

5. **Psychoanalyst's comparison**: Elena Bezzubova compared the condition to seeing an apple that feels unreal but known to be real. The aspect is the "painfully aware" awareness that something is wrong. The question asks what the psychoanalyst compared it to. The answer is "the experience of seeing an apple that seems unreal, despite knowing it is real."

6. **Life stressor other than divorce**: The article says "multiple triggers... like panic, depression, terrible divorce." The question asks for another stressor besides divorce. The text mentions "major life stressors" as a trigger. Examples given are panic, depression, divorce. The question wants another one. The article says "major life stressors" as a general category. So possible answers could be "major life stressors" but that's too broad. Wait, the example given for Mr. Abugel: his first episode was panic, then depression, then divorce. The question asks for another stressor besides divorce. Since the article lists "major life stressors" as a possible trigger, but not specific ones, maybe "depression" or "anxiety"? But the question is asking for a different one from the initial triggers. The article says "multiple triggers... particularly if there is an underlying propensity." The exact triggers listed are panic, depression, divorce. So the answer would be "depression" but that's already mentioned. Alternatively, "untreated depression" like Barrie's case. Wait the question says "other than a terrible divorce, might trigger a recurrence in someone who initially had panic." The article says "if there is an underlying propensity... first episode triggered by panic, then depression, then divorce." So the other stressor besides divorce would be depression or anxiety. The question says "other than a terrible divorce," so the answer is "depression" or "anxiety." The article specifically mentions "depression" as a trigger. The answer is "depression."

7. **Medication besides seizures**: The pregnant woman (Barrie Miskin) restarted antidepressants and took lamotrigine. The question asks for the other medication besides the one for seizures (lamotrigine). The answer is "antidepressant."

8. **Memoir title in same month as Saab's novel**: Alana Saab's novel came out in June. The memoir is Barrie Miskin's "Hell Gate Bridge," published last June. So the title is "Hell Gate Bridge."

9. **Jeffrey Abugel's profession**: He is a health and wellness coach.

10. **Primary treatment for bipolar and dissociative symptoms**: Lamotrigine is used for bipolar and seizures. The pregnant woman took it for dissociative symptoms. So the answer is "lamotrigine."

11. **Substance linked to Abugel's decade-long episode**: Pot (cannabis).

12. **Number of categories in Cambridge Scale**: The article says 29 different experiences. The examples given are three, but the question is about the number of categories. Wait, "29 different experiences" are evaluated. The question says "distinct experiential categories," but the article just says 29 items. So the answer is 29. But the question says "as illustrated by the examples provided." The examples given are three, but the article states 29. So answer is 29.

13. **Neurological condition sharing treatment**: Lamotrigine is for seizures and bipolar. The article mentions it's used for seizures and bipolar. So the answer is "bipolar disorder."

14. **Sensory alteration during pregnancy**: Barrie had visual changes (halo effect, blurring vision). The article mentions "bright lights enveloped objects in a halo, blurring her vision." The symptom related to derealization is the visual distortion. The answer is "blurred vision" or "halo effect around lights." The question asks for the sensory alteration correlated with environmental detachment. The article says "the outside world was changing, too: In her neighborhood... bright lights... blurring vision." So the answer is "blurred vision."

15. **Psychological mechanism for DPD**: Dr. Simeon's evolutionary basis is the mind's defense against intolerable experiences. The article says it's part of the defense system to detach. The answer is "dissociation as a defense mechanism against intolerable experiences" or "detachment as a defense mechanism." The exact quote: "part of the mind's defense system... You're having an intolerable experience, essentially, from which you then have to detach." So the mechanism is dissociation as a defense.

16. **Demographic at risk due to historical factor**: The article says D.D.D. is often associated with "a history of emotional abuse or neglect." So the answer is "those with a history of emotional abuse or neglect."

Now let me check each answer again:

1. N/A (dosage not mentioned)
2. N/A (only 3 examples given)
3. Dissociation (or "detachment")
4. 17 (2023-2006)
5. "the experience of seeing an apple that seems unreal, despite knowing it is real"
6. Depression
7. Antidepressant
8. Hell Gate Bridge
9. Health and wellness coach
10. Lamotrigine
11. Cannabis
12. 29
13. Bipolar disorder
14. Blurred vision (or "halo effect" but the article says "blurring her vision")
15. Dissociation as a defense mechanism against intolerable stress (or "detachment from intolerable experience")
16. Those with a history of emotional abuse or neglect

Wait for question 15, the exact term is "defense system" but the mechanism is dissociation. The answer should be "dissociation" or "detachment as a defense mechanism." The article says "defense system" so maybe the answer is "dissociation as part of the mind's defense system." But the question asks for the psychological mechanism proposed by Dr. Simeon. The answer should be "dissociation as a defense mechanism against intolerable stress."

For question 16, the answer is "people with a history of emotional abuse or neglect."

Now, let me structure the answers properly in the required format without markdown.
