Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict format. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. The first question asks which quartet performed Streichâ€™s piece with a uniquely tuned instrument. The article mentions the piano-percussion quartet Yarn/Wire performing "Orchestra of Black Butterflies" at the Miller Theater. The piece includes a piano tuned a quarter-tone down. So the answer is Yarn/Wire.

2. The venue hosting the showcase is mentioned as the Miller Theater in New York. The question specifies the venue where the fading sequences were part of the performance, which matches the Miller Theater.

3. The institution that commissioned the additional scene for Henze's "Das Wundertheater" is the Bavarian State Opera in Munich. The article states they asked her to write the final scene.

4. The Venice Biennale work "Stabat" used 32 singers divided into four choirs. The question asks how many singers, so 32.

5. The instrument altered by tuning a quarter-tone lower is a piano. The article says one of the pianos was tuned that way in "Orchestra of Black Butterflies."

6. Streich's favorite tempo is 37 beats per minute, as stated in the article.

7. The composition with austerity and a warm glow is "Safran," which is for violin and motorized piano. The description mentions the bronzed glow.

8. The title of her compilation with 14 chord categories is "Book of Chords," which includes photos and poetry.

9. The historic structure described is St. Mark's Basilica in Venice, where the performance had an endless haze.

10. The final dynamic marking used is "pianississimo" (pianississimo), mentioned in "Ishjarta" and the ending of "Butterflies" as "pianississimo."

Wait, let me check each again to avoid mistakes. For question 10, the article says "pianissississimo" in "Ishjarta" and "pianississimo" in the ending of "Orchestra of Black Butterflies." The question asks for the repeated marking. The exact term used in the conclusion of her works is "pianississimo," but in one case it's "pianissississimo." Hmm, the question says "repeatedly employed to signal the conclusion." The article mentions "pianississimo" in the final note about the ending of "Butterflies" being "pianississimo." Since the question is about the repeated marking, maybe "pianississimo" is the answer, even if one instance is more. Alternatively, check the exact wording. The article states "ends with almost the entire orchestra playing an extremely soft pianissississimo" and the ending of "Butterflies" is "pianississimo." Since the question says "repeatedly employed," the answer should be "pianississimo" as it's mentioned in two contexts, even if one is an extra s. Or maybe it's "pianississimo" because that's the term used in the final example. I'll go with "pianississimo" as the answer here.
