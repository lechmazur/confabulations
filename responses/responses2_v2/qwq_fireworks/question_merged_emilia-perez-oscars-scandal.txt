Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. Let's start with the first question.

1. **Question 1**: The user is asking which award Zoe Saldana likely presented at, given Gascon's original schedule. The article mentions that Gascon was slated to present at the Producers Guild Awards (PGA) on Saturday. Since Netflix shifted focus to Zoe Saldana after Gascon pulled back, maybe Zoe took over Gascon's role. So the answer would be the Producers Guild Awards. But wait, the question is about which award Zoe "presented at," but the article says Gascon was originally booked as a presenter there. If Gascon skipped it, maybe Zoe didn't present because the voting was already closed before the scandal. Hmm, the article says "Netflix will no longer cover expenses for Gascon to make those trips to Los Angeles," but it's unclear if Zoe presented in her place. Wait, the question is about which award Zoe likely presented at based on Gascon's original schedule. Since Gascon was supposed to present at PGA, maybe Zoe didn't because the voting was already done. The article says "voting on this Saturday's PGA was nearly closed before the scandal ramped up," so maybe the scandal didn't affect it. But the question is about which award Zoe "likely presented at" given Gascon's original schedule. Since Gascon was supposed to present at PGA, but the article doesn't say Zoe did, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "given Gascon's original schedule," so perhaps Gascon was supposed to present at PGA, and since Zoe is now the focus, maybe she took over. But the article doesn't explicitly state that. Hmm. The article says Gascon skipped PGA and Critics Choice, but doesn't mention Zoe presenting. Maybe the answer is N/A because it's not stated. Wait, the question says "likely present at, given Gascon's original schedule." Since Gascon was originally presenting at PGA, maybe the answer is PGA, but Zoe didn't necessarily do it. The question is tricky. Maybe the answer is N/A because there's no info on Zoe presenting. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the PGA, but the question is about the award Zoe presented, so maybe N/A. Hmm, I'll need to check the article again. The article says "had originally booked her as a presenter" for PGA. Since Gascon skipped, but the question is which award Zoe "likely" presented at based on Gascon's schedule. The answer might be the Producers Guild Awards. But the article doesn't explicitly say Zoe did, but since Gascon was supposed to present there, and Netflix shifted focus to Zoe, maybe they replaced her. I'll go with PGA.

2. **Question 2**: The backlash against The Brutalist and Anora was for using AI speech and not employing an intimacy coordinator. The question asks what Emilia Perez was scrutinized for before Gascon's tweets. The article says Emilia Perez had been lambasted online since last year for its "indelicate staging of trans issues and Mexican culture." So the specific element is the staging of trans issues and Mexican culture. The answer should be "indelicate staging of trans issues and Mexican culture."

3. **Question 3**: If European voters' response mirrors PGA (which was unaffected because voting closed before the scandal), then BAFTA and Cesar might still support Emilia. The question is about impact on Independent Spirit Awards. The article doesn't mention Independent Spirit Awards, so maybe N/A. Wait, the article says European voters might still back it at BAFTA and Cesar. The Independent Spirit Awards are a different category (probably American indie). If the scandal affected US voters, then maybe the impact would be negative. But the question states "if European voters' response mirrors PGA's" which was unaffected, but the Independent Spirit is likely US-based. The article doesn't specify, so maybe N/A. Alternatively, the answer could be "negative impact" but since the question is about if the European response mirrors PGA (which was okay), then the Spirit Awards might be affected because the scandal was public. But the question is phrased as "overall impact will this likely have on Emilia Perez's chances at the Independent Spirit Awards?" Since the article doesn't mention Spirit Awards, answer N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Fernanda Torres had to apologize for blackface. The question asks what type of performance Gascon engaged in that might surface. The article mentions Gascon implied people associated with Torres were "tearing her down," and Torres later had to apologize for blackface. Gascon's own past performance? The article says Gascon resurfaced posts criticizing 2021 Oscars. But the question is about a performance similar to Torres's (blackface). The article says Gascon's posts included criticizing the 2021 Oscars, but not a performance. Maybe N/A. Wait, Gascon's own past performances? The article doesn't mention Gascon doing anything like blackface. The answer might be N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The Variety editorial compared Gascon to the "Donald Trump of Oscar season." The question asks which political figure's campaign style resembles the initial approach (Gascon's defiant media blitz). The answer would be Donald Trump.

6. **Question 6**: Gascon's tweets included criticizing Muslims and the 2021 Oscars (which were diverse). The question is which religious group she alienated. The Muslims, so answer "Muslims."

7. **Question 7**: Gascon did a self-booked interview with CNN En Espanol. The question asks which similar outlet she might approach next. Similar format would be another Spanish-language or international news outlet. Maybe "CNN" or "The Hollywood Reporter" but the question specifies similar to CNN En Espanol, so maybe "CNN" or "Telemundo" but the article doesn't mention others. The answer might be "CNN" but since the user wants the format, perhaps "CNN" is correct. Alternatively, "The Hollywood Reporter" since she sent a missive there first. The article says she sent to THR first, then did CNN En Espanol. Next might be another Spanish outlet, but the question says similar in format, so maybe "CNN" (the English version). Not sure. Maybe "CNN" is the answer.

8. **Question 8**: The standard industry practice mentioned is scrubbing old social media posts. The action would be "scrubbing her old social media posts."

9. **Question 9**: The ceremony after Critics Choice (Feb 1st) but before SAG (Feb 23). The PGA was on Saturday (before Critics Choice?), but the article says the PGA voting was nearly closed before the scandal. The Producers Guild Awards was on Saturday, same as Critics Choice on Friday? The timeline is a bit unclear. The article mentions "the Producers Guild Awards on Saturday (which had originally booked her as a presenter)". The next ceremony after Critics Choice but before SAG would be the BAFTA or Cesar, but those are international. The question is which was least affected. The article says European voters might still support it. The Independent Spirit isn't mentioned. Maybe the PGA itself, since voting closed before the scandal. So the answer is the Producers Guild Awards, but that was before Critics Choice. Wait, the question is after Critics Choice but before SAG. The next major US award after Critics Choice is SAG, so maybe another one? The article doesn't mention another. The answer might be the Producers Guild Awards, but it was before Critics Choice. Alternatively, maybe the BAFTA, but it's European. The question says "least likely to be affected" because voting closed before. The PGA's voting closed before the scandal, so the answer is the PGA, but it's before Critics Choice. The question is about a ceremony after Critics Choice but before SAG. Since the article doesn't mention another, maybe N/A. Alternatively, the answer is the Producers Guild Awards, but it's before. Hmm. The article says the PGA voting was nearly closed before the scandal, so the result there is unaffected. The next ceremony after Critics Choice (which Gascon skipped) but before SAG would be maybe the BAFTA, but it's European. The question asks for an award least affected, which would be the PGA, but it's before. Since the user says "after Critics Choice but before SAG," maybe there's none, so N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the Producers Guild Awards, but that's before. Maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, perhaps the Critics Choice itself, but it's before SAG. I'm confused. The article says the PGA voting closed before the scandal, so the result there is unaffected. The Critics Choice was on Friday, Gascon skipped it. The next US ceremony before SAG is SAG itself, so perhaps there's no other. Therefore, N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Legal action against Gascon? The article mentions her posts about George Floyd (calling him a drug addict), Muslims, and others. Legal actions could be defamation or something. The answer might be "defamation lawsuits" but the question is "theoretically." The article doesn't mention legal action, so maybe N/A, but the question says "theoretically." The answer is "defamation lawsuits."

11. **Question 11**: The film compared to AI tech in The Brutalist (which used AI for language) is "The Brutalist" itself. Wait the question says which film used AI similar to Gascon's posts. The article says "The Brutalist" was pilloried for using AI to perfect Hungarian speech. So the answer is "The Brutalist."

12. **Question 12**: Gascon compared the 2021 Oscars to "Afro-Korean festival, a Black Lives Matter demonstration or the 8-M." The 8-M is International Women's Day (March 8). So the 2021 Oscars were compared to Black Lives Matter and an international feminist event (8-M). The answer is the 2021 Oscar telecast.

13. **Question 13**: Fernanda Torres had to apologize for blackface after her supporters clashed with Gascon's. The answer is Fernanda Torres.

14. **Question 14**: The ceremony whose voting closed before the scandal was the PGA. The answer is the Producers Guild Awards.

15. **Question 15**: The example given is "Green Book" and "Three Billboards" which overcame racial backlash. The answer is "Green Book" or "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri." The question asks which one is cited. The article says "Green Book" and "Three Billboards" faced online opprobrium for racial issues and still won. The example cited is "Green Book" and "Three Billboards," but the question asks which is cited as an example. The article specifically mentions both, but the answer might be "Green Book" since it's mentioned first.

16. **Question 16**: The co-star now positioned as primary is Zoe Saldana.

17. **Question 17**: Gascon referenced marginalization of workers and another group. The article says "It's always the same story of these same people trying to find a new victim to generate more hate... Before, it was people of color or women or workers." So the groups are people of color, women, workers. The answer is "people of color and women."

18. **Question 18**: The public figure's commentary on an Olympic athlete's gender eligibility was J.K. Rowling's comments on Imane Khelif. The answer is J.K. Rowling.

19. **Question 19**: Gascon emphasized being a "warrior" and love to fight, which manifested in her defiant media responses. The answer is "combative nature" or "love to fight." The article says she mentioned being a warrior and loving to fight in her August interview.
