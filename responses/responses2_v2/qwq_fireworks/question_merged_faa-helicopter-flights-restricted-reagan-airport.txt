Okay, let me start going through each question one by one, making sure I only use the information provided in the article. 

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions a 2023 F.A.A. memo that assessed the impact of adding new flight routes. It says they "issued a warning" but there's no specific percentage given for collision risks. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The restrictions were told to approved users on Thursday but not announced publicly until Friday. The article doesn't specify exact times, so the time elapsed isn't provided. N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The article states that Senator Kaine warned before Congress voted to add five new routes. It doesn't mention who first proposed them. N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The article doesn't mention the flight time of the Black Hawk before the collision. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** No altitude details are given when the helicopter transitioned routes. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** There's no mention of previous incidents in the past decade. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The memo's primary recommendation isn't specified beyond the warning about adding routes. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The F.A.A. is the agency mentioned for the concerns. So answer F.A.A.

9. **Question 9:** Pre-crash protocols' time intervals aren't discussed. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The article doesn't mention the Defense Department proposing alternative routes before the current paths. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The article talks about Route 6 being curtailed but doesn't state a percentage. N/A.

12. **Question 12:** The timeline mentioned by Hegseth doesn't specify minutes after turning onto Route 4. N/A.

13. **Question 13:** The model of the American Airlines jet isn't provided. N/A.

14. **Question 14:** The anonymous pilot mentioned restricted areas include parts of Route 1 and all of Route 4, plus a third route. The third route is called Route 6. So answer Route 6.

15. **Question 15:** The female pilot's rank isn't stated, only that she was undergoing evaluation with a co-pilot as evaluator. N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Senator Duckworth's statement doesn't mention the number of routes approved. The article says Congress added five, but the question asks what Duckworth said. Since her quote doesn't specify, N/A.

17. **Question 17:** The southern boundary of the restricted Route 1 section is the South Capitol Street Bridge on the Anacostia. So answer South Capitol Street Bridge.

18. **Question 18:** The article doesn't mention a call sign for Eaves. N/A.

19. **Question 19:** The NTSB didn't name the American Airlines pilot. N/A.

Wait, for question 8, the article says F.A.A. air-traffic overseers viewed the airspace as a problem. So the agency is F.A.A. Correct.

For question 14, the third route mentioned is a rarely used portion of a third route over the airport, which is Route 6. The affected routes besides 1 and 4 are Route 6. So answer Route 6.

Question 17: The briefing mentions the southern boundary as South Capitol Street Bridge. Correct.

Others remain N/A where info isn't present.
