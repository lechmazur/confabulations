Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start with question 1:

1. Which U.S. president first proposed legislation requiring the Defense Department to monitor Chinese influence over ports, leading to Panama joining the Belt and Road Initiative?

Hmm, the article mentions that in July, lawmakers introduced legislation to require the Defense Department to monitor China's influence over ports. It also says Panama became the first Latin American country to sign onto Belt and Road in 2018. But the question is asking which president proposed this legislation. The article doesn't mention a specific president proposing it. It just says lawmakers introduced it. So answer N/A.

2. How many containers per vessel must pass through the Panama Canal to make the transit fees economically viable according to the testimony of General Laura J. Richardson?

Looking for General Richardson's testimony. The article says she testified about Chinese investments as points of access, but there's no mention of container numbers or economic viability of fees. Judah Levine from Freightos talks about fees being a fraction of Suez charges, but no specific number per container. So N/A.

3. What percentage of Hong Kong billionaire family ownership in CK Hutchison Holdings triggered U.S. congressional concerns about Chinese control of port operations?

The article states CK Hutchison is a publicly listed company whose largest owner is a Hong Kong billionaire family. It doesn't specify a percentage. So N/A.

4. When did the Chinese government's extension of national security laws to Hong Kong prompt CK Hutchison to establish its joint venture with Aviation Industry Corporation of China?

The article says corporate records show CK Hutchison co-owns a real estate joint venture with Aviation Industry Corporation of China through subsidiaries. The timing of when this happened isn't linked to when China extended laws to HK. The laws' extension is mentioned as a reason for concern, but the joint venture's establishment date isn't given. So N/A.

5. How many ports did Panama agree to transfer to Chinese management control as part of cutting diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 2017?

The article says Panama cut ties with Taiwan in 2017 and then joined Belt and Road next year. But there's no mention of transferring specific ports to Chinese management as part of that deal. The ports are operated by CK Hutchison, but the article doesn't say Panama transferred them. So N/A.

6. What drought-related water level decrease caused Panama to raise canal transit fees to match Suez Canal rates?

The article says fees increased due to drought lowering water levels, but it mentions the fees are lower than Suez. The question asks what decrease caused fees to match Suez rates, but the article states Panama's fees are still lower. So the answer is N/A because they didn't match Suez rates.

7. Which cybersecurity vulnerabilities in Chinese-made cargo cranes led to Panama's partnership with the U.S. chips industry?

The article says Panama partnered with the U.S. to expand its chips industry, but it doesn't link this directly to vulnerabilities in cranes. The cybersecurity measures mentioned are from Biden's actions. So N/A.

8. What surveillance capabilities did the Strategy Risks report identify in CK Hutchison's port management software that concerned U.S. officials?

The Strategy Risks report says no direct links between CK Hutchison and CCP in Panama, but mentions ties to China due to HK jurisdiction. It doesn't specify surveillance capabilities in software. So N/A.

9. How many Chinese military personnel were documented working at the canal's visitor center according to President Mulino's press conference?

President Mulino said there were no Chinese in the canal beyond transiting ships or visitor center. The question asks how many military personnel were documented there. Since he said none, answer 0.

10. What percentage of U.S. military cargo monitoring was compromised through Chinese companies' access to port screening procedures?

The article mentions port operators might have knowledge of what the U.S. is looking for, but there's no specific percentage given. So N/A.

11. Which Latin American country became the second to join China's Belt and Road Initiative after Panama, according to the article's discussion of regional diplomatic shifts?

The article doesn't mention any other Latin American countries joining BRI after Panama. So N/A.

12. What is the name of the Hong Kong-based company that co-owns a real estate joint venture with Aviation Industry Corporation of China through subsidiaries, as revealed in corporate records mentioned in the text?

The company is CK Hutchison Holdings, as stated in the article.

13. How many U.S. military cargo shipments pass through the Panama Canal annually, according to the concerns raised by Michael R. Wessel about port operators' insights?

The article says 90% of U.S. military cargo travels by commercial ships, but doesn't give an annual number. So N/A.

14. Which U.S. president's administration ratified the treaties transferring control of the Panama Canal to Panama, as referenced in the article's historical context about Republican criticisms?

The treaties were under Jimmy Carter, ratified by the Senate. Reagan was his successor and criticized the decision.

15. What specific cybersecurity measure did the Biden administration implement in February to counter Chinese-made port cranes, beyond funding domestic manufacturing?

The article says Biden's effort included strengthening cybersecurity at U.S. ports and funding domestic manufacturing of cranes. The specific measure mentioned is cybersecurity measures, so "strengthening cybersecurity at U.S. ports".

16. Which Central American country's workers accounted for the majority of deaths during the Panama Canal's construction, according to historians cited in the article?

The article says historians say most deaths were Central Americans, Caribbean, or Colombians. Since Panama is in Central America, but the answer should be Central America's workers. Wait, the exact quote: "the thousands of people who died were from Central America, the Caribbean or Colombia." So the majority were from Central America? The question is which country, but the answer is "Central America" as a region. But the question asks for a country. Since the canal is in Panama, maybe Panama's workers? But the article says "Central America, the Caribbean or Colombia" so the answer would be Central America (but as a region, not a country). The question specifies "Central American country", so perhaps Panama itself? But the workers might have been from Panama, but the article says "Central America" as a broader region. Since the question asks for a country, maybe N/A, but the article says "Central America, the Caribbean or Colombia". Since the question asks for the country, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the exact quote: "the thousands of people who died were from Central America, the Caribbean or Colombia". So the majority from Central America (as a region), but the question asks for a country. Since the canal is in Panama, maybe the workers were Panamanian? The article doesn't specify a country, just regions. So the answer is N/A because it's not a specific country.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is "Central America" but the question specifies a country. Since the question says "Central American country", and the workers were from there, perhaps Panama? But the article says "Central America, the Caribbean or Colombia". Panama is a Central American country, so maybe the answer is Panama? But the article doesn't explicitly say that most were Panamanian, just from Central America. Since the question requires a country, but the text doesn't specify, it's N/A.

17. What percentage of global container traffic transits through ports operated by Hutchison Ports, based on the article's description of its worldwide operations?

The article says Hutchison operates 53 ports in 24 countries, but doesn't give a percentage of global traffic. So N/A.

18. Which U.S. state's congressional representative questioned Daniel Runde during the May hearing about Chinese control over Panamanian ports in a Taiwan conflict scenario?

The representative was Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois.

19. What is the total number of countries where Hutchison Ports operates terminals, according to the article's mention of its global reach in port management?

The article states 24 countries.

20. Which year did the U.S. government issue its advisory cautioning port operators about foreign-made equipment risks, as referenced in the discussion of cybersecurity vulnerabilities?

The article says a recent report by Strategy Risks, but the advisory was issued last year (the article mentions a previous version had an error about when the advisory was issued; it says the advisory happened last year, not this year). Since the article was written in 2023 (assuming current events), last year would be 2022. But the exact year isn't given. Wait, the article says: "In a previous version... the U.S. government put out an advisory... last year, not this year." So the correct answer is 2022 (if published in 2023). But since the article's date isn't given, but the correction says the advisory was last year, but the question just wants the year from the text. The text says "last year", but without knowing the article's publication year, it's impossible. However, the article mentions the advisory was last year. Since the question asks for the year according to the article, the answer is "last year" but needs a number. Wait, the article says "A previous version of this article... the U.S. government put out an advisory... last year, not this year." So the correct year is the one mentioned as "last year" in the article. Since the article's current version states it was last year, but without a specific year, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the text says: "In July, lawmakers introduced legislation... last year, not this year." Wait, the correction says the advisory happened last year, so the answer is the year mentioned as last year, but since the article's publication date isn't given, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, the article says "last year" in reference to the advisory, but without the current year, can't convert to a number. So answer N/A.
