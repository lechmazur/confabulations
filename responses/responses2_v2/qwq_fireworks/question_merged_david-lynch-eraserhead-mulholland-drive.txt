Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article provided. I'll go through each question carefully to ensure I don't miss any details.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which Los Angeles neighborhood Lynch established his compound in. The article mentions he established a nearby compound but doesn't specify the neighborhood. Since the exact neighborhood isn't named, the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The article says during his May 11, 2020 weather report, there were "several pairs of glasses" on his desk. "Several" is vague, so without a specific number, it's N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The temperature isn't explicitly stated. The article mentions the fog would burn off to 70 degrees, but that's the forecast after burning off, not the current temperature. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Betty discovers the dog droppings outside her aunt's bungalow. The text says "a pile of dog droppings deposited on the walkway outside" when Betty is shown to the bungalow. So the answer is Betty.

5. **Question 5:** The color of the mug isn't mentioned. The article only says it was filled with black coffee. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The Bobby Vinton song plays once in the opening. The article describes the opening with the song, then it fades. No mention of multiple plays, so N/A unless it's implied once, but the question asks how many times. Since it's not stated, N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The building manager is Ann Miller, as stated directly in the text. So Ann Miller.

8. **Question 8:** The collaborators mentioned are Kyle MacLachlan, Laura Dern, and Isabella Rossellini. The question asks who spoke first in tribute. The article doesn't specify the order, so N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The insect devouring the ear is ants. The severed ear in "Blue Velvet" is covered with ants. So ants.

10. **Question 10:** Ebert's review mentions "one of the few Black characters" in "Wild at Heart" refers to the man beaten. So the count is 1.

11. **Question 11:** The question is a bit complex. The building manager is Ann Miller, who guides Betty. The symbolic role is as a guide, but the question is phrased as a metaphor. Since the article says she "led Betty to an outwardly charming bungalow," the answer might be the building manager, but the question asks for the role. The text doesn't explicitly state the symbolic role beyond being a guide, so maybe N/A? Wait, the question asks "what type of role" she plays in guiding Betty. The article says she's a "tap-dancing film legend" and building manager. The role is building manager, so the answer is building manager. But the question is phrased as a symbolic role related to "Mulholland Drive's" themes. Since the article doesn't elaborate beyond her role as building manager, maybe the answer is "building manager" but the question might want a metaphor. Hmm, tricky. The article says she "led Betty to her aunt's bungalow," so the role is building manager. So answer: building manager.

12. **Question 12:** The metaphor for transient Hollywood success. The weather phenomenon mentioned in the May 11 report is fog burning off to sunshine. The author uses the fog burning off as a metaphor for transient success? The article says "this all should burn off pretty soon and we'll have sunshine and 70 degrees." The author might link the fog burning off to the fleeting nature of success. So the answer is fog.

13. **Question 13:** The object near the building manager's residence that foreshadows events. The dog droppings are mentioned as part of the bungalow's setting. The droppings are the object, so answer: dog droppings.

14. **Question 14:** Betty's aunt's profession. The article says the bungalow belonged to her aunt, but doesn't state the aunt's profession. So N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Beverage consumed at the Oscars. The article mentions Lynch's desk had a mug with black coffee, but the Oscars audience's beverage isn't stated. So N/A.

16. **Question 16:** The color of the flowers in "Blue Velvet's" ending. The opening had "blood-red roses," but the ending's flowers are the same as the opening? The article says in the ending, Jeffrey and his sweetheart marvel at a robin with an insect, but the flowers mentioned are the blood-red roses in the opening. The question asks about the concluding scene's flowers. Wait, the ending scene with the robin isn't about flowers. Wait, the article says in the opening, there are blood-red roses. The ending's flowers aren't mentioned. The question might be a trick. The flowers in the ending are not described, so N/A. Wait, the question says "what color were the prickly stemmed flowers that Jeffrey's sweetheart was marveling at in the concluding scene?" The article says the ending has the robin, but the flowers aren't there. So N/A.

17. **Question 17:** The creature offered by the radiator lady. The article mentions the lady in the radiator in "Eraserhead," but doesn't describe what she offers. So N/A.

18. **Question 18:** The date of the weather report predicting sunshine. The article specifies May 11, 2020, so that's the answer.

19. **Question 19:** The household item the man used before his heart attack. He was watering his lawn, so the item is a hose or watering can. The article says "a man watering his lawn," so the item is a hose/watering can. The answer is watering hose or watering can. Since the article says "watering his lawn," the answer is watering hose or just "hose." But the exact term isn't given. The article says "man watering his lawn," so the item is a hose. But maybe "watering can"? Since the article doesn't specify, but the action is watering, so the item is a hose or watering can. Since the exact term isn't there, maybe N/A. Wait, the question asks for the household item. The act of watering implies a watering can or hose. Since the article doesn't specify, but it's implied, maybe N/A. Alternatively, the article says "watering his lawn," so the item is a hose. But the text doesn't name it, so N/A.

Let me check each again carefully.

1. **Neighborhood?** The article says "nearby compound" but no neighborhood. N/A.
