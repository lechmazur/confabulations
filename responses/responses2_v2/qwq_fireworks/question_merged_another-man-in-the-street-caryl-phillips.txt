Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by going through each question and checking the article for the answers.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks about the London neighborhood where Victor initially found housing before moving to where he worked as a rent collector. Looking through the article, I remember it mentions Victor working in Notting Hill at a pub. Wait, the article says "a pub in Notting Hill where they both work." But does it specify where he first lived? Hmm. The article says he worked as a rent collector for Peter Feldman. The text mentions he moved to the area where he worked, so maybe the initial housing was Notting Hill? Or maybe there's another area mentioned. Let me check again. The article states: "a pub in Notting Hill where they both work." The pub is where Lucky (who is Victor) works. But the first housing isn't explicitly stated. The question is about before moving to the area where he worked as a rent collector. Since the rent collector job is with Feldman, maybe the area where Feldman's properties are isn't specified. The article doesn't mention another neighborhood, so maybe Notting Hill is the area where he worked at the pub, so the initial housing might be Notting Hill. Wait, but the question is before moving to the area where he worked as a rent collector. Since he worked at the pub in Notting Hill, but the rent collector job might be elsewhere. The article says he "finds work as a rent collector for a Jewish slumlord, Peter Feldman". The text doesn't specify the location of that work. Since the pub is in Notting Hill, maybe the initial housing was Notting Hill, but the question is asking for before moving to the area where he worked as a rent collector. Since the rent collector job isn't tied to a specific area, maybe the answer is Notting Hill, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's no info, so N/A. Hmm. The article doesn't explicitly state the initial neighborhood, so maybe N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many years passed between Victor's arrival and his first journalist job. The article mentions he becomes a journalist, but there's no timeline given. The arrival is in the 1960s, but exact years aren't provided. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The pub where Lucky worked. The article mentions "a pub in Notting Hill where they both work." But the name of the pub isn't given. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Which family member accompanied Maria when fleeing during the war? The article says Maria's husband is a tailor. It mentions Maria's family avoiding religious markers. But does it say who fled with her? The text says "Maria (an odd name for a Jew, though maybe she isn't one), is married stereotypically to a tailor..." So maybe her husband? The question is about the family member who accompanied her during the war. The article doesn't explicitly state this, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The title of the article that launched his career. The article doesn't mention any specific article title. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Ruth's family's reaction. The article says Ruth stayed with Victor till the end, but there's no info on her family's reaction when introduced. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Medical condition leading to his death. The article states he "confronts the magnitude of what he lost when he left St. Kitts for the 'motherland.'" No medical condition mentioned. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Caribbean author Victor read. The article doesn't mention any specific author. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Shipping company's name. The article mentions he traveled by ship but doesn't name the company. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Who introduced Ruth to Peter before Victor? The article says Victor met Peter first, then through him met Ruth. No mention of another person introducing Ruth to Peter. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Which immigrant's alternate identity is unveiled through a new narrator. The article says Lucky is Victor, so the answer is Victor. The question asks for the Caribbean immigrant's name, so Victor Johnson.

12. **Question 12:** The decade implied by the voyage. The article starts with "1960s London." So 1960s.

13. **Question 13:** Which character has dual identities. The article states Lucky is Victor, so Victor.

14. **Question 14:** Which matriarch's name is incongruous. Maria is the name mentioned as odd for a Jew. The question asks which member's name is inconsistent, so Maria. The spouse's trade is tailoring, which is mentioned, so maybe Maria's name is the incongruous part.

15. **Question 15:** After how many pages does the identity reveal? The article says "it's 20 pages before we know this (almost a tenth of the novel's length)". The novel is 222 pages, so 20 pages.

16. **Question 16:** Which working-class figure's career is stunted by racism after working under Feldman. The article says Victor's career as a journalist was limited by racism, and he worked under Feldman as a rent collector. So Victor.

17. **Question 17:** Phillips's earlier novel on historical hatred. The article mentions "The Nature of Blood" as a previous work on the Holocaust and Jew hatred.

18. **Question 18:** Which immigrant found solace in Ruth's affection. Victor is the immigrant who stayed with Ruth.

19. **Question 19:** Matriarch with incongruous name. Maria, as mentioned earlier.

20. **Question 20:** Figure associated with rent collection and loss, portrayed with affectless tone. Peter Feldman is the slumlord, and the article says his portrayal is "mysteriously affectless". So Peter Feldman.
