Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I use only the information from the given article. Let's start with question 1.

1. The first question asks how many times Gotti tried to include Ja Rule in the BET documentary according to Ashanti's interview with Angie Martinez. Wait, the article says Gotti tried three times to get Ashanti to participate in his documentary, not Ja Rule. And Ashanti later called him manipulative. So the question is about Ja Rule, but the article mentions Ashanti. That's a mismatch, so answer N/A.

2. The second question is about the A&E documentary on gangsters that inspired the label's name. The article states the name Murder Inc. was inspired by an A&E documentary on gangsters. The exact name isn't given, so the answer is N/A.

3. The third question asks besides Ja Rule, which artist under Murder Inc. had three No. 1 hits. The article says Ja Rule had three, but no other artist is mentioned with three. The answer is N/A.

4. Fourth question: In what year did Gotti talk about confidence in chemistry with Kenneth McGriff on "Uncensored"? Wait, the article mentions he spoke about his confidence in Ja Rule on "Uncensored", not Kenneth McGriff. The question has an incorrect premise, so N/A.

5. The fifth question asks for the name of the convicted gang leader and co-founder of Roc-A-Fella. The co-founder is Dame Dash, but the gang leader is Kenneth McGriff (Supreme). Roc-A-Fella's co-founder is Dame Dash, who is mentioned as having a soured relationship. The question combines two different people. The answer is Kenneth McGriff.

6. Sixth question: What food did Gotti struggle with? The article says he had diabetes and struggled to cut out certain foods. The exact food isn't named, so N/A.

7. Seventh question: How many years did the investigation add to his age? The article says the investigation took three years, but the question asks how it influenced his age for collaborating with GloRilla. Not mentioned, so N/A.

8. Eighth question: DMX's album chart position. The article says "It's Dark and Hell Is Hot" debuted at No. 1. But the question is about the reason for dropping "Murder" from the name. The name change was in 2003, but the album was 1998. The question links the chart position to the name change, but the article doesn't connect them directly. N/A.

9. Ninth question: The podcast where he discussed LL Cool J. The article mentions the "Drink Champs" podcast where he talked about Dame Dash and Ashanti, but not LL Cool J. So N/A.

10. Tenth question: The Bronx apartment building. The article mentions hip-hop started in a Bronx apartment but doesn't name it. The family's circumstances are described as having "plenty of love but not much money," which was Gotti's family, not the building. So N/A.

11. Eleventh question: Year the label dropped "Murder" was 2003, as stated in the article. So 2003.

12. Twelfth question: Birth name is Irving Domingo Lorenzo Jr., from the article.

13. Thirteenth question: DMX's debut was executive produced by Gotti, not Dame Dash. The question says Dame Dash, which is incorrect. N/A.

14. Fourteenth question: The rapper endorsed by Gotti as having the right look and talent is Ja Rule, paired with Ashanti.

15. Fifteenth question: The legal accusation was money laundering for Kenneth McGriff, so money laundering.

16. Sixteenth question: The alias "Supreme" is Kenneth McGriff.

17. Seventeenth question: 28 Hot 100 hits, per Billboard mentioned.

18. Eighteenth question: The documentary aired on BET in 2022.

19. Nineteenth question: The entrepreneur with a deteriorated relationship is Dame Dash, mentioned in the podcast.

20. Twentieth question: Diabetes, as stated in the 2023 podcast.
