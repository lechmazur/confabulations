Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article and follow the strict instructions given. Let me start with question 1.

1. **Which European film archive initially discovered the original A negative print of "Shoulder Arms" that led to MoMA's restoration project?**  
The article mentions that Adrian Gerber worked with the Swiss archive Lichtspiel/Kinemathek Bern to locate and catalog prints, but it doesn't say they found the A negative. MoMA's restoration used surviving prints based on A-negative material, but the initial discovery isn't specified here. The article says MoMA had reported its copies, so maybe the answer is N/A because the text doesn't state which archive found the A negative.

2. **How many frames per second did Chaplin's preferred version of "Shoulder Arms" run at when it was first shown to troops during World War I?**  
The article states that in 1943, the army used sound projectors at 24 fps, but the original version in 1918 ran at 20 fps. So the answer is 20.

3. **What was the running time of the version of "Shoulder Arms" included in the 1959 "Chaplin Revue" after the stretch-printing modifications?**  
The original runs around 40 minutes. The 1959 version was trimmed and stretch-printed, but the exact running time isn't given. So N/A.

4. **Which cinematographer worked with Chaplin to create the B negative version that was distributed throughout Asia?**  
The article doesn't mention who worked on the B negative. It does say Rollie Totheroh was the regular cinematographer in the 1940s, but that's for a different version. So N/A.

5. **What technical innovation did Kodak introduce in 1919 that would have made Chaplin's multiple-camera filming technique unnecessary for his next film?**  
The article says Kodak hadn't developed duplicate negative stock "at the time" (since the film was made in 1918). The question asks what they introduced in 1919. The article doesn't mention a specific year for this innovation, just that it wasn't available then. So N/A.

6. **How many minutes of footage from the original A negative did MoMA manage to recover for their restoration before having to rely on 16mm prints?**  
The article says MoMA used surviving prints based on A-negative but had to use 16mm/28mm for some parts. The exact minutes aren't provided. So N/A.

7. **What was the box office revenue difference between the A negative version shown in America and the B negative version shown internationally?**  
No revenue figures are mentioned anywhere. N/A.

8. **Which scene from the tree disguise sequence was completely removed when Chaplin revised the film for "The Chaplin Revue"?**  
The article says the 1959 version starts the tree sequence differently, with Chaplin scratching his behind, but it doesn't mention a scene being removed. So N/A.

9. **What percentage of the original 1918 title cards did MoMA's restoration team have to recreate from written records?**  
The article mentions title cards were returned to 1918 versions but doesn't specify a percentage. N/A.

10. **How many theaters simultaneously showed "Shoulder Arms" during its initial American release in October 1918?**  
The article doesn't provide the number of theaters. N/A.

11. **Drawing on the restoration narrative and the film's original production methods, which negative did MoMA predominantly use to assemble the print resembling the 1918 version of "Shoulder Arms"?**  
The article says the restoration used surviving prints based on the original A-negative material. So A negative.

12. **Considering the modifications made during the restoration process described in the article, what frame rate does the updated version of "Shoulder Arms" now run at?**  
The restoration removed stretch printing and uses 20 fps, which matches the original. So 20.

13. **Based on the historical account of film distribution and later military screenings, who was Chaplin's regular cinematographer that worked with the surviving negatives during the 1940s?**  
The article says Rollie Totheroh, Chaplin's regular cinematographer, worked with the C and D negatives in 1943. So Rollie Totheroh.

14. **Integrating details from the article about archival partnerships, which archive collaborated with the film historian to catalog the surviving prints of "Shoulder Arms"?**  
Adrian Gerber worked with Swiss archive Lichtspiel/Kinemathek Bern. So Lichtspiel/Kinemathek Bern.

15. **According to the discussion on negative selection in the article, which negative provided the bulk of the footage for the version of "Shoulder Arms" included in the 1959 "Chaplin Revue"?**  
The article states the 1959 version used mostly the D negative. So D negative.

16. **Interpreting the restoration adjustments mentioned in the text, what change was made to the title cards to reflect the film's original public presentation in 1918?**  
The 1927 reissue had altered title cards, which were returned to the 1918 version. So returned to 1918 versions.

17. **Reflecting on the chronological narrative, in which year did the United States Army request "Shoulder Arms" for morale purposes, leading to the discovery that the A negative was no longer viable?**  
The article says the army asked in 1943. So 1943.

18. **Analyzing the critical commentary on reissues, who in the article compared the restoration work to a historic version of a space opera franchise, implying that viewers are seeing an earlier, unaltered work?**  
Dave Kehr compared it to the 1977 Star Wars. So Dave Kehr.

19. **Combining details from film runtime information and historical context in the article, what is the approximate duration of "Shoulder Arms" as it was originally premiered in 1918?**  
The article says it runs around 40 minutes. So approximately 40 minutes.

20. **From the account of production challenges in the silent era described in the text, which company’s failure to develop duplicate negative stock necessitated Chaplin’s use of two cameras for shooting "Shoulder Arms"?**  
Kodak hadn't developed duplicate negative stock. So Kodak.
