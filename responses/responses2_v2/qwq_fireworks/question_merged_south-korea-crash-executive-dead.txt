Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. Each question is a bit tricky because they involve figuring out who might be incorrectly blamed based on the information given. The article mentions Son Chang-wan as the former president of Korea Airports Corporation from 2018 to 2022. The crash happened in December 2022, and the renovation started in 2020 during his tenure. The police aren't investigating him, but the questions are about possible mistaken assumptions.

For question 1, the structural feature criticized is the concrete wall with the antenna array. That's directly stated.

Question 2 asks about someone who might be incorrectly assumed responsible for safety issues. Since Son was in office when the renovation began in 2020, people might think he's responsible even if he's not a subject of the investigation. So the answer would be Son Chang-wan.

Question 3 is similar. The former executive linked to both the renovation start and the incident is again Son, since he was president until 2022 when the crash occurred.

Question 4 connects his suicide with safety upgrades. Since his tenure overlapped with the accident and the upgrades are happening now, he might be wrongly implicated. So Son again.

Question 5: The flight recorder failure and international investigation are part of the crash. Since his term ended in 2022, the crash happened during his term, so he might be blamed here too.

Question 6: The concrete structure, safety violations, and the disaster. All happened during his time, so he's the one to blame here.

Question 7: The 2020 renovation and the runway closure. Again, his term included the renovation, so he's the answer.

Question 8: Upgrades to localizers and international investigations. His past role in the corporation might be linked here.

Question 9: The term overlapping with renovation, steel structures, and the crash. Son was there until 2022, so yes.

Question 10: The infrastructure timeline and the Boeing crash. His leadership is mentioned as being in office when the works were done, so he's the answer.

Question 11: Safety improvements and flight recorder issues. Again, his tenure would be the time when these started, so he's the one.

I need to make sure each question's answer is "Son Chang-wan" except if there's a case where the article says someone else, but the article states he's not a subject of the police investigation. But the questions are about mistaken assumptions, so all answers point to him. So all answers are Son Chang-wan except if any question specifies a different aspect, but looking through each, they all refer to his role during the relevant time periods. So all 11 answers should be him.
