Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let's start with the first question.

1. **How many bottles of vodka did Brodsky take with him when he was exiled, according to Robert Morgan?**
   - The article says: "the Soviets booted him from the country with little more than a small leather suitcase in which he packed two bottles of vodka." Robert Morgan isn't mentioned here, but the answer is two bottles. Since the question specifies according to Robert Morgan, but the text doesn't mention Morgan talking about this, maybe it's a trick. Wait, the question says "according to Robert Morgan," but the article only states the fact about the vodka in the general narrative. Since Morgan isn't quoted here, maybe it's N/A? Wait, no, the article says "he packed two bottles of vodka" so the answer is two, but the question says "according to Robert Morgan." The text doesn't have Morgan mentioning this, so maybe N/A? Hmm, conflicting. Wait, the article doesn't attribute the vodka detail to Morgan. The question is asking if Robert Morgan said that. Since the text doesn't mention Morgan talking about the vodka, the answer should be N/A. Wait, but the question is phrased as "according to Robert Morgan," so unless Morgan is the source of that info, which he isn't. The article just states it as a fact. So the answer is N/A here. Wait, but the article does say he took two bottles. The question is if Robert Morgan said that. Since the text doesn't have Morgan's statement on that, answer is N/A. Wait, but the question is wrong in its premise, so N/A. Hmm, tricky. Alternatively, maybe the article says Morgan didn't mention it, so the answer is N/A. I'll go with N/A.

2. **What type of animal does Brodsky suggest, in a conversation with the author's daughter, he would like to be in his next life in Venice?**
   - The article says: "I would like to live my next life in Venice. To be a cat there, anything, even a rat, but always in Venice." So the animal is a cat (or rat, but the main suggestion is cat as the first option). The question asks what animal he suggests he would like to be. The answer is a cat. So the answer is cat.

3. **What color are the domes of San Marco that explode with light, as described by the author when referencing Brodsky's description of winter mornings?**
   - The article mentions: "the pale winter sun rose across the lagoon and the weak rays unexpectedly exploded off the five domes of San Marco, turning them into lighthouses against the leaden sky." The domes are described as turning into lighthouses, but the color isn't explicitly stated. Wait, but Brodsky's quote says "part damp oxygen, part coffee and prayers," but the description in the article's narration says the domes' light is reflected as lighthouses. The color isn't directly stated here. Wait, maybe in another part? Let me check again. The author's description says the domes' light explodes, but the color isn't mentioned. The question is about the color. Since the text doesn't specify the color of the domes themselves, maybe it's N/A. Wait, but the domes of San Marco are typically golden, but the article doesn't say that. The answer is N/A? Wait, the text says "the weak rays... turned them into lighthouses against the leaden sky." Lighthouses are usually white or bright, but the color of the domes isn't stated. So the answer is N/A? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the domes are golden, but since the article doesn't say, it's N/A. Let me check again. The article says "the five domes of San Marco, turning them into lighthouses against the leaden sky." The leaden sky is the sky's color, not the domes. The domes' color isn't specified here, so answer is N/A. Wait, maybe the question is referencing Brodsky's description? The article says Brodsky described winter mornings as "part damp oxygen, part coffee and prayers," but that's about the atmosphere, not the domes' color. So I think N/A here.

4. **Where did Susan Sontag meet Ezra Pound's mistress, Olga Rudge, five years after Pound's death, as described in *Watermark*?**
   - The article states: "a salmon-colored house was the setting for a provocative literary encounter in 'Watermark.' A marble plaque above the narrow front door explained that this was where the American poet Ezra Pound lived with his mistress, Olga Rudge... Brodsky wrote about squeezing through this doorway in 1977, five years after Pound's death, with his girlfriend, the writer Susan Sontag, for tea with Rudge." So the location is the salmon-colored house at Calle Querini, No. 252. The answer is the house at number 252 on Calle Querini, but the question asks "where" so the street name and number? The question says "as described in Watermark," so the answer is the house at No. 252 on Calle Querini. But the question might just need the street name. Wait, the question is "where" so the full address. The article says "Calle Querini, where, at No. 252, a salmon-colored house..." So the answer is Calle Querini, number 252. But maybe just the street? The exact location is "the salmon-colored house at No. 252 on Calle Querini." The question is phrased as "where," so the answer is the house at number 252 on Calle Querini. But the answer might just be the street name. Wait, the question says "where did Susan Sontag meet..." so the specific place is the house at 252 Calle Querini. So the answer is "Calle Querini, No. 252" or "the house at No. 252 on Calle Querini." The article says "setting for a provocative literary encounter in 'Watermark.' A marble plaque... this was where the American poet Ezra Pound lived... Brodsky... with Susan Sontag for tea with Rudge." So the answer is the house at No. 252 on Calle Querini. But the question might just want the street name. Let me check the exact wording: "where did Susan Sontag meet..." The text says they went to the house at No. 252 on Calle Querini, so the answer is Calle Querini, number 252. But the question might accept "Calle Querini" as the street. The exact answer as per the text is Calle Querini, No. 252. But maybe the answer is just the street name. Wait, the question is about the location where they met, so the full address. The article says "No. 252" on Calle Querini, so the answer is Calle Querini, number 252.

5. **What kind of graffitied markings, made by the author's kinsmen, did Vivian find on the flanks of the Piraeus Lion, mitigating its ferocity?**
   - The article mentions: "runes were graffitied into its flanks by marauding Vikings -- our kinsmen!" So the markings are runes, made by Vikings (the author's kinsmen as a Dane). The answer is runes.

6. **What is the name of the cemetery where Brodsky, Stravinsky, and Diaghilev are buried, and where Vivian encountered women taking selfies near Brodsky's grave?**
   - The article says: "arranged for him to be buried on the cemetery island of San Michele just north of Venice." Also, "the composer Igor Stravinsky and the ballet impresario Serge Diaghilev, where dancers still leave their worn slippers on his gravestone." So the cemetery is San Michele.

7. **What was the profession of the person who arranged for Brodsky to be buried on San Michele, near Ezra Pound's original gravesite?**
   - The article states: "his Italian wife, Maria Sozzani, whom he had met just six years earlier when she was a student at one of his lectures, arranged for him to be buried on the cemetery island of San Michele." Maria Sozzani is his wife. The question asks her profession. The text doesn't mention her profession, only that she was a student at his lectures. So the answer is N/A, unless "student" is her profession, but she's a student. The question is about her profession at the time of arranging the burial. The article says she was a student when they met, but doesn't state her profession later. So answer is N/A.

8. **What was the name of the ballet impresario, mentioned by Brodsky in *Watermark*, whose tomb Viv and the author visited on San Michele?**
   - The article says: "the composer Igor Stravinsky and the ballet impresario Serge Diaghilev, where dancers still leave their worn slippers on his gravestone." So the ballet impresario is Serge Diaghilev.

9. **What is the name of the street where the author met Robert Morgan, to whom Brodsky dedicated *Watermark*?**
   - The article mentions: "I wandered 10 minutes east of the Morgans' apartment to a dead-end street, Calle Querini..." Wait, the author met Robert Morgan in Dorsoduro neighborhood. Wait, the meeting with Morgan: "In the bohemian Dorsoduro neighborhood on the south bank of the Grand Canal, where some bars display 'No Tourist' signs, I met the American expatriate painter Robert Morgan..." The street isn't named here. The question is about the street where the author met Morgan. The text doesn't mention the street name where the meeting took place, only that Morgan's apartment was on a street leading to Calle Querini. The article says the author met Morgan in Dorsoduro, but the exact street isn't given. The question asks for the street name. Since the text doesn't specify the street where the meeting occurred (only that Morgan lived on a street leading to Calle Querini), the answer is N/A.

10. **What was the name of Brodsky's Italian publisher, who, along with Robert Morgan, discovered the initial gravesite's proximity to Pound's?**
    - The article states: "Mr. Morgan told me that he and Roberto Calasso, Brodsky's Italian publisher, went to the cemetery before the cortege..." So the publisher is Roberto Calasso.

11. **What is the name of the lion that Brodsky and his daughter visit annually, and which historical event involving Vikings is directly linked to its presence in Venice?**
    - The lion is the Piraeus Lion. The article mentions "runes were graffitied into its flanks by marauding Vikings -- our kinsmen!" The historical event linked is the Vikings' presence, so the Vikings' graffiti. The question asks for the event, which is the Vikings' marauding (or their graffiti). The answer for the lion's name is Piraeus Lion, and the event is the Vikings' graffiti. But the question is structured as two parts in one: name of the lion and the historical event. The question is phrased as "what is the name... and which historical event..." So the first part is Piraeus Lion, and the second part is the Vikings' graffiti. But the question wants the name of the lion and the event linked. The question's exact wording: "what is the name of the lion... and which historical event involving Vikings..." So the answer needs to include both. However, the answer format requires each question's answer to be in one <answer> tag. So for the lion's name, it's Piraeus Lion, and the event is the Vikings' graffiti. The question asks for both, so the answer should be both parts. Let me check the article again. The lion is called the Piraeus Lion. The event is that Vikings (the author's kinsmen) graffitied runes into its flanks. So the historical event is the Vikings' graffiti. Therefore, the answer should be "Piraeus Lion" for the name and "Vikings' graffiti" for the event. But the question is phrased as "name of the lion... and which historical event...", so the answer needs both. Since the answer must be in one sentence fragment, perhaps "Piraeus Lion and Vikings' graffiti". But the question is structured as a single question asking for both. The article states the lion's name is Piraeus Lion and the event is Vikings' runes. The answer should be both parts. The question requires both, so the answer is "Piraeus Lion" (name) and the event is Vikings' graffiti (the Vikings' marauding and their runes). So combining both parts into the answer as per the question's phrasing.
