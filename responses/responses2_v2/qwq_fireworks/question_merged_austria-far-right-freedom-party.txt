12. **Term repurposed for refugee housing?** The article says "concentrating" refugees in centralized facilities, which was compared to Nazi camps. The term used was "concentrating," but the exact phrase from the text is "concentrating refugees in centralized facilities." However, the answer might be "concentration camps" but the article says he used a Nazi-era phrase referencing them. The specific term he used was "concentrating," but the question asks for the term he repurposed. The article says he used the term "concentrating," which was seen as referencing concentration camps. So maybe "concentrating" but the exact term borrowed might be "Volkskanzler" is mentioned later. Wait, the question is about the term for refugee housing. The article says he suggested "concentrating" refugees in centralized facilities, which was criticized as referencing Nazi camps. So the term is "concentrating" but the exact Nazi-era term might be "KZ" (concentration camps), but the article doesn't state the exact slogan. The answer is "concentration camps" but the question asks for the term Kickl used. Since the article says he used the phrase "concentrating," which was seen as provocative, the answer is "concentrating" but the question specifies "Nazi-era slogan." Wait, the article says "many believe that his use of a Nazi-era phrase referencing concentration camps was deliberate." So the phrase he used was referencing "concentration camps," but the exact term he used isn't given. Hmm, maybe the answer is "concentration camps," but the question is about the term he repurposed. Alternatively, the article says "concentrating refugees in centralized facilities" which is the term he used, but the Nazi-era term is "concentration camps." Since the question asks for the term he repurposed, the answer is "concentration camps" but the article says he used a phrase that references them. Since the exact term isn't stated, maybe N/A. Wait, the article says he suggested "concentrating" refugees in centralized facilities. So the term he used was "concentrating," but the Nazi-era term is "concentration camps." Since the question asks for the term he repurposed, which is "concentration camps," but the article says he used the phrase that references it. Since the exact term he used isn't given beyond "concentrating," maybe N/A? Or maybe the answer is "concentration camps" as the Nazi-era term he referenced. The question says "borrowed from Nazi-era vocabulary," so the answer is "concentration camps."
