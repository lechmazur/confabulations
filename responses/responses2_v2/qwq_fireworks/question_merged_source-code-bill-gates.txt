Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. Let's go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks which female board member taught Gates card games. The article mentions his grandmother (Gami) fed him Ritz crackers and taught card games. His grandmother is his mother's mother. The article doesn't explicitly state her name, only referring to her as "Gami." Since the question specifies "female board member," but Gami isn't mentioned as a board member, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says his mother was on boards later. Wait, the first paragraph says: "his mother came from money, and his father made up for his more straitened childhood by becoming a partner in a law firm. Gates's mother would eventually join the boards of publicly traded companies..." So his mother was a board member later, but the person who taught him card games was Gami, his maternal grandmother. The question asks for the board member who taught him, but Gami isn't a board member. The answer might be N/A, but maybe the question is mixing up. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "Gami" even though she's not a board member. Wait the question says "female board member", but Gami is not a board member. So answer is N/A. Wait, but the first question says "female board member taught young Bill..." but the text says Gami taught him, but Gami isn't a board member. The board member is his mother, but she's not the one who taught him. So the answer is N/A. Hmm, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again. The text says: "his mother's mother, who fed him Ritz crackers with peanut butter and taught him how to excel at card games." So Gami is the one who taught him, but she's not a board member. The board member is his mother, but she's not mentioned as teaching him. So the answer is N/A because the question specifies a board member who taught him, but that's not Gami. Wait, but the question says "female board member", so maybe the answer is N/A.

Wait, the first question: "Which female board member taught young Bill Gates to excel at card games..." The female board member would be his mother, but she didn't teach him card games. The one who did was Gami, who's not a board member. So the answer is N/A. But maybe the question is wrong, so answer N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The Cub Scout fundraising. The article says "he helped raise money for the Cub Scouts by selling 179 pounds of nuts." So the answer is 179.

3. **Question 3**: The name of the therapist. The article mentions "seeing a therapist who helped him process his arrogance and anger," but doesn't name the therapist. So answer N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Season of Disneyland trip. The article says "For a family trip to Disneyland she used her IBM Selectric..." but doesn't mention the season. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Initial percentage for Microsoft split. The article states: "He would later insist on splitting ownership of Microsoft with Allen 64-36 -- bumping up Gates's share from the 60-40 split that Allen had already agreed to." So the initial was 60-40 (Allen's proposal?), so the answer is 60-40. The question asks what Allen initially proposed before the 64-36 split. Wait, the article says that Allen had agreed to 60-40, but Gates wanted 64-36. Wait, the exact wording: "bumping up Gates's share from the 60-40 split that Allen had already agreed to." So the initial was 60-40 (Gates 60, Allen 40?), so the answer is 60.

Wait, the question is "what percentage of Microsoft ownership did Paul Allen initially propose before Gates negotiated the final 64-36 split?" So if Allen agreed to a 60-40 split (Gates 60, Allen 40?), then Allen's initial proposal might have been different, but the article says that Allen had agreed to 60-40, so the answer is 60. The question is about what Allen proposed before the 64-36. Since the 60-40 was what Allen agreed to, the initial proposal might have been different, but the article doesn't say. Wait, the article says "bumping up Gates's share from the 60-40 split that Allen had already agreed to." So the 60-40 was the split Allen agreed to, and Gates wanted 64-36. Therefore, the initial was 60-40. The question asks what Allen initially proposed before the final split. Since the 60-40 was the agreed split before the final, that's the answer. So the answer is 60.

6. **Question 6**: Hours spent with Trump. The article says "a three-hour-long dinner with Donald Trump after the 2024 election." So three hours.

7. **Question 7**: Programming language. The article doesn't mention any specific language he mastered during those sessions. It says he did computer work for fun and profit, but no specific language. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Name of the beloved librarian. The article lists "the beloved librarian" but doesn't provide her name. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Sets of textbooks. The article says he had two sets. "he could leave one set at school and waltz into tests..." So two sets.

10. **Question 10**: Number of Epstein meetings. The article states "Beginning in 2011, he met several times with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein..." but doesn't specify the exact number. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Office equipment from the trip. The mother used an IBM Selectric for the travel log. The question asks which became a symbolic artifact in Microsoft's founding. The article doesn't mention the IBM Selectric being a symbolic artifact. The article says "his mother used her state-of-the-art IBM Selectric to type out a travel log..." but doesn't link it to Microsoft's founding. So N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Therapist's influence on dropping out. The article says the therapist helped him process anger and arrogance but doesn't mention influencing the Harvard decision. So N/A.

13. **Question 13**: Racial segregation policy named. The article says "Seattle was still cleaved by racial segregation" but doesn't name the specific policy. So N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Board game linked to business. The article mentions card games with Gami, but not a specific board game. So N/A.

15. **Question 15**: Political figure inspiring climate strategy. The article mentions MAGA and Trump dinner but doesn't link Trump to climate strategy inspiration. It says he didn't go MAGA but met Trump. The question asks which 2024 election figure inspired his philanthropy for climate. The article doesn't mention this. So N/A.

16. **Question 16**: Weight of nuts compared to contract. The article says he sold 179 pounds, and later compares it to Microsoft's first contract. The exact metaphor is mentioned? The article says "the rest of the book recounts childhood battles... getting precious access to a rare computer... selling 179 pounds of nuts... later metaphorically compares to Microsoft's first major contract." Wait, the text says: "he helped raise money for the Cub Scouts by selling 179 pounds of nuts. Gates knows he had a charmed upbringing... the rest of the book recounts childhood battles with his parents... getting precious access to a rare computer... and getting precious access to a rare computer at his private school. Along with a few high school classmates, an enterprising Gates started doing computer work for fun and profit. As a teenager, Gates would sneak out his bedroom window to code all night at a computer lab. At Harvard, trying to make room for studying as well as programming, he "could be awake for 36 hours at a stretch." The article doesn't explicitly say he compared the 179 pounds to the first contract. The question says "later metaphorically compares to Microsoft's first major contract?" The article might not mention that. The article only mentions the 179 pounds as part of his early competitive streak. So answer N/A.

17. **Question 17**: Female staffer confronting work-life balance. The article mentions "reports trickled out about overtures to female staffers and extramarital affairs." But it doesn't name any specific staffer who confronted him about work-life balance. So N/A.

18. **Question 18**: Reconciling sneaking out vs structured education. The article says his mother emphasized structured education with the travel log, and he sneaked out. The text says "Gates knows he had a charmed upbringing... his mother's emphasis... but he started doing computer work..." The article doesn't explicitly state how he reconciles them. The question asks how he does so in the book. The article says "Source Code contains... his rebellion... his mother's virtues... but he also talks about sneaking out." But the article doesn't say how he reconciles it, so N/A.

19. **Question 19**: Medical diagnosis from childhood. The epilogue mentions he speculates he might be on the autism spectrum. So the answer is autism spectrum.
