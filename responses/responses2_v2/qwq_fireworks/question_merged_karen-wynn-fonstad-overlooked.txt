Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked without inferring beyond the text.

1. The first question asks for the conceptual designer of Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" who praised her work on Anne McCaffrey's novels. Wait, the text mentions Alan Lee as the Oscar-winning designer who mentioned her atlas was vital. But the question mentions Anne McCaffrey's novels. Wait, no—Fonstad's Middle-earth atlas was for Tolkien, not McCaffrey. The McCaffrey one was "The Atlas of Pern". The question might be a trick here. But the text says Alan Lee referred to her Middle-earth atlas. So the answer is Alan Lee. The mention of McCaffrey might be a red herring because the question's last part refers to the book about McCaffrey's novels, but the actual praise was for the Middle-earth book. Hmm, but the question states "a book she wrote about the setting of Anne McCaffrey's novels"—that's "The Atlas of Pern". But the text says Alan Lee praised her atlas (Middle-earth). So maybe the question has an error? Wait the question says "the book she wrote about the setting of Anne McCaffrey's novels"—but the praise from Alan Lee was about her Middle-earth work. Therefore, the question's premise is wrong? But according to the text, the answer should still be Alan Lee. Wait, maybe the question is correct because the McCaffrey atlas was part of her work, but the praise from Lee was for the Middle-earth one. The question might have a mistake, but according to the text, the answer is Alan Lee. So I'll go with that.

2. The second question: How many years after the publication of "The Silmarillion" did she publish her atlas with the grid system? The Silmarillion was published in 1977. Her atlas was published in 1981. So 1981-1977 is 4 years. So the answer is 4.

3. The third question: The magazine where Baird Searles reviewed her work. The text says "Asimov's Science Fiction magazine". So the answer is Asimov's Science Fiction.

4. The fourth question: The year she met the designer in Oklahoma City? Wait the text says she met Alan Lee in Atlanta in 2004. The question mentions Oklahoma City, but the article says Atlanta. So that's conflicting. The text says "at a conference in Atlanta". So the answer would be N/A because the question states Oklahoma City, but the text says Atlanta. Therefore, answer is N/A.

5. The reason for the grid system: The article states "because ancient Middle-earth is canonically flat; the world only later became spherical." So the reason is the flatness of Middle-earth.

6. The note from her husband: "to go to bed". The text says "Her husband left notes on her drafting table reminding her to go to bed."

7. The author she traveled to Ireland for: The text mentions working with Anne McCaffrey in Ireland for "The Atlas of Pern". So Anne McCaffrey.

8. The valley with caldera collapse and orcs: Udun valley. The article says "whether a caldera collapse formed Tolkien's orc-filled Udun valley."

9. Volumes of The History of Middle-earth incorporated: 9 volumes. The text says "incorporated details from nine volumes".

10. Institution she taught at: University of Wisconsin Oshkosh. The text says "teaching geography part time for the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh".

11. The work that spurred her atlas proposal: The publication of "The Silmarillion" in 1977 led her to pitch the atlas.

12. The D&D world she mapped: "Dragonlance World" and "Forgotten Realms". The question asks for the role-playing world. The text mentions both, but the answer should be both? But the question says "which role-playing world"—maybe one of them. The question says "the company associated with D&D", so the answer is either. The text says "Atlas of the Dragonlance World (1987) and The Forgotten Realms Atlas (1990)". Since the question is singular, perhaps the first one? Or maybe either is acceptable. But the question says "which", so need to pick one. Wait the question says "for a collectible atlas commissioned by the company associated with Dungeons & Dragons?" The Forgotten Realms is a primary D&D setting. The answer might be Forgotten Realms. Wait, the question says "which role-playing world"—either is correct. But the text says "both of which are sought-after collectibles". Since the question asks for the name, perhaps either is acceptable, but the exact wording in the text for the first is "Dragonlance World". Let me check the exact question: "which role-playing world did Fonstad map for a collectible atlas commissioned by the company associated with Dungeons & Dragons?" The answer could be either. However, the Forgotten Realms Atlas is mentioned as part of the D&D settings. The text says "a pair of foundational worlds within the Dungeons & Dragons franchise". So maybe both are part of D&D. Since the question asks for one, perhaps "The Forgotten Realms" since it's mentioned in the title. Alternatively, the first one is Dragonlance. The question says "the company associated with D&D" (TSR Inc.), so both are correct, but the answer must pick one. The text says "Atlas of the Dragonlance World (1987) and The Forgotten Realms Atlas (1990)". Since the question is about the collectible atlas, perhaps either is correct. But since the user wants the exact answer from the text, maybe "Dragonlance World" or "Forgotten Realms". Looking back, the question says "which role-playing world"—so the answer is either, but since both are mentioned, perhaps the question expects one of them. Since the text says "a pair of foundational worlds", maybe the first one mentioned? Let me see the exact text: "she released "Atlas of the Dragonlance World" (1987) and "The Forgotten Realms Atlas" (1990)". The question says "which", so maybe either is acceptable, but the user expects the exact wording. Since the question is about the atlas commissioned by TSR, both are correct. But the question might expect one, so perhaps "Dragonlance World" as the first example. Alternatively, the Forgotten Realms. Hmm, the answer might be "Dragonlance World".

Wait, the question says "the company associated with Dungeons & Dragons"—TSR. The Forgotten Realms is a D&D setting. The answer could be either. Since the question says "which", maybe both are correct but need to pick one. Let me check the text again. The article says "both of which are sought-after collectibles still used as reference material by artists working for the franchise." The question asks for "the role-playing world"—so either is acceptable, but the answer must be one. Since the question is in the singular, perhaps the first one mentioned: Dragonlance World.

13. The month abbreviation in the D&D atlas: The text mentions "Flamerule (F) and Eleasias (E)". The question asks for the single month abbreviation noted. So either F or E. The example given is "marked with dates from the months of Flamerule (F) and Eleasias (E)", so possible answers are F or E. The question says "which single month abbreviation", so pick one. Since the question is in the article, the example uses both, but the answer could be either. Since the question is singular, maybe the first one, F.

14. The series the estate declined to authorize: C.S. Lewis's "Chronicles of Narnia". The text says "she started mapping C.S. Lewis's "Chronicles of Narnia," but the Lewis estate ultimately withheld permission for an atlas."

Now, compiling all answers carefully.
