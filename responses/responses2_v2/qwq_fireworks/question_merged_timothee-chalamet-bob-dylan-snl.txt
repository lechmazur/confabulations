Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked and avoid any assumptions beyond the text.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions that during "Outlaw Blues," Chalamet wore dark sunglasses and video screens showed a mountain range. Dylan's 1979 SNL appearance isn't linked to sunglasses here, but the question asks which song Chalamet wore them for. The answer is "Outlaw Blues."

2. **Question 2:** It says Chalamet sang three of the five verses of "Outlaw Blues." So he omitted 2 verses.

3. **Question 3:** The text states that James Blake was on keyboards. There's no mention of him adding lyrics to "Three Angels," so N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The mountain range is mentioned in "Outlaw Blues" performance, so that's the song.

5. **Question 5:** The lyrics mention "nine below zero," so that's the temperature reference.

6. **Question 6:** The article says others like Elvis Presley recorded "Tomorrow Is a Long Time" before Dylan's 1963 version was released in 1971. So first artist is maybe Elvis? Wait, the article lists Judy Collins, Odetta, Ian & Sylvia, the Kingston Trio, Elvis Presley. The question asks which artist first released it. The order isn't clear, but the article says "demoed in the early 1960s, but was recorded by others (Judy Collins, Odetta, Ian & Sylvia, the Kingston Trio, Elvis Presley) before Dylan's own 1963 version was released in 1971." The first would be Judy Collins? But the exact first isn't specified. Since the list starts with Judy Collins, maybe she's first. But the question asks for the first. Since the article doesn't specify order beyond the list, perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "first released a commercial recording"â€”the article lists them in order, but maybe the first is the first in the list? The answer might be Elvis Presley? Wait no, the list includes multiple artists. The article says "recorded by others (Judy Collins, Odetta, Ian & Sylvia, the Kingston Trio, Elvis Presley) before Dylan's own 1963 version was released in 1971." The question is which artist first. The article doesn't specify which was first, so N/A?

Wait, the article says "demoed in early 60s, but recorded by others before Dylan's own 1963 version was released in 1971." So the first commercial recording would be by someone else. The first in the list given is Judy Collins, but maybe the answer is N/A because the article doesn't state the first. Hmm. Alternatively, since the question is "which artist first," but the article doesn't say which was first among the listed, so answer N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Dylan demoed in early 60s, his own version released in 1971. The demo was in early 60s (say 1960-1964?), and his version came out in 1971. The duration is roughly 8-11 years, but exact? The article says "demoed in the early 1960s, ... Dylan's own 1963 version was released in 1971." Wait, "1963 version" but released in 1971. So the demo was early 60s (maybe 1961?), but the version recorded in 1963 was released in 1971. So between 1963 and 1971, that's 8 years. So the answer is 8 years.

8. **Question 8:** The article doesn't mention who directed the animated video segments. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The article says Chalamet "echoed Dylan's phrasing in his own voice," so the modification is using his own voice but keeping phrasing. The question is what modification he made. The answer might be "used his own voice" but the question says "key modification... while maintaining authenticity." The article says "not imitating Dylan's nasality as slavishly as he did in the movie, but still echoing phrasing." So the modification is not imitating nasality, hence "avoided Dylan's nasality."

10. **Question 10:** Chalamet didn't perform any Christian phase songs. Dylan did in 1979, but Chalamet's performances don't mention those. The answer is 0.

11. **Question 11:** The article says Chalamet hosted SNL and was musical guest, but before promoting "A Complete Unknown"? The article says "with his Oscar campaign for best actor revving up, he hosted SNL and sang Dylan songs." The question is how many times he performed before this appearance. The article doesn't mention prior performances, so N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Dylan's concerts keep focus on musicians, but Chalamet used visuals. The element absent is "focus on the musicians" or "keeping focus on the musicians." The article says "Instead of keeping the focus on the musicians, as Dylan does in concert, Chalamet surrounded himself with visual aids..." So the answer is "focus on the musicians."

13. **Question 13:** The second performance was "Tomorrow Is a Long Time," which was done by others before Dylan. Elvis Presley is listed as one of those artists. So the answer is "Tomorrow Is a Long Time."

14. **Question 14:** Same as question 4, "Outlaw Blues" had the mountain range. The critic (Pareles) noted it, so answer is "Outlaw Blues."

15. **Question 15:** The question refers to "A Complete Unknown" where he imitated Dylan's speaking and singing voices. In the monologue, he avoided the nasality. The answer is "nasality."

16. **Question 16:** The band included James Blake on keyboards. The question asks for another English songwriter. The article only mentions James Blake, so N/A.

17. **Question 17:** Dylan's 1979 SNL appearance was for "Slow Train Coming." The article states "three songs from his album 'Slow Train Coming'."

18. **Question 18:** Dylan's own version of "Tomorrow" was released in 1971, according to the article. The former Rolling Stone editor is Jon Pareles, so the answer is 1971.

19. **Question 19:** The lyrics "nine below zero" prompted his wardrobe (hooded parka). The ironic detail is the temperature mentioned, so the answer is "nine below zero."

20. **Question 20:** Dylan's "Three Angels" used gospel-tinged organ. Chalamet's version had electronic effects and video instead. The instrument replaced is "organ," but the question asks what was replaced by video images. The article says "extra lyrics... none of them necessary. Dylan's one... gospel-tinged organ." The video images replaced the organ's role? Or the video was added. The article says "gussied up with animated video images from the lyrics, electronic effects on vocals and extra lyrics..." The instrument central to Dylan's version was the organ. So the answer is "organ."
