Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict format. Let me start with question 1.

1. The first question asks how many workers at the Mercedes-Benz plants in Alabama voted against joining the UAW, according to the union's "supermajority" statement. The article mentions that the UAW lost another vote at two Mercedes-Benz plants in Alabama. However, it doesn't provide specific numbers. The term "supermajority" refers to the Glendale plant workers, not the Mercedes vote. Since the exact number isn't given, the answer is N/A.

2. The second question is about which Trump appointee at the NLRB ruled against labor during his first term. The article states that Trump's appointees were seen as hostile to unions and often ruled in favor of employers. But it doesn't name any specific person. So, N/A here too.

3. Question 3 asks for the percentage of UAW members in Wisconsin who supported Trump in 2024. The text says a significant number supported him in Michigan and Wisconsin but doesn't give a percentage. "Significant" isn't a number, so N/A.

4. The fourth question is when SK On first announced their partnership with Ford for Kentucky plants. The article doesn't mention the announcement date, only that the plants are joint ventures. So N/A.

5. Question 5: Bill Wilmoth mentioned a "supermajority" but the question is about production jobs at full capacity. The article doesn't state the number of jobs, so N/A.

6. The sixth question is the margin of victory in the Chattanooga vote. The article says the UAW won there but no margin is given. So N/A.

7. Question 7 asks the month in 2024 when production began at Glendale. The article mentions the plant is expected to begin production "this year," but without a specific month. Since the article was written in 2024, "this year" is 2024, but the month isn't specified. N/A.

8. The eighth question is the total number of battery plants under construction via Ford-SK On. The article mentions two in Kentucky and Tennessee under construction, plus another in Lansing that GM is selling. Wait, but the Lansing plant is being sold to LG, so it's not part of the current joint venture. The article says the other two are under construction. The answer should be 2? Wait, the article says "two other Ford battery plants" besides Glendale, which are in KY and TN. So total joint venture plants being constructed would be those two plus Glendale? Wait, the Glendale plant is already mentioned as the one where the election is. The question is about the ones being constructed. The article states that the two others (KY and TN) are under construction. So total constructed via the joint venture (BlueOval SK) would be those two plus the Glendale? Wait, the Glendale plant is part of the joint venture. The article says "the new factory in Glendale" which is the joint venture between Ford and SK On. The two others (another KY and TN?) are also joint ventures. Wait, the article says "those plants -- one in Kentucky and the other in Tennessee -- are under construction and are also joint ventures between Ford and SK." So the Glendale is in KY, but the two others are one in KY and TN? Wait, the wording is confusing. Let me check again. The article says: "the plant... is a joint venture between Ford and SK On. [...] A vote to join the U.A.W. would increase the likelihood that workers who were hired at two other Ford battery plants would also become union members. Those plants -- one in Kentucky and the other in Tennessee -- are under construction and are also joint ventures between Ford and SK." So the Glendale plant (KY) is the first one, and the two others are another KY and TN. So total three plants under the joint venture? But the question is about "currently being constructed through the Ford-SK On joint venture?" The Glendale plant is expected to begin production this year, so maybe it's already under construction or completed? The two others are under construction. So the answer is 2? The question is about plants currently being constructed. Since Glendale is "new" and "expected to begin production this year," maybe it's already built. The two others are under construction. So the answer would be 2. Wait, but the article says "two other Ford battery plants" (in KY and TN) under construction, so total of those two plus Glendale? The Glendale plant is part of the joint venture but maybe already built. The question is about plants currently being constructed. So the answer is 2. But I need to check the exact wording. The article says "those plants -- one in Kentucky and the other in Tennessee -- are under construction". So those are two. The Glendale plant is already built? Or is it under construction? The article says "the new factory in Glendale... is a joint venture... expected to begin production this year". So "new factory" might still be under construction? Maybe the three? Hmm, but the question is about the joint venture's plants. The article says the two others (KY and TN) are under construction. So the answer is 2? Or maybe the total number is three (Glendale plus the two others)? The question is "how many total battery plants are currently being constructed through the Ford-SK On joint venture?" The Glendale plant is part of the joint venture, but the article says "those plants (the two others) are under construction". So maybe the answer is 2. But I'm not sure. The article says "the plant" (Glendale) and the two others. So the total constructed via the joint venture would be three? But the question is about those currently being constructed. Since the Glendale is "new" and expected to start production, maybe it's already done. The two others are under construction. So the answer is 2. I'll go with 2, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me note that and proceed.

9. The ninth question asks the salary increases UAW workers received after their 2023 strike. The article says they won "significant wage and benefit gains" but doesn't specify percentages. So N/A.

10. The tenth question is when LG Energy Solution first acquired their stake in Lansing from GM. The article states that GM is set to sell its stake to LG, but the acquisition hasn't happened yet. It says an earlier version incorrectly stated workers there were non-union, but now they are. But the question is when LG acquired it. The article doesn't mention a date. So N/A.

11. The eleventh question is how the 2024 election outcome influenced the timing of the UAW's petition. The article says the election will take place after Trump becomes president again, and his appointees at NLRB might affect it. The union's timing might be influenced by wanting to avoid Trump's NLRB. The answer would be that the petition was filed before Trump's appointees took over the NLRB. The article says the election will happen after Trump becomes president. The union petitioned before his presidency, so the timing was to try to get it resolved before his appointees could influence it. The exact phrasing: "The union election will take place after Mr. Trump becomes president..." so the petition was filed before, but the timing was influenced because the outcome (Trump's presidency) could affect the board's rulings. So the answer is that the petition was filed before Trump's appointees took over the NLRB, but the article says the election will occur after Trump is president, so the outcome's timing was influenced by the election. The question asks how the election's outcome (Trump's win) directly influenced the timing. The answer is that the petition was filed before but the election result meant the vote would occur under Trump's NLRB. The article states that the election will take place after Trump becomes president. So the answer is that the petition was filed before the election, but the timing of the vote is after Trump's presidency, so the outcome (his election) directly influenced when the vote happens. So the answer would be that the petition was filed before Trump's appointees took over the NLRB, but since the election result made him president, the vote would be under his appointees. The question is phrased as "how did the outcome... directly influence the timing..." So the answer is that the UAW's petition was filed before the election, but the election's result (Trump becoming president) caused the vote to be scheduled under his NLRB appointees. The article says "the election will take place after Mr. Trump becomes president and possibly after his appointees have taken over leadership posts..." So the direct influence is that the outcome caused the vote to be held under Trump's NLRB. So the answer is that the petition was filed before the election, but the election's outcome meant the vote would occur under Trump's NLRB. But the question is phrased as "how did the outcome... directly influence the timing..." The answer is that the petition was filed before the election, so the timing was influenced by the expectation that Trump would win, leading to his appointees taking over. The article says the union petitioned on Tuesday, but the election timing is after Trump's presidency. So the answer is that the UAW filed the petition before Trump's appointees took over the NLRB, but the election's timing was pushed to after his presidency due to the outcome. Wait, maybe the direct influence is that the election result (Trump's win) led to the NLRB's composition changing, which affected when the vote could be held. The article says the union petitioned for an election, but it will take place after Trump's appointees are in charge. So the direct influence is that the outcome caused the vote to be under Trump's NLRB. So the answer is that the UAW's petition was filed before Trump's appointees took over the NLRB, but the election's timing was set to occur after his presidency due to the election result. So the answer is "the election will take place after Trump becomes president and his appointees take over the NLRB." But the question is phrased as how the outcome influenced the timing. The answer is that the outcome caused the vote to be scheduled under Trump's NLRB, so the answer is "the UAW's petition was filed before Trump's appointees took over the NLRB, but the election will occur under his administration's board." But the exact wording in the article says the election will take place after Trump becomes president. So the direct influence is that the outcome caused the timing to be after his presidency. So the answer is "the election will take place after Trump becomes president, possibly under his appointees." But the question asks how the outcome directly influenced the timing. The answer is that the outcome caused the vote to be scheduled after Trump's presidency, hence under his NLRB. So the answer is "the election will be held under Trump's NLRB appointees due to his election win." But the question requires a direct answer from the text. The article states "The union election will take place after Mr. Trump becomes president and possibly after his appointees have taken over leadership posts at the labor board." Therefore, the outcome (Trump winning) directly influenced the timing so that the vote occurs after his appointees are in place. The answer is that the petition was filed before, but the timing was set for after Trump's presidency, so the answer is "the petition was filed before Trump's appointees took over the NLRB, but the election will occur after his presidency due to the outcome." But the question is phrased as "how did the outcome... directly influence the timing of the U.A.W.'s petition..." So the answer is that the outcome caused the vote to be scheduled under Trump's NLRB, so the timing was influenced to occur after his presidency. The answer is "the election will take place after Trump becomes president and his appointees take over the NLRB."

12. The twelfth question is the contradictory outcome between the Volkswagen and Mercedes plants. The UAW won at Volkswagen Chattanooga but lost at Mercedes-Benz in Alabama. The answer is that they won at Volkswagen but lost at Mercedes.

13. The thirteenth question asks the strategic advantage a Glendale victory would provide. The article states that a vote there would increase the likelihood workers at the other two joint venture plants (KY and TN) would also join. So the answer is that it would provide momentum for organizing the other Ford-SK plants.
