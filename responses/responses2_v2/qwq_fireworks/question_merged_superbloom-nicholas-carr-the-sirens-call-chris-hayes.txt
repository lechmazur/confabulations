Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information given in the article and answer each exactly as per the instructions. Let's start with question 1.

1. The first question asks about specific radio regulations after the Titanic disaster that Carr credited with preventing later communication failures. The article mentions the Titanic's distress call and amateur messages clogging the airwaves, leading to information overload. But the article doesn't mention any specific regulations implemented afterward that Carr credited. It only says there was a lack of regulation in the US causing the problem. So the answer is N/A.

2. Next, question 2 is about the number of followers the California poppy influencers accumulated. The article describes the super bloom drawing selfie-taking influencers and crowds but doesn't provide any specific numbers or follower counts. So N/A here.

3. Question 3 asks for a percentage decrease in attention span among cable news viewers between the start of Hayes' career and now. The article talks about the marketplace getting more ruthless for attention but doesn't give a specific percentage. So N/A.

4. Question 4 is about a psychological study cited by Hayes linking childhood dependency to social media engagement. The text mentions Hayes uses social science studies about attention, including the idea that people crave attention from childhood dependency, but there's no specific study named. So N/A.

5. Question 5: Zuckerberg's squirrel analogy's influence on Facebook's content moderation. The article states the analogy was part of Facebook's News Feed rationale, but it doesn't say it directly influenced content moderation policies on international news. The focus was on attention competition, not policy changes. So N/A.

6. Question 6 asks for a monetary value Hayes calculated for daily attention span. The article mentions attention being commodified and monetized, but there's no specific figure given. N/A.

7. Question 7: The behavioral experiment comparing print vs social media's neurological effects. The article says Hayes now reads print newspapers, but doesn't mention a specific experiment measuring neurological differences. So N/A.

8. Question 8: Percentage of radio transmissions during Titanic that were amateur vs official. The article says amateur messages clogged the airwaves, but no exact percentage is provided. N/A.

9. Question 9: How "The Shallows" author (Carr) described the transition from letters to texts. The article says Carr laments the shift, calling texting "short, snappy" versus reflective letter-writing. So his view is negative, but the question asks for his description of the improvements. Since he criticizes the transition, there's no positive improvement mentioned. So N/A.

10. Question 10: Hayes' proposed regulatory solution after Titanic to combat infinite scroll effects. The article ends by both authors suggesting reintroducing friction via physical world practices, not a specific regulatory solution. So N/A.

11. Question 11: Energy form Hayes compared to attention, like fracking. The text says attention is like fracking of minds, so the energy is "fracking" or "coal/oil" but the answer should be "fracking" as the analogy. Wait, the question asks what energy is analogous, so the article says "fracking of our minds" so the energy is "coal or oil" but the analogy is to fracking. The question says "form of energy analogous to attention... requiring regulation to prevent harmful extraction." The article says attention is like a resource like coal/oil but the fracking part is the extraction method. The form of energy is coal or oil, but the question might want the analogy as "fracking" but the exact wording in the article is "fracking of our minds", so the energy is like coal/oil. Wait, the question says "energy analogous to attention" so attention is the resource, and fracking is the method. The answer should be "coal or oil" but the question is phrased as "form of energy... analogous to attention", so maybe "attention is like coal/oil" so the answer is "coal or oil". Wait, the article says "attention isn't a resource like coal or oil... but this stage of capitalism is fueled by a fracking of our minds." So the energy is the metaphor for attention, but the form is coal/oil. The answer is coal or oil? The question says "form of energy analogous to attention", so the answer is "coal or oil".

12. Question 12: The flower Hayes cites as a TikTok metaphor. The article mentions Carr's superbloom example but Hayes isn't said to cite the same flower. The question says Hayes uses it, so N/A unless the flower is mentioned for Hayes. The article only says Carr uses the California poppy super bloom. So N/A.

13. Question 13: Year "The Shallows" was published. The article states Carr's 2010 book "The Shallows". So answer is 2010.

14. Question 14: Governmental body enforcing fairness doctrine that Carr blames for media ecosystem. The article says "the public-interest standard" and "fairness doctrine" were part of what the media ecosystem abandoned. Carr is critical of the deterioration, but does he blame a specific regulatory body? The article doesn't name a specific body, just mentions the doctrines. So N/A.

15. Question 15: Psychological condition shared by Trump and influencers. The article says both seek validation: Trump takes any attention, influencers for online validation. The critic (Szalai) attributes this to "relentless pursuit of online validation". The condition isn't named, so N/A.

16. Question 16: Tech advancement from Titanic that Hayes critiques. The Titanic used radio, which is the tech. Hayes critiques Zuckerberg's analogy which relates to Facebook's News Feed. The article says the squirrel analogy was part of Zuckerberg's explanation of the News Feed. So the tech is radio? The question says "initially hailed for life-saving during Titanic, now critiqued for amplifying Zuckerberg's analogy." The article connects radio to Titanic and Zuckerberg's idea as part of the problem. So answer is "radio".

17. Question 17: Literary device used by both authors. The article mentions Carr's "tragic, nebulous concept of human nature" and Hayes' analysis of Trump's behavior. The device could be paradox or irony, as they highlight contradictions. The question says the device highlights the paradoxical nature. The article says "abundance stokes conflict" and "attention's dual role". Maybe paradox is the device. The article says both use "the title refers to a rare superbloom... which drew crowds leading to conflict" and Hayes on Trump's attention-seeking. The device might be metaphor, but the question specifies a device that shows paradox. The answer could be "paradox" or "metaphor". The article says Carr uses the superbloom as a metaphor for online trends, and Hayes uses Trump's behavior to show paradox. The question says both use a device that highlights the paradoxical nature. The article says "the title refers to a rare superbloom... which drew crowds leading to conflict" showing a paradox. So maybe "metaphor" is the device, but the question might want "paradox" as the device. Alternatively, the article mentions "the infinite scroll of the information age" as a paradox of giving what we want but being detrimental. The exact device isn't named, but the question might expect "metaphor" since both use examples (superbloom and Trump) as metaphors. Alternatively, "analogy" but the answer might be "metaphor".

18. Question 18: Print publication Hayes reads now. The article says Hayes now makes a point of sitting down with a print version of the newspaper. So the answer is "the newspaper".
