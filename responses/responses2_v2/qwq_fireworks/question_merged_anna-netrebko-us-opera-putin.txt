Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any external knowledge. Let's go through each question carefully.

1. **Total ticket revenue**: The article mentions there were about 450 attendees, but it doesn't state the ticket prices. Without pricing data, I can't calculate revenue. So, N/A.

2. **Longest applause for an aria**: The article says the encore was "O mio babbino caro" and it had a "prolonged standing ovation." That seems like the longest. Answer: "O mio babbino caro".

3. **Number of protesters arrested**: The text describes protesters but doesn't mention any arrests. So, N/A.

4. **Duration of dance**: The article says she kicked off her heels and danced spiritedly, but no duration is given. N/A.

5. **Board member who proposed**: The article names Veronica Atkins and Frayda Lindemann as sponsors, but not who proposed it. N/A.

6. **Percentage of Met patrons**: No data on audience composition is provided. N/A.

7. **Gown changes**: She wore a flamingo-pink gown and didn't mention changing. Answer: 1 (only one gown described).

8. **Most expensive ticket price**: No ticket prices are mentioned. N/A.

9. **Dedication of encore**: She mentioned Russian music but didn't specify composers. The encore was Puccini, not Russian. The Russian pieces were Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, Rimsky-Korsakov. The final encore wasn't specified as dedicated. N/A.

10. **Number of Met board members**: The article mentions Veronica Atkins and Frayda Lindemann as attendees. That's two. Answer: 2.

11. **Trump official in attendance**: The article mentions wanting to attract Trump's attention but no official attended. N/A.

12. **Gender discrimination claim**: The lawsuit was narrowed to gender discrimination, but the article doesn't specify what the claim was. N/A.

13. **Shostakovich composition**: The Russian music listed includes Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, and Rimsky-Korsakov, but not Shostakovich. N/A.

Wait, let me double-check each:

1. Revenue requires price and attendance. Since price isn't given, N/A.

2. The encore's ovation was prolonged, so that's the longest. The answer is correct.

3. No arrests mentioned.

4. No duration info.

5. No proposer named.

6. No percentage given.

7. The article says "in a ruffled flamingo-pink gown" and doesn't mention another gown, so one change? Wait, actually, she might not have changed. The question is how many times she changed. Since only one gown is mentioned, maybe zero changes. Wait, the question is "how many times did she change her gown". The article says she was in a flamingo-pink gown, and during the dance she kicked off her heels but kept the gown. So no changes. So answer 0? Hmm, the article doesn't mention any other gown. So maybe answer N/A? Wait the question is about the number of gown changes. Since only one is described, perhaps she didn't change, so answer 0? But the article doesn't explicitly say she didn't change. Since there's no info, maybe N/A. Wait the article says "in a ruffled flamingo-pink gown" and that's all. So unless she changed, but no info, so N/A? Hmm. The user might consider that since only one is mentioned, but it's possible she had one gown, so changes would be 0. But the article doesn't say. So safest is N/A.

Wait the question is "how many times did Netrebko change her gown during the Palm Beach performance?" The text only describes her in one gown. Since there's no mention of another, maybe the answer is 0. But since the article doesn't explicitly state that she didn't change, it's safer to go with N/A. I'll check again. The article says "in a ruffled flamingo-pink gown and sparkling heels" at her entrance, and later she kicked off her heels but stayed in the gown. No mention of changing the gown. So she didn't change it. So the answer would be 0? But the instruction says to use only the article. Since it's not stated, maybe N/A. Hmm. The user might expect that since only one is mentioned, the answer is 0, but maybe I should go with N/A. Wait the question is about how many times she changed. Since the article doesn't mention any changes, the answer is 0? Or is it N/A because it's not stated? The instructions say to answer "N/A" if not provided. Since it's not mentioned, N/A. I'll go with N/A for question 7.

10. The article says Veronica Atkins and Frayda Lindemann were sponsors, so two. Answer 2.

12. The lawsuit's gender discrimination claim isn't specified in the text. The article says the case is pending but doesn't detail the claim. So N/A.

13. Shostakovich wasn't mentioned in the Russian pieces she sang. The article lists Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, Rimsky-Korsakov. So N/A.

Okay, that should cover all questions.
