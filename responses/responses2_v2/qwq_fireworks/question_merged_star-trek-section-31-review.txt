Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one based strictly on the provided article. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then cross-referencing the article for answers.

1. **Q1: Which Star Trek series features Lt. Rachel Garrett as a recurring character prior to her appearance in "Section 31"?**  
The article mentions Lt. Rachel Garrett as a future starship captain in "The Next Generation." Since "Section 31" is set before "The Next Generation," her prior series would be "The Next Generation" itself? Wait, but "Section 31" is set in the Lost Era between original movies and TNG. The article says "as fans of 'The Next Generation' know" that she becomes a future captain. So maybe she isn't in TNG yet. Hmm, but the question is about a prior series where she was a recurring character before "Section 31." The article doesn't mention any other series, so maybe it's "The Next Generation" since that's where she becomes a captain. But the article says "future" so she might not have appeared there yet. Wait, the article states she is a future captain in TNG, so prior to "Section 31," she might not have been in any series. The answer might be N/A, but the question says "given her future role... acknowledged in the review." The review just mentions her future role in TNG, so maybe the answer is "Star Trek: The Next Generation." But since she's in "Section 31" first, the prior series isn't mentioned. Maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "prior to her appearance in 'Section 31,'" but the article doesn't say she was in any prior series. So the answer is N/A? Or maybe "The Next Generation" because she's a future captain there? The question is tricky. Let me check again. The article says "as fans of 'The Next Generation' know) a future starship captain." So in "Section 31," she's Lt. Garrett, and in TNG, she becomes a captain. But she might not have been in TNG before "Section 31" since TNG is set later. So prior to "Section 31," she's not in any series. So answer N/A?

Wait, the question is about a series where she was a recurring character before "Section 31." Since the article doesn't mention her being in any prior series, the answer is N/A.

2. **Q2: Explanation for Sven Ruygrok's Vulcan character's Irish accent.**  
The article says "histrionically played by Sven Ruygrok with an inexplicable Irish accent." The word "inexplicable" implies there's no in-universe explanation given. So the answer is N/A.

3. **Q3: How many years after "Discovery" does "Section 31" take place?**  
The article says "the 14th film... set in 2333... originating in 2019 as a spinoff series for Yeoh's character in 'Star Trek: Discovery' (2017-2024)." So "Discovery" ran until 2024, but the film is set in 2333. Wait, the timeline is in the 24th century. Wait, the film's setting is 2333, and Georgiou's origins are from Discovery. The article says "the Lost Era between the original movies and Picard's series 'The Next Generation'." The original movies (like the original series movies) are set in the late 23rd century. "The Next Generation" is set in the 24th. The article doesn't give exact years for Discovery's timeline. Wait, "Discovery" is set in the 23rd century (the same as the original series). But "Section 31" is in 2333, which is part of the Lost Era between original movies (2280s?) and TNG (2360s). So if Discovery is set in the 23rd century, maybe around 2250s? Let's see, the article says "Set in 2333 -- in the so-called Lost Era between the original movies and Picard's series 'Star Trek: The Next Generation'." Original movies are from 1979-1991, but in-universe, those movies are set in the late 2200s (like Star Trek II is 2285). TNG is 2364-2370. So 2333 is between them. The spinoff "Star Trek: Discovery" (2017-2024) is set in the 2250s, according to canon. So 2333 minus 2250s would be around 80 years later. But the article doesn't give exact years. The question asks how many years after Discovery, but the article only mentions "originating in 2019 as a spinoff series for Yeoh's character in 'Star Trek: Discovery' (2017-2024)" — the production years, not the in-universe timeline. The film's in-universe year is 2333, and Discovery's in-universe setting is the 2250s. 2333 - 2250 = 83 years. But the article doesn't specify exact years for Discovery's timeline. The question says "given the film's 2333 setting and Georgiou's origins from that series." So if Georgiou was in Discovery, which is set in the 2250s, then 2333 is about 80 years later. But since the article doesn't give exact years, maybe it's N/A. Wait, the article says "Star Trek: Discovery (2017-2024)" which is the production years, not the in-universe. So the answer might be N/A because the article doesn't specify the in-universe timeline of Discovery. The question is about how many years after Discovery, but without exact dates, can't compute. So answer N/A.

4. **Q4: Real-world event influencing Rob Kazinsky's character's design.**  
The article describes him as "a walking scrap yard" due to illegal mechanical add-ons. The question asks which historical event influenced this. The article doesn't mention any real-world events affecting the design. So N/A.

5. **Q5: Alien tech Georgiou uses to defeat the microbe during the Nostril Invasion.**  
The PG-13 rating mentions "neurotic aliens and a nostril invasion." The article doesn't specify what tech she uses. So N/A.

6. **Q6: Which TNG actor makes a cameo in the coda to set up the sequel?**  
The article says "a major celebrity in this film's coda" but doesn't name them. Since it's about "The Next Generation," maybe Patrick Stewart (Picard) but the article doesn't say. So N/A.

7. **Q7: Name of the parallel universe Georgiou ruled with dehydration tactics.**  
The prologue mentions her heinous past behavior ruling a dehydrated parallel universe. The name isn't given. The term "dehydrated" might refer to the Mirror Universe from earlier Trek, but the article doesn't name it. So N/A.

8. **Q8: 20th-century Earth conflict compared to Section 31's operations.**  
The article says the screenplay "struggles to impart too much info" and mentions the moral paradox of the Federation running a death squad. It doesn't mention a specific historical conflict. So N/A.

9. **Q9: Number of neurotic mutants excluding Vulcan and shape-shifter.**  
The article lists: microbe (Vulcan exoskeleton?), shape-shifter (Sam Richardson), human augment, body-modification addict. The question says excluding Vulcan (the microbe in Vulcan exoskeleton) and shape-shifter. So remaining: human augment (Omari Hardwick) and body-mod (Rob Kazinsky). That's 2. So answer 2.

10. **Q10: Discontinued Star Trek prop repurposed as nightclub decor.**  
The article doesn't mention any specific props from The Original Series used in the nightclub. So N/A.

11. **Q11: Actor who played the Vulcan-exoskeleton microbe with Irish accent and Dalek nod.**  
The article says Sven Ruygrok plays the microbe with an Irish accent, and it reminds the reviewer of Doctor Who's Daleks. So the answer is Sven Ruygrok.

12. **Q12: Character transitioning from parallel ruler to Starfleet target.**  
Georgiou is the one who was a ruthless ruler in the parallel universe and now is a target. So Michelle Yeoh's character, Philippa Georgiou.

13. **Q13: Nervous shape-shifter known from a satirical comedy.**  
Sam Richardson is mentioned as from "Veep," a satirical comedy. So answer Sam Richardson.

14. **Q14: Screenwriter whose involvement increased after a success filling Yeoh's schedule.**  
The article says "Craig Sweeny's screenplay... Yeoh's dance card filled up after the 2022 success of 'Everything Everywhere All At Once.'" So the screenwriter is Craig Sweeny.

15. **Q15: Covert org operating like a death squad under Federation.**  
Section 31 is the black ops group. The article says "why the supposedly ultravirtuous and idealistic Federation is running what appears to be a death squad." So answer Section 31.

16. **Q16: Character with illegal mechanical enhancements as a scrap yard.**  
Rob Kazinsky's character is described as such. So Rob Kazinsky's character's name? The article doesn't name him, just describes him. The question asks for the individual (the actor?), but the name is Rob Kazinsky. Wait, the question says "which individual" — the character's name isn't given, but the actor is Rob Kazinsky. But the question might want the character's name, which isn't provided. The article refers to him as "body-modification addict (Rob Kazinsky)". So answer Rob Kazinsky.

17. **Q17: Operation implicitly criticized for contradicting Federation's idealism.**  
The article says the film didn't explore why the Federation runs a death squad (Section 31). So the operation is Section 31's existence as a death squad.

18. **Q18: Character who's uptight and future captain in TNG.**  
Lt. Rachel Garrett, as stated in the article. The question asks for the character's name, so Rachel Garrett.

19. **Q19: Precise year of the film's timeline.**  
The article says "Set in 2333" so answer 2333.

20. **Q20: Streaming service where the film is available.**  
The article ends with "On Paramount+"
