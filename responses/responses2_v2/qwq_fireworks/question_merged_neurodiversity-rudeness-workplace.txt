Okay, let me go through each question one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article and not anything else. 

1. The first question asks about an alternative training program after emotional intelligence classes failed. The article mentions the managers said he's taking those classes, but there's no mention of another specific program. So the answer is N/A.

2. The second question is about how many years of back pay the boss promised. The article says the boss plans to increase the salary but hasn't committed to closing the gap fully or addressing past years. No specific years mentioned, so N/A.

3. The third question asks for a percentage improvement when the writer took over editing. The article doesn't give any metrics or percentages, just that the writer took over editing. So N/A.

4. The fourth question is about which department head hired him based on technical skills. The text doesn't name any specific department head who hired him, so N/A.

5. The fifth question asks for the salary differential percentage. The article mentions the boss admitted to underpayment but doesn't specify a percentage. It does note women make 84% of men's pay, but that's a general statistic, not the writer's case. So N/A.

6. The sixth question is about the number of formal complaints before the classes. The article doesn't state how many complaints were filed, just that the writer brought issues to managers. So N/A.

7. The seventh question is about disciplinary action after the remote site incident. The article says the department told him to leave and never return, but doesn't mention formal discipline like suspension or termination. So the answer is N/A.

8. The eighth question asks which executive board member protected him. The article mentions an executive-level videographer had to take over projects but doesn't name a board member defending him. So N/A.

9. The ninth question is about the duration of the training. The article mentions emotional intelligence classes but no duration. So N/A.

10. The tenth question asks how many interview subjects withdrew. The article mentions one person felt uncomfortable but no formal withdrawals. So N/A.
