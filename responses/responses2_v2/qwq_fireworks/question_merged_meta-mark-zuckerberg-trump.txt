Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided.

First question: What specific training material contradiction regarding mental illness claims about different groups led to internal confusion before Meta locked access to the documents?

Looking through the article, there's a part that mentions some training materials were confusing and contradictory. It says, "Some of the text said saying that 'white people have mental illness' would be prohibited on Facebook, but saying that 'gay people have mental illness' was allowed, they said." So the contradiction is between prohibiting claims about white people's mental illness but allowing similar claims about gay people. That's the specific contradiction mentioned.

Second question: Which two external groups did Joel Kaplan contact privately to explain Meta's policy shifts before the public announcement, according to the article's related coverage section?

The article states: "The night before Meta's announcement, Mr. Kaplan held individual calls with top conservative social media influencers, two people said." So the groups here are "top conservative social media influencers." But the question asks for two external groups. Wait, maybe I need to check again. The question says "two external groups"—but the text only mentions "top conservative social media influencers" as one group. Hmm, maybe I missed another mention? Let me re-read. The article also mentions Joel Kaplan appearing on Fox & Friends, but that's a media outlet, not a group. The influencers are one group. The article doesn't mention two separate groups here. Wait, maybe the question is a trick? The article says "top conservative social media influencers" as the group contacted. Since the question asks for two, but only one is mentioned, maybe it's N/A? Wait, but the question says "two external groups"—maybe I missed another part. Let me check again. The article says "Mr. Kaplan held individual calls with top conservative social media influencers, two people said." Only one group is mentioned here. So the answer might be N/A? Wait, but the question says "two external groups"—so perhaps there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the fact-checking groups? But the article says fact-checking groups were mentioned in the context of their denial of bias. Wait, the question is about Joel Kaplan contacting groups before the announcement. The only explicit mention is the conservative influencers. So maybe the answer is "top conservative social media influencers" as the only group, but the question asks for two, so N/A? Wait, perhaps the article says he contacted two groups? Let me check again. The article says "held individual calls with top conservative social media influencers"—so that's one group. The question asks for two, so maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe the answer is "top conservative social media influencers and Fox & Friends?" But Fox & Friends is a TV show, not a group. The article also mentions that he appeared on Fox & Friends after the announcement. So before the announcement, only the influencers. Therefore, the answer should be N/A? Hmm, but the user might expect the answer to be "top conservative social media influencers" but since it's only one group, perhaps the question is incorrect, leading to N/A. Alternatively, maybe the article mentions another group. Wait, the article says "he assembled a team of no more than a dozen close advisers and lieutenants, including Joel Kaplan..." but that's internal. The only external contact mentioned before the announcement is the influencers. So the answer is N/A because the question asks for two, but only one is mentioned. Wait, but the question says "two external groups"—maybe the answer is "N/A" because only one is listed. Alternatively, maybe the question is misinterpreted. Let me check again. The question is about Joel Kaplan contacting two groups before the announcement. The article only mentions one group (conservative influencers). Therefore, the answer is N/A.

Third question: Which U.S. government agency did Trump target for closure hours before Meta announced its policy changes, according to the article's related coverage section?

Looking at the related coverage sections after the main article, there's a section titled "U.S.A.I.D.: Trump directly called for the closure of the U.S. Agency for International Development, the government's main provider of global humanitarian and development aid, just hours before most of its staff were expected to be suspended with pay or laid off." So the agency is the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The timing is "hours before" which matches the question's timeframe. So the answer is USAID.
