Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the provided article and follow the instructions strictly.

1. The first question asks about the percentage of annual salary offered in the buyout package, mirroring Musk's structure at Twitter. The article mentions the package offers eight months of pay. Since the question is about the percentage of annual salary, eight months would be roughly 66.67%, but the article doesn't state it as a percentage. Wait, the exact wording is "eight months of pay". The question might want the percentage, but the article doesn't convert that to a percentage. Hmm, maybe it's N/A? Wait, maybe they just want the eight months part, but the question specifies "percentage of annual salary". Since it's not stated as a percentage, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "mirroring the structure Elon Musk implemented at X". The article says Musk's plan at Twitter had similar terms, but the article doesn't mention the percentage there either. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says the buyout offers employees eight months of pay. So the answer is eight months, but the question asks for percentage. Since the article doesn't give a percentage, it's N/A. Wait, but maybe eight months is equivalent to 2/3 of a year, so 66.67%, but that's an inference. Since the question specifies "percentage of annual salary", and the article only mentions "eight months of pay", the exact percentage isn't stated. So the answer is N/A?

Wait, let me check the article again. The article says "buyout offer" which "offers employees eight months of pay". The question is asking for the percentage of their annual salary. Since eight months is 66.67%, but the article doesn't state it as a percentage. The question might be expecting the 8 months converted to a percentage, but since it's not explicitly stated, perhaps the answer is N/A? Or maybe the question is a trick because it's asking for the percentage, and the article doesn't give that number. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A here.

Wait, maybe I misread. Let me look again. The article says "offers employees eight months of pay". The question is about the percentage of their annual salary. Since eight months is 2/3, but unless the article states it as a percentage, we can't say. So N/A.

2. Second question: Senator Tim Kaine's opposition cites a specific legislative act challenging the president's authority, referencing the earlier blockage of freezing federal grants. The article says Senator Kaine "told The Wall Street Journal that the president did not have the authority to execute the 'deferred resignation' orders." But it doesn't mention a specific legislative act. The blockage was of the president's order to freeze trillions in grants and loans, which was blocked by a federal judge. The question asks what legislative act Kaine cited. Since the article doesn't name any specific law, the answer is N/A.

3. Third question: Brian Niccol's comments mention a target time for Starbucks orders. The article says Starbucks had an annual sales drop and Niccol's goal was "four minutes" which is falling short. The answer is 4.

4. Fourth question: Caroline Kennedy claimed her cousin's views would exacerbate a specific disease. The article mentions Caroline Kennedy called her cousin a predator but doesn't mention a specific disease. The opposition from industry figures includes concerns about FDA, vaccines, pesticides, etc. David Ricks of Eli Lilly mentions defending FDA, and John Driscoll called Kennedy a danger. The question asks what disease Caroline Kennedy linked. The article doesn't specify a disease. So N/A.

5. Fifth question: ASML's projected sales increase percentage for the next quarter. The article states ASML reported "blowout earnings and an upbeat sales outlook" but doesn't give a specific percentage increase. So N/A.

6. Sixth question: The dollar amount of federal grants and loans the president's order tried to freeze. The article says a federal judge blocked the president's order to freeze "trillions of dollars in federal grants and loans". The exact amount isn't specified beyond "trillions", but the question asks for the specific dollar amount. Since it's "trillions", but not exact, maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "freeze trillions of dollars", so the answer is trillions. But the question says "specific dollar amount". Since it's not exact, maybe N/A. Alternatively, if "trillions" is acceptable, but the question says "specific", which might require a number like $1 trillion, but the article just says "trillions". So N/A.

7. Seventh question: Final month a worker would receive full pay if opting for buyout. The email says "get full pay through the end of September". So the final month is September.

8. Eighth question: Which tech leader's prior approach is compared to the federal plan? The article mentions Musk's approach at Twitter as the comparison, so Elon Musk.

9. Ninth question: Proportion of federal workers' resignations for $100 billion saving. The article states Musk's PAC says if up to 10% resign, saving around $100B. So the answer is 10%.

10. Tenth question: Managing partner at Andreessen Horowitz to lead OPM. The article mentions Scott Kupor as managing partner at Andreessen Horowitz, nominated to lead OPM (awaiting Senate confirmation). So Scott Kupor.

11. Eleventh question: Semiconductor manufacturer noted for soaring shares. The article mentions ASML, a Dutch semiconductor equipment maker.

12. Twelfth question: Nominee criticized both pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. The article discusses Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination, where he's criticized GMOs, pesticides, corn syrup, vaccines. So Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

13. Thirteenth question: Coffee chain struggling with four-minute orders. The article mentions Starbucks's annual sales drop and Niccol's comments on the four-minute target.

14. Fourteenth question: Chinese start-up accused of distillation. The article discusses DeepSeek, accused by OpenAI of distillation.

15. Fifteenth question: Columnist and founder of DealBook. The article's byline includes Andrew Ross Sorkin as the founder of DealBook.

Let me check each again:

1. The question asks for the percentage of annual salary. The article says eight months of pay. 8/12 is 66.67%, but since it's not stated as a percentage, the answer is N/A.

2. No legislative act named by Kaine, so N/A.

3. 4 seconds, yes.

4. No specific disease mentioned by Caroline, so N/A.

5. ASML's sales increase percentage not given, N/A.

6. The article says "trillions of dollars", but no specific amount. The question asks for specific dollar amount, so N/A.

7. September.

8. Elon Musk.

9. 10%.

10. Scott Kupor.

11. ASML.

12. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

13. Starbucks.

14. DeepSeek.

15. Andrew Ross Sorkin.

Okay, that's all. Now to format them correctly.
