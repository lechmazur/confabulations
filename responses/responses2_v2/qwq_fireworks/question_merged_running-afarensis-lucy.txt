Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions Lucy's top running speed was 11 mph. But the question is about average speed over 5 km. The text doesn't specify average speed for a distance, just the top speed. So maybe N/A?

2. **Question 2:** The simulation tried millions of sequences. The exact number of muscle configurations isn't stated. The answer might be N/A unless "millions" counts, but that's vague.

3. **Question 3:** The muscular architecture used was modern apes. The text says "muscular architecture of modern apes" for the model. So answer: modern apes.

4. **Question 4:** When humanlike muscles were added, energy was comparable. With apelike, it was 3x more. So the improvement would be 3 times less, but the question asks for percentage improvement. Maybe 66%? Wait, the article says "three times as much energy" with apelike, so humanlike is 1/3. The efficiency improvement would be 200%? Not sure. The question might not have exact numbers. The text says "comparable" with humanlike, so maybe the percentage isn't given. Hmm, maybe N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Altitude of discovery? The article doesn't mention altitude. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Metabolic cost compared to modern human. The text says with apelike muscles, she spent 3x as much. So maybe 3 times higher? The question is phrased as "compared to a modern human of equivalent body mass." So answer: 3 times higher? The article states "three times as much energy running as a modern human." So answer: 3 times higher.

7. **Question 7:** Number of tree species in habitat? The text mentions areas with woodlands and grassland but no specific count. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Length of Achilles tendon. The article says Lucy's Achilles was "little more than stub," but no exact measurement. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Closest modern animal in biomechanics. The article compares her top speed to a domestic pig at 11 mph. So answer: domestic pig.

10. **Question 10:** Survival rate of burst runners vs endurance. The article doesn't give survival rates. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The anatomical component is the Achilles tendon. The text says "Achilles tendon acts like a spring." So answer: Achilles tendon.

12. **Question 12:** Cause of death from 2016 autopsy was a fall from a tree. The article states she died from a fall. Answer: fall from a tree.

13. **Question 13:** Researcher using simulations: Dr. Karl Bates. The lead author mentioned. Answer: Karl Bates.

14. **Question 14:** Body measurements of 5'9", 154 lbs: Dr. Bates himself. The text says "Dr. Bates, who is 38." So answer: Karl Bates.

15. **Question 15:** Reconstruction method combining fossil and muscles: virtual reconstruction. The text says "virtual reconstruction of her leg and pelvic muscles." Answer: virtual reconstruction.

16. **Question 16:** Missing adaptation in Lucy: long, elastic Achilles tendons and shorter muscle fibers. The article states she lacked these. So answer: long, elastic Achilles tendons and shorter muscle fibers.

17. **Question 17:** Domestic animal benchmark: domestic pig. The article says 11 mph is "roughly what a domestic pig could achieve." Answer: domestic pig.

18. **Question 18:** Contrast species with endurance: Homo erectus. The text says Homo erectus was an endurance runner. Answer: Homo erectus.

19. **Question 19:** Alteration leading to energy efficiency: humanlike ankle muscles. The text says "when humanlike ankle muscles were added... energy expenditure was comparable." Answer: humanlike ankle muscles.

20. **Question 20:** Artifact with fertility ritual: Psychedelic Traces on Ancient Egyptian Mug. The article mentions "Egyptians may have used hallucinogens as part of a fertility rite." Answer: Ancient Egyptian Mug (or the exact name mentioned, but the article says "Psychedelic Traces on Ancient Egyptian Mug" so maybe that's the artifact. The question asks for the artifact's name. The exact phrase is "Psychedelic Traces on Ancient Egyptian Mug" but the answer would be the mug itself. The article says "a Psychedelic Traces on Ancient Egyptian Mug: Egyptians may have used..." so the artifact is the mug. So answer: Ancient Egyptian Mug (but the exact title is "Psychedelic Traces on Ancient Egyptian Mug" but the question asks for the artifact, so maybe just "Ancient Egyptian Mug" or the full title? The article's heading is "Psychedelic Traces on Ancient Egyptian Mug" so that's the artifact's name. So answer: Ancient Egyptian Mug with psychedelic traces? Wait, the exact wording in the article is: "Psychedelic Traces on Ancient Egyptian Mug: Egyptians may have used hallucinogenic substances as part of a fertility rite..." So the artifact is the mug. So the answer is "Ancient Egyptian Mug".
