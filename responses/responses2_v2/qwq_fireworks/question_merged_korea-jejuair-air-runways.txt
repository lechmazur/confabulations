Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer strictly based on that. Let me start with the first question.

1. Which international aviation organization first raised concerns about the concrete barrier's placement at Muan Airport following the crash investigation?

The article mentions the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), but the text says that South Korean officials reviewed structures after the crash. The article states that Sangdo Kim urged international action, but I don't see any mention of an organization first raising concerns. The ICAO is referenced in their safety standards, but the article doesn't say they raised concerns first. So maybe N/A?

Wait, the article says officials initially said the barrier met regulations, but later they reviewed. The ICAO's guidelines are mentioned, but no specific organization raised concerns first. So answer N/A.

2. How many minutes of flight recorder data were successfully recovered and analyzed from the Jeju Air crash before the device malfunctioned?

The article says the flight recorder didn't capture the final four minutes. So total data recovered would be total minus 4, but the article doesn't say how much was recovered. Since it's not stated, N/A.

3. When did the Korea Airports Corporation initially implement their frangible structure requirements for navigation equipment housing?

The article says the Korea Airports Corporation declined to comment but would cooperate. No info on when they first implemented frangible structures. N/A.

4. What material did aviation experts recommend as the optimal replacement for the concrete barriers at South Korean airports?

The article says structures should be frangible (break or give way). The materials mentioned as compliant are easily breakable, like Incheon's. So the optimal material would be frangible materials like breakable ones. The answer is "frangible materials" but maybe more specific? The article says "frangible, meaning they should break or give way". The exact material isn't specified except that Incheon used "easily breakable materials". So maybe the answer is "easily breakable materials".

5. How many passengers survived the initial impact but later succumbed to their injuries in the Jeju Air crash?

The article states 179 of 181 died. So 2 survived initially, but it's possible they died later. But the article doesn't specify how many died after impact. The question is about those who survived impact but later died. Since the total deaths are 179, maybe both survived the impact but died later? But the article says "killing 179 of the 181 people onboard." So 2 survived. The answer might be 2, but the question is about those who survived initial impact but later succumbed. Since the article doesn't split it, maybe N/A? Wait, the article doesn't say if the 2 survived the crash entirely or died later. So answer N/A.

6. Which former South Korean aviation official first identified the structural inconsistencies at domestic airports during their tenure?

The article mentions Sangdo Kim, a former ambassador to the UN aviation agency and deputy minister, urged international action. But did he identify the inconsistencies during his tenure? The article says "government investigators found" the structures. The former official's role is in urging action, not necessarily identifying during his tenure. So maybe N/A unless it's Sangdo Kim. Wait, the text says "government investigators found" so the official's role here is different. The question is who first identified during their tenure. The article doesn't name anyone else, so maybe N/A.

7. What was the flight speed of Jeju Air 7C2216 when it made contact with the concrete barrier?

No data on speed given. N/A.

8. How many previous incidents involving runway barriers had occurred at South Korean airports in the decade before this crash?

The article doesn't mention previous incidents. N/A.

9. What weather conditions were reported at Muan International Airport at the time of the Jeju Air crash?

No weather details provided. N/A.

10. How many meters beyond the recommended ICAO buffer zone did the Jeju Air Flight 7C2216's wreckage ultimately come to rest after colliding with the barrier?

The barrier was 250 meters from the runway end. The ICAO recommends 300 meters. Wait, the article says the ICAO guideline is 300 meters (984 feet). The structure was 250 meters from the runway end, so it's within the buffer? Wait, the buffer zone is supposed to extend 300m. If the barrier was at 250m, then it's inside the recommended zone. But the question is how far beyond. The wreckage would be beyond the runway, but the barrier is at 250m. The article says the structure was surrounded by dirt, but the exact distance the wreckage went beyond isn't stated. The question is about the wreckage's rest position beyond the ICAO's 300m. Since the barrier is at 250m, maybe the plane went further, but the article doesn't say. So N/A.

11. What material, similar to that used in the construction of the navigation device housing at Incheon International Airport, does the transport ministry plan to mandate for all South Korean airports?

The article says Incheon's localizers were in structures made of easily breakable materials. So the answer is "easily breakable materials".

12. Which city, served by an airport with a substandard concrete structure, is located closest to the site of the Jeju Air crash?

The crash was at Muan International Airport. The substandard airports include Muan and others like Gwangju, Yeosu, Pohang, Gyeongju. The closest would be Muan itself, but the question asks for a city served by an airport with the structure. Muan's airport is the crash site, so the city served by Muan is Muan. But the question might be looking for another city. Wait, the article lists three smaller airports serving Gwangju, Yeosu, Pohang, and Gyeongju. Wait, the article says "three smaller airports in South Korea -- which serve the cities of Gwangju, Yeosu, Pohang and Gyeongju". Wait that's four cities. So the closest to Muan might be one of these. But without knowing locations, can't determine. The article doesn't say. So N/A.

13. Following the transport ministry's review, what percentage of South Korean airports were found to have navigation structures failing to meet frangibility standards?

The ministry said 7 out of 14 airports had non-compliant structures. 7/14 is 50%, so 50%.

14. What specific type of navigation aid, housed within the concrete structure struck by Jeju Air Flight 7C2216, was identified as a potential factor in the severity of the crash?

The article mentions the barrier contained a localizer, an antenna array used to guide landings. So the answer is "localizer".

15. What international organization's safety recommendations were initially cited by South Korean officials as having been met by the barrier at Muan International Airport?

The officials initially said the barrier met regulations. The ICAO sets standards. So the answer is "International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)" or "ICAO".

16. What was the registration number of the flight that crashed at Muan International Airport, leading to a nationwide review of airport safety structures?

The flight is referred to as Jeju Air Flight 7C2216. The registration number (like HL7238) isn't given. The question asks for the registration number, not the flight number. Since the article doesn't provide the registration number, answer N/A.

17. What governmental entity, responsible for overseeing Muan International Airport, stated its commitment to implementing the transport ministry's forthcoming safety improvements?

The Korea Airports Corporation operates Muan and said they would cooperate. So the answer is "Korea Airports Corporation".

18. According to Sangdo Kim, what kind of inspection should all countries undertake to prevent accidents similar to the Jeju Air crash?

He urged countries to check their localizer-housing structures on a voluntary basis. So "voluntary inspection of localizer-housing structures".

19. Which airport's localizer structures were cited as meeting safety standards despite the discovery of non-compliant materials at other South Korean airports?

Incheon International Airport's structures were made of easily breakable materials, so they are compliant. The answer is "Incheon International Airport".

20. What was the primary reason the concrete barrier at Muan International Airport failed to comply with international aviation safety guidelines?

The guidelines require frangible structures. The barrier was concrete, which is hard and doesn't break. The primary reason is non-frangible material. The answer is "use of non-frangible (hard) materials".

21. How many survivors were officially confirmed in the Jeju Air crash before the flight recorder’s data gap was identified?

Total deaths 179 out of 181, so 2 survived. The data gap is about the last 4 minutes, but the survival count is given as 2. The answer is 2.

22. What material was used in the construction of the localizer housing at Incheon International Airport that differentiated it from the non-compliant structures at other airports?

Incheon used "easily breakable materials".

23. Which former government official linked the Jeju Air crash to the need for mandatory international reviews of runway safety areas?

Sangdo Kim, the former ambassador and deputy minister, urged international action. So his name.

24. What critical mechanical failure was directly identified as the cause of the Jeju Air plane’s inability to deploy its landing gear during the final approach?

The article says the plane landed without wing flaps or landing gear deployed, but the cause is under investigation. No specific mechanical failure is stated as the cause. So N/A.

25. How many meters short of the U.N.-recommended buffer zone was the concrete barrier located at Muan Airport’s runway safety area?

The ICAO recommends 300m, and the barrier was at 250m. So 300-250=50 meters short. The answer is 50.

26. Which government-owned entity responsible for operating Muan Airport publicly refused to acknowledge the transport ministry’s findings about non-compliant structures?

The Korea Airports Corporation declined to comment on the findings but would cooperate. "Declined to comment" might count as refusal to acknowledge. So answer is "Korea Airports Corporation".

27. What specific feature of the localizer barrier at Muan Airport was retroactively criticized by aviation experts for exacerbating the collision’s impact?

The article says the concrete barrier could make damage worse if hit. The feature is the hard materials (concrete or steel). The answer is "concrete construction" or "non-frangible materials". The exact wording from the article: "structures with navigation devices were built with hard materials, such as concrete or steel, that could make damage worse if a plane collided with them".

Now, let me go back and check each answer against the article again to ensure accuracy.
