Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1:** The real-life Rose (from "Gypsy") had daughters before managing Gypsy Rose Lee. The article mentions "her daughters' 1920s childhoods" implying she had more than one. But the exact number isn't given. Since it's not specified, I'll put N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The article talks about gender equity leading to shifts, but there's no specific percentage mentioned. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The character who becomes an animal is in the movie "Nightbitch," not the stage plays. The question asks about "The Hills of California," so N/A.

4. **Question 4:** "The Blood Quilt" mentions the daughters gathering to mourn, but no specific therapeutic technique like a quilt is mentioned. The name "Blood Quilt" might imply it, but the article doesn't state it. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The letter from Harry's mother is part of "Suffs," but the article doesn't say how many votes it secured. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The guest in "Cult of Love" is Barbie Ferreira's character. The first name starts with B, so Barbie.
