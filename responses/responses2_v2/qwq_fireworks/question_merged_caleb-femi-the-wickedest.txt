Okay, let me start by reading through the questions carefully and then go back to the article to find the answers. 

Question 1: The question is about the structural element Femi used in "Poor" to represent the fleeting nature of fame. The article mentions in "Poor" the narrator's line about crossing over and the hood not taking him back because he "stinks of uptown." The structural element here is probably the skyscraper or tall buildings mentioned. Wait, the article says "similar tall and anonymous concrete housing in 'The Wickedest,' for example when the narrator announces..." So in "Poor," the same kind of housing is there. The fleeting fame is tied to the narrator's change in relation to his home, so maybe the structural element is the "belly of the bourgeois" or "high ceilings, grand windows." But the question is about the structure used to represent fleeting fame. The exact quote is "I crossed over & now the hood won't take me back. I stink of uptown, high ceilings, grand windows -- they know that I room in the belly of the bourgeois." The structure here is the "belly of the bourgeois," but maybe the structural element is the "concrete housing" from "Poor"? Wait, the question is about the previous work "Poor" and the structure representing the fleeting nature of fame. The answer might be the "concrete housing" or the "skyscraper" mentioned in "The Wickedest" but since it's from "Poor," maybe the North Peckham Estate's tall buildings. The article says "similar tall and anonymous concrete housing in 'The Wickedest'" so in "Poor" it's the same, so the structural element is "tall concrete housing."

Question 2: Femi equates Joshua Bennett's line "Lord, if you be / at all, be / a blade" with a musical instrument. The article says Femi "smuggles in this line from 'The Sobbing School,' by Joshua Bennett: 'Lord, if you be / at all, be / a blade.'" But where is the musical instrument? The question says in the context of "The Wickedest" party. Wait, the article mentions Femi's mother's heartbeat as his original bass line. So the blade line is a metaphor, maybe the blade is a sword, but the question asks what instrument he equates it with. Alternatively, maybe the blade is compared to a musical instrument? The article doesn't directly link the blade to an instrument. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A? Or perhaps the "blade" is likened to the bass line? Wait, the question says "in the context of The Wickedest party." The line is from Bennett's poem, but Femi uses it in his work. The question might be looking for the "blade" as a metaphor for something else, but I can't find a direct instrument. Maybe N/A?

Wait, the question says "what musical instrument does he equate with Joshua Bennett's line..." Maybe the line itself is a blade, so the instrument is a sword? But that's not an instrument. Alternatively, maybe the blade is a metaphor for the music's sharpness, but the article doesn't say. Hmm. Let me check again. The article states Femi uses the line from Bennett, but doesn't equate it to an instrument. So maybe N/A?

Question 3: The DJ's warning about asbestos risks. The article mentions "the asbestos of worry" in "The Wickedest." The party's exit instruction is "don't speak of what you saw... cobwebs, stinky food and trick mirrors." If the DJ were to warn about asbestos, maybe he'd say something like "avoid the asbestos in the building" but the question wants an instruction mirroring the existing advice. The existing advice is to not talk about the party. So maybe the DJ would say "Don't breathe in the asbestos" or "Avoid the asbestos in the walls." But the instruction given to leavers is to say they saw nothing. So maybe "Don't mention the asbestos" but the question is about health risks. The article doesn't mention any actual asbestos in the party, just the metaphor of worry. So maybe N/A? Or perhaps the instruction would be similar to the existing one: "Don't breathe the asbestos-laden air" but that's not in the text. Since the article only mentions "asbestos of worry," not real asbestos, the answer might be N/A.

Question 4: Femi's description of dancing as falling from a skyscraper and learning flightâ€”what element of a pop song does this resemble in terms of impact? The article compares "The Wickedest" to "Howl" in Lucy Sante's question about a poem's impact like a pop song. The dancing's impact is compared to a pop song's tenacity. The line "Dancing is your body falling from a skyscraper / and suddenly learning flight" uses imagery of transformation. The element of a pop song that has lasting impact is its "tenacity" or "grip." The question asks what element this resembles. The answer might be "tenacity" but the options are elements like melody, lyrics, etc. The article says "grip it with the tenacity of a pop song." So the element is tenacity, but the question wants what the dancing's description resembles. Since the dance's impact is like the pop song's tenacity, maybe the answer is "tenacity." But the question is phrased as "most closely resemble, in terms of its impact on the world?" So the impact is like a pop song's tenacity. So the answer is "tenacity."

Question 5: The line from "The Sobbing School" is "blade." The question asks for a kitchen item similar to cereal with cooking oil that symbolizes desperation. The article mentions "breakfast cereal eaten with cooking oil" in "The Wickedest" as an image. The "angels" part: the article says "an angel is anyone who visits the desperate with news." So the kitchen item symbolizing desperation would be something like cooking oil (since cereal with cooking oil is mentioned). But the question wants an item similar to that, used to symbolize desperation. Maybe "cooking oil" itself? Or another item like "stinky food" (mentioned in the exit instruction). Wait, the question says "kitchen item similar to cereal eaten with cooking oil" used to symbolize desperation. The answer might be "cooking oil" but the question wants a different item. Alternatively, "asbestos" is a material, not kitchen. Maybe "smudges of makeup" but that's not kitchen. Hmm. The article says "breakfast cereal eaten with cooking oil" is an image in "The Wickedest." The angel line is in "Poor," perhaps? The question says in "The Wickedest," so the kitchen item there is cereal with cooking oil. The symbol for desperation would be that. But the question wants another item. Wait, maybe "stinky food" is mentioned at the end, but that's not a kitchen item. Alternatively, "asbestos of worry" is not kitchen. Maybe N/A? The question might be looking for "cooking oil" itself, but since it's part of the cereal example, maybe "cooking oil" is the answer. Let me check again: the line from "The Sobbing School" is in "Poor" or "The Wickedest"? The article says Femi uses it in "Poor," perhaps. Wait, the article says "In that book [Poor], he observes..." about hipsters and rent. The angel line is in "Poor" too. The question asks for a kitchen item in "The Wickedest" symbolizing desperation. The cereal with cooking oil is already mentioned there. So maybe that's the answer, but the question wants a similar item. Since the question says "similar to cereal eaten with cooking oil," perhaps "smudges of makeup" is not kitchen. Maybe the answer is N/A? Or perhaps "cooking oil" is the answer, but the question wants a different item. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, the angel line's symbol of desperation might be the "asbestos of worry," but that's not a kitchen item. Maybe the answer is N/A.

Question 6: Architectural feature in "Poor" causing rising rent from hipsters taking selfies. The article says "When hipsters take selfies on the corners where our friends died, the rent goes up." The architectural feature there is the "corners" where friends died, but the question asks for a feature akin to the "secret city of flair" (which is the party's atmosphere). The increasing rent is caused by hipsters, so the structure is the location where friends died (the corners), but the architectural feature might be the "North Peckham Estate" (public housing). The question is asking for a feature similar to the "secret city of flair" but in "Poor" causing rent rise. The "secret city" is the party's atmosphere, so the counterpart in "Poor" is the public housing estate. The architectural feature is "concrete housing" or "North Peckham Estate." The answer would be "North Peckham Estate" or "concrete housing."

Question 7: If the direct deposit is delayed, what deceptive statement would the character make, similar to party lies like "Link up soon." The article mentions "lists of lies people tell at parties ('Link up soon')." The character waiting for direct deposit at midnight might say something insincere like "Everything's fine" or "No worries," but the question wants a statement similar to the party lies. So maybe "Link up soon" is the example, so the answer would be something like "I'll get it sorted" or another generic lie. The article doesn't give a specific example, so maybe N/A? Or perhaps the answer is "Link up soon" again, but that's already listed. The question says "similar to those made at parties," so the answer is one of the listed lies. Since only "Link up soon" is given, maybe N/A? Or maybe the answer is "I'll get back to you later" as a common party lie. The article doesn't specify, so perhaps N/A.

Question 8: Visual element from "Poor" comparable to cobwebs in "The Wickedest." The article mentions photos in "Poor" are worth the price. The end of "The Wickedest" says "cobwebs, stinky food and trick mirrors." The economic disparity in "Poor" is shown through the photos. The visual element in "Poor" that's similar might be the photos of the North Peckham Estate. The cobwebs symbolize neglect, so in "Poor," the photos of the public housing or the corners where friends died. The answer might be "photos of the North Peckham Estate" or "the photos in 'Poor'." The question asks for a visual element comparable to cobwebs, so maybe "photos of crumbling buildings" or "images of neglect." The article says "When hipsters take selfies on the corners where our friends died, the rent goes up." The photos in "Poor" might capture that, so the answer is "photos of the corners where friends died."

Question 9: Urban structure in "Poor" mirroring the anonymity of housing in "The Wickedest." The article mentions "similar tall and anonymous concrete housing in 'The Wickedest'" which refers to the North Peckham Estate from "Poor." The urban structure is the "tall concrete housing" or "North Peckham Estate." The question is about the location where friends died in "Poor," which is the corners of the estate. So the structure is "North Peckham Estate's concrete buildings."

Question 10: Advertisement for the party would be least suitable in what publication. The party's first rule is not to talk about it. So the least suitable is a public one, like the "Book Review" or "magazine." The article mentions the party isn't advertised, so a publication like a newspaper or magazine. The question says reflecting "Howl's impact," which was a public poem. So the least suitable is a public medium. The answer could be "The New York Times" but the question wants a type, like "mainstream magazine" or "public newspaper." The article mentions "The Times" as the source, so maybe "The New York Times" but the question wants the type. Alternatively, "a mainstream publication" or "national newspaper." The article says "independent reviewed book through our site" so maybe the answer is "a mainstream publication."

Question 11: Real-life artist whose lyrics are in the mother's heartbeat as bass line. The article says "Femi considers his mother's heartbeat to be his original bass line, and her womb 'the first room I danced in.'" There's no mention of a specific artist here, so N/A.

Question 12: Historical protest movement analogous to the "secret city of flair." The article doesn't mention a specific historical movement, so N/A.

Question 13: The poet who wrote "Swing! your partner..." is A.R. Ammons. The article says "intentionally dowdy bit of A.R. Ammons's verse: 'Swing! / your partner, / promenade (and when / you can / get laid / get laid).'" So the answer is A.R. Ammons.
