Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I use only the information from the article provided. Let me start by going through each question and cross-referencing with the text.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions Amy Schultz suggesting to increase effort by 5-10% each month. The question asks about weekly increase, but the text specifies monthly. Since the question is about weekly, the answer would be N/A because it's monthly, not weekly.

2. **Question 2**: Dr. Tanaka emphasizes bone density, so high-impact exercises like sprinting would need gradual introduction. Since the question is about what to least prioritize initially, maybe high-impact like sprinting itself? Wait, the article says they shouldn't avoid impact entirely but need to introduce it gradually. The least priority might be explosive movements before building base. The article says to start with building muscle and stability first. So maybe explosive movements like sprinting would be least prioritized initially. But the question is about a woman starting sprinting. Wait, the advice for someone starting sprinting would need to build a base first. The least priority initially would be the explosive movements themselves before the foundation. But the question is phrased as "type of exercise least prioritize initially", so perhaps explosive movements like sprinting are to be introduced later. So the answer might be sprinting itself? Wait, the question says "given the emphasis on bone density and the advice..." Since bone density benefits from weight-bearing, maybe the least priority is something else? Hmm, maybe not. Let me check the text again. The article says to start with building a base of strength and stability before introducing explosive movements. So if someone wants to start sprinting, the initial phase should focus on building strength, not the sprinting itself. So the least prioritized would be the explosive movements (sprinting) initially. But the question says "type of exercise" so maybe explosive movements. The answer should be explosive movements.

3. **Question 3**: The article mentions building a foundation for 3-6 months. Ken Rideout started in his mid-40s, so the ideal would be within that range. The question asks "how many months... ideal". The text says 3 to 6 months, so maybe the answer is 3-6, but the question wants the ideal, which might be the higher end? The article says "plan to work out... for three to six months". Since it's a range, maybe the answer is 3-6, but the question asks "how many months... ideal", perhaps the answer is 3 to 6, but since it's a single answer, maybe the article doesn't specify, so perhaps N/A. Wait, the question says "ideal" but the text just gives a range. The exact answer would be "3 to 6 months", but the question might require a specific number. Since it's a range, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "plan to work out... for three to six months", so the ideal would be within that range. The question might expect 3-6 as the answer. Let me see the exact wording: "plan to work out... with two active rest days for three to six months". So the answer is 3-6, but the question asks "how many months... ideal", so the answer is "3 to 6".

4. **Question 4**: Recovery day yoga for a former sprinter. The article mentions yoga as a recovery activity. Since they need to regain explosive power, maybe mobility or rotational exercises. The question asks for the type of yoga. The article says recovery days might include light yoga. The type isn't specified, but since the person is a former sprinter, maybe something focusing on mobility or flexibility. The article mentions mobility work and rotational exercises for golfers, but yoga isn't specified. Since the question is about the type, but the article just says "light yoga", maybe the answer is "light yoga".

5. **Question 5**: Muscle memory for a surfer's pop-up. The article says former athletes can regain skills in a few weeks. So the answer is a few weeks, but the question says "how many weeks", so "a few" isn't precise. The exact text says "a few weeks after you start using them again". So the answer is "a few" but the question might need a number. Since "a few" is vague, but the text says "a few weeks", so maybe the answer is "a few weeks", but the question requires a number. Since it's not exact, maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "how many weeks... assuming they follow...", so the answer is "a few", but since it's not a number, perhaps N/A. Wait, the article says "a few weeks", so maybe 2-3 weeks? The exact wording is "a few weeks", so perhaps the answer is "a few" but the question wants a number. Hmm, tricky. The question might expect "a few" but since it's not a specific number, maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "how many weeks", so if the text says "a few", then it's N/A. But maybe the answer is "a few" as per the text. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 2-3 weeks, but the article says "a few", which is vague. The correct answer is "a few weeks", but since the question asks for a number, maybe N/A. Wait, the exact text says "a few weeks after you start using them again", so the answer is "a few", but the question wants the number. Since it's not a specific number, maybe N/A. But the question might accept "a few" as the answer. Hmm. The instructions say to answer with a sentence fragment, so maybe "a few weeks" but the question asks for weeks, so "a few". Alternatively, the answer is "a few", but the question wants a number. Maybe N/A. Alternatively, the answer is 2-3, but the article says "a few", which is ambiguous. Let me check the text again: "you might have to work on specific motor skills... these skills usually return a few weeks after you start using them again." So the answer is "a few weeks", but the question asks "how many weeks", so the answer is "a few". But the question might require a numerical answer. Since it's not exact, maybe N/A. Hmm, I'm confused. Maybe the answer is "a few weeks" but in the required format, perhaps "a few". Alternatively, the answer is N/A because it's not a specific number. Wait, the question says "how many weeks", so unless the text specifies like 2 weeks, it's N/A. Since it's "a few", which is vague, then N/A. Let me note that and move on, then come back.

6. **Question 6**: The article says during the initial 3 months, focus on cardiovascular endurance, building muscle mass and stability in core, hips, and shoulders. So besides cardio, the priority is muscle mass and stability. The question asks for the aspect besides cardio. The answer is "muscle mass and stability" or "building muscle mass and stability". The question says "what aspect... should they prioritize", so the answer is "muscle mass and stability".

7. **Question 7**: The article mentions low-intensity cardio for recovery. The example given is yoga, but the question asks for another type suitable for a skier. Maybe swimming or cycling? The article doesn't mention specific ones beyond yoga, but the question says "not explicitly mentioned". The answer should be something like swimming or cycling, but since the text doesn't list them, perhaps N/A. Wait, the article says "low-intensity cardio" but doesn't specify types beyond yoga. The question wants a suitable type not explicitly mentioned. Since the article doesn't say, maybe N/A. But maybe the answer is swimming? The article mentions "low-intensity cardio" but doesn't name it. Since it's not in the text, N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Jen Murphy went from 1 pull-up at 40 to 11 by 41. The improvement took one year, so minimum is 1 year.

9. **Question 9**: The article says increase effort by 5-10% each month. The metric is "level of effort".

10. **Question 10**: Muscle mass decline starts in the 30s.

11. **Question 11**: The article says marathoners peak in 40s, so the age group is 40s.

12. **Question 12**: Preparation time for a half marathon in 40s is twice as long as in 20s. So factor is 2x.

13. **Question 13**: After high-intensity, recovery methods mentioned include light yoga or low-intensity cardio, but the article specifically mentions "three moderate training days and one light day" after hard workouts. The single method mentioned for cushioning is the moderate days, but the specific activity is yoga or low-intensity cardio. Wait, the exact text says: "recovery days might include light yoga or low-intensity cardio". The question asks for the specific method noted. The answer is "light yoga" or "low-intensity cardio", but the question says "single recovery method". The text says "light yoga or...", so maybe "light yoga".

14. **Question 14**: The base-building phase is 3-6 months. The minimum is 3 months.

15. **Question 15**: Protein intake is mentioned for muscle repair.

16. **Question 16**: The article mentions Jen Murphy as the author who did pull-ups and became a trainer. She's the one with personal achievement and guiding others.

17. **Question 17**: Sleep over workout if conflict. The article says prioritize sleep if choosing between rest and workout.

Now, let me go through each again to confirm:

1. The question is about weekly percentage, but the article says monthly 5-10%. So answer N/A.

2. The initial phase should prioritize building strength, so the least would be explosive movements like sprinting itself. So answer "explosive movements".

3. The article says 3-6 months. The question asks "how many months... ideal". Since it's a range, perhaps the answer is "3 to 6" but the question might want the minimum or maximum? The article says "plan to work out... for three to six months", so the answer is "3 to 6 months", but the question asks for the number of months, so "3-6".

4. The article says recovery days might include light yoga. The type isn't specified beyond that. So "light yoga".

5. The article says "a few weeks", so the answer is "a few weeks". But the question asks for weeks as a number. Since "a few" is vague, maybe N/A. Alternatively, "a few" is the exact wording, so the answer is "a few weeks", but the question says "how many weeks", so maybe "a few".

6. The answer is "muscle mass and stability".

7. The article doesn't mention specific types beyond yoga, so N/A.

8. The answer is 1 year (from 40 to 41 is 1 year).

9. "level of effort".

10. 30s.

11. 40s.

12. Twice as long, so factor is 2.

13. The article mentions light yoga or low-intensity cardio as recovery. The question asks for the single method noted. Since both are mentioned, but the question says "specifically mentioned", perhaps the answer is "light yoga" or "low-intensity cardio". The article says "light yoga or low-intensity cardio", so either could be. Since the question asks for "specific type not explicitly mentioned", wait, no, the question says "not explicitly mentioned" in the article. Wait, the question says "what specific type of low-intensity cardio, not explicitly mentioned". Wait, the article does mention low-intensity cardio. The question is asking for a type not mentioned. Wait, the question says "not explicitly mentioned". So the answer would be N/A because the article does mention low-intensity cardio. Wait, no, the question is asking for a type that's suitable but not explicitly listed. The article says "low-intensity cardio" as a category but doesn't list examples. The question wants a specific type (like swimming) not mentioned. Since the article doesn't say, the answer is N/A.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood. The question says "what specific type of low-intensity cardio, not explicitly mentioned". Since the article mentions low-intensity cardio but doesn't name a specific type (like cycling, swimming), then the answer is N/A because the text doesn't provide an example.

14. The minimum is 3 months.

15. Protein.

16. Jen Murphy.

17. Sleep.
