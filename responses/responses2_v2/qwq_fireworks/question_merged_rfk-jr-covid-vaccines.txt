Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not infer anything beyond what's stated.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks for the percentage of the $8 billion Vaccines for Children program funding that Kennedy proposed to reallocate to ivermectin and hydroxychlorquine research. The article mentions that Kennedy led Children's Health Defense, which petitioned against vaccines and cited those treatments, but there's no specific percentage mentioned. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: After the Texas court dismissal, the article states that Kennedy's case was dismissed, but it doesn't mention any legislative amendment he proposed. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The article says Kennedy called the Covid vaccine the "deadliest ever" but doesn't provide a specific statistical comparison with the flu vaccine. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The "Disinformation Dozen" is mentioned in the censorship case. The article says an advocacy group named him in that list. The exact group's name isn't given, so N/A. Wait, actually, the text says "a prominent advocacy group" but doesn't name it. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The petition in May 2021 included Dr. Meryl Nass. The article mentions her, but asks for another physician with a suspended license for similar reasons. The text only mentions Nass's suspension. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The lawsuit with Children's Health Defense was in 2022, but prior legal actions? The article mentions he sent letters threatening legal action. The exact legal action before the lawsuit? The petition was in May 2021, then a lawsuit in 2022. The question says "beyond threatening letters" so maybe the initial petition? But the question specifies "concerning vaccine authorizations for children" prior to the 2022 lawsuit. The petition in May 2021 was about all vaccines, not specifically children. The article also mentions a lawsuit in 2022. The answer might be N/A because the prior action was the petition, which wasn't specifically about children. Wait, the May 2021 petition was about all vaccines, but the question is about children. The answer is N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The Supreme Court declined the appeal in "late last year" but the article doesn't specify the exact date. Since the article was published in 2024, "late last year" would be 2023. But the exact date isn't given. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The report estimating lives saved is mentioned as "an estimate released in early 2024 found that the Covid vaccines and mitigation measures saved about 800,000 lives". The article doesn't name the report. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The senior executive who reported to Murthy was from Facebook. The article says "a senior Facebook executive reported to Dr. Murthy". So the platform is Facebook.

10. **Question 10**: The lawyer connected to Trump's defense of Kennedy regarding polio vaccines is mentioned as "one of Mr. Kennedy's lawyers had previously petitioned the FDA". The name isn't given. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Dr. Nass's license was suspended in "early 2022". The exact month isn't stated. So N/A.

12. **Question 12**: The article states "more than 230,000 deaths could have been prevented". That's the numerical estimate between May 2021 and September 2022.

13. **Question 13**: Same as question 9, the platform is Facebook.

14. **Question 14**: The lawsuit mentions "the Disinformation Dozen" but how many were named? The article only says Kennedy was one of them, but the total number in the lawsuit isn't specified. So N/A.

15. **Question 15**: Dr. Nuzzo criticized Kennedy's claim about people over 65 not needing vaccines. The exact demographic she referenced was "people over the age of 65".

16. **Question 16**: The January 2021 date when Kennedy posted about Hank Aaron's death isn't specified beyond the month. The article says "in January 2021", so the exact day is N/A.

17. **Question 17**: The FDA mentions Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for infants and children under emergency authorization. The question asks for the specific company. The answer would be both, but since the question says "which specific", maybe either. The article says "Pfizer and Moderna", so need to list both? But the question asks for "the" so maybe one? Wait, the exact wording is "Covid vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna for infants and children 6 months to 11 years old remain in use under emergency authorization". So the answer is both, but the question asks for "pharmaceutical company", so perhaps either. Since the question says "specific", but the article mentions both, maybe it's N/A because it's both. Wait, the question says "which specific age demographic"â€”no, wait, question 17 is about which company. The answer is both, but since the question is singular, maybe N/A? Wait the question says "which specific pharmaceutical company's", so the answer would be either Pfizer or Moderna. Since the article mentions both, but the question asks for the name, perhaps the answer is both. However, since the question is singular, maybe it's N/A. Wait the article says "Pfizer and Moderna", so the answer is both. But the question is phrased to pick one. Hmm. The answer is N/A because it's both, but the question asks for "the" so perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, maybe the question is referring to the one mentioned first, so Pfizer? Let me check the exact text again: "Covid vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna for infants and children 6 months to 11 years old remain in use under emergency authorization". So both are mentioned, but the question asks for "specific", so since it's both, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, since the question is phrased to ask for the name, perhaps the answer is both, but the format requires one answer. Since the question says "which specific", maybe it's N/A. Alternatively, the article says "Pfizer and Moderna", so the answer is both, but the question is singular. Hmm, maybe N/A.

18. **Question 18**: The number of pages or groups Facebook removed is stated as "a number of pages or groups, including Mr. Kennedy's". The exact number isn't given. So N/A.

19. **Question 19**: The Texas appeals court dismissed the case in "early 2024". The exact month isn't specified. So N/A.

20. **Question 20**: The funding amount is "$8 billion" for the Vaccines for Children program. The question asks for the exact dollar amount, so $8 billion.
