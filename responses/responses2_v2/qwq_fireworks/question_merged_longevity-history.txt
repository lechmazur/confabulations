Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based strictly on the article provided. I need to make sure I don't use any outside knowledge and only the information given. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **First question**: It asks about the specific type of broth Cornaro consumed. The article mentions his diet included eggs, milk, broth, and vegetables but doesn't specify the type of broth. Since there's no detail on the broth type, the answer should be N/A.

2. **Second question**: The question combines Gilgamesh's plant and Bogomolets' serum. The article says Gilgamesh found a "youth-restoring plant" but doesn't name it. The serum was from horse blood and cadaver marrow. No specific plant name is given, so N/A.

3. **Third question**: Cyrus Edson's potential added years if he used Bogomolets' serum and Pauling's vitamin C. The article states Pauling's advocacy but doesn't link his vitamin C to extending lifespan beyond his own age (he died at 93). Since there's no specific number given for how much longer, N/A.

4. **Fourth question**: The first book using "longevity" per OED. The article says the word emerged in the 1500s but doesn't give a precise date. Without exact publication year, it's N/A.

5. **Fifth question**: Surgical instrument used in the procedures mentioned. The article talks about surgeries but doesn't name any specific instrument. N/A.

6. **Sixth question**: Ancient Egyptian theory discussed by The Hundred Years Club. The article mentions theories of India, Egypt, and Hebrews but doesn't specify which one was considered crucial. N/A.

7. **Seventh question**: Specific candy mentioned with wine and whale hunting. The article says oldest Americans mentioned eating candy but doesn't name the type. N/A.

8. **Eighth question**: Crucial vegetable in Cornaro's diet. The article lists vegetables but doesn't specify which one. N/A.

9. **Ninth question**: Type of water filtration with chlorination. The article mentions public water filtration and chlorination but doesn't detail the filtration type. N/A.

10. **Tenth question**: Number of ships Xu Fu was given. The article states "ships and 3,000 virgins" but doesn't specify the number of ships. N/A.

11. **Eleventh question**: Steinach's procedure now used for another purpose. The article mentions his vasectomy surgery, which is now used for contraception. So the answer is vasectomy.

12. **Twelfth question**: Value for a 20-year extension. The article cites $367 trillion for adding a decade. Doubling that would be $734 trillion, but the question asks for the exact figure mentioned. Since the article only states the decade value, the 20-year figure isn't provided, so N/A.
