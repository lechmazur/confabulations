Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and don't infer anything beyond what's written.

1. **Question 1**: The original purpose of the Clock Tower Building's bank hall. The article mentions it's the "former New York Life Insurance Building" and that the bank hall was part of that structure. Since it was an insurance building, the bank hall's original use was probably related to banking or insurance operations. The text says it's now an exhibition space, so the original purpose would be as part of the insurance building's functions. The answer should be "bank hall" but maybe more specific? Wait, the question is asking what it was used for before Shainman took it over. The article says "the building's magnificent 'bank hall'" which implies it was a bank's main hall. So the original purpose was as a bank's main hall. Answer: "bank hall" or maybe "bank's main hall"? The article says "the building's magnificent 'bank hall'" so the original purpose was as a bank hall. The answer is "bank hall".

2. **Question 2**: Number of Soundsuits displayed alongside "Amalgam (Origin)". The article mentions "Soundsuits, seen recently in a major show at the Guggenheim" but the opening show here is "Nick Cave: Amalgams and Graphts". The text doesn't mention Soundsuits being displayed in the current exhibition. The article talks about the Soundsuits' origin but not their presence in this show. So answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Architectural firm that restored rounded corners. The article states the secondary gallery was renovated under Carlos Vega's lead, with architect Gloria Vega Martin and preservation specialists Higgins Quasebarth & Partners. So the firm responsible for the rounded corners and sinuous walls is Higgins Quasebarth & Partners? Wait, the text says "renovated, under the lead of Shainman's husband, the painter Carlos Vega, working with the architect Gloria Vega Martin and the preservation specialists Higgins Quasebarth & Partners". The rounded corners and edges were part of their work. The question is which architectural firm completed the restoration. The architect mentioned is Gloria Vega Martin, but the preservation specialists were Higgins Quasebarth. Since architectural firms might be the architects, but the question says "architectural firm", so maybe Gloria Vega Martin's firm? Wait, the exact wording: "working with the architect Gloria Vega Martin and the preservation specialists Higgins Quasebarth & Partners". The rounded corners were part of their renovation. The question asks which architectural firm did the rounded corners. The architect here is Gloria Vega Martin, but perhaps the firm is Higgins? Or is Higgins a preservation firm? The question specifies architectural firm, so Gloria Vega Martin is the architect, so the firm might be her own, but the text doesn't name the firm. The answer might be Higgins Quasebarth & Partners as they are preservation specialists, but the question says architectural firm. Hmm, the article doesn't explicitly state the firm's name for that part. Wait, the rounded corners and edges were done under Carlos Vega, working with Gloria Vega Martin (architect) and Higgins Quasebarth (preservation). The architectural firm here would be Gloria Vega Martin's, but the text doesn't name her firm. Since the question asks for the architectural firm, maybe Higgins isn't an architectural firm but preservation. The answer might be N/A? Or maybe the answer is Higgins Quasebarth & Partners, even if they are preservation? The question says "architectural firm", so perhaps not. Since the article doesn't specify the firm's name for the rounded corners, answer N/A? Wait, the question is about the secondary gallery's rounded corners. The renovation was done by Carlos Vega leading, with architect Gloria Vega Martin and Higgins Quasebarth. The architectural firm would be Gloria's, but the name isn't given. So answer is N/A? Or maybe the answer is Higgins Quasebarth & Partners? The question is a bit ambiguous. The text doesn't explicitly name the firm responsible for the rounded corners. So perhaps N/A.

Wait, the question is "Which architectural firm completed the restoration of the rounded corners and sinuous walls in the secondary gallery spaces?" The text says "the secondary, street-level gallery on Broadway with a uniquely sinuous wall" and the renovation involved "Carlos Vega, working with the architect Gloria Vega Martin and the preservation specialists Higgins Quasebarth & Partners". The architectural firm here would be Gloria Vega Martin's, but the text doesn't name her firm. Since the question is about the architectural firm, and the answer is not provided, so N/A? Alternatively, maybe Higgins Quasebarth is considered the architectural firm? But they are preservation specialists. Hmm, tricky. Maybe the answer is N/A here.

4. **Question 4**: Material for the bird sculptures before being scanned and cast. The article says "scans of found Syroco ornaments and bird sculptures, before being printed in wax and cast in bronze". So the original material was Syroco ornaments and the bird sculptures themselves were made of some material, but the question is what material were the birds made of before scanning? The text says "found Syroco ornaments and bird sculptures". "Found" implies they were existing objects. The material isn't specified, but Syroco ornaments are likely the material. Wait, the question is asking what material the bird sculptures were made of before being scanned. The article says "scans of found Syroco ornaments and bird sculptures", so the birds were part of the found items, but their material isn't mentioned. The answer might be N/A. Unless Syroco refers to a material? Syroco might be a typo for something else, but the article says "Syroco ornaments"—maybe that's the material? Wait, perhaps Syroco is a type of ornament, but the material isn't stated. Since the question is about the material, the answer is N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Square footage of previous gallery. The article states Shainman's new location is 20,000 sq ft, but there's no info on the previous space. So answer N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Year Cave began using Syroco ornaments. The article mentions Syroco ornaments in the context of "Amalgam (Origin)", but doesn't state when he started using them. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Primary conservator for the ceiling. The article mentions the coffered ceiling was preserved, but doesn't name a specific conservator. The preservation team was Higgins Quasebarth & Partners, but the question asks for the individual. Since it's not mentioned, answer N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Number of needlepoint self-portraits. The article says "some of the pieces include large needlepoint portraits of Cave's own face — the first time, the news release notes, he's ever depicted himself so explicitly — and several include clusters..." The exact number isn't given. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Art movement influencing metallic flowers. The article doesn't mention any specific art movement influencing the metallic flowers in "Amalgam (Plot)". So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Purchase price of the building. The article doesn't mention the price paid, so N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Decorative elements restored to align with "graphts". The article says "the rosettes and banisters and Corinthian capitals have been replastered, touched up, or reinforced" and that these elements gain a fresh life when decontextualized. Since the "graphts" are about recontextualizing found objects, the restored elements mentioned are rosettes, banisters, Corinthian capitals. So the answer is "rosettes, banisters, and Corinthian capitals".

12. **Question 12**: Flaw in production process. The reviewer says "if Cave had built the whole thing from hand, or even just attached the actual found ornaments and branches to a 3-D printed figure, instead of scanning them, it might have been a more powerful statement." So the flaw is using scanning instead of physically attaching the actual items. The answer is "scanning instead of physically attaching found materials" or more precisely, "scanning instead of using actual found materials".
