Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly what's asked. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Indigenous traditions targeted by Fundy squads**: The article mentions "conflicts between the Hindu caste system, various indigenous traditions, consumerist tourism and the desperate outflow of migrant labor." It says Fundys police morals, but doesn't specify which traditions they target. So maybe N/A?

2. **Years between encounter and rise to power**: The article says P.M. Papa's rise follows the Big Two earthquake. The university encounter is mentioned but no timeframe. So N/A.

3. **Ghimirey's waste disposal role in tent cities**: The Ghimireys have a waste disposal business. The tent cities are refugee areas. The article says their empire includes waste disposal, so maybe they managed the tent cities' waste? But does it say their business played a role there? The article says "the state functions as an instrument..." but not directly linking Ghimirey's waste to tent cities. Hmm, maybe N/A.

4. **Primary narrator for Rozy's transformation**: The article mentions Rozy and Kranti as main characters, but doesn't specify a narrator. The story is told in third person? So N/A.

5. **Symbolic meaning of Big Three to Kranti's journey**: The ending fuses nation and character, with oppression leading to revolution. The Big Three's threat is part of the Jameson thesis. The article says Kranti becomes an avenger, so maybe the Big Three represents her revolutionary climax? The article says "entities of character and nation fuse", so the earthquake symbolizes her transformation. The exact symbolic meaning isn't spelled out, so N/A?

6. **Number in Madame Mao's opposition**: The article says "ragtag and largely ineffective" but no number. N/A.

7. **Rozy's previous connection to Ghimirey**: The article says Kranti marries the Ghimirey scion. Rozy is P.M. Papa's lover. No prior connection mentioned. So N/A.

8. **Aid orgs that withdrew**: The article doesn't mention any specific organizations. N/A.

9. **Dependence on tourist dollars and gender politics**: The article says "Darkmotherland's dependence on tourist dollars" and discusses gender in the context of Rozy and Kranti. Maybe tourism symbolizes exploitation linked to gender oppression? The article states that "the social battles... are global", but no direct metaphor stated. So N/A.

10. **Historical event paralleled by Big Two**: The article mentions the 2015 earthquake in Nepal. The Big Two is an earthquake in the novel, so that's the parallel. So 2015 earthquake.

11. **Color of Madam Mao's followers**: The Fundys are saffron-clad. The opposition (Madam Mao's group) might wear a different color. The article says "Madam Mao's depressed daughter" but no color for followers. N/A.

12. **Political leader contrasted with P.M. Papa**: The article mentions Narendra Modi's Hindu-Nationalist thugs and American incels. The question asks for a real leader whose policies are contrasted. The article says P.M.'s Fundys evoke Modi's thugs and Trump's. The contrast is with Modi's policies? Or maybe the question is about someone else? The article says "resonate eerily with some of the wealthiest nations today" like the US. But the question is which leader's policies are explicitly contrasted. Since the article compares Fundys to Modi's thugs, maybe Modi is the one being contrasted? Or perhaps Trump? The question says "explicitly contrasted"â€”but the article doesn't state a direct contrast, just mentions both as examples. So maybe N/A.

13. **Indigenous tradition vs Ghimirey tourism**: The article mentions "various indigenous traditions" conflicting with consumerist tourism. The Ghimireys are involved in tourism (their business includes hotels). The tradition isn't named. So N/A.

14. **Character with surgery funded by Ghimirey**: P.M. Papa's lover is Rozy, who transitions. The article says Rozy is "gender-transitioning lover" and in the second half they become avengers. The Ghimirey family are allies of P.M. Papa. Maybe Rozy's transition was funded by them? The article says "their business empire..." but doesn't explicitly state funding for surgery. So N/A.

15. **Years between Big Two and Big Three**: The article doesn't specify the time between the two earthquakes. N/A.

16. **Symbolic object Kranti carries**: The article mentions her final confrontation but doesn't specify an object. N/A.

17. **Multinational partner of Ghimirey**: The article mentions Ambanis and Trumps as possible analogs but doesn't name a real company. N/A.

18. **Rozy's caste/ethnicity**: The article mentions conflicts along caste lines but doesn't state Rozy's caste. N/A.

Wait, let me check again:

For question 10: The article says "the 2015 earthquake that killed thousands" which the novel's Big Two is an allegory for. So the answer is the 2015 Nepal earthquake.

Question 12: The article says "the toxic masculinity of Narendra Modi's Hindu-Nationalist thugs as well as of American incels on 4chan." So P.M. Papa's Fundys are compared to Modi's. The question asks which leader's policies are contrasted. Since the article doesn't say they are contrasted but rather that Fundys evoke Modi's, maybe Modi's policies are an example, but the question is about contrast. Hmm, maybe N/A unless there's an explicit contrast mentioned. Since it's not stated, N/A.

Question 10 is the only one with a clear answer.
