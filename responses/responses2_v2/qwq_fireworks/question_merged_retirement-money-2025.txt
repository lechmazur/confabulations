Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question is about the percentage of the average specialty medicine cost a patient would still pay after the $2,000 cap, compared to the old $3,000 threshold. The article mentions that under the old system, patients had to spend over $3,000 before catastrophic coverage kicked in, leaving them with 5% co-pay. The new cap is $2,000. Wait, but the question is about after meeting the old threshold. Wait, the old system had patients paying 5% after $3k. The new system caps at $2k. So under the old system, if they hit $3k, they paid 5% of the remaining. But the question says "assuming they had already met the $3,000 threshold for catastrophic coverage under the old system"—so under the old system, they'd pay 5% of the drug cost beyond $3k. But with the new $2k cap, they only pay up to $2k total. Let me see. The average specialty drug cost is around $7k/month, so annually that's $84k. Under the old system, after $3k, they pay 5% of the remaining. Let me compute for a year. Let's say their total drug cost is $84k. Under old system: up to $3k out-of-pocket, then 5% of (84k - 3k) = 5% of 81k = $4,050. Total would be $3k + $4,050 = $7,050? Wait no, catastrophic coverage is when they hit the $3k, so after that, they pay 5% of each subsequent dollar. So total out-of-pocket would be capped at the $3k plus 5% of the rest. But the new system caps it at $2k total. Wait the question is, under the new system, how much would they pay? The new cap is $2k, so regardless of drug costs, they pay up to $2k. So the percentage they pay would be $2k divided by the total drug cost. But the question is asking what percentage of the average monthly cost they are responsible for. Wait, the question says "assuming they had already met the $3,000 threshold for catastrophic coverage under the old system"—so under the old system, they were paying 5% beyond that. But under the new system, their total is capped at $2k. So the percentage would be (2000 / (average annual cost)) but the average is $7k/month, so $84k/year. 2000/84000 ≈ 2.38%. But the question is phrased as "what percentage of the average monthly cost of specialty medicines would a patient typically still be responsible for paying". Wait, average monthly cost is $7k. The cap is $2k annually? Wait no, the $2k is the annual cap. So per month, it's $2k total per year. So monthly contribution would be 2000/12 ≈ 166.67 per month. So the percentage of the $7k monthly cost would be (166.67 / 7000)*100 ≈ 2.38%. But the question might be considering the old system's 5% after $3k threshold. Wait the question is asking the percentage under the new system. The answer is (2000 / (total annual drug cost)) but the article says average price is around $7k a month. So annual is 7k*12 = 84k. 2000/84000 ≈ 2.38%. But the question might just want the 5% vs the new cap. Wait the question is "what percentage of the average monthly cost... would a patient typically still be responsible for paying, assuming they had already met the $3,000 threshold for catastrophic coverage under the old system?" Wait, but under the old system, after meeting $3k, they pay 5% of the rest. The question is asking under the new system, so their total is capped at $2k, so the percentage would be 2000 divided by the total annual cost. Since the average is $7k/month, total is 84k, so 2000/84000 is about 2.38%. But maybe the question expects a different approach. Alternatively, the question might be looking for the 5% vs the new cap, but the answer would be 0% beyond the $2k. Wait, the question says "assuming they had already met the $3,000 threshold for catastrophic coverage under the old system"—so under the old system, they would pay 5% of the remaining after $3k. But under the new system, they only pay up to $2k. So the percentage they pay under the new system is 2k divided by the total drug cost. The average monthly is $7k, so annual $84k. 2k/84k ≈ 2.38%. The question asks "percentage of the average monthly cost"—so per month, their share is 2000/12 divided by 7000. (166.67 /7000)*100 ≈ 2.38%. So the answer is approximately 2.38%, but the article might state it differently. Wait the article says "out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs covered under Part D will be limited to $2,000 this year." So the total annual out-of-pocket is $2k. So the percentage of their total drug costs is (2000 / total cost). Since average specialty drugs are $7k/month, total is 84k. 2000/84000 ≈ 2.38%. But the question might expect the answer as 2.38%, but maybe the answer is 0% because the cap is $2k, so they only pay up to that. Wait, the question says "what percentage of the average monthly cost of specialty medicines would a patient typically still be responsible for paying"—so per month, their payment would be part of the $2k annual cap. So per month, they pay (2000 /12) ≈ 166.67, so (166.67 /7000)*100 ≈ 2.38%. The article doesn't give exact numbers for this calculation, but the math is derived from the given info. So I think the answer is 2.38%, but maybe rounded to 2% or 2.4%. The question might want the answer as 2.38%, but perhaps the article states a different way? Wait the article says "Five percent of a big number is still a big number" referring to the old system. The new cap is $2k. The question is about the new system's percentage. So the answer would be (2000 divided by annual drug cost). Since average is $7k/month, total is 84k, so 2000/84000= ~2.38%. The question might accept 2.38% or 2.4%. But maybe the answer is 5%? No, because under the new system, it's capped. The answer is 2000/total, which is approximately 2.38%. Let me check if the question is about monthly or annual. The question says "average monthly cost"—so per month, the patient pays 2000/12 divided by 7000. So 2.38%.

2. The second question is about a 61-year-old earning $160k maximizing 401(k) and Roth IRA. The article says for 2025, the 401(k) limit is $23,500 base plus catch-up. For age 60-63, the super catch-up is $11,250. So total 401(k) contribution is 23,500 + 11,250 = 34,750. The article also mentions Roth IRA eligibility: the income limit is raised, but what's the exact limit? The article states "the income limit is also going up for the saver's credit, worth up to $1,000 for singles who earn $39,500 or less, and $2,000 for married couples filing jointly who make $79,000 or less." Wait, but the question is about Roth IRA eligibility. The article says "income limits to qualify for Roth individual retirement accounts, health savings accounts, and deductible I.R.A.s for people also covered by a retirement plan at work." The exact income limits for Roth IRA aren't given in numbers, but since the person earns $160k, which is above the phase-out for Roth IRA (assuming the limit is lower than that). Wait the article doesn't provide the exact income limit for Roth IRA eligibility, so maybe we can't answer. Wait the question says "assuming Roth IRA eligibility"—so if they are eligible, then they can contribute. The maximum Roth IRA contribution is $7,000 (since 2025 401(k) base is $23,500, but IRA contribution is typically $7k, but the article doesn't specify. Wait the article mentions "small increases in the income limits to qualify for Roth individual retirement accounts" but doesn't give the exact numbers. So the question says "assuming Roth IRA eligibility"—so we can proceed. The max Roth IRA contribution for 2025 is likely $7,000 (since 2024 was $7,000, and maybe increased by small amount, but the article doesn't specify). However, the article says "the income limit is also going up for the saver's credit...", but not the Roth IRA contribution limit. The question says "maximizes their 401(k) contributions, including the super catch-up"—so 34,750. Then Roth IRA max is $7,000? So total would be 34,750 +7,000=41,750. But if the Roth IRA contribution limit is higher, but the article doesn't say. Since the question says to assume eligibility, maybe the max Roth IRA contribution is $7,500? The article mentions "regular contribution limit for 401(k) plans is up by $500, from $23,000 last year"—so 2025 is $23,500. The Roth IRA limit might be separate. Since the article doesn't give the IRA contribution limit, maybe it's still $7,000 or $7,500? Wait, the IRS typically has the IRA contribution limit at $6,500 for under 50 and $7,500 with catch-up. For 2025, assuming the catch-up is $1,000, so total $7,500. So if the person is 61, they can contribute $7,500 to Roth IRA (assuming eligibility). So total would be 34,750 +7,500 = 42,250. But the article doesn't specify, so maybe the answer is N/A? Wait the question says "assuming Roth IRA eligibility"—so even if the income limit is met, but the article doesn't give the exact contribution limit for Roth IRA. Since the article mentions "small increases in the income limits to qualify for Roth individual retirement accounts", but no numbers, maybe the contribution limit is $7,500. So the answer would be 34,750 +7,500 = 42,250. But since the article doesn't state the contribution limit for Roth IRA, maybe I should answer N/A? Hmm, tricky. The article does mention "the income limit is also going up for the saver's credit...", but not the Roth IRA contribution limit. Since the question says "assuming Roth IRA eligibility", perhaps the contribution limit is standard, so $7,500 (since 2024 was $7,500 for over 50). So total would be 34,750 +7,500 = 42,250. I'll proceed with that.

3. Third question: Social Security reduction for someone earning $30k, with $23,400 limit. The article says "For every $2 that early retirees earn above the income limit, they lose $1 in benefits until they reach full retirement age." The limit is $23,400. The person earned $30k, so over by $6,600. For every $2 over, they lose $1. So $6,600 over divided by 2 is $3,300 lost. The monthly benefit was $1,500. The total loss is $3,300 per year. To find monthly reduction: $3,300 /12 = $275 per month. So the monthly check would be reduced by $275. So the answer is $275.

4. Penalty for incorrect withdrawal: the question states the penalty is applied at the reduced rate (10% if corrected within two years). The heir withdrew $5k less than required. The penalty is 10% of the required amount not taken. Wait, the penalty is 25% of the amount you should have taken out, or 10% if corrected within two years. The question says the original owner was 75, so they were required to take RMDs. The heir must take RMDs each year. If they withdrew $5k less than required, the penalty is 10% of the under-withdrawn amount. Wait, the article says: "The penalty for not making the correct withdrawal: 25 percent of the amount you should have taken out, or 10 percent if you correct the mistake within two years." So if they withdrew $5k less than required, the penalty is 10% of the $5k, which is $500. So the answer is $500.

5. The saver's credit maximum for married filing jointly in 2026. The article says in 2025, the limit is $79,000. The question asks for 2026, assuming a linear increase. The article doesn't give the rate of increase, so we can't compute. But the article mentions "the income limit is also going up for the saver's credit...", but no numbers. Since it's linear, but we don't know the previous year's increase. In the article, 2025's limit is $79k (for married). The previous year (2024?) might have been lower, but the article only gives 2025. So without knowing the rate, can't compute. So answer N/A.

6. The person previously paid $3,500 annually, now capped at $2k. The reduction is (3,500-2,000)/3,500 *100 = (1,500/3,500)*100 ≈42.86%. So 42.86% reduction. The question asks for the percentage reduction, so ≈42.86%, which can be rounded to 43%.

7. Vanguard's research suggests equal annual withdrawals over 10 years to minimize tax. The question asks the optimal annual withdrawal for a $250k IRA. Equal each year would be 250,000 /10 = $25,000 annually. So answer $25,000.

8. The question says if the credit score increase leads to qualifying for a mortgage, how many additional mortgages might be approved annually, assuming proportional to White House's 22,000. If the increase is 25 points (the example in the article mentions an estimated 20 points, but the question says 25 points), but the White House estimate was 22k. Since it's proportional, but the article's example is 20 points leading to 22k. If the question's scenario is 25 points, but the question says "assuming a proportional relationship to the White House estimates"—so 22k is for 20 points. If it's 25 points, which is 25/20 = 1.25 times, so 22k *1.25=27,500. But the question states the increase is 25 points, but the White House's estimate was 20 points leading to 22k. So the answer is 22,000 multiplied by (25/20). But maybe the question is just asking the White House's figure, which is 22k. Wait the question says "how many additional mortgages might be approved annually, assuming a proportional relationship to the White House estimates?" The White House said 22k. So the answer is 22,000.

9. Deductible IRA limit for someone earning $78k and covered by a workplace plan. The article says "income limits to qualify for... deductible I.R.A.s for people also covered by a retirement plan at work." The exact limit isn't given. Since the article mentions "small increases" but no numbers, maybe we can't answer. So N/A.

10. If the ban is overturned causing a 15-point decrease, what percentage of the projected 22k mortgage approvals would be lost. The initial increase was 22k from 20 points. If the score drops 15 points, which is 15/20 of the original increase. So the loss would be (15/20)*100% = 75% of the 22k. So 75% of the increase would be lost. So 75%.

11. A 64-year-old's 401(k) contribution. The article says for 2025, the regular contribution limit is $23,500 (base) plus catch-up for 50+ is $7,500 (since the super catch-up is only for 60-63). The person is 64, so catch-up is $7,500. Total: 23,500 +7,500=31,000. But wait the super catch-up is for 60-63. So the 64-year-old can't get the super catch-up. So total is 23,500 +7,500=31,000.

12. The provision from the Inflation Reduction Act affecting rheumatoid arthritis patients. The article says the $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket under Part D, which is part of the Inflation Reduction Act. So the answer is the Inflation Reduction Act's cap on Part D out-of-pocket costs.

13. Penalty for two consecutive years without correcting. The penalty is 25% each year. For two years, it would be 25% of the required amount each year, but the question says "total financial penalty". The article says "the penalty for not making the correct withdrawal: 25 percent of the amount you should have taken out, or 10 percent if you correct the mistake within two years." If they didn't correct, each year's penalty is 25% of that year's required withdrawal. But the question says "failing to take required minimum distributions for two consecutive years"—so total penalty would be 25% of each year's under-withdrawal. But without specific amounts, maybe the question is asking the total penalty rate, but the article says each year's penalty is 25% of the required amount. So if they didn't take either, the total would be 25% of year 1's RMD plus 25% of year 2's RMD. But the question doesn't give numbers, so maybe the answer is "25% of the total required withdrawals for both years" but since the question asks for amount, but no numbers given, so N/A? Wait the question asks "what is the total financial penalty"—but since no specific amount is given in the article, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait the article says "the penalty for not making the correct withdrawal: 25 percent of the amount you should have taken out". So for each year, it's 25% of the required amount. So over two years, it's 25% of each year's required withdrawal. But without the actual amounts, we can't compute a numerical value. The question might be asking for the penalty structure, but the answer would be 25% per year, so total is 25% each year. Since the question asks for the total, but without numbers, it's N/A. Wait, but the question might want the total penalty as a multiple, but since it's not given, maybe N/A.

14. Social Security adjustment for someone earning $25k, which is under the $23,400 limit? Wait the limit is $23,400. If they earn $25k, over by $1,600. For every $2 over, lose $1. So $1,600/2 = $800 reduction annually. Monthly reduction is $800/12 ≈ $66.67. So their monthly check would be reduced by that amount.

15. The estimated increase in mortgages is 22,000 as per White House.

16. The age group with super catch-up tied to SECURE 2.0. The article says the super catch-up is for 60-63, part of SECURE 2.0.

17. HSA contribution limit. The article mentions income thresholds increased for HSA, but doesn't give the max contribution. Since the question asks for the max after adjustment, but without numbers, maybe N/A. The article only mentions "small increases in the income limits to qualify for... health savings accounts", but not the contribution limit. So N/A.

18. If heir fails to withdraw all by end when original owner wasn't taking RMDs. The article says "must withdraw within 10 years. If they don't, the penalty is 25% or 10% if corrected. But the question is about failing to withdraw all. The penalty is 25% of the amount not withdrawn? The article says "the penalty for not making the correct withdrawal: 25 percent of the amount you should have taken out, or 10 percent if you correct the mistake within two years." If they didn't take any, but the requirement is to have it all out by end of 10 years. So if they didn't take any, the penalty would be 25% of the total remaining? Or per year? The article isn't clear. Since the question is about not withdrawing by end, the penalty isn't specified beyond the 25% per missed withdrawal. But since they have to have it all out by end, maybe the penalty is 25% of the entire account? The article doesn't specify, so N/A.

19. The regulatory body facing legal challenges: the CFPB. The article mentions lawsuits from debt collection industry against the CFPB's rule.

20. Saver's credit max for single earning $38k. The article says the saver's credit max is $1,000 for singles under $39,500. Since $38k is under, they qualify for the full $1,000. So answer $1,000.
