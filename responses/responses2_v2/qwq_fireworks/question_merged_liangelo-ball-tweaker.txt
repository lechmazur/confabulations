Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions N3on's reaction during the livestream. It says he was "almost shivering with joy in the back seat." His enthusiastic reaction likely contributed to the song's initial surge. The answer should be his demeanor here.

2. **Question 2**: The article references No Limit Records and Cash Money Records. Since the question asks for another label besides No Limit, Cash Money is the fit. 

3. **Question 3**: The incident mentioned is shoplifting in China, leading to withdrawal from UCLA. The question asks what prompted his shift to music, so that incident is the answer.

4. **Question 4**: The article states he was booked for Rolling Loud's March installment. But the question asks besides Rolling Loud. Wait, the article says "booked for the March installment of the influential hip-hop festival Rolling Loud." Since the question asks another major event besides Rolling Loud, maybe there's another? Wait, the article only mentions Rolling Loud. Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The article says "booked for the March installment of the influential hip-hop festival Rolling Loud." So the answer might be N/A? Wait, the question says "besides Rolling Loud, at what other major event..." But the text doesn't mention another event. So maybe N/A?

Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me recheck. The article says "...booked for the March installment of the influential hip-hop festival Rolling Loud." No other events mentioned. So answer is N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The article mentions Lil Boosie and Moneybagg Yo as the rappers who nudged him about collaborations. That's two. So answer is 2.

6. **Question 6**: The vehicle was a Dodge Challenger SRT Demon. The article says "he was driving N3on around in his Dodge Challenger SRT Demon."

7. **Question 7**: The beat's element is a piano figure that sounds accidental or drunk, played with "chubby fingers." So the answer is the piano.

8. **Question 8**: The question is about LiAngelo's brother on the Chicago Bulls previously with Charlotte Hornets. Wait, the article says LaMelo is with Charlotte, Lonzo is on Chicago Bulls. Wait the text says: "LaMelo is a Charlotte Hornets point guard; Lonzo plays the same position on the Chicago Bulls." So Lonzo is now with Bulls, but before his trade, he was with Hornets? Or was he drafted by the Bulls? Wait the article says "Lonzo plays the same position on the Chicago Bulls." So maybe he was traded from another team, but the article doesn't mention previous teams. The question asks what position his brother (who is now with Bulls) had with Hornets before trade? Wait, the article says LaMelo is with Hornets, Lonzo with Bulls. So perhaps the Bulls brother (Lonzo) was previously with another team, but the article doesn't say. The question is about the brother currently with Bulls, previously with Hornets? Or was he traded from Hornets to Bulls? The article doesn't specify. Since the article only states their current teams, the answer would be N/A. Because the question is about the position he secured with Hornets before being traded, but the article doesn't mention any trade for Lonzo. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The article mentions that traditional platforms like radio, streaming services, TikTok, and streets are unreliable. The question asks which one besides TikTok was bypassed. So radio, streaming services, or streets. The answer could be radio, but the question says "traditional star-making platform now deemed unreliable." The article says "no reliable systems anymore -- not the radio, not streaming services, not TikTok, not the streets." So the answer could be radio, but the question is which one was bypassed by G3's path. Since he used livestreaming instead, the traditional ones like radio are the ones bypassed. The question says "excluding TikTok," so radio is the answer.

10. **Question 10**: The article mentions "if TikTok isn't forced to cease its operations in the United States this weekend" as a potential reason for the changing landscape. So the legal issue is TikTok's potential shutdown.

11. **Question 11**: The question asks which Ball brother's NBA team was referenced in connection with a collaboration inspired by Memphis rap. The article says "I ain't from the South, but kick it with my Memphis twin," but doesn't mention a specific brother collaborating. The only brothers mentioned are LaMelo and Lonzo. The article doesn't state that either collaborated on the track. So N/A.

12. **Question 12**: The article doesn't give an exact date for the livestream. So N/A.

13. **Question 13**: The article doesn't mention any Def Jam artist criticizing "Tweaker." It mentions Lil Boosie and Moneybagg Yo expressing interest. So N/A.

14. **Question 14**: The article doesn't mention the number of tracks on his debut album. So N/A.

15. **Question 15**: The article doesn't mention any NBA player performing a verse on the original track before the livestream. So N/A.

16. **Question 16**: The vehicle was Dodge Challenger SRT Demon. The article says "Dodge Challenger SRT Demon."

17. **Question 17**: The production style is influenced by New Orleans (No Limit) and Memphis. Since the question asks which city's scene influenced it despite his LA roots, it's Memphis or New Orleans. The article says "the urgent and sometimes clunky New Orleans rap music... as well as the bouncier and less antic side of 1990s Memphis rap." So the answer is Memphis or New Orleans? The question says "directly influenced the production style contradicting his roots." Since he's from SoCal, but the production is Memphis or New Orleans. The question says "which city's underground scene" so either. The article mentions both, but the question might expect Memphis since it's mentioned alongside. Wait the question says "contradicting Ball's Southern California roots" so the answer would be either New Orleans or Memphis. The question asks for the city, so either is possible. But the article mentions both, so maybe both? But the answer should pick one. Let me check the exact wording: "the urgent and sometimes clunky New Orleans rap music popularized by No Limit Records in the late 1990s (later streamlined by Cash Money Records), as well as the bouncier and less antic side of 1990s Memphis rap." So both cities are mentioned. The question is asking for which city's scene directly influenced the production style. Since it's a choice between the two, perhaps both are correct, but the question expects one. The article says "the accompanying production, are redolent of the urgent and sometimes clunky New Orleans rap music... as well as the bouncier and less antic side of 1990s Memphis rap." Since the question says "directly influenced," maybe both are correct, but the answer might be Memphis because the verse mentions "Memphis twin." The line is "I ain't from the South, but kick it with my Memphis twin," so Memphis is directly referenced. So answer is Memphis.

18. **Question 18**: The 1994 compilation is "B-Ball's Best Kept Secret," mentioned in the article. 

19. **Question 19**: The potential shutdown platform is TikTok, as mentioned in the article's scenario.

20. **Question 20**: The incident in China involved shoplifting. The article states they admitted to shoplifting in China but doesn't specify the items. So the exact item isn't mentioned. So N/A.

Now, let's ensure each question is addressed with these answers, and any that can't be answered get N/A.
