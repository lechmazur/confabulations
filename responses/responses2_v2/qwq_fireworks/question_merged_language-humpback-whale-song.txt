Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and don't infer anything beyond that.

1. The first question asks about the statistical law discovered by George Kingsley Zipf that applies to 12 cetacean species. The article mentions Zipf's law in the context of whale songs and also refers to another study in Science Advances about Menzerath's law. Wait, the first part of the question specifies that the law is exemplified by "groan-groan-moan" and also applies to 12 cetacean species. The article says that the study in Science Advances found Menzerath's law in 11 species. But the question mentions 12. Hmm, but the first part of the article says Zipf's law applies to whale songs. The question is asking which law Zipf discovered that also applies to those 12 species. The answer should be Zipf's law, because Menzerath's is mentioned in the other study. Wait, but the first sentence of the article says the study about Zipf's law, and the Science Advances study is about Menzerath's. The question says "vocalizations of 12 cetacean species" which is from the Menzerath's law study. Wait, the question is a bit confusing. Wait, the first question says "exemplified by the phrase... in whale songs near New Caledonia" which is part of the Zipf's law study. The question also says "that also applies to the vocalizations of 12 cetacean species". The Menzerath's law study mentions 11 species. The article says "11 species of dolphins and whales" followed Menzerath's law, but the question says 12. Maybe a typo? But the answer must be Zipf's law, since that's what Zipf discovered, and the question is about the law he discovered. So answer is Zipf's law.

2. The second question asks about the sound sequence most prevalent in 2010 recordings near Altadena, following Menzerath's law. Wait, Menzerath's law is about longer sequences having shorter components. The article mentions that in 2010, the most common was groan-groan-moan, then the next was moan followed by three ascending cries. But the question is about the most prevalent (most common) which would be groan-groan-moan. But the question also mentions Menzerath's law, but maybe the answer is just the sequence mentioned as most common. The location is Altadena, but the article mentions New Caledonia for the recordings. The question mentions Altadena, but the article's 2010 example is from New Caledonia. So maybe this is a trick? Since the article's 2010 example is from New Caledonia, the answer might be N/A because the location in the question is different. Wait, the article says "recorded over eight years in the waters around New Caledonia". The question says "near Altadena, California". That's a different location. So the answer would be N/A because the 2010 data is from New Caledonia, not Altadena. So the second question's answer is N/A.

3. The third question asks for the second most common subsequence, which according to the article, after groan-groan-moan, the next was a moan followed by three ascending cries. So the answer is "moan followed by three ascending cries".

4. Fourth question: If a new song follows Zipf's law, what rank is a subsequence used six times less than the most common. Zipf's law states that the nth most common is 1/n times the most common. So if the most common is used N times, the second is N/2, third N/3, etc. So a subsequence used six times less would be 1/6 of the most common, so rank 6th.

5. Fifth question: The scientist at Carleton is Shane Gero. He said that structural patterns like Zipf's law might be broader principles. The question asks what besides frequency distinguishes the most common subsequences. The article says "the most frequently used subsequences were also generally shorter than the rarer ones". So the characteristic is "shorter duration/length".

6. Sixth question: If the bear's communication follows Zipf's law, the third most common would be 1/3 the frequency of the most common. The question says "approximate frequency", so the answer is "one-third" or "1/3".

7. Seventh question: During a song revolution, the aspect that changes most is the song itself. The article says during a song revolution, a new song is introduced and takes over. So the vocalizations would change most in the "entire song structure" or "sequence patterns".

8. Eighth question: The study identified subsequences besides the moan + three cries. The article mentions "various types of squeaks, grunts, whistles, groans and moans" as basic elements. The subsequences include combinations like short ascending whistle followed by a squeak. But the question asks which were recorded in Egypt. The article mentions a spotted hyena in Egypt, but whale songs around New Caledonia. The question might be a trick since the study was on humpbacks in New Caledonia, not Egypt. So maybe N/A? Or perhaps the study's general principles apply, but the specific examples from Egypt aren't in the text. So answer N/A.

9. Ninth question: The researcher specializing in language acquisition is Inbal Arnon. The article says she proposed looking at bats and elephants. So answer is Inbal Arnon.

10. Tenth question: The exact number of basic sound elements. The article says they transformed songs into "long sequences of basic sound elements, including various types of squeaks, grunts, whistles, groans and moans." But it doesn't give an exact number. So N/A.

11. Eleventh question: The predator's attention attracted by songs. The article says "it can attract the attention of predators". No specific predator mentioned. So N/A.

12. Twelfth question: Third most common subsequence after the first two. The article only mentions the first two in the 2010 example. The third isn't specified. So N/A.

13. Thirteenth question: Cetacean that violates Menzerath's law. The article says the study found the law in humpbacks, sperm whales, and bottlenose dolphins. So the one that violates would be the others not listed, but the question says "mentioned in the study". Since the study included 11 species, but the ones listed comply, the answer is N/A as no species mentioned as violating.

14. Fourteenth question: Methodological flaw identified by Shane Gero. The article says he found the study convincing and "elegant". So no flaw mentioned, so N/A.

15. Fifteenth question: Non-cetacean animal without Zipf's law due to non-cultural transmission. The article mentions that whale song and human language are culturally transmitted, but other animals like songbirds and primates follow Menzerath's law. However, the study in Science Advances included birds and primates for Menzerath's, but the question is about Zipf's law. The article doesn't mention any animal explicitly ruled out. So N/A.

16. Sixteenth question: Inverse ratio for least common. The article says Zipf's law is inverse rank to frequency. The question asks for deviation in least common. But the article doesn't discuss deviations. So N/A.

17. Seventeenth question: Eaton fire and humpback song transmission. The article mentions the 525-pound bear in a crawl space after the Eaton fire, but no direct correlation with whale songs. So N/A.
