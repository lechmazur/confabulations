Okay, let me start going through each question one by one. The article is about Clay McLeod Chapman's new horror novel and some of his background. I need to make sure I only use the information provided here.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which Virginia theater was instrumental in his early monologue work before moving to Brooklyn. The article mentions "New York theatergoers might know him as the playwright-performer behind 'The Pumpkin Pie Show,' an evening of creepy monologues that ran for over 20 years in the East Village." Wait, the East Village is in New York, not Virginia. The question is about Virginia, but the article doesn't mention any Virginia theater. So the answer should be N/A because the text only talks about East Village in NYC.

2. **Question 2:** How many copies of his previous 11 books were sold? The article doesn't provide sales numbers for any of his books. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Medical condition from mom after reading the manuscript. The article says Chapman warned his parents not to read it, and his mom still wants to support him but the book isn't for her. No medical condition mentioned. N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Famous horror director more influential than Sam Raimi. The article says Chapman envisioned the book like Sam Raimi directed the Jan 6 riots. But then mentions George Romero's spirit is in the story. The question asks who is more influential than Raimi? The text says George Romero's legacy is invoked, so maybe Romero is the answer here. Wait, the question says "more influential than Sam Raimi"? The article says Chapman "envisioned Sam Raimi directed the Jan 6 riots" and later mentions "George Romero gave us a template". So the answer is George Romero?

5. **Question 5:** Percentage of Goodreads reviewers stopping after the mother's tongue scene. The article says "if Goodreads is any indication, the make-or-break passage starts around Page 48..." but no percentage given. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** How did his experience at Fax News in his 20s influence the novel? The article says the network is called Fax News, but there's no mention of him working there. The name is a parody of Fox, but he didn't work there. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Original working title before publisher changed it. The article doesn't mention the original title. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Which Brooklyn bookstore hosted his first reading with autobiographical elements? The article mentions he lives in Ditmas Park, but no specific bookstore named. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Role of stepfather in introducing horror. The article says his stepfather inherited a "surly, punkish teen dude" but no info on introducing horror. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Number of rewrites to tone down politics. The article says he was "petulant" wanting release before election, but no mention of rewrites. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** TV network causing changes in family. The book's network is Fax News. Direct answer: Fax News.

12. **Question 12:** How he describes himself to show ideological split. The article says he's a "left-leaning cis white male" with conservative parents. So the answer is "left-leaning cis white male".

13. **Question 13:** Director for chaotic energy like Jan 6. The article mentions Sam Raimi directing the riots as his vision. So Sam Raimi.

14. **Question 14:** Neighborhood for Pumpkin Pie Show. The article says it ran in the East Village. So East Village.

15. **Question 15:** Page number critical moment. The article states "starts around Page 48". So 48.

16. **Question 16:** Title of work by Sara Gran that influenced him. The article lists "Come Closer" by Sara Gran. Answer: Come Closer.

17. **Question 17:** Cinematic legacy for collapsing society. George Romero is mentioned as the one whose spirit is in the story. So George Romero.

18. **Question 18:** Absent medium common in horror. The article lists film, comic, podcasts. Common horror mediums like novels are mentioned (he's a novelist), but maybe theater? Wait, he did theater with Pumpkin Pie Show. Hmm. The question says "notably absent despite common association". Maybe traditional horror movies are covered in film, but maybe something like video games? But the article doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe "television" but he uses TV in the book's premise. Not sure. Wait, the article says he writes in "novel, film, comic books and podcasts". The common horror medium not listed here might be "television shows" but that's part of the book's plot (Fax News). Alternatively, maybe "short stories"? But the question is about a medium absent. Since the article lists film, comic, podcasts, and he's a novelist, perhaps "television" is part of the story but not his creative outlets. The question is tricky. Wait the question says "among the creative outlets detailed by the author alongside film, comic books, and podcasts, one medium is notably absent". The author mentions being a novelist, so novels are included. The creative outlets listed are novelist (so novels), film, comic books, podcasts. So the absent one might be "television" as a creative medium? But the question might be looking for "television" but the answer isn't clear. Wait the article says "New York theatergoers might know him as the playwright-performer behind 'The Pumpkin Pie Show'". So theater is included. So maybe the answer is "television" as a creative outlet? But the article doesn't mention TV as a medium he used. Alternatively, perhaps "short stories" or "graphic novels" but the article includes comic books. Hmm. Since the question says "notably absent despite common association with horror narratives", maybe "television" as a creative medium? The answer might be television, but the article does mention his theater work. Alternatively, maybe "video games" but that's not mentioned. I might have to put N/A here, but maybe the answer is "television" but not sure. Wait, the article says he writes in "novel, film, comic books, and podcasts". The common horror medium not listed here could be "television shows" as a creative outlet. Since he's a playwright (theater), that's covered. So maybe "television" as a creative medium (like TV writing) is absent. So answer: television? But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "short stories", but the article doesn't say. Hmm, maybe the correct answer is N/A, but I think the question is pointing towards "television" as the absent one. Alternatively, perhaps "short stories" but not sure. Wait, the article says "as a novelist -- this is his 12th book -- but also in film, comic books and podcasts." So novels, film, comic books, podcasts. The common horror medium not listed here would be "short stories", but maybe not. Alternatively, "graphic novels" but comic books are mentioned. Hmm. Maybe the answer is "N/A" because all major mediums are covered except maybe something else. Alternatively, the question might be a trick, but I'll go with N/A for now.

Wait, the question says "among the creative outlets detailed by the author alongside film, comic books, and podcasts, one medium is notably absent despite its common association with horror narratives". The author mentions being a novelist (so novels), playwright (theater), so theater is there. The absent one might be "short stories" but that's part of novels. Alternatively, maybe "video games" but that's not common. Alternatively, "television" as a creative medium (like TV writing). Since he's a playwright, theater is covered, but TV isn't mentioned. So maybe television? But the question says "notably absent despite common association with horror narratives". So the answer could be "television" but I'm not sure. Since the article doesn't explicitly mention TV as a medium he worked in, maybe that's the answer. I'll tentatively put Television.

19. **Question 19:** Duration before telling parents. The article says he told them "Two weeks ago. I kept stalling. We had a half-hour to go before leaving from the holidays..." So the duration is two weeks before the holiday, but the exact time he waited isn't specified. The question asks for the duration mentioned, which is "two weeks". The answer is "two weeks".

20. **Question 20:** Award-winning sci-fi writer exploring personal trauma. The article mentions Nnedi Okorafor's new autobiographical novel. So Nnedi Okorafor.
