Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information provided in the article.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions Dr. Iwasaki wants to identify biological markers in those who improved, but it doesn't specify any particular biomarker. So, N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The article says patients were infected between March 2020 and December 2022, but their treatment start dates aren't given. No info on months after infection when they started Paxlovid, so N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Kate Leslie's cognitive improvement isn't quantified as a percentage. She mentions feeling better but no exact number, so N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The article lists various symptoms but doesn't state which one correlated most with improvement. No specific symptom mentioned here, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The answer states five patients had lasting improvement, but the duration isn't specified. The article doesn't give an average, so N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The article mentions two patients with extended courses due to reinfection, but not how many had 30-day courses or their outcomes on post-exertional malaise. No data, so N/A.

7. **Question 7:** There's no mention of dosage modifications by Dr. Peluso for side effects. So, N/A.

8. **Question 8:** No pre-existing conditions linked to poor response are listed. The article doesn't specify, so N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The article doesn't mention any specific blood test results as predictive. So, N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Julia Vogel's migraines didn't improve; she said Paxlovid had no impact. The question asks when her symptoms improved, which they didn't, so N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The Stanford trial didn't report on worsening immune conditions. Only Kate's case is mentioned, but not others. So, N/A.

12. **Question 12:** The article states Dr. Vogel took a 10-day course but doesn't mention dosage in mg. Paxlovid's standard dose is 300mg nirmatrelvir and 100mg ritonavir twice daily, but the question asks for her specific dosage, which isn't provided. So, N/A.

13. **Question 13:** The placebo brand isn't mentioned in the Stanford study description. So, N/A.

14. **Question 14:** The report had 13 patients, two were reinfected. The rest: 11. The courses ranged up to 30 days. The question asks how many had courses over 25 days. The longest was 30, but how many? The text says "courses ranged from 7.5 to 30 days." The exact number isn't stated, so N/A.

15. **Question 15:** The Stanford trial's average age isn't provided. The Communications Medicine patients were 25-55, but the Stanford trial's age isn't specified. So, N/A.

16. **Question 16:** The article lists symptoms like fatigue, GI, cognitive issues, muscle pain, irregular heart rate, postural tachycardia, and post-exertional malaise. It says "one or more of a range of symptoms," but doesn't state a third universal symptom. So, N/A.

17. **Question 17:** The doctor who prescribed Paxlovid to Kate isn't named. The authors include Dr. Peluso and others, but not the specific prescriber. So, N/A.

18. **Question 18:** The article doesn't mention when Dr. Singh moved to Iowa. It just states her current position. So, N/A.

19. **Question 19:** The Stanford study's Paxlovid duration was 15 days. The question asks for duration of the longest course for someone with post-exertional malaise. Since all in Stanford trial took 15 days, answer is 15. But wait, the article says "the Stanford trial involved 155 patients who took the drug or placebo for 15 days." So the duration was fixed. So the answer is 15 days.

20. **Question 20:** The article mentions migraine meds helped Dr. Vogel but doesn't name the specific type. So, N/A.
