Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. 

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions Rosa, a surrogate otter, raised 15 pups. So the answer is 15.

2. **Question 2:** The article states the aquarium was built with a $55M donation, but doesn't mention the current budget or percentage from that donation. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Only the Maine lobster lawsuit is mentioned. The question asks for lawsuits unrelated to it, but the article doesn't mention others. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The article says Julie studied giant kelp for her master's. The midnight zone includes vampire squid and salmon snailfish. But no mention of a plant being misclassified. Wait, the kelp is a plant she studied, but the question is about an organism in the exhibit. Maybe the kelp isn't in the midnight zone. The article says the midnight zone has those creatures, so maybe N/A here? Or is there another? Hmm, the question says "mistakenly classified as a plant" but the article only mentions her research on kelp (a plant). The midnight zone creatures are animals. So maybe N/A?

5. **Question 5:** The article doesn't provide specific attendance growth rates. The total visitors are 73M, but not per decade. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The Seafood Watch program's lawsuit is mentioned, but no federal agency named. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** She mentions giant kelp as the base, and mola mola (ocean sunfish) as the slow-swimming fish. So answer is giant kelp.

8. **Question 8:** The surrogate otters can only raise one pup each, so the answer is sea otters.

9. **Question 9:** The male executive is the Deputy Director.

10. **Question 10:** The original donation from her parents (David and Lucile Packard) was the funding contribution.

11. **Question 11:** The partner institute developed robotic submersibles.

12. **Question 12:** Mola mola (ocean sunfish) is cited as the example with the committee design.

13. **Question 13:** She mentions "the dry side" (humans) as the challenging species.

14. **Question 14:** SpongeBob is referenced as the animated character with the pineapple house.

15. **Question 15:** The albatross, Makana, is flightless due to injury.

16. **Question 16:** The free admission for school groups is the initiative.

Now, check each again for exact matches:

1. Rosa raised 15 pups. Correct.

2. No info on budget percentage. N/A.

3. Only the lawsuit mentioned, so unrelated ones not mentioned. N/A.

4. The question says "mistakenly classified as a plant". The article says she studied kelp (a plant) but the midnight zone creatures are animals. The article doesn't mention any being misclassified. So N/A.

5. No growth rate given. N/A.

6. No agency named. N/A.

7. Giant kelp is the answer.

8. Sea otters, as the surrogate program is for them.

9. Deputy director.

10. The $55M from her parents.

11. Robotic submersibles.

12. Mola mola.
