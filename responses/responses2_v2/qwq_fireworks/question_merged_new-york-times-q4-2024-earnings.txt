Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks for the percentage of total advertising revenue attributed to print advertising before the decline, given a 9.5% increase in digital. The article states that total advertising revenue was $165.1 million, with digital up 9.5% and print down 16.4%. But to find the percentage before the decline, I need the previous year's print revenue. Wait, the article only gives the current year's figures. Hmm, since it says digital advertising revenue was up 9.5% YoY, but I don't have last year's numbers. The question can't be answered because the previous year's print revenue isn't provided. So answer N/A.

2. The next question is about projecting next year's Q4 adjusted operating profit if growth continues. The current Q4 profit was $170.5M with a 10.7% increase. If the same percentage growth applies next year, it would be 170.5M * 1.107. But the article mentions the full-year profit increased 16.8%, but the question specifically refers to the CEO's statement about future growth. However, the question says "similar growth percentages" but doesn't specify which percentage. The Q4 growth was 10.7%, so applying that again would give the answer. But the question is about next year's Q4, so maybe using the current Q4's profit and adding 10.7% growth. Let me calculate that: 170.5 * 1.107 ≈ 188.5 million. But the problem is the question says "if Meredith anticipates similar growth percentages"—the article says she expects growth, but the exact percentage isn't stated. Since the question says "considering this quarter's $170.5M" and assumes the same percentage growth (10.7%), then yes, 170.5 * 1.107. But the article doesn't explicitly state that the CEO expects the same rate, so maybe it's N/A. Wait, the CEO's statement says "deliver another year of healthy growth in subscribers, revenue and profitability", but the exact percentage isn't given. Since the question requires using the current quarter's percentage (10.7%), then the answer is 170.5 * 1.107. Let me check the exact numbers. 10.7% of 170.5 is 18.3335, so total would be 188.8335. But the question says "projected adjusted operating profit for the next fourth quarter". Since the article doesn't specify the expected growth rate for next quarter, just that there will be growth, but the exact percentage isn't given. Therefore, since the question assumes using the current quarter's growth rate (10.7%), maybe the answer is 170.5 * 1.107. But the problem is the question is a bit ambiguous. Wait the question says "considering this quarter's $170.5 million?" So if the growth rate is the same as the current quarter's increase from last year, then yes. The current quarter's profit was up 10.7% from last year. So next year's would be 170.5M * 1.107. But the question says "if Meredith anticipates similar growth percentages"—maybe she expects the same rate, but the article doesn't state that. Since the question instructs to assume the same growth rate as this quarter's, then the calculation is possible. So I'll proceed with that. The answer would be approximately 188.8 million. But since the article uses exact figures, maybe they expect rounding to the nearest million? The article's numbers are in millions, so maybe 188.8M. But the question might expect the exact calculation. Let me check: 170.5 * 1.107 = 170.5 + (170.5 * 0.107). 170.5 *0.1 is 17.05, 0.007*170.5 is ~1.1935, so total 18.2435. So total is 170.5 +18.2435 = 188.7435, which rounds to 188.7 million. The answer would be $188.7 million. But the question might just want the numerical value without the dollar sign. The answer is 188.7. However, the article says "adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter increased 10.7 percent from a year earlier, to $170.5 million". So the previous year's Q4 was 170.5 /1.107 ≈ 154 million. But the question is about next year's profit, so 170.5 *1.107. Since the user might accept that, I'll go with that. So answer is 188.7.

3. The question is about the increase in cash per new digital subscriber from litigation costs. The litigation cost was $10.8 million for the year. The new subscribers added in the last quarter were 350,000. Wait, but the question says "per each new digital-only subscriber added in the last quarter". The cash and marketable securities increased from $709.2M to $911.9M, so the increase is $202.7 million. But the litigation cost is an expense, so the cash increased despite the expense. The net cash increase is $911.9M - $709.2M = $202.7M. The question is, how much did the cash increase per new digital subscriber (350,000) added in the last quarter? So $202.7M divided by 350,000. But wait, the litigation cost is an expense, so it's part of the cash outflow. The total cash increased by $202.7M despite the $10.8M expense. The question is phrased as "how much did the company's cash... increase per each new subscriber added". So the total cash increase is $202.7M, divided by 350,000 subscribers: 202,700,000 / 350,000 ≈ $579.14 per subscriber. But the question says "considering the litigation costs", but maybe it's asking for the net cash increase divided by the subscribers. The answer would be approximately $579.14, but since the question might want it in dollars and cents, but the article uses whole numbers. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the question says "how much did... cash and marketable securities increase per each new digital-only subscriber added in the last quarter?" So the total increase in cash is $202.7M, divided by 350,000 new subscribers gives about $579 per subscriber. So the answer is 579.14, but maybe rounded to the nearest dollar: $579. However, the question might have a different approach. Wait, the litigation cost is an expense, so cash went down by $10.8M, but total cash still increased. So the question is about the net increase in cash divided by the number of new subscribers. So yes, 202.7M divided by 350,000. Let me compute that: 202,700,000 ÷ 350,000 = 202700 ÷ 350 ≈ 579.142857. So $579.14. The answer should be in dollars, so maybe $579. But the question might want the exact figure, so 579.14. But the problem is the article says "cash and marketable securities" increased by $202.7M. The answer is $579.14 per subscriber. However, the question might be phrased as "how much did the cash increase per subscriber", so the answer is that number. So I'll go with 579.14, but maybe the answer expects rounding to the nearest whole number. Alternatively, maybe the question is trickier. Wait, the litigation costs are part of the expenses, but the cash increase is after all expenses. So the total cash increase is $202.7M, divided by the 350k new subscribers gives the per subscriber increase. So yes, 579.14. Since the answer format is numerical, perhaps they want it as a number without $, so 579.14, but maybe rounded to the nearest dollar. Let me check the numbers again. 202,700,000 divided by 350,000 is exactly 579.142857, so 579.14.

4. The question asks for the total subscribers lost across both print and digital in 2024. The digital-only subscribers added were 1.1 million net in 2024. The print subscribers went from 660k in 2023 to 610k in 2024, so a loss of 50k. So total loss is digital net gain (which is a gain, so not a loss) and print loss of 50k. But the question is total subscribers lost across both. Since digital added 1.1 million net, that's a gain, so no loss there. The only loss is print's 50k. So total is 50,000. The answer is 50,000. Wait, the question says "total number of subscribers lost across both print and digital platforms". Since digital added 1.1 million net, that means the net gain is 1.1 million, so the loss on digital would be negative (i.e., not lost). So total lost is only the print loss of 50,000. So answer is 50,000.

5. The question is about the total dividend payout if the dividend had remained at 13 cents instead of 18. The previous dividend was 13 cents (since it increased by 5 cents from the previous quarter to 18). The question says "assuming a direct correlation with the number of Class A shares implied by the repurchase program". Wait, the repurchase program is $350 million, but the number of shares isn't given. The question is tricky. The dividend payout is per share, so if the dividend per share was 13 instead of 18, then the total payout would be (number of shares) *0.13. But the number of shares isn't provided. The repurchase program's size doesn't directly give the number of shares outstanding. Since the article doesn't mention the number of shares, we can't compute the total payout. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

6. The question asks for average revenue per subscriber across all platforms, assuming all revenue streams are equally distributed. The total revenue in Q4 was $726.6 million. The total subscribers are 11.4 million digital-only plus print subscribers (610k at end of 2024, but the article says "total subscriber count" is over 11.4 million, which probably includes digital-only and print? Wait, the article says "total subscriber count to more than 11.4 million" after adding digital-only. The print subscribers were 610k. So total subscribers (digital and print) would be 11.4M + 610k? But the article might mean that the 11.4M are digital-only. The exact wording: "total subscriber count to more than 11.4 million" after adding 350k digital-only. Since the print subscribers are separate, total all subscribers would be digital-only (11.4M) plus print (610k) = 12,010,000. But the article might consider "total subscriber count" as only digital-only. The question says "assuming all revenue streams are equally distributed among them"—but revenue streams include subscription (digital and print?), advertising, etc. The question is confusing. The answer requires knowing the total number of all subscribers (digital and print) and total revenue. The total revenue is $726.6M. If all revenue is divided equally among all subscribers, then average revenue per subscriber is 726.6M / (digital + print). But the article says "total subscriber count to more than 11.4 million" (digital-only), and print is 610k. So total is 11.4M + 0.61M = 12.01M. Then 726.6 /12.01 ≈ 60.5 per subscriber. But the question says "assuming all revenue streams are equally distributed among them"—maybe all revenue (subscription, advertising, etc.) is divided by total subscribers. The answer would be approximately $60.50, but since the exact numbers aren't given (total subscribers might be exact?), but the article says "more than 11.4 million", so we can't get an exact number. Hence, the answer is N/A because we don't have the exact total subscriber count (since it's "more than 11.4M") and whether "total" includes print. Since the question requires an exact figure and the data isn't precise, answer N/A.

7. The question asks how many more print subscribers at end of 2022 compared to combined Wirecutter and The Athletic subscribers at end of 2024. The article mentions that in 2024, the company had subscribers to more than one product, but doesn't give numbers for Wirecutter and The Athletic. The print subscribers at end of 2022 were 730k. Since the number of subscribers for Wirecutter and The Athletic isn't provided, the answer is N/A.

8. The question projects total revenue increase for the current quarter assuming the highest growth rates for both digital subscription and digital advertising. The article says "the company expected digital-only subscription revenue in the current quarter to increase up to 17% from a year ago, with digital advertising revenue rising in the high single digits". The highest expected growth for digital subscriptions is 17%, and digital advertising in the high single digits (e.g., 9%). The current quarter's total revenue would be previous year's revenue plus growth. But the question is about total revenue's increase percentage. Let me see. The previous year's Q4 revenue was $726.6M /1.075 ≈ 676 million (since revenue increased 7.5% to 726.6). Wait, the current quarter's revenue is 2024's Q4, which was $726.6M. The expected growth for the current quarter (which is 2025's Q1?) The article says "the company expected digital-only subscription revenue in the current quarter to increase up to 17% from a year ago, with digital advertising revenue rising in the high single digits." Assuming "current quarter" is next quarter (after the reported Q4 2024), so comparing to same quarter 2023. Let's assume the previous year's same quarter's subscription revenue was, say, the previous year's subscription revenue in that quarter. But the article doesn't give last year's subscription figures except for the full year. Alternatively, the total revenue growth would be the sum of subscription (17% increase) and advertising (high single digits, say 9%) plus other revenue? But the question says total revenue's projected increase. To calculate total revenue increase, need to know the contribution of each part. Since the article doesn't provide last year's breakdown of subscription vs advertising in the current quarter, we can't compute the exact percentage. Hence, answer N/A.

9. The question asks what percentage of total revenue was represented by operating costs plus adjusted operating profit. The formula is (Operating Costs + Adjusted Operating Profit) / Total Revenue *100. For Q4, operating costs were $580 million, adjusted operating profit was $170.5 million. Total of those two is 580 + 170.5 = 750.5. Total revenue was $726.6M. Wait, but that can't be, because profit is revenue minus costs. If operating costs are 580, then revenue minus costs equals profit: 726.6 -580 = 146.6, but the article says adjusted operating profit was 170.5. Hmm, discrepancy. Wait the article says "Adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter increased 10.7 percent from a year earlier, to $170.5 million." So operating costs must be revenue minus profit. So revenue is 726.6M, so costs would be 726.6 -170.5 = 556.1M. But the article states operating costs grew 6% to $580 million. So there's inconsistency here. Wait maybe the "adjusted operating profit" is after some adjustments, so maybe operating costs are separate. The question says "operating costs and adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter"—so adding them would be costs + profit, but that equals revenue (since profit is revenue - costs). Therefore, the percentage would be (Costs + Profit)/Revenue = (Costs + (Revenue - Costs))/Revenue = Revenue/Revenue = 100%. But that's a tautology, so the question must have a mistake. But according to the article, operating costs were $580M, adjusted operating profit was $170.5M. So 580 +170.5 = 750.5, divided by revenue 726.6 gives over 100%, which is impossible. Therefore, the question is based on a wrong premise, so answer N/A.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to operating costs plus operating profit (which is the same as revenue). So the answer is 100%, but that's inherent. The question is likely a trick, but the article says operating costs were $580M, and operating profit was $170.5M. So revenue is costs + profit: 580 +170.5 = 750.5, but the revenue given is $726.6M. There's inconsistency. The article might have different definitions. Since the article says "adjusted operating profit" and "operating costs", perhaps adjusted profit is after some adjustments, so the numbers don't align. Therefore, the question can't be answered accurately, so N/A.

10. The question projects print subscribers remaining by end of 2026 if the decline continues at the same rate between 2023-2024. From 2023 to 2024, print went from 660k to 610k, a decrease of 50k over a year. The rate is a constant 50k per year. So by 2025: 610k -50k = 560k; 2026: 560k-50k=510k. So answer 510,000.

11. The question asks for the percentage increase in full-year adjusted operating profit. The article says "Adjusted operating profit for the full year was $455.4 million, up 16.8 percent from 2023." So the answer is 16.8%.

12. The question asks for the net digital-only subscribers added over the whole year. The article states "The Times added more than 1.1 million net digital-only subscribers in 2024". So the answer is 1,100,000.

13. The question is about litigation costs related to OpenAI. The article says "$10.8 million in 2024 on litigation costs relating to a copyright infringement lawsuit it filed in December 2023 against OpenAI and Microsoft." So the answer is $10.8 million.

14. The question asks for total advertising revenue for the quarter. The article says "Total advertising revenue in the quarter was largely flat at $165.1 million". So answer is $165.1 million.

15. The decline in print subscribers between end of 2023 and 2024: from 660k to 610k, so decrease of 50,000. The percentage decline is (50,000 /660,000)*100 ≈7.58%. But the question just asks the decline in numbers, which is 50,000.

16. The cash and marketable securities at end of 2024 were $911.9 million.

17. The repurchase program approved was a $350 million class A share repurchase.

18. The question asks which subscription product drove the revenue increase. The article says "subscription revenue grew 8.4 percent to $466.6 million in the fourth quarter, driven by an increase from digital-only products." It doesn't specify which product, but mentions Wirecutter and The Athletic as part of the offerings. Since it's driven by digital-only products in general, not a specific one, the answer is N/A.

19. The digital-only subscriber count at end of last quarter (Q4 2024) is more than 11.4 million. The exact number isn't given beyond "more than", so N/A. Wait, the article says "pushing the total subscriber count to more than 11.4 million." So the answer is "more than 11.4 million", but the question might want the exact figure. Since it's stated as over 11.4M, we can't specify exactly, so answer N/A.

20. The operating costs increased 6% to $580 million. The previous year's costs were 580 /1.06 ≈ 547.17 million. So the percentage increase is 6%.

Now I'll go through each question again quickly to ensure I didn't miss any.

1. N/A

2. 188.7 (approximate)

3. 579.14

4. 50,000

5. N/A

6. N/A

7. N/A

8. N/A

9. N/A (due to inconsistency)

10. 510,000

11. 16.8

12. 1,100,000

13. 10.8

14. 165.1

15. 50,000

16. 911.9

17. 350 million

18. N/A

19. N/A

20. 6

Wait, for question 20, the operating costs grew 6%, so the answer is 6%.

Wait, question 15 is the decline in numbers: 50,000.

Let me confirm all answers again based on the text.

Question 1: The article only gives the current year's advertising figures, not prior year's print, so N/A.

Question 2: The growth rate for Q4's profit was 10.7%, so applying that to next year's same quarter would be 170.5 *1.107≈188.8, so 188.7 or 188.8. Since the article uses one decimal, maybe 188.7 is okay.

Question 3: Total cash increased by $202.7M, divided by 350k new subscribers gives ~$579.14. So 579.14.

Question 4: Print lost 50k, digital gained 1.1M net, so total lost is 50k.

Question5: Can't compute shares, so N/A.

Question6: Can't get exact total subs, so N/A.

Question7: No data on other sub numbers, so N/A.

Question8: Not enough data to compute total revenue's growth rate, so N/A.

Question9: The math leads to over 100%, which is impossible, so N/A.

Question10: 610k-50k=560 in 2025, then 510 in 2026. So 510,000.

Question11: 16.8% as stated.

Question12: 1.1 million.

Question13: 10.8.

Question14: 165.1.

Question15: 50,000.

Question16: 911.9.

Question17: 350 million.

Question18: N/A, since no specific product mentioned.

Question19: "more than 11.4 million"—exact not given, so N/A.

Question20: 6% increase in operating costs.
