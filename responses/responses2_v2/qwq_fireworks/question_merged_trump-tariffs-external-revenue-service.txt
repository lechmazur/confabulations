Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the provided article. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked without inferring beyond the text.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which Congressional committee approved the ERS before Trump's executive order. The article mentions that creating the agency is Congress's job but doesn't specify any committee. Since there's no info, I'll put N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The second question is about the projected revenue from a 25% tariff on Canada. The article says Trump planned a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico starting Feb 1, but there's no figure given for the revenue. So N/A again.

3. **Question 3:** The name of the former customs house in D.C. is mentioned as "stately customs houses" but no specific name. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** No mention of any foreign association protesting the ERS. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The $111.8B in 2022 includes Chinese goods, but the article doesn't break down percentages. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The article doesn't mention an interim director appointed. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** No specific port city mentioned for the electronic payment model. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The deadline for the feasibility report. The executive order was issued on Monday evening, and the article says they were directed to "investigate the feasibility" but no specific deadline. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The number of new officers isn't stated. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Cost savings from consolidation aren't mentioned. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The expert who called it "more branding than substance" is Scott Lincicome from Cato Institute. That's in the text.

12. **Question 12:** The 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico starting Feb 1 is mentioned in Trump's plan. The answer is 25%.

13. **Question 13:** The 1789 agency is the Customs Service, referenced indirectly. So answer is Customs Service.

14. **Question 14:** Before 9/11, Customs was under the Treasury Department. Correct.

15. **Question 15:** Trump claimed tariffs would generate "massive" revenue pouring into the Treasury from foreign sources. So the answer is "massive amounts of money pouring into our Treasury coming from foreign sources."

16. **Question 16:** The current agency handling those tasks is Customs and Border Protection (CBP), part of Homeland Security. The article says Customs officials collect tariffs and do those tasks.

17. **Question 17:** The revenue surge is credited to Trump's 2018-2019 tariffs on metals, solar panels, and Chinese goods. So list those.

18. **Question 18:** CBO said tariffs would raise consumer prices. So answer is "raise consumer prices."

19. **Question 19:** The executive action was an executive order issued on Monday evening, as stated. The exact name is "executive order."

20. **Question 20:** The expert suggested a name like "Foreigners Pay the Tariffs Agency," but the actual proposed moniker by the expert is the "External Revenue Service," but the alternative was the example given. Wait, the article says Scott Lincicome called it "more branding than substance" and mentioned the name "Foreigners Pay the Tariffs Agency" as an example. So the answer is "Foreigners Pay the Tariffs Agency."

Wait, let me check again. The article says: "Scott Lincicome [...] called the agency's name 'more branding than substance -- and misleading branding at that.' 'Trump could call it the 'Foreigners Pay the Tariffs Agency,' and it still wouldn't change the fact that Americans really are [paying].'" So the alternative moniker proposed by the expert is "Foreigners Pay the Tariffs Agency." That's the answer for question 20.
