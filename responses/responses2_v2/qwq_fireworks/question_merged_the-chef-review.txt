Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and not anything else. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions a rivalry between Dori and a former sous chef who was called "Tel Aviv's most interesting chef" by Haaretz. However, the question asks what award Dori won. The text doesn't mention any specific award for Dori. So the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The article states that the show's first season premiered in 2020 with nine episodes, and the fifth episode arrives on Thursday (when the article was published). The total episodes across all seasons aren't specified. It only mentions Season 1 has nine episodes. But maybe the article is from when Season 1 was ongoing? Since it says "the fifth of that season's nine episodes arrives on Thursday," implying that up to that point, four had been released, but the total across all seasons would still be nine if only Season 1 exists. However, the question is about total episodes released as of the article's publication. Since it's talking about the fifth arriving on Thursday, that means five have been released so far (assuming the article is published on that Thursday). Wait, the article says "the fifth of that season's nine episodes arrives on Thursday." So the first season has nine episodes total, and as of the article's publication, five have been released (since the fifth is arriving then). But the question is total episodes across all seasons. The article doesn't mention other seasons. So the answer would be N/A because we don't know the total across all seasons, only that Season 1 has nine episodes, but how many have been released? The article says the fifth is arriving on Thursday, so perhaps five are out. But the question is total episodes released across all seasons. Since only Season 1 is mentioned, and five have been released, but the question is total, maybe the answer is N/A because the total released is not given, only that the fifth is coming. Wait, the article says "the fifth of that season's nine episodes arrives on Thursday," so up to that point, four were already out, and the fifth is arriving. So total released would be five. But the question is how many total episodes have been released across all seasons. Since only Season 1 exists, and five are released so far, but the total episodes in Season 1 are nine. The question asks total across all seasons, so as of the article's publication, it's five. But the article might not state that. Wait, the first paragraph says "The show's first season premiered in 2020, two years before 'The Bear.' The fifth of that season's nine episodes arrives on Thursday." So the first season has nine episodes, and the fifth is coming out on Thursday. So up to that Thursday, five episodes have been released. However, the question is "as of the article's publication." Assuming the article is published on that Thursday, then five have been released. But the article doesn't explicitly state how many have been released before the fifth arrives. The exact number might not be there. The article only says that the fifth is arriving on Thursday. So maybe the total is N/A because we don't know how many were released before the fifth episode's arrival. Hmm, tricky. Alternatively, maybe the total released is five (including the fifth episode arriving on Thursday). But the question is total across all seasons. Since only Season 1 is mentioned, and it has nine episodes, but only five have been released so far. The article doesn't state that all nine are out. So the answer would be N/A because the total number of episodes released as of the article's publication isn't explicitly stated, only that the fifth is arriving. So I'll go with N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The article mentions "No Abed. Curfew." in the context of an absence. The question asks which real-world political event in Tel Aviv during 2020 caused this. The article says the show was filmed in 2020, and the absence is due to curfew. However, the specific political event isn't named. The article just says "curfew" but doesn't mention which one. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The question asks for the dish Nimrod invented during his tryout that got him promoted. The article doesn't mention any specific dish invented by Nimrod. It talks about his role and how he's observed by Dori, but no dish name is given. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The article compares "The Chef" to "The Bear" but was made first. The question asks which character from "The Bear" is compared to Gitit Fisher, the pastry chef. The article says "the women... including Rotem Sela as the restaurant's preternaturally calm manager, and Gitit Fisher as the itchy pastry chef." It doesn't mention any comparison to "The Bear" characters. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Nimrod's financial hardship is mentioned as why he took the valet job. The article states "he has aged out of Tel Aviv's tech sector and is working as a valet parking attendant. Given a tryout... because of his financial hardship." But it doesn't specify what the hardship is. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The question asks how many years younger Nimrod is than Dori. The article says they're at opposite ends of the kitchen hierarchy but doesn't give ages. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The article doesn't mention any Israeli political figure making a cameo in Episode 5. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The article doesn't mention any specific brand of kitchen equipment. It talks about authenticity but not brands. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The article doesn't mention Dori citing a historical culinary figure as inspiration. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The series is compared to "The Bear," and the question asks which character is depicted as a careless yet effective leader. The article says Dori is a toxic narcissist. Maybe Dori? The critic mentions "ineffective to delegate" critique. The article says Dori's behavior, so perhaps Dori. The answer might be Dori, but the question specifies the comparison to "The Bear." The article's comparison is about the show's approach, not characters. The article says "The Chef" stands back from the flare-ups and bad-boy misbehavior. The character in "The Bear" might be someone like the chef in that show. But since the question asks which character in Sophia is depicted like that, maybe Dori. Let me check the text again. The article says "Dori is amused by Nimrod and wants to help him out, but he also blithely takes advantage of Nimrod's enthusiasm and financial hardship." So he's careless yet effective? Maybe. The article also says "the show's first season premiered in 2020, two years before 'The Bear.'" The comparison is about the show's approach. The question's answer is likely Dori, but the exact phrasing is needed. The article says "ineffective to delegate subtly critiques the hierarchy" so perhaps Dori. I'll say Dori. But the question asks for the name. The article refers to Dori as the chef. So answer: Dori.

12. **Question 12:** The composed figure ensuring continuity despite marginal screen time is Rotem Sela as the manager. The article says "Rotem Sela as the restaurant's preternaturally calm manager." So answer: Rotem Sela.

13. **Question 13:** The character with challenges obtaining ingredients is Dori, as mentioned in the first paragraph. "His buyers can't source the ingredients he needs." So Dori's challenges exemplify the struggle. Answer: Dori.

14. **Question 14:** The cinematographer is Guy Raz, as stated in the text. The article says "Erez Kavel... and Guy Raz, his cinematographer." So answer: Guy Raz.

15. **Question 15:** Nimrod's transition from tech to the kitchen is the allegory. The article says Nimrod was a coder and now works in the kitchen. Answer: Nimrod.

16. **Question 16:** The line "Discretion is a very important quality..." is said by Dori. The article quotes him: "Discretion is a very important quality in our world." So Dori.

17. **Question 17:** The show's workforce lacks Arab characters. The article says "there is some cognitive dissonance in the portrayal... absence of Arab characters; the show makes note of it when a kitchen worker's absence is explained with: 'No Abed. Curfew.'" So the unexpected decision is the absence of Arab characters. The answer is absence of Arab characters, but the question asks what decision is evident. So the decision is the absence. The answer is "absence of Arab characters" but the question asks for the decision, so the answer is that there's an absence. The question is phrased as "what unexpected decision... evident in the workforce at Sophia?" Answer: absence of Arab characters.

18. **Question 18:** The series released in 2020 that's a precursor to "The Bear" is "The Chef." The article says "The show's first season premiered in 2020, two years before 'The Bear.'" So the answer is The Chef.

19. **Question 19:** The surrogate observer is Nimrod, as he's the new guy with financial hardships. The article says "Nimrod... becomes our surrogate eyes and ears." Answer: Nimrod.

20. **Question 20:** The directorial choices for emphasizing maintenance are by Erez Kavel, as he created and directed it. The article says "Kav-el, who directs, and Guy Raz..." So answer: Erez Kavel.
