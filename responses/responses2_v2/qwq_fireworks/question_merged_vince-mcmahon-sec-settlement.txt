Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly what's asked. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Total amount from WWE board's investigation**: The article says the board found McMahon spent $14.6 million from 2006-2022 on payments to women who accused him of sexual misconduct. Then it mentions an additional $5 million to two other women. Adding those together: 14.6 + 5 = 19.6 million. So the total is $19.6 million.

2. **TKO shares percentage**: The article states McMahon owned about 80% of WWE stock. But after the merger forming TKO, he reported 8 million shares. The question asks for the percentage he owned at the time of his resignation. However, the article doesn’t mention the total shares of TKO, so we can’t calculate the exact percentage. Therefore, N/A.

3. **Primary legal basis for SEC fine**: The SEC's issue was that McMahon didn't disclose settlements to the board, lawyers, or accountants. This failure prevented proper risk evaluation and accounting. The primary basis is failure to disclose, leading to accounting issues. So the answer is failure to disclose settlements, but the question asks for the legal basis considering SEC's focus on corporate governance and accountants. The SEC cited "minor accounting errors" per McMahon, but the article says the SEC said he didn't disclose agreements, affecting accounting. So the basis is failure to disclose leading to improper accounting.

4. **Total women confirmed**: The SEC mentions two women (the $7.5M and $3M settlements). The board's investigation found payments to women who accused him of sexual misconduct: $14.6M to some, and an extra $5M to two others. So total women: 2 (SEC) + (those in 14.6M?) but the 14.6M is for women who accused him, but how many? The article says "women" plural, but exact number not given. The additional $5M is to two others. So total would be 2 (SEC) + however many in the 14.6M (but it's not specified) plus two more. Since the question asks for confirmed, maybe only the ones mentioned by name: two from SEC and two more from the $5M, totaling 4. Wait, the board's finding: "spent $14.6 million... on payments to women who had accused him of sexual misconduct. The investigation also found that Mr. McMahon had made additional payments totaling $5 million to two other women." So the two other women are separate. So total women: 2 (SEC settlements) plus those in 14.6M (the article doesn't say how many, just "women") plus the two from the $5M. But since the question says "confirmed to have received payments across all investigations", the SEC mentions two, and the board's findings add two more (from the $5M). The 14.6M is for the women who accused him (but how many? The article says "women" but not the count). Since the question asks for confirmed, maybe only the ones specifically named: 2 (SEC) plus 2 (from the $5M) equals 4. But maybe the $14.6M includes the first two? The SEC's settlements were part of the $14.6M? The board's investigation found the $14.6M from 2006-2022, which would include the 2019 $7.5M and 2022's $3M? Then the additional $5M to two others are separate. So total women would be (number in $14.6M) plus two. Since the $14.6M includes the two mentioned in SEC, plus others? The article says "payments to women who had accused him of sexual misconduct" (plural), so maybe more than two. But since the question says "confirmed" via the investigations, but exact numbers not given, except for the two in SEC and two more in the $5M. So total is 4? Hmm, the article says "two other women" for the $5M. So total is 2 (SEC) + (the women in 14.6M, which includes the two?) plus the two others. Wait, the $14.6M is the total for the women who accused him, which would include the two from the SEC cases. Then the $5M is to two others not part of the accusations? The wording is tricky. The board's investigation found that he spent $14.6M on payments to women who accused him of sexual misconduct. Then, "made additional payments totaling $5 million to two other women". So the "two other women" are separate from the accusers. So total women: those in the 14.6M (which includes the two from SEC) plus two more from the $5M. But how many are in the 14.6M? The article doesn't specify. Since the question asks for the total confirmed, perhaps only the two from SEC and the two from the $5M (total 4) plus others, but since the exact number isn't given, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "confirmed to have received payments across all investigations mentioned". The SEC order mentions two women, and the board's findings mention "two other women" for the $5M. The $14.6M includes the two from SEC, but how many total in that? Since the article doesn't give a count beyond "women", it's impossible to know exactly. Therefore, the answer might be N/A. Wait, but the SEC order's two are confirmed, plus the two others (the $5M), so total 4. The $14.6M includes those two but maybe more. But the question is asking for the total confirmed, so perhaps the answer is 4? Or is the $5M part of the board's findings, which are included in the 14.6? The article says the board found $14.6M from 2006-2022, then "made additional payments totaling $5M to two other women". So those two are separate. Therefore total women: at least four (the two from SEC, plus two others). The question says "confirmed", so 4? But maybe more in the 14.6M. Since the exact number isn't given, maybe N/A. Hmm, this is tricky. Let me check the article again. The board's investigation found that he spent $14.6 million on payments to women who accused him of sexual misconduct, and then made additional payments totaling $5 million to two other women. So the two other women are not part of the accusers. So total women: the ones who accused him (number unknown) plus two. Since the question asks for total confirmed, but the number isn't specified except for the two in SEC and the two in the $5M. Wait, the SEC's two are part of the $14.6M? The SEC's order mentions two women, one of whom accused him of assault (the $7.5M) and the other (the $3M). So those two are part of the $14.6M. The additional $5M to two others are separate. So total women: the ones in the 14.6M (at least two, possibly more) plus two more. But since the exact number isn't given, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, the question might just be asking for the number of women mentioned in the text. The SEC has two, the board mentions two more. So total of four. The article says "two other women" for the $5M. So total is 2 + 2 = 4. So answer 4.

5. **Entity that approved 2019 $7.5M settlement**: The article says "the W.W.E. was listed as a party to the confidential settlements with the women, Mr. McMahon had not disclosed those agreements to the company's board, lawyers or accountants." So the WWE was a party, but McMahon didn't disclose to the board. So the settlement was approved by WWE, but without the board's knowledge. The question asks which entity initially approved it. Since WWE was a party, perhaps WWE's legal team or another entity? But the article says "the W.W.E. was listed as a party", so maybe the settlement was between McMahon and the woman, with WWE as a party, but the approval might have been done without board disclosure. The article doesn't explicitly say who approved it, just that WWE was a party. So perhaps the answer is WWE, but since the question asks who "approved", maybe it's the woman and McMahon, but the entity would be WWE. Alternatively, since the SEC says the WWE was a party but McMahon didn't disclose to the board, implying the board didn't approve. Maybe the answer is N/A, but the question might be looking for WWE. The article states the settlement was reached with the woman, and WWE was a party. So the entity that approved would be WWE, but since the exact approving body isn't mentioned, maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "given the article's details about WWE's involvement in confidentiality agreements and board oversight". Since the board wasn't informed, the approval might have been done without them, perhaps by McMahon himself? The answer might be N/A because it's not specified. Alternatively, the settlement was reached without board approval, so perhaps the answer is N/A. Hmm.

6. **Federal agency overseeing NDAs**: Janel Grant's lawyer says the SEC settlement supports her claim that her NDA was illegal. The SEC is handling corporate governance, but the NDAs' legality might be under another agency. However, the SEC's action relates to McMahon not disclosing, not the NDA's legality. The question asks which agency is responsible for overseeing the NDAs. Since the article mentions the SEC's role in corporate disclosures, but the NDA legality (like under labor laws or other regulations) might be handled by the EEOC or another agency. But the article doesn't specify, so maybe N/A. Wait, the article says the lawyer argues the NDA was illegal, but which agency oversees that? The question states "based on Janel Grant's allegations and the SEC's enforcement action". Since the SEC is handling the corporate disclosure issue, but the NDA's legality might be under another. Since the article doesn't name the agency, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the SEC isn't the right one here, so N/A.

7. **Percentage stock controlled during non-disclosure period**: The article says during the time he failed to disclose, he was WWE's controlling shareholder owning about 80%. So the answer is 80%.

8. **Total of two settlements mentioned in confidential agreements**: The two settlements are $7.5M (assault) and $3M (personal relationship). Total is 10.5 million.

9. **Value of shares at $1M each**: He had 8 million shares. 8 million shares * $1M each would be 8,000,000 * 1,000,000? Wait no, if each share is worth $1M, then 8 million shares would be 8,000,000 * $1,000,000. That's 8 billion. But that's probably a misunderstanding. The question says "if each of McMahon’s reported shares were hypothetically valued at one million dollars, what would be the total value of his holdings". So 8 million shares * $1 million per share = $8,000,000,000 (8 billion). The answer is 8,000,000,000.

10. **Which came first: board's investigation or assault settlement?** The board became aware in April 2022 and opened an investigation. The assault settlement was in 2019. So the assault settlement came first.

11. **Starting year of payments**: The board's investigation found payments from 2006 to 2022. So starting year is 2006.

12. **Title after merger**: After the merger, he served as executive chairman of TKO Group.

13. **Settlement not for concealing relationship**: The $7.5M was for assault after refusing sex, while the $3M was to keep the relationship secret. So the $7.5M is the one not for concealing a relationship.

14. **Combined total of the two mentioned settlements**: $7.5M + $3M = $10.5M.

15. **What prompted his resignation from WWE**: The board's investigation led to his resignation in June 2022, not the SEC's order. The SEC's action came later. The article says the board's investigation found the payments, leading to his resignation.

16. **New corporate name after merger**: TKO Group.

Now, let me verify each answer again against the text.

1. The board's findings: $14.6M (2006-2022) and an additional $5M to two others. Total is 19.6M. Correct.

2. TKO shares: The article says he owned 8M shares of TKO, but doesn't state the total shares, so percentage is N/A.

3. SEC's basis: Failure to disclose settlements affecting accounting and risk evaluation. The answer should be failure to disclose settlements to the board, lawyers, and accountants.

4. Women: SEC mentions two, board adds two more (the $5M to two others). So 4. The 14.6M includes the two from SEC, but the question asks for total confirmed, so 4.

5. Approval of 2019 settlement: The article says WWE was a party but McMahon didn't disclose to the board. So maybe the settlement was between him and the woman, with WWE as a party. The entity that approved isn't specified, so N/A?

Wait, the question says "initially approved the $7.5M settlement in 2019". Since WWE was a party, maybe WWE's legal team or another entity. But the article doesn't say who approved it. The answer might be N/A.

6. Agency overseeing NDAs: The article mentions SEC's role in corporate disclosures but not NDA legality. The lawyer's argument about the NDA being illegal isn't linked to a specific agency. So N/A.

7. 80% correct.

8. 10.5M correct.

9. 8 million shares at $1M each is 8,000,000,000.

10. Assault in 2019 before board's 2022 investigation. Correct.

11. 2006. Correct.

12. Executive chairman. Correct.

13. The $7.5M was for assault after refusal, so that's the one not for concealing relationship. Correct.

14. 10.5M. Correct.

15. Board's investigation prompted resignation. Correct.

16. TKO Group. Correct.
