Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the given article. I need to be careful to answer exactly based on the text and not use any outside knowledge. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks how many chemicals the Biden administration restricted after Nancy Beck rewrote the rules on the "forever chemical." The article says the Biden admin proposed or finalized restrictions on 10 dangerous chemicals, including trichloroethylene and asbestos. But the question specifies "after Nancy B. Beck rewrote rules." Wait, Beck was in the first Trump admin, so the Biden admin's actions came after her previous role. The article mentions that Biden proposed or finalized restrictions on 10, so the answer is 10. But the question is about the number they restricted after her rule changes. Since the article states that Biden did this, the answer should be 10. But need to confirm if it's exactly the number mentioned. The article says "proposed or finalized restrictions on 10 dangerous chemicals," so the answer is 10.

2. The second question: What role did Dr. Beck hold at Hunton Andrews Kurth before becoming a political appointee? The article states she was director of regulatory science there. So the answer is "director of regulatory science."

3. The third question asks for the name of the environmental group whose director warned about weakening protections. The article mentions Daniel Rosenberg from the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). So the answer is "Natural Resources Defense Council."

4. The fourth question: besides asbestos, what other substance did Beck help scale back bans on? The article says "methylene chloride, a harmful chemical found in paint thinners." So the answer is "methylene chloride."

5. The fifth question: the coalition's stated reason for asking to revisit the PFAS designation. The article says they called the Biden's approach "unscientific, sledgehammer approach" and wanted to revisit the PFAS standards. The reason given was the "unscientific approach." So the answer is "unscientific, sledgehammer approach."

6. Sixth question: the year Biden finalized restrictions on trichloroethylene. The article says "over the past four years the Biden administration has tried to catch up... proposed or finalized restrictions on 10 dangerous chemicals, including trichloroethylene..." Since the article was published in the current time, but the exact year isn't given. The article doesn't specify the year, so answer N/A.

7. Seventh question: the mineral Beck helped scale back bans on. Asbestos is mentioned as a heat- and fire-resistant mineral. So the answer is "asbestos."

8. Eighth question: under Dekleva's leadership, what action were employees encouraged to take? The article says employees were pushed to approve new chemicals based on less stringent assessments. So the answer is "approve new chemicals based on less stringent assessments."

9. Ninth question: what organization did Beck lead before the American Chemistry Council? The article says she was a former executive at the American Chemistry Council, but before that? The article mentions she was at Hunton Andrews Kurth as director of regulatory science, but before that? Wait, the article says "a former chemical-industry executive who fought against stronger regulations under the first Trump administration is returning... Nancy Beck, a toxicologist and former executive at the American Chemistry Council." It doesn't mention another organization she led before ACC. So the answer is N/A. Unless she was at the ACC first, but the question is about before joining ACC. Since the article doesn't say, answer N/A.

10. Tenth question: maximum capacity of the tent city for migrants. The article states "preparing a tent city to house as many as 30,000 migrants." So the answer is 30,000.

11. Eleventh question: primary reason cited by ACC for supporting non-hazardous designation. The article says the industry groups wanted to revisit the hazardous designation because of the "unscientific approach." But the question is about the ACC's reason. The ACC's statement is: "looked forward to working with all EPA staff in support of sound science and policy to strengthen America's competitiveness and create jobs." So the primary reason would be "sound science" or "strengthen America's competitiveness and create jobs." The exact reason cited is their support for "sound science." But the question is about the reason for opposing the hazardous designation. The coalition's letter mentions the "unscientific approach," so the ACC's reason is the same as the coalition's. But the question is phrased as the ACC's reason. The article says the coalition, including ACC, called the approach unscientific. So the answer is "unscientific approach" or "sound science." Wait, the question is asking for the primary reason cited by ACC. The ACC's statement mentions "sound science" and policy for competitiveness. The article says the coalition (including ACC) in the letter asked to revisit because of the "unscientific approach." So the answer is "unscientific approach."

12. Twelfth question: numerical threshold for PFAS in drinking water. The article states Biden set the first federal standards for PFAS, but doesn't give a numerical value. So answer N/A.

13. Thirteenth question: provision used to justify Guantanamo for migrants. The article mentions that the Trump admin is holding migrants there, but the question links to a 2016 law? The article says the Biden admin used a law to designate PFAS as hazardous, shifting cleanup costs. The migrant part: the article says "Threats to Canada..." section mentions the tent city and Guantanamo for migrants with gang ties. The question asks which provision in the 2016 chemical safety law was used. Wait, the 2016 law is about chemical safety (the article mentions a law strengthened in 2016). The migrant housing might be under a different law. The article doesn't connect the chemical law to the migrant housing. So the answer is N/A.

14. Fourteenth question: number of West Point clubs disbanded due to Nancy Beck's policies. The article mentions DEI section where West Point ended a dozen clubs due to Trump's D.E.I. ban. The question links Beck's policies, but Beck's role was on chemical regulations. The DEI action was from Trump's D.E.I. ban, not Beck's policies. So the answer is N/A because Beck's policies aren't linked to that.
