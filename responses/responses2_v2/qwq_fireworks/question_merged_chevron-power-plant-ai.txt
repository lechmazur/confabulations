Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and answer each exactly as per the instructions. Let's go step by step.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which tech company's stock dropped the most percentage-wise after DeepSeek's announcement. The article mentions that Nvidia's stock fell 17% and Constellation Energy dropped over 20%. Since the question specifies a "technology company," Constellation Energy is an energy company, so the answer should be Nvidia.

2. **Question 2:** Engine No.1 secured seven gas turbines from GE Vernova. The article states "reserved seven gas turbines from GE Vernova." But the question is about gigawatts. The next part says they expect to build up to four gigawatts. The turbines themselves are equipment, so the capacity is four gigawatts. Wait, the question is about the capacity secured via the turbine order. The turbines are part of the equipment needed for the four gigawatts. The article says "seven gas turbines from GE Vernova" but the capacity they aim to build is up to four gigawatts. So the answer is four.

3. **Question 3:** The question is about 2025, but the article says "2028" with 12%, and 2023 at 4.4%. There's no 2025 figure, so N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The article says Engine No.1 is known for a proxy battle against Exxon in 2021. It doesn't mention Chevron, so the answer is Engine No.1.

5. **Question 5:** The article says they ordered equipment but didn't state the total value. The cost per gigawatt is $2B, but they are planning up to four gigawatts. However, the question is about the order placed with GE Vernova. The article mentions "reserved seven gas turbines from GE Vernova" but no total value, so N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The article says they have ruled out the East Coast and looked for sites with carbon sequestration. It doesn't specify how many sites met the criteria, so N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The article mentions Chevron's CEO talking about keeping costs low but doesn't provide ROI figures compared to oil drilling. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The companies determined regions excluding the East Coast. The article says they have ruled out the East Coast, implying other regions have higher potential, but doesn't name the highest potential region, so N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Microsoft and Google aim to use carbon-neutral energy but the timeline isn't specified in the article. It just says "set targets," so N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The article doesn't mention additional grid capacity needed, just that they might connect later. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The company initiating the plants is Chevron, as stated in the first paragraph.

12. **Question 12:** The CEO mentioned is Mike Wirth of Chevron.

13. **Question 13:** Morgan Stanley's estimate is $2 billion per gigawatt.

14. **Question 14:** Bypassing the grid allows quicker startup, as grid approvals take time.

15. **Question 15:** 2023 is 4.4%, 2028 is up to 12%, so difference is 7.6 points (12-4.4=7.6).

16. **Question 16:** The firm is Engine No.1.

17. **Question 17:** Nvidia's stock fell 17%.

18. **Question 18:** Constellation Energy bought Calpine for $16.4B.

19. **Question 19:** The greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide (CO2).

20. **Question 20:** The structural change is building gas plants directly connected to data centers, off-grid initially, using turbines from GE, etc. The answer is co-locating gas plants with data centers.
