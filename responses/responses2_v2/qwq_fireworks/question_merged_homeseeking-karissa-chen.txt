Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let me start by reading through the questions and then check the article for answers.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks about the longtang district in Shanghai where the porridge peddler encountered Suchi and Haiwen's families during the Japanese occupation. The article mentions a longtang at dawn in 1947 Shanghai with the porridge peddler, but it doesn't specify a district name. So, I'll note that as N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The fortune teller's name predicting yuanfen isn't mentioned. The article says "a fortune teller's prediction" but doesn't give their name. So, N/A again.

3. **Question 3:** The time between their second reunion and the 2008 meeting in LA. The text states they meet in 2008, which is their third reunion. The second meeting isn't dated, so the exact years between can't be determined. Answer N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The Communist official persecuting Haiwen's family during the Cultural Revolution isn't named. The article mentions their families endured the Cultural Revolution but no specific official. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The melody played by violins when Howard met Sue. The article says "a chorus of violins ushered Suchi into Howard's life," but no specific melody is named. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The night-soil man's daughter who helped Suchi escape. The article doesn't connect the night-soil man's daughter to Suchi's escape. It mentions Suchi escaped with her sister Sulan. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The Nationalist Army unit Haiwen served in. The article says he enlisted in the Nationalist Army but doesn't name the unit. Answer N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The dish Suchi's mother prepared. The opening scene mentions a porridge peddler's song, but it's not clear if that's what she made. The text doesn't specify the dish, so N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The occupation of Suchi's cruel husband. The article says he was cruel but doesn't state his job. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Number of siblings Haiwen left behind. The text mentions families but doesn't specify the number. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Same as question 2, no name given. N/A.

12. **Question 12:** The specific LA neighborhood isn't mentioned. The article just says Los Angeles. N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Haiwen's military rank in Taiwan. The article doesn't mention his rank. N/A.

14. **Question 14:** The ship's name he took leaving Shanghai. Not mentioned. N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Years Suchi lived in Hong Kong before moving. The article says she escaped to Hong Kong but doesn't give the duration before moving to the US. N/A.

16. **Question 16:** The chapter title about Sulan's Cultural Revolution experiences. The article doesn't list chapter titles. N/A.

17. **Question 17:** Literary award "Homeseeking" won. The article doesn't mention any awards. N/A.

18. **Question 18:** The restaurant of their second reunion. The text doesn't specify a restaurant name. N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Number of children Suchi had with her first husband. The article mentions she had children but doesn't specify the count. N/A.

20. **Question 20:** The historical event leading Sulan and Suchi to flee Shanghai. The article states they fled due to the Communist takeover. So the answer would be the Communist takeover of Shanghai.

Wait, let me check question 20 again. The article says "forced to abandon their families, who, back in Shanghai, endure a Communist takeover, famine and the Cultural Revolution." So the direct event leading to their escape would be the Communist takeover. So that's the answer here.

Alright, I think that's all. Let me go through each question again to confirm.
