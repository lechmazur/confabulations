Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information given in the text and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions that Marianna's grandfather was missing in action, and in Soviet logic, this meant he was presumed captured by Nazis, making family members suspect. The text says Korol surveilled Marianna, so the answer is that her grandfather's status led to her being under suspicion, prompting surveillance. The direct link is her family's association through the grandfather's MIA status.

2. **Question 2**: The Engineer designed the mine, and there's a line: "I am coal. I am slowly transforming." The metamorphosis of the Holocaust victims into coal is linked to the mine's structure. The architectural feature here is the mine's shaft or structure itself, but the explicit link is the Engineer's statement about transforming into coal.

3. **Question 3**: The review says Zhanna turns into a "garishly painted doll for a sexually charged night on the town." The ritual is her wearing garish makeup, but the question asks about a specific ritual to channel her mother's powers. The text doesn't specify a ritual beyond the transformation scene, so maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "to channel her mother's purifying powers during her confrontation with Valet." The text mentions her turning into a doll but doesn't tie it to a ritual for her mother's powers. Hmm, maybe N/A?

4. **Question 4**: The reviewer mentions the O.G.P.U. in a list (O.G.P.U. and the Makhnovists). Since Korol is a Russian general who surveilled Marianna, perhaps the O.G.P.U. is the secret police organization. The article states "Korol, a Russian general who once surveilled Marianna," so O.G.P.U. is the answer.

5. **Question 5**: The Engineer alternates between speaking as the mine and the dead Jews. The symbolic object might be the shaft, as he speaks as the shaft. The text says "the Engineer, who designed the mine... is given to speaking, alternately, as the mine and as the dead Jews." No specific object mentioned, so maybe N/A? Wait, the shaft is part of the mine's structure. The answer could be "the shaft."

6. **Question 6**: Valet was banished by Marianna for killing a tramp and later returns as part of the invasion. The text says he "has returned home as part of Russia's invasion." The banishment led him to seek other avenues, so the direct link is that being banished pushed him to join the invasion forces. But does the article explicitly state that his banishment caused his recruitment? It just says he returned as part of the invasion. The article doesn't explicitly state that his banishment led to recruitment, so maybe N/A?

7. **Question 7**: The Engineer designed the mine and there's a line "I am coal. I am slowly transforming." The transformation into a geological element could be the Engineer becoming part of the mine. The novel's end might have him as the mine's structure. The text says "the Engineer... is given to speaking... as the mine." So maybe the Engineer undergoes the transformation, but the question asks which character. The answer is the Engineer.

8. **Question 8**: The Makhnovists are mentioned in the article. The reviewer says "the Russians... had turned into those whom they considered their worst enemy... the Nazis." The Makhnovists were a historical group, but the explicit parallel is between Russians and Nazis. The question asks about Makhnovists and Russian invaders. The article doesn't explicitly link Makhnovists to the invaders, so maybe N/A?

9. **Question 9**: Korol accuses Zhanna of supporting a political uprising. The text mentions "Maidan! Junta! Coup! Banderites!" which are references to the 2014 Ukrainian protests (Maidan). So the answer is the Maidan uprising.

10. **Question 10**: The headline mentions the translator as Antonina W. Bouis. The first line says "Translated by Antonina W. Bouis," so that's the answer.

11. **Question 11**: The catastrophic aviation incident is a surface-to-air missile taking out a passenger airliner, which really happened. The article states this as a plot device mirroring the historical event, so the answer is the downing of a passenger airliner.

12. **Question 12**: The presumption is that the soldier was captured by Nazis. The article says "a soldier who had gone M.I.A. in World War II was presumed to have been captured and recruited by the Nazis."

13. **Question 13**: Zhanna is described as turning into a garishly painted doll, so the answer is Zhanna.

14. **Question 14**: Valet is the character who lusts after Zhanna. The text says "Valet, a local thug... has returned home as part of Russia's invasion and lusts after Zhanna."

15. **Question 15**: Marianna is the deceased laundry forewoman, so her name is Marianna.

16. **Question 16**: The primary setting is the coal mine in eastern Ukraine, as stated in the first paragraph.

17. **Question 17**: The reviewer was born in the U.S.S.R., so the cultural background is Soviet or Russian.

18. **Question 18**: The review mentions Tristram Shandy's lament about full disclosure. The answer is "Tristram Shandy."

19. **Question 19**: The section "A Turn to Reality" mentions Nnedi Okorafor as the award-winning writer exploring trauma in her autobiographical novel. So the answer is Nnedi Okorafor.

Now, checking each again for accuracy and ensuring all are answered with N/A where necessary.
