Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information given in the article. Let me start by reading through the questions again and then check each against the article.

1. **How many days after Trump's inauguration did Harvard announce their adoption...?** The article says Harvard's move came "a day after the inauguration of President Trump." So that would be 1 day. But wait, the announcement was on Tuesday when the agreement was released. The question is about days after the inauguration. The article says the move came a day after the inauguration, so the answer is 1.

2. **Which Harvard department... focused on democracy in Palestine?** The article mentions the Kennedy School must allow alumni to host an event "on the substantive issues of Israeli Jewish democracy." Wait, the question says "Palestine," but the article says "Israeli Jewish democracy." Maybe a trick here? The answer would be N/A because it's about Israel, not Palestine.

3. **What percentage of Harvard's student groups signed the letter...?** The article states "more than 30 student groups posted an open letter." But the exact percentage isn't given. Since there's no total number of student groups, percentage can't be calculated. Answer N/A.

4. **According to Kenneth Marcus, monetary penalties...?** The article quotes Marcus hoping others adopt the definition but doesn't mention penalties. Answer N/A.

5. **Which Israeli university did Harvard name...?** The article says they must establish a partnership with an Israeli university but doesn't name it. Answer N/A.

6. **How many Congressional hearings did Claudine Gay attend...?** The article mentions her testimony during a Congressional hearing, but not the count. Answer N/A.

7. **Role of American Jewish Committee assigned to Kenneth Stern?** The article says Stern "helped draft the definition while he was at the American Jewish Committee." So his role was as a drafter, but the exact title isn't given. Answer N/A unless "helped draft" counts, but the question asks for the role assigned by the committee. Maybe "drafter" but the article doesn't specify. Hmm, maybe N/A.

8. **Who was appointed as Harvard's new consultant...?** The settlement terms require hiring someone to be consulted on complaints, but the name isn't given. Answer N/A.

9. **How many federal agencies...?** The article says "the Education Department and other federal agencies must 'consider' the I.H.R.A. definition." But how many? Not specified. Answer N/A.

10. **Minimum number of events Brandeis Center must host?** The article says "a variety of events" but no exact number. Answer N/A.

11. **Specific Israeli university named?** Same as question 5. N/A.

12. **Year of Trump's executive order?** The article mentions a 2019 executive order from Trump. So 2019.

13. **Exact monetary penalty?** The settlement includes an unspecified amount. So N/A.

14. **Current role of Shabbos Kestenbaum?** He graduated in June and is now a former student. The article says he's working with the White House but doesn't mention his current role at Harvard. Answer N/A.

15. **Month Brandeis Center filed lawsuit?** The article states the Brandeis Center sued in May. The other lawsuit was in January by Students Against Antisemitism. So May for Brandeis.

16. **Number of faculty members at Kennedy School required to host event?** The article says "three alumni to host an event." Not faculty members. Answer N/A.

17. **Jeffrey S. Flier's position at Harvard?** The article mentions he's a former dean of Harvard Medical School, but his current role isn't stated regarding overseeing the IHRA definition. Answer N/A.

18. **Which example references apartheid?** The article lists examples like holding Israel to a double standard or calling its creation a racist endeavor. No mention of apartheid. Answer N/A.

19. **Total lawsuits consolidated?** Two lawsuits were settled: one by Students Against Antisemitism and another by Brandeis Center. So 2.

20. **Federal department Shabbos Kestenbaum is collaborating with?** He mentioned working closely with the White House, which isn't a federal department. The article doesn't name a specific department. Answer N/A.
