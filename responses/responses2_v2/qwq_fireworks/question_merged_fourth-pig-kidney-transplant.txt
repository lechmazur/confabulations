Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly as per the instructions. Let's start with the first question.

1. **Question 1:** Which patient received a pig kidney transplant at NYU Langone Health and later required physical therapy to prepare for a heart surgery mentioned in the article?

The article mentions Towana Looney received a pig kidney at NYU Langone Health in November. However, the question mentions "later required physical therapy to prepare for a heart surgery." Looking through the text, Tim Andrews had a heart attack and started physical therapy to get in shape for surgery. But the question specifies NYU Langone, which was where Towana Looney was treated. The heart surgery part might be a confusion. Wait, Tim Andrews had a heart attack after starting dialysis, and the physical therapy was to prepare for the transplant. The question says "prepare for a heart surgery," but the article doesn't mention heart surgery for Looney. Since the question combines NYU and heart surgery, maybe it's a trick. Since the article doesn't link Looney to heart surgery, answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many gene edits were made to the pig kidney received by Lisa Pisano to address organ rejection rather than retroviruses?

Lisa Pisano's kidney was from United Therapeutics. The article mentions that Tim Andrews' kidney had 69 edits, 59 to inactivate retroviruses. The remaining would be 69-59=10, but that's for Andrews. The question is about Lisa Pisano's kidney. The article doesn't specify the number of edits for her kidney. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Total number of patients enrolled across both trials?

The article says Mass General is doing three as part of their trial (first of three). The other trial by United Therapeutics starts with six, could go to 50. But the total is 3 + 6 = 9 initially. But the question is "according to the article." The article says "the first of three that will be done at Mass General" and "the other, sponsored by United... will begin later this year with six patients, could eventually rise to 50." So currently, the total is 3 (Mass) + 6 (United) = 9. But the question is asking for the total number enrolled across both. Since the article mentions "first of three" (so 3 total for eGenesis?), and United's trial is starting with 6. So total is 3+6=9? But maybe the question is about current enrollment? The article says "first of three" so maybe only one done so far (Tim Andrews) plus the upcoming two at Mass. But the question says "enrolled across both clinical trials combined." The article says "first of three" at Mass, so maybe 3 planned there. United's trial is starting with 6. So total planned is 3+6=9, but the question is about enrolled. Since the article mentions that the latest transplant was done (Tim Andrews is the first of three at Mass), so enrolled so far at Mass is 1, and United hasn't started yet. So total enrolled so far would be 1 (Mass) + 0 (United) = 1. But the question might be asking for the total planned? The article says "the first of three that will be done at Mass General" and "the other... will begin later this year with six patients, but that number could eventually rise to 50." So the total is 3 (eGenesis) plus 6 (United's initial 6, which could go to 50). So the answer is 3+6=9, but maybe the question is about the current total, which is 1 (Tim Andrews) plus none yet in the other trial. But the question says "according to the article," which mentions the trials' plans. So the answer is 3+6=9? The question says "enrolled," so maybe the trials are still in planning. Hmm, tricky. The article says "the first of three that will be done at Mass General as part of a new clinical trial." So the trial at Mass is three patients. United's trial is starting with six. So total across both is 3+6=9. So answer is 9.

4. **Question 4:** Which surgeon performed the pig kidney transplant for Richard Slayman at NYU Langone Health before his death?

The article says Richard Slayman received an eGenesis kidney at Mass General. So the question says NYU, but the hospital was Mass General. So the surgeon would be Dr. Tatsuo Kawai (Mass General's lead surgeon), but since the question mentions NYU, which isn't where Slayman was treated, answer N/A.

5. **Question 5:** How many days after Tim Andrews' surgery did Towana Looney begin experiencing complications that delayed her discharge?

The article says Tim had his surgery in late January. Towana's surgery was in November, and she is doing well, planning to return home later that month (three months after her operation). There's no mention of her having complications delaying discharge. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Which company’s genetically modified pig kidneys were used in the clinical trial that required patients to undergo dialysis for at least five years prior?

The article mentions the eGenesis trial at Mass General and United's trial. The requirements for eligibility aren't specified here. The article says Tim Andrews had dialysis for over two years. The question asks which company's trial required five years. Since the article doesn't mention a five-year requirement, answer N/A.

7. **Question 7:** What specific type of insurance coverage does the article confirm will fully reimburse the cost of pig kidney transplants for Medicare patients?

The article states that most patients on kidney failure are on Medicare but doesn't specify if Medicare covers the transplant. It says "it's unclear what they would cost and whether they would be covered by insurance." So no confirmation, so N/A.

8. **Question 8:** How many porcine retrovirus gene edits were made to the pig kidney transplanted into the patient who tap-danced post-surgery?

The patient who tap-danced is Tim Andrews. His kidney had 59 edits to inactivate porcine retroviruses. So 59.

9. **Question 9:** Which hospital’s clinical trial involved pig kidneys with gene edits targeting both organ rejection and Alzheimer’s disease prevention?

The article doesn't mention Alzheimer's in any of the trials. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Primary reason for Towana Looney’s prolonged stay in NYC?

She is staying for follow-up care. The article says she plans to return home later that month (three months after her operation). The reason is follow-up care.

11. **Question 11:** Patient who tap-danced after Mass General surgery?

Tim Andrews tap-danced, and he had overcome heart complications (heart attack) and wheelchair use. So answer Tim Andrews.

12. **Question 12:** Which company’s pig kidneys with 69 edits (59 for retroviruses) were used at Mass General?

The article says eGenesis's organs. The kidney Tim got was from eGenesis, with 69 edits, 59 for retroviruses. So eGenesis.

13. **Question 13:** Patient treated in November at NYU, planning to leave NYC 3 months after transplant?

Towana Looney had her surgery in November at NYU and plans to return home three months after. So Towana Looney.

14. **Question 14:** Government health plan covering transplant recipients unable to work?

Medicare, as stated in the article.

15. **Question 15:** Trial with initial 6 patients (expand to 50) sponsored by a different corporation from Mass General?

United Therapeutics' trial is separate from Mass General's (eGenesis). So United Therapeutics Corporation.

16. **Question 16:** Massachusetts patient who received eGenesis organ and died?

Richard Slayman received eGenesis at Mass General and died shortly after.

17. **Question 17:** Corporation sponsoring trial with possible expansion to 50?

United Therapeutics.

18. **Question 18:** Hospital linked to post-op care of November transplant patient?

NYU Langone Health for Towana Looney.

19. **Question 19:** Procedure at Mass General last month leading to discharge in a week?

The pig kidney transplant (Tim Andrews' case).

20. **Question 20:** Type of transplant using pig organs to alleviate human organ shortage?

Kidney transplants, as the article focuses on kidneys.
