Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions beyond that.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions American users fled to RedNote to protest the U.S. ban on TikTok, but there's no specific mention of data privacy being their primary reason. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The article states that Tencent is the only Chinese company left in the top 10, but it doesn't provide a percentage decline in market cap. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The article doesn't mention any Silicon Valley company attempting to acquire RedNote in 2021. N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The text says U.S. investors stopped funding, but no total amount is given. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The investor said 40% of the fund's emerging market holdings were Chinese tech stocks before dropping to 3%. So the peak was 40%.

6. **Question 6:** The article mentions apps were removed, but doesn't specify the number. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** No specific revenue growth rate for RedNote after the influx is mentioned. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The Jiangsu user posted a panda doing laundry, but the number isn't stated. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The article compares work hours (996) but not salary differentials. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The article mentions the investor's fund had Chinese stocks drop to 3% after zero-Covid, but the percentage before isn't linked to the policy. The 40% peak was in 2017, but the question is post-zero-Covid. Since the timing isn't clear, N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The app wasn't removed; users joined after the U.S. ban threat. The number is 500,000. But the question says "after the app was removed," which didn't happen. So N/A.

12. **Question 12:** The investor joined in 2017. Didi raised $10B in 2016. The question says "around the same time Didi raised nearly $100 million" – but Didi raised $10B. The amount is wrong, so N/A.

13. **Question 13:** RedNote was founded in 2013 and hasn't gone public. The question mentions Xi prioritizing manufacturing in 2018, but the year matches. The user base is over 300M, Jiangsu's population is around 80M. So RedNote fits. Answer: RedNote.

14. **Question 14:** The year Tencent had 56% growth (2017) and Alibaba had 60% growth. The question says "when five of the top 10 were no longer Chinese" – but the five left were in 2017. Wait, the article says "now Tencent is the only one left". The question's phrasing is tricky. The answer might be 60%, as Alibaba's growth that year was 60%. 

15. **Question 15:** The author wrote at "another publication" around when Starbucks lost customers. The article doesn't name the publication. N/A.

16. **Question 16:** The article mentions RedNote as popular with young, urban, affluent female users. The question says "male users" and "dog tax" – which isn't in the text. The tax was "cat tax". So N/A.

17. **Question 17:** The article states ByteDance's overseas growth is faster than domestic. The question asks domestic growth rate when wolf warrior diplomacy and alliance with North Korea (the article says Russia) happened. No specific rate given. N/A.

18. **Question 18:** Andreessen Horowitz's partner preached WeChat's power. The crackdown on Alibaba etc. was in 2020-2021. So the answer is Andreessen Horowitz.

19. **Question 19:** The app with over 300M users (RedNote) and the time when endowments stopped funding. The article mentions RedNote has over 300M users. So the answer is RedNote.
