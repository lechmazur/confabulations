Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict formatting rules. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks about the program where the Trump administration stopped disbursement of funds, impacting HIV treatment globally. The article mentions under the health section that the administration stopped disbursement of funds from a program that supplies most of the HIV treatment in Africa and developing countries. The exact name isn't given, but the question specifies it's related to HIV treatment. Wait, the article says "a program that supplies most of the treatment for H.I.V. in Africa and developing countries worldwide." The program's name isn't mentioned here. Hmm, but maybe it's part of the development aid halted by the executive order. The order halted all development aid for 90 days, affecting programs like that. Since the question is asking for the name of the program, but the article doesn't explicitly name it, maybe it's N/A? Wait, no. Wait, the article says "the program that supplies most of the treatment for H.I.V. in Africa and developing countries worldwide." But the name isn't given. The question is asking for the name of the program. Since it's not named, I have to put N/A. Wait, but the answer might be "N/A" here. Let me check again. The exact text is: "the administration stopped disbursement of funds from a program that supplies most of the treatment for H.I.V. in Africa and developing countries worldwide." Since the program isn't named, the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe the question is referring to the "Mexico City rule"? Wait, no, the Mexico City rule is about abortion funding. The question is about HIV treatment. Hmm. So the answer would be N/A because the program's name isn't provided.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The article says: "the administration stopped disbursement of funds from a program that supplies most of the treatment for H.I.V. in Africa and developing countries worldwide." The program itself isn't named, so the answer is N/A. So answer 1 is N/A. Wait, but maybe the question is a trick? Let me read the question again. "the program from which the Trump administration stopped disbursement of funds, impacting HIV treatment globally?" The program's name isn't given, so yes, N/A.

2. The second question is about the historic civil rights order signed by Johnson that banned discrimination in government contracting. The article states: "Mr. Trump also revoked a civil rights-era order signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 that banned discrimination in government contracting." The name of that order is likely Executive Order 11246, but the article doesn't mention the name. Wait, the question is asking for the title of the order. The article says "a civil rights-era order signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 that banned discrimination in government contracting." Since the name isn't provided, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, but maybe the question is expecting the answer as "Executive Order 11246" even if the article doesn't state it. Wait, no, the instructions say to use only the article's facts. Since the article doesn't name it, the answer should be N/A. Wait, but the article says "the underpinning of the federal government's commitment to affirmative action." The question is asking for the name of the order. Since it's not named, answer is N/A. Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the order as "Executive Order 11246" but since the article doesn't state it, then yes, the answer must be N/A. Wait, the user instructions say to answer based solely on the text. The article doesn't give the name, so N/A. Hmm, but maybe I'm missing it. Let me check again. The article says "revoked a civil rights-era order signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 that banned discrimination in government contracting." The name of the order isn't mentioned. Therefore, the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe the question is referring to the name of the policy, like "affirmative action" but the order's name isn't given. So N/A.

Wait, but maybe the question is expecting "Executive Order 11246" as the answer even if the article doesn't name it. No, instructions say only use the article's facts. So answer is N/A. Hmm, but perhaps I missed a part where it's named. Let me check the exact text again. The relevant part under the DEI section says: "Mr. Trump also revoked a civil rights-era order signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 that banned discrimination in government contracting. The order was seen as the underpinning of the federal government's commitment to affirmative action." The article does not name the order, so the answer is N/A. So question 2: N/A.

Wait, but maybe the question is a trick and the order is referred to as "Executive Order 11246" but the article doesn't say that. Since the user says to only use the article, answer is N/A. Hmm.

3. The third question asks what unyielding gender recognition the executive order enforces. The article states: "a person's sex must be a permanent gender identity" and "the government to effectively recognize only two 'immutable' sexes -- male and female." The exact wording from the order is "two 'immutable' genders, male and female." So the answer is "two immutable genders, male and female."

4. The fourth question is about the international agreement the US withdrew from regarding climate change. The article says: "pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement." So answer is Paris climate agreement.

5. The fifth question asks which term the administration revived to describe migrants, reflecting a harder stance. The article mentions "aliens" as the term used: "Migrants -- now referred to as 'aliens' — are being turned away at the border." So the term is "aliens."

6. The sixth question is the specific date for the tariffs. The article states: "Feb. 1" as the date for the tariffs on Canada and Mexico (25%) and China (10%). So the date is February 1.

7. The seventh question is about the international public health organization withdrawn from. The article says: "World Health Organization" (W.H.O.), so answer is World Health Organization.

8. The eighth question is the video-sharing app with a temporary reprieve. The article mentions TikTok: "TikTok was given a temporary reprieve from a forced shutdown."

9. The ninth question refers to the group of top bureaucrats subject to easier termination. The article says: "Senior Executive Service, top bureaucrats across the government." The answer is Senior Executive Service.

10. The tenth question asks for the title of the order dismantling DEI programs. The article states: "Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing."

11. The eleventh question is the mountain renamed. The article says: "Mount Denali once again will be known as Mount McKinley."

Now, double-checking each answer:

1. The program name for HIV: article doesn't name it, so N/A.

2. Johnson's order's name: article doesn't name it, so N/A.

Wait, but maybe the order is called Executive Order 11246, but the article doesn't state that. Since the user says only use the article, must be N/A.

3. "two immutable sexes, male and female" – correct.

4. Paris climate agreement – correct.

5. "aliens" – correct.

6. Feb. 1 – correct.

7. World Health Organization – correct.

8. TikTok – correct.

9. Senior Executive Service – correct.

10. "Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing" – exact quote from the article.

11. Mount McKinley – correct.

So answers should be as above. Now, writing them in the required format.
