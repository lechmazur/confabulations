Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly. Let me go through each question and see what the article says.

1. **Question 1**: The first question is about California's governor proposing tax incentives to retain film production after wildfires. The article mentions Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed doubling tax incentives to $750 million annually. So the answer is $750 million. But the question asks for "billions," so $750 million is 0.75 billion. But the answer should be in billions, so maybe 0.75? Wait, the article says "double tax incentives for filming to $750 million annually." So the answer is $750 million, which is 0.75 billion. But the question specifies "billions," so maybe they want the exact figure in billions. The answer would be 0.75 billion, but since the question says "how many billions," the answer should be 0.75? Or maybe I misread. The article says "double tax incentives for filming to $750 million annually." So the proposed amount is $750 million, which is 0.75 billion. The question asks for "billions," so 0.75. But maybe the answer is N/A because it's not stated in billions but in millions. Wait, the question says "billions in tax incentives," but the article states "$750 million annually," which is less than a billion. So the answer might be N/A. Wait, maybe I need to check again. The article says "the state double tax incentives for filming to $750 million annually." So it's $750 million, which is 0.75 billion. The question asks for "billions," so the answer is 0.75? But the options might require a whole number. Hmm. Maybe the answer is N/A because the article specifies $750 million, not in billions. Alternatively, since 750 million is 0.75 billion, maybe 0.75 is acceptable. The question says "how many billions," so the answer is 0.75. But I need to check the exact wording. The question is: "How many billions in tax incentives did California's governor propose..." The article states "$750 million annually." Since 750 million is 0.75 billion, the answer is 0.75. But maybe the question expects "N/A" because it's in millions. Wait, the question says "billions," but the article says "750 million," so the correct answer is N/A because the amount is under a billion. Wait, the question is about the number of billions. Since it's 0.75 billion, but the question might expect a whole number. Hmm, tricky. Maybe the answer is N/A because it's not stated in billions but in millions. Alternatively, the exact figure is 0.75. I'll note that and proceed, but perhaps the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Which former Twitter investor introduced Musk to Chinese officials? The article mentions Musk considering borrowing against Tesla shares when he bought Twitter, but there's no mention of who introduced him. The text says Chinese officials are considering letting Musk buy TikTok, but no one is mentioned as introducing them. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Percentage of Tesla's market value Musk needs. The article states Musk might borrow against Tesla shares, which have soared. But no specific percentage is given. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Disney employees relocated to Eisenhower Executive Office. The article says Disney's CEO Bob Iger helped relief efforts, 64 employees lost homes, but nothing about relocation to that building. The Eisenhower space is mentioned for Musk's office. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Anysphere's revenue triggering Qatar's mediation. The article links Anysphere's funding to investor interest but no connection to Qatar's cease-fire talks. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Hollywood executive joining Bob Iger's committee. The article mentions Disney's Iger leading relief but doesn't name others joining. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Joey Levin's role at Cleveland-Cliffs. The article says Levin left IAC to oversee Angi's spinoff as executive chairman. So the answer is executive chairman of Angi.

8. **Question 8**: Harvard paid Ballard Partners for lobbying against tariffs. The article says Harvard hired Ballard Partners to lobby for the university but doesn't mention the amount or tariffs. The question is about lobbying against tariffs, but the article doesn't link Ballard's work to tariffs. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Percentage of Anysphere's code licensed to Meta. The article says Meta's Zuckerberg wants to automate code but doesn't mention Anysphere's licensing percentage. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Trump official proposing IEPA for TikTok. The article mentions Trump considering tariffs using IEPA but doesn't name the official who first proposed it. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Legal restriction on ByteDance as leverage. The article says the law requires TikTok's sale, so the leverage point is that ByteDance can't update TikTok unless sold. The answer is the U.S. law requiring the app's sale.

12. **Question 12**: Figure connected to EV company benefiting from Tesla sales. The article mentions Musk's Tesla has 40% sales in China, so the answer is Elon Musk.

13. **Question 13**: Leader with controversial trade stance as Musk's ally. The article says Musk is a counterweight to China hawks like Marco Rubio, but the referenced ally is Trump. The article mentions Trump opposing the ban and Musk's ties to him. So the answer is Donald Trump.

14. **Question 14**: Benefit from TikTok's data for AI. The article states TikTok's data could help train xAI's models. So the answer is training artificial intelligence models.

15. **Question 15**: Why Beijing might let TikTok be banned first. The article says discussions concluded letting it be banned to negotiate with Trump. The reason is to negotiate with Trump's administration.

16. **Question 16**: Financing method involving an auto company's assets. Musk using Tesla shares as collateral. So the method is borrowing against Tesla shares.
