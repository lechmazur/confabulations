Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks how many photographs are in the English translation of "Violence" by Collins. Wait, the article mentions "The Use of Photography" by Ernaux and Marie has 14 photographs. But the question is about "Violence," which is a different book by Collins. The article says Collins's "Violence" is a nonfiction work from 2009. The part about the photographs is in Ernaux's book. Since the question is about Collins' "Violence," the article doesn't mention any photographs in that book. So the answer here should be N/A.

2. The second question is about where the bookseller recommended to find a copy of "Violence." The article says "Available from: Princeton University Press" for "Violence." So the answer is Princeton University Press.

3. Third question: Scott Turow's latest novel is "Presumed Guilty," mentioned as a new case for Rusty Sabich. The question asks about a genre-bending approach similar to Ernaux's. Ernaux's work hybridizes fiction, memoir, and sociology. The article says "We Do Not Part" by Han Kang is a novel delving into historical wounds, but Turow's book isn't mentioned as genre-bending. The question might be mixing authors. Since the article doesn't mention Turow using a similar approach, answer N/A.

4. Fourth question asks for a specific type of fighting Collins mentioned, paralleled by Molly in Han Kang's work. The article lists examples in Collins' book including boxing, pillow fights, mosh pits, etc. The question mentions Han Kang's exploration, but the article says Han's work is about historical wounds. The parallel might be to "domestic abuse" or "boxing matches" but the exact parallel isn't stated. Since the question links to Han's work which isn't directly connected to Collins' examples, maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "Molly Young cites as a parallel to the photographic documentation..." but the article's connection between Han and Collins isn't clear. So N/A.

5. Fifth question: What prize did Ernaux (author of "The Use of Photography") receive that led to African publishing growth? The article mentions a "Renaissance in African Publishing" in a separate paragraph. There's no mention of Ernaux winning a prize related to that. So N/A.

6. Sixth question: Where did Marc Marie pass away? The article states he died in 2022 but doesn't mention the city. So N/A.

7. Seventh question: What cord is mentioned in the photos of "The Use of Photography"? The article says "a twisted extension cord" is among the items photographed. So the answer is extension cord.

8. Eighth question: What play by Michel Leiris is recommended with "Violence"? The article lists "Michel Leiris" under "Read if you like" for "Violence," but doesn't specify a title. Since it's just the author's name, not a specific work, the answer is N/A.

9. Ninth question: What food item symbolizes the futility in Ernaux's work? The article mentions "cat food" as one of the items in the photos. So cat food.

10. Tenth question: The title of the book co-written by Marie. That's "The Use of Photography," as stated in the article. So that's the answer.

11. Eleventh question: Collins' policy recommendation for drug gangs. The article says he suggests pistol duels instead of drive-by shootings. So pistol duels.
