Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks how many pounds Ren√©e Zellweger gained to play Bridget Jones according to Kate Betts' New York Times article. The article says, "At the outset of 'Diary' she resolves to lose 20 pounds, despite weighing in at only 136." But Kate Betts' article is mentioned in the context of her pulling a cover because Zellweger looked "too fat." However, the exact number of pounds Zellweger gained isn't specified here. The article mentions she "famously gained weight" but doesn't state the exact pounds. Since the question specifically asks for the number from Kate Betts' article, and the article doesn't provide that number, the answer should be N/A.

2. The second question is about which streaming platform originally aired "Bridget Jones's Diary" before moving to Peacock. The article states that "Mad About the Boy" premieres on Peacock, but it doesn't mention the original platform for the first movie. The first film was released in theaters, but the question is about streaming platforms. Since the article doesn't say which streaming service originally had it before Peacock, this is N/A.

3. The third question asks for the name of Bridget's first child. The article mentions "Bridget Jones's Baby" (2016) where she may not know the father, but it doesn't name the child. So N/A.

4. The fourth question is about the number of cigarettes Bridget smoked per day. The article says she "smokes like a chimney" and mentions the number is shocking in 2025, but doesn't give a specific number. So N/A.

5. The fifth question asks which fashion magazine featured Zellweger on its cover. The article mentions Kate Betts, former editor of Harper's Bazaar, pulled a cover because Zellweger looked too fat. So the magazine is Harper's Bazaar.

6. Mark Darcy's profession is described as an insufferable snob. The article says he's a "snob" but doesn't specify his job. Wait, in the first paragraph, it says "Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), then find herself smitten with him, realizing he's her one great love, even though he's an insufferable snob." The article doesn't state his profession. Maybe I missed it? Let me check again. The article doesn't mention his job. So N/A.

7. The original novel's publication year. The first movie was 2001, and the article says Helen Fielding's novel inspired the films. The article doesn't state the novel's publication year, so N/A.

8. The weight loss goal in "Edge of Reason" is mentioned in the article: "At the outset of 'Diary' she resolves to lose 20 pounds..." Wait, but the question is about "Edge of Reason." The article says in "Edge of Reason," she hides from her boyfriend. The 20-pound goal is from the first movie. The article doesn't mention a specific goal in Edge of Reason, so N/A.

9. The therapist who helped Bridget deal with Mark Darcy's death. The article mentions Mark's death in the latest movie but doesn't name the therapist. So N/A.

10. The viewing rating that caused the premiere to be on Peacock instead of theaters. The article says "Mad About the Boy" premieres on Peacock but doesn't mention any rating determining that. N/A.

11. Daniel Cleaver's profession. The article describes him as a "cad" played by Hugh Grant, but doesn't state his business. The question links it to body image discourse, but without info on his job, N/A.

12. The screenplay Helen Fielding didn't write. The article says she had a hand in all screenplays. So any film not written by her would be N/A, but the question is tricky. Since the article doesn't mention one she didn't write, answer N/A.

13. The streaming platform for "Mad About the Boy" is clearly stated as Peacock. So answer is Peacock.

14. Mark Darcy's profession related to media standards. The article says he's a snob but doesn't specify his job. So N/A.

15. The director of "When Harry Met Sally..." The article mentions the film but doesn't name the director. N/A.

16. The newspaper where Kate Betts admitted her bias. The article says she wrote in The New York Times, so answer is The New York Times.

17. The award for Zellweger's accent. The article mentions her mastery of the accent but doesn't mention an award. N/A.

18. Tom Green's famous show is mentioned as his MTV prank show. The name is "Tom Green's show" but the exact title? The article refers to his MTV show as "the MTV prank show," likely "Tom Green Show." Since it's called that in the text, answer is "Tom Green's MTV prank show" or just "Tom Green Show." The exact name isn't given, but the article says "MTV prank show and surreal brand of comedy is back," so the answer is "Tom Green's MTV prank show" but maybe the exact title is "The Tom Green Show." Since the article doesn't use the full title but refers to it as his MTV show, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "Tom Green's Return: The Y2K-era phenomenon most famous for his MTV prank show..." So the show's name is his MTV prank show, but the exact title isn't given beyond that. Since the question asks for the name of the show, and the article refers to it as "MTV prank show," but the official name might be "The Tom Green Show." Since the article doesn't specify, perhaps N/A. Alternatively, if the question allows the description as the name, but the user wants the exact name. Since the article doesn't state the exact name, answer N/A.
