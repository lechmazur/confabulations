Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and answer exactly what's asked. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then check the article for the answers.

1. The first question is asking how many years Will Lewis has served as publisher. The article mentions his tenure began a year ago. Wait, the exact quote is: "The Post has been in turmoil for much of Mr. Lewis's tenure, which began a year ago." So that means he's been there for one year. The question also mentions "given that his tenure began amid financial losses and newsroom reductions via a voluntary buyout program two years prior?" Hmm, the voluntary buyout was two years ago, but his tenure started a year ago. So the answer is 1 year.

2. The second question asks which two media outlets hired Ashley Parker, Michael Scherer, and Josh Dawsey. The article states: "including Ashley Parker and Michael Scherer, two well-known political reporters, who joined The Atlantic, and Josh Dawsey, an investigative politics reporter, who departed for The Wall Street Journal." So The Atlantic and The Wall Street Journal.

3. The numerical difference between the 240 newsroom jobs and the 73 advertising cuts. That's 240 minus 73, which is 167. The question specifies "numerical difference," so subtraction is needed here. The answer should be 167.

4. The executive overseeing the 73 advertising positions reduction. The article says Johanna Mayer-Jones, the chief advertising officer, mentioned in a memo that 73 positions under her were eliminated. So her name.

5. Which journalism executive's departure is mentioned in connection with avoiding newsroom layoffs? The article mentions Sally Buzbee stepping down as executive editor, and Rob Winnett withdrawing as her replacement. The question refers to avoiding further newsroom layoffs, so Sally Buzbee's departure is mentioned here. Wait, the exact line: "Sally Buzbee stepped down as the paper's executive editor in June. Rob Winnett... withdrew himself from that position." The question asks which executive's departure is mentioned in connection with avoiding newsroom layoffs. The article says the current layoffs don't affect the newsroom, which had prior cuts. The answer might be Sally Buzbee, since she stepped down, but the question is about avoiding layoffs. Maybe the answer is Sally Buzbee?

6. The communications officer who announced the shift in publicity focus. The article says Kathy Baird, the chief communications officer, stated they would stop dedicated publicity for journalism and focus on promoting talent. So her name.

7. The investigative politics reporter who left for WSJ. The article mentions Josh Dawsey as the investigative reporter who went to WSJ. So Josh Dawsey.

8. The Pulitzer-winning cartoonist who resigned after a rejected cartoon. The article says Ann Telnaes stepped down after the opinions section rejected a cartoon of Jeff Bezos. So Ann Telnaes.

9. The primary goal of the restructured PR function. The memo from Kathy Baird says they would "stop the dedicated practice of publicity for our journalism" and focus on promoting talent. The goal is to "develop more strategic practices for greater impact and success rooted in talent." The answer is promoting talent, but the question asks for the primary goal as per the memo. The exact quote: "repositioning itself to focus on promoting talent."

10. The historical initiative contrasted with current layoffs. The current layoffs are in business divisions, whereas the prior buyout was in the newsroom. The question asks what historical initiative is contrasted with the current business division layoffs. The answer is the voluntary buyout program two years ago that eliminated 240 newsroom jobs.

11. Which department's adjustments are central to addressing fiscal challenges? The article mentions the advertising division's cuts and Johanna's memo about connecting advertisers to subscribers. The primary department here is advertising, but the question says "implicitly presented as central". The answer would be the advertising division, since they're cutting 73 positions there and focusing on connecting clients to subscribers, which is part of the strategy to address losses.

12. The percentage reduction stated for business operations. The article says "layoffs will affect roughly 4 percent of its workforce" and the business divisions. So the answer is 4%.

Let me check each again:

1. 1 (since tenure began a year ago)
2. The Atlantic and The Wall Street Journal
3. 240 - 73 = 167
4. Johanna Mayer-Jones
5. Sally Buzbee (since her stepping down is part of the leadership instability mentioned)
6. Kathy Baird
7. Josh Dawsey
8. Ann Telnaes
9. Promoting talent (as per the memo)
10. The voluntary buyout program two years ago
11. Advertising division (since their cuts and strategy are key)
12. 4%

Wait for question 5: the question says "which journalism executive’s departure is mentioned in connection with avoiding further newsroom layoffs during these business changes?" The article states that the current layoffs don't affect the newsroom, which had prior cuts. The leadership instability includes Sally Buzbee stepping down and Rob Winnett withdrawing. The answer might be Sally Buzbee, since her departure is part of the leadership issues but the connection to avoiding layoffs isn't explicit. Alternatively, maybe Ann Telnaes? No, her resignation was due to the cartoon rejection. The question might be tricky here. The article doesn't explicitly state that any executive's departure was to avoid newsroom layoffs. The newsroom wasn't affected because the layoffs are in business divisions. So perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "in connection with avoiding further newsroom layoffs during these business changes?" The article mentions that the current layoffs don't affect the newsroom. The leadership issues (Sally stepping down) are part of the turmoil but not directly linked to avoiding newsroom layoffs. So maybe N/A? Hmm, but the question says "which journalism executive’s departure is mentioned..." The only executive mentioned stepping down is Sally Buzbee. Maybe the answer is Sally Buzbee. I'll go with that as per the article's mention, even if the connection isn't explicit, because the question states that it is mentioned in connection. Alternatively, maybe it's Ann Telnaes? No, she's a cartoonist. Maybe the answer is Sally Buzbee.

Proceeding with the answers as above. Let me confirm each question again against the text.
