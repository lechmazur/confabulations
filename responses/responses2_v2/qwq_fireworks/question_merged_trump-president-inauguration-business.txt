Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I'm only using the information from the given article. Let me start by going through each question and finding the relevant parts in the text.

1. The first question asks which technology leader Trump discussed in relation to a major US investment. The article mentions Trump saying he spoke with Tim Cook of Apple, who mentioned a "massive investment" in the US. So the answer should be Tim Cook.

2. The second question is about the social media app that had its operations restored. The article talks about TikTok resuming service after Trump's actions. The answer here is TikTok.

3. The third question refers to an aerospace firm benefiting from post-election deals. The article mentions Boeing getting a contract for Air Force One replacements. So Boeing is the answer.

4. The senator warning about financial risk for companies aiding a Chinese app. The text says Senator Tom Cotton warned about TikTok, so Tom Cotton is the answer.

5. The entrepreneur criticizing imbalance in social media policies. Elon Musk is mentioned for comparing TikTok's access to China blocking X. So Elon Musk.

6. The company's CEO who could weather EV incentive losses. Tesla's Musk is noted here. Answer: Tesla or Elon Musk? The question asks for the CEO, so Elon Musk.

7. Federal initiatives being scaled back. The article mentions rolling back DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) measures. So DEI initiatives.

8. The meme coin named after the president. The article mentions $TRUMP and $Melania coins. The question specifies the president's, so $TRUMP.

9. The Chinese-owned entity with the algorithm issue. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, so ByteDance.

10. The amount raised by the inauguration committee. The text states over $170 million. So $170 million.

Wait, let me double-check each point to ensure accuracy.

1. Yes, Tim Cook is explicitly named. Correct.
2. TikTok's resumption is mentioned. Correct.
3. Boeing's Air Force One contract under previous donations. Correct.
4. Senator Tom Cotton's warning. Correct.
