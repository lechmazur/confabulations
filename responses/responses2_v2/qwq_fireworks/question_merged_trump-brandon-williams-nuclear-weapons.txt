Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the given article. I need to be careful to answer exactly based on the text, no outside knowledge. Let me go through each question step by step.

1. **Question 1**: Which former Los Alamos director specifically endorsed Brandon Williams' nomination while expressing concerns about China's nuclear testing capabilities?

The article mentions Terry C. Wallace Jr. and Siegfried S. Hecker as former Los Alamos directors. Wallace expressed surprise at the pick, but the question is about endorsing the nomination. The article says Wallace criticized Williams' experience. Hecker talked about China's testing. The article states Dr. Hecker argued that China has more to gain from testing. But did he endorse Williams? The text doesn't say any former director endorsed Williams. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2**: How many years did Brandon Williams spend developing cybersecurity protocols for nuclear facilities before entering Congress?

The article says Williams founded a software company that helps secure critical infrastructure from cyberattacks. But it doesn't specify the time spent before Congress. His service on the submarine was until 1996, then he was in Congress from 2023 to recent. The exact years before Congress aren't given. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: What was the annual budget allocated for maintaining nuclear submarine officer training programs during Williams' service on the USS Georgia?

The article mentions the USS Georgia, but there's no specific budget figure for submarine officer training during his service. The $10 billion is for nonexplosive testing. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: According to Terry Wallace's assessment, which technical qualifications made Williams stand out from other potential NNSA administrator candidates?

Wallace said Williams had "very limited experience" with NNSA's missions. So he didn't highlight any qualifications. The question asks what made him stand out, but Wallace criticized his lack. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: What percentage of previous NNSA administrators came from private sector technology companies rather than scientific or military backgrounds?

The article compares Williams' background (business, MBA) to others who had technical or military experience. But no percentage is given. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: During his congressional term, what legislation did Williams introduce regarding the modernization of nuclear testing facilities in Nevada?

The article doesn't mention any specific legislation he introduced. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: How many nuclear engineering certifications did Williams obtain during his "steep learning curve" period in the Navy?

The article says he underwent nuclear engineer training but doesn't state the number of certifications. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: What role did Williams play in developing artificial intelligence systems for monitoring nuclear warhead reliability?

The software company he founded uses AI for modernizing production and reducing emissions, but the article doesn't specify a role in warhead reliability monitoring. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Which specific Bible passages did Williams cite as influencing his approach to nuclear security policy?

The article mentions he reads a Bible section each morning but doesn't specify which passages. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: What recommendations did Williams make regarding the resumption of nuclear testing during his meetings with Robert O'Brien?

The article states Trump's advisers suggested resuming testing, and O'Brien advocated for it, but there's no mention of Williams' specific recommendations in meetings. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Considering the comparison between the candidate’s civilian career and traditional technical expertise, which branch of service mentioned in his biography has led experts to question his familiarity with maintaining nuclear weapons?

He served in the Navy. The article notes his background is non-technical compared to others (like Hruby's Sandia experience). The Navy is mentioned as part of his service. So answer: Navy.

12. **Question 12**: By integrating discussions on nonexplosive testing costs and historical testing practices, what annual budget figure mentioned in the article might be misinterpreted as the funding for all nuclear weapons testing activity?

The $10 billion is for nonexplosive testing. The question asks which figure could be misinterpreted as all testing. So $10 billion.

13. **Question 13**: Reflecting on the influence behind the search for a new nuclear arsenal head, which former presidential adviser, noted for his commentary on the need for renewed nuclear testing, was involved in guiding the selection process?

Robert C. O'Brien, mentioned as aiding Trump in the search, and he argued for testing. So O'Brien.

14. **Question 14**: By juxtaposing academic achievements with technical training in the nuclear field, whose educational record—described by studies in liberal arts and business rather than advanced science or engineering—raises concerns about having a deep understanding of nuclear reliability?

Williams has a liberal arts degree and MBA, contrasting with others like Hruby. So Williams.

15. **Question 15**: Considering traditional leadership in the nuclear weapon complex, whose long career at a major nuclear weapons laboratory serves as a benchmark that contrasts with the nominee's background?

Jill Hruby had a 34-year career at Sandia. So Hruby.

16. **Question 16**: Within the narrative of managing nonnuclear components of America’s armament, which outgoing administrator’s experience at a key nuclear weapons laboratory is highlighted to underscore the difference between conventional technical training and the nominee’s career?

Same as 15, so Hruby again.

17. **Question 17**: Interweaving perspectives on the challenges of nuclear weapons management with analyses from a scientist at a renowned research organization, which director from the Federation of American Scientists emphasized the complex technical task awaiting the candidate?

Hans M. Kristensen from the Federation of American Scientists said the job is "incredibly complex." So Kristensen.

18. **Question 18**: Linking the candidate’s political career with his military experience and private sector achievements, whose prior service representing an upstate district including cities like Syracuse and Utica is cited in contrast to traditional technical backgrounds?

Williams represented the district including Syracuse and Utica. So Williams.

19. **Question 19**: Combining accounts of entrepreneurial ventures with military service details, which individual is portrayed as both a former missile officer on a nuclear submarine and the founder of a cybersecurity-oriented software company?

Williams was a submarine officer and founded the software company. So Williams.

20. **Question 20**: Drawing on historical discussions of resuming nuclear tests and multiple national security adviser's influences, which former adviser—whose input is noted as having guided the hunt for the new nuclear weapons leader and who argued for renewed testing—should be connected to this selection process?

Robert C. O'Brien is mentioned as involved and argued for testing. So O'Brien.
