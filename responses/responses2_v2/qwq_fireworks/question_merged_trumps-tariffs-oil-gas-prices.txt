merged_trumps-tariffs-oil-gas-prices.txt
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The user is asking about the tariff percentage Trump threatened on Canadian oil before Colombia agreed. The article mentions that Trump imposed 25% tariffs on Colombia after their president balked at accepting deported immigrants. But regarding Canada, it says he might reduce it to 10% or exempt oil entirely. However, the question is about the initial proposal on Canadian oil. Wait, the first part of the article says Trump is imposing 25% on products from Canada and Mexico. But in the Colombia example, he used 25% as a threat. Wait, the question is about the Canadian oil before Colombia agreed to something. Wait, the question is specifically about the Colombian goods first, then the Canadian oil. Wait, the question says: "Given President Trump's initial tariff proposal on Colombian goods, what was the final tariff percentage he threatened to impose on Canadian oil imports before Colombia agreed to his demands?" Hmm. Wait, the Colombian situation is separate. The 25% on Colombia was a different case. The question links the Colombian tariff to the Canadian one? Wait, no. The question is asking, given that Trump used a tariff on Colombia (the initial proposal there was 25%), what was the percentage he threatened on Canadian oil before Colombia agreed. Wait, perhaps the question is mixing up the two. The article says Trump threatened Colombia with 25% tariffs, which led to them agreeing. But for Canada, the initial proposal was 25%, but he later considered lowering to 10% or exempting. The question is about the final tariff percentage he threatened on Canadian oil before Colombia agreed to their demands. Wait, but Colombia's agreement was about accepting deported immigrants, not related to the Canadian tariffs. The question might be trying to get the 25% as the initial, but the user is asking specifically about Canadian oil before Colombia agreed. But the article states that Trump initially proposed 25% on Canada and Mexico, but then considered lowering it for Canada. The Colombia example is a separate instance where he used 25% and then reversed it after they agreed. The question might be a trick, but the answer is 25% because that's the initial tariff on Canadian oil before any changes. So answer 25%.

2. **Question 2**: Valero's stockpile of Canadian oil. The article says Valero is planning scenarios and has Gulf Coast refineries, so they can import from other places. Kloza said they aren't stocking up. The answer would be "N/A" because the article states Valero isn't stockpiling. The question asks how much they stockpiled, but the text says they didn't. So answer N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Midwest gasoline price when Trump first threatened Colombia. The article mentions the average national price on Friday was $3.11, but the question is when the Colombia tariffs were first threatened. The article says Trump announced 25% against Colombia last weekend, and the current price is $3.11. But the question asks specifically when he first threatened Colombia, but the article doesn't provide the price at that exact time, only the current price. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Kathy Mikells mentioned a specific refining process. The article says Exxon's CFO mentioned being competitively advantaged but doesn't specify the process. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Percentage of refining capacity dependent on thick oil. The article says 60% of imports are Canadian, and that US oil is light, imports are heavy. But no exact percentage of refining capacity dependent on thick. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Harrison Fields cited a regulatory change for reducing costs. The article says he mentioned "building on the achievements of his first term and reversing the setbacks of the previous four years," but no specific regulatory change. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Most affected region by price rise. The article says Midwest could see 15-20 cents. So answer Midwest.

8. **Question 8**: Thick substance analogy for crude. The article says US oil is like light beer, imports (Canada/Mexico) are thick molasses. So the thick one is Canadian/Mexican crude. The question asks which type is described as thick. The answer is Canadian/Mexican, but the question uses the metaphor, so the answer is "thick molasses".

9. **Question 9**: Which company's exec mentioned data centers timeline. The article says Exxon's Darren Woods mentioned a 2028 plant, and Chevron mentioned 2027. The question asks which company's senior exec mentioned their timeline. The answer would be Exxon (Darren Woods) and Chevron. Wait, the question says "which company’s senior executive", so both? But the question might want the first one. Wait, the article says Exxon's CEO mentioned 2028, and Chevron said they too planned, with 2027. The question asks which company's exec mentioned a timeline. Both are mentioned, but the answer is "Exxon" and "Chevron". But since the question says "which company", maybe both? Wait, the question is phrased as "which company’s senior executive", so the answer is Exxon and Chevron. Wait, but the article says "Exxon's CEO... Chevron also planned". The question might want both? But the options are to pick one? Wait, the question is "which company", so both? But the answer format requires a single answer. Let me check the article again. The question says "which company’s senior executive mentioned a timeline for powering data centers as part of their scheduling..." So Exxon's CEO (Darren Woods) mentioned 2028, and Chevron's mentioned 2027. The question asks for the company's name. The answer is both? But the answer must be one. Wait, the question is phrased as "which company’s senior executive", so perhaps both are correct. But in the article, the exact quote from Exxon's CEO is given, and Chevron's is mentioned in a separate sentence. The answer should include both? But the format requires one answer. Wait, the user might expect Exxon because the question says "plans to supply power to data centers" and mentions Exxon's CEO. Alternatively, maybe both? But since the question says "which company", maybe the correct answer is "Exxon" and "Chevron" but since the user wants a single answer, perhaps "Exxon" as the first one. Wait, the article states: "Darren Woods, Exxon's chief executive, provided an update Friday on the company's plans to supply power to data centers, saying Exxon could have a power plant running by 2028. On Tuesday, Chevron said that it, too, planned to sell electricity to data centers, saying it could have a power plant operating by the end of 2027." So both companies are mentioned. The question asks "which company’s senior executive mentioned..." so both? But the answer requires a single answer. Since the question is in the singular, maybe the first one, Exxon. Or perhaps the answer is both. But the user might expect "Exxon" and "Chevron". However, the instructions say if a question asks for two people and the article lists one, answer N/A. Here, the question is singular but both are mentioned. Since the answer must be one, but the article mentions both, perhaps the answer is both. But the format requires one. Hmm, maybe the user expects Exxon because the first mention is Exxon's CEO. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is "Exxon and Chevron", but the instructions say to answer with words, not sentences. The exact answer would need to be both, but since the question is singular, maybe "N/A"? Wait, the question is asking "which company’s senior executive", so each company's exec mentioned their own. The question might be looking for both, but since the answer must be one, perhaps the correct answer is Exxon and Chevron. But since the user's example uses "salmon" as a single answer, maybe the answer should list both. However, the instructions say if the question asks for two people and only one is given, answer N/A. Here, the question is asking for one company, but two are mentioned. So the answer is both? But how to format? Maybe separate with a comma. The article says both companies. Let me check the exact wording: "Chevron also planned to sell electricity..." So the answer is both, but since the question is singular, maybe "N/A". Wait, no, the question is "which company’s senior executive", so each company's exec did so. Since the question is singular, but two are mentioned, maybe the answer is "Exxon" (first mentioned) or "Chevron" (also mentioned). The user might have intended Exxon, as the first example. Alternatively, the answer should be both. Since the instructions require a single answer, perhaps "Exxon" and "Chevron" together. The answer should be both, but how? Maybe "Exxon and Chevron". The instructions allow sentence fragments, so that's okay. Let me check the article again. The question says "which company’s senior executive mentioned a timeline...", so both companies' executives did, so the answer is both. So the answer is "Exxon and Chevron".

Wait, but the question says "which company’s senior executive", so maybe the answer is both. Since the user wants the answer to be in words, that's acceptable. So I'll go with that.

10. **Question 10**: The trade organization that warned about affordability and competitiveness. The article says the American Petroleum Institute (API) warned in a December letter that tariffs would undermine affordability and competitiveness. So answer API.

11. **Question 11**: Which company had severance charges? The article says Chevron recognized $715 million in severance charges in Q4. So answer Chevron.

12. **Question 12**: Which company had a slight profit decline? Exxon's profit went from $7.63B to $7.61B, a slight decline. So Exxon.

13. **Question 13**: Commodity causing price rise up to 20 cents. The article mentions gasoline prices in the Midwest could climb 15-20 cents. So gasoline.

14. **Question 14**: Country targeted before Colombia agreed. The Colombia example: Trump imposed 25% tariffs on Colombia, then they agreed. The country is Colombia.

15. **Question 15**: Nation's oil relied upon leading to price hikes. The article says Canadian oil is relied upon by Midwest refiners, so Canada.

16. **Question 16**: National average gasoline price. The article states $3.11 a gallon nationally. So $3.11.

Now, let me verify each answer again:

1. 25% (initial tariff on Canadian was 25%, but later considered 10%)
2. N/A (Valero didn't stockpile)
3. N/A (no specific price at time of Colombia threat)
4. N/A (no specific process mentioned)
5. N/A (no percentage given)
6. N/A (no specific regulatory change cited)
7. Midwest
8. thick molasses (as per the article's description)
9. Exxon and Chevron (both mentioned)
10. American Petroleum Institute
11. Chevron
12. Exxon
13. gasoline
14. Colombia
15. Canada
16. $3.11

I think that's all. Now, format them properly.
