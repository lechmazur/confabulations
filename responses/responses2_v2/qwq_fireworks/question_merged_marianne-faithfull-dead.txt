Okay, I need to go through each question one by one and find the answers strictly from the provided article. Let me start with question 1. The first question asks which Rolling Stones album featured Marianne's first credited songwriting collaboration that led to immediate royalties. The article mentions that she co-wrote "Sister Morphine" which she released as a single in 1969. The Stones' version was on "Sticky Fingers," but she didn't get credit until 1994. Since the question is about the album where she first received credit leading to royalties, the answer would be "Sticky Fingers," but the question specifies "first credited songwriting collaboration that led to immediate royalties." Wait, the article says she didn't earn parallel status on the Stones album until 1994. So the first time she got credit was in 1994, but the album itself is "Sticky Fingers." So the answer is "Sticky Fingers."

Question 2 asks about the experimental medical device invented by Eva von Sacher-Masoch. Wait, the article says her father's father (paternal grandfather) invented the "Frigidity Machine." The question mentions Eva, her mother, but the text says it was her father's father. So the answer is "Frigidity Machine," but since the question incorrectly attributes it to her mother, the answer should be N/A? Wait, the question says "Eva von Sacher-Masoch invented..." but according to the article, Eva is her mother, and the inventor was her paternal grandfather. So since the question's premise is wrong (the inventor wasn't Eva), the answer is N/A.

Question 3: During which year of her marriage to Giorgio Della Terza did she record the Hal Willner album? The article says she married him in 1988, and the album "Strange Weather" was produced by Hal Willner and released in 1987. Wait, the marriage was in 1988, so the recording would have been before the marriage. The article says "in 1987... produced by Hal Willner" and "still, her drug days were not yet behind her. She didn't clean up until 1985, after which her music took another turn... 1987 album 'Strange Weather'". Since the marriage was in 1988, the album was recorded before the marriage. So the question is about the year of the marriage when she recorded it, which would be 0 years into the marriage, but since the marriage hadn't happened yet, the answer is N/A.

Question 4: The French film with Alain Delon after Hamlet. The article mentions "The Girl on a Motorcycle" opposite Alain Delon in 1968, and before that she played Ophelia in 1969? Wait, let me check. The article says in 1969 she played Ophelia in "Hamlet," and the same year she had a role in "I'll Never Forget What's'isname." Then the next year (1970?), "The Girl on a Motorcycle" in 1968? Wait, no, the article says: "In 1967... 'I'll Never Forget What's'isname.' The next year she had the glamorous title role in 'The Girl on a Motorcycle,' opposite Alain Delon." So "next year" after 1967 is 1968. So the film was 1968. The question is which director cast her after seeing her in Hamlet. Wait, but Hamlet was in 1969. So maybe the director of "The Girl on a Motorcycle" saw her in Hamlet? The article doesn't say that. The article just lists the films. Since the question asks which director cast her after seeing her in Hamlet, but the article doesn't mention that connection, so answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the director's name is needed, but the article doesn't mention the director's name for either film. The article only mentions "The Girl on a Motorcycle" opposite Alain Delon. So the answer is N/A because the director's name isn't provided.

Question 5: Unreleased folk album recorded in Reading's coffeehouses before being discovered. The article says she sang folk songs in local coffeehouses. Her first album was "Marianne Faithfull" and "Come My Way" in 1965. The article mentions that she recorded "As Tears Go By" in 1964. There's no mention of an unreleased folk album from that time. The question might be referring to "Come My Way" which had folk pieces, but that was released. The article says "the other, 'Come My Way,' consisted mainly of traditional folk pieces." So the unreleased one might be "Rich Kid Blues" from 1971, but that was released later. The article says she recorded "Rich Kid Blues" in 1971 but it was not released until 1985. But the question is about before being discovered by Oldham. The article says she was discovered at a Rolling Stones party in 1964, so before that, but there's no mention of an unreleased album from that time. So the answer is N/A.

Question 6: How many pills did they pump from her stomach after the suicide attempt on the flight. The article states she took more than 100 pills of Tuinal. The exact number isn't given, so the answer is N/A because it's "more than 100" but not exact.

Question 7: Literary figure who wrote the foreword to her first memoir. Her first memoir was "Faithfull," published 13 years before "Memories, Dreams and Reflections" (2007). The article mentions a photo-driven book introduction by Salman Rushdie, but that's not her memoir. The question is about her first memoir's foreword. The article doesn't mention who wrote the foreword for her first memoir. So N/A.

Question 8: London nightclub where Keith Richards introduced her to Mick Jagger. The article says she was approached by Andrew Loog Oldham at a 1964 party for the Rolling Stones. It doesn't mention a specific nightclub's name, so N/A.

Question 9: Months she lived on the streets before recording the country album that topped Ireland. The article says she lived on the streets for two years after the 1969 suicide attempt. The country album "Dreamin' My Dreams" reached No. 1 in Ireland. So two years is 24 months. The answer is 24.

Question 10: Photographer who captured her in the fur rug during the 1967 raid. The article doesn't mention the photographer's name, so N/A.

Question 11: The moment she emerged with new-wave sound. The article says "starting in 1979 with the new-wave-influenced album 'Broken English'... earned the kind of broad respect...". So the answer is 1979 with "Broken English."

Question 12: Phrase upon waking from coma influenced a Stones refrain. She said "Wild horses couldn't drag me away," which became the refrain in "Wild Horses." So the answer is "Wild horses couldn't drag me away."

Question 13: Unusual device linked to paternal lineage. The Frigidity Machine invented by her paternal grandfather. The answer is "Frigidity Machine."

Question 14: Which band was she never considered a muse for. The article says she was Mick Jagger's muse, part of the Rolling Stones' scene. The question asks which famous band she wasn't a muse for. The options aren't given, but the question is phrased as "renowned band... despite celebrated connection with another legendary group (Rolling Stones)." The answer is probably The Beatles, but since the article doesn't mention her being considered a muse for any other band, but the question is looking for a band she wasn't a muse for. Since the article doesn't mention any other band, perhaps the answer is "The Beatles," but since that's not in the text, maybe it's N/A. Wait, the question says "for which renowned band was Marianne Faithfull never considered a muse, despite her celebrated connection with another legendary group?" The other group is the Rolling Stones. The question is asking which band she wasn't a muse for. Since the article doesn't mention any other band, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question implies that she was a muse for the Stones but not for another band, but without info, it's N/A.

Question 15: Age when she recorded "As Tears Go By." She was born in 1946, recorded the song in 1964. 1964-1946=18.

Question 16: Career path not mentioned. The article mentions singer, actress (theater, TV, film), and collaborations. It doesn't mention, say, painter or novelist, so answer is something like "painter" but since the options aren't given, need to see if any career is excluded. The article lists acting, music, memoir writing, etc. Maybe "novelist" or "painter" but since the question is open-ended, but the article doesn't mention any other career, so perhaps "painter" is the answer. Wait, the question is which career path is not mentioned. The article mentions acting, singing, writing lyrics, memoirs, but not, for example, "architect" or "athlete." Since the question is about the options given in the article's context, but since it's open, perhaps the answer is "N/A" if all mentioned are covered. Wait, the article says "she maintained a parallel if fitful acting career in theater, television and film." So acting is covered. The article doesn't mention any other career like chef or something else. Since the question is asking which is NOT mentioned, but without options, it's hard. Maybe the answer is "N/A" because the question is invalid without options, but perhaps the article lists all her careers. Wait, the question is phrased as "which career path is not mentioned in the article as part of her accomplishments?" The article mentions singer, actor, songwriter, memoirist. So possible answers could be "novelist," "painter," etc. Since the article doesn't mention those, but since the question is open, perhaps the answer is "N/A" because it's not specified. Alternatively, the user expects a specific answer based on the text. Wait, maybe the question refers to something like "businesswoman" or "politician," which aren't mentioned. Since the question is open, but the instructions say to answer based on the text, perhaps the answer is "N/A" because the article doesn't list any omitted careers. Alternatively, maybe the question is trickier. Let me check again. The article says she had an acting career, music, wrote lyrics, memoir, and collaborations. So the answer is "painter" or "novelist," but since the question is open, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "politician," but that's not in the text. Hmm. Maybe the answer is N/A.

Question 17: Health challenge not battled. The article says she battled breast cancer, hepatitis C, and later Covid-19. So if the question lists options not mentioned, but since it's open, the question might be which of the following wasn't listed, but since it's open, the answer is N/A unless the question had options. Since it's open, maybe the answer is "diabetes" or something else not mentioned. But since the question is standalone, perhaps the answer is N/A because the article lists those three. Since the question is phrased as "which one of the following was not listed," but without options, it's impossible. So N/A.

Question 18: The album with Hal Willner and Tom Waits. The article says "Strange Weather" in 1987, produced by Hal Willner, and includes a Tom Waits-written track. So the answer is "Strange Weather."

Question 19: Song on Sticky Fingers she got credit for after a dispute. The article says "Sister Morphine" was released by her in 1969, then the Stones' version in 1971 (Sticky Fingers), but she didn't get credit until 1994. So the answer is "Sister Morphine."

Question 20: Relationship that drew her into London's notorious scene. The article mentions her relationship with Mick Jagger leading to the 1967 drug raid. The question asks which relationship (like with Jagger) is highlighted as drawing her into the scene. The answer is "her relationship with Mick Jagger" but the question says "which relationship... characterized by both glamour and public scandal including drug arrests." So the answer is "her relationship with Mick Jagger."
