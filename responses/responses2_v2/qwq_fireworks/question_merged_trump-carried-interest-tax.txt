Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. The first question asks what percentage of Amazon's $100 billion was allocated to offset lost income from extending the 2017 tax cuts. The article mentions that ending the carried interest loophole could raise billions, which could be important for Trump to offset lost income from extending the 2017 tax cuts. But there's no specific percentage given for Amazon's expenditure related to that. So I think this is N/A because the article doesn't state a percentage allocated for that purpose.

2. The second question is about how many jobs at USAID Musk's team proposed to eliminate. The article says the White House will cut nearly 10,000 jobs at USAID. Since the Department of Government Efficiency is Musk's team, that number is 10,000. So the answer is 10,000.

3. The third question asks for the ticker symbol of the Bitcoin ETF proposed by Kash Patel. The article states that Trump Media filed trademark applications for ETFs, including a Bitcoin one, under the ticker DJT. But the question is about Kash Patel, who is Trump's FBI pick. However, the ETF is part of Trump Media's initiative, not directly Kash Patel's. The article doesn't link Patel to the ETF's ticker. So maybe N/A here since the question attributes it to Patel, but the article says it's Trump Media's proposal.

4. The fourth question is which agency's budget Russell Vought (OMB director) would impact via media contract terminations. The article mentions Trump directed GSA to terminate media contracts, and the Agriculture Department canceled Politico Pro. But Vought is OMB director, and the GSA action was directed by Trump. The question is which agency's budget is most impacted. The article says Vought is an advocate for cuts, and the GSA's termination affects agencies like Agriculture. But the exact agency isn't specified here. Wait, the Agriculture Department canceled their subscription, so maybe USDA? But the question is about which agency's budget Vought would impact. The article says the GSA terminated contracts, so maybe USAID? But the question is about the agency affected by the termination. The article says the Agriculture Department canceled, so the answer might be USDA. Alternatively, the question might be about the OMB's role in budgeting for the GSA's actions. Hmm, not sure. The article says "The Agriculture Department said it canceled its subscription to Politico Pro." So the answer might be the Agriculture Department, but the question is phrased as "which agency's budget... most impacted by the termination of media contracts directed by GSA". Since GSA's directive led to USDA's action, the answer is USDA? Or maybe the GSA itself? The question is a bit unclear. The article states the GSA was directed by Trump to terminate contracts, and the Agriculture Department's action is an example. The question is about which agency's budget would be most impacted by those terminations. Since USAID is cutting 10,000 jobs, but the media contracts are part of other agencies' budgets. The article says "anything that disrupts Social Security could draw backlash," but the direct example given is Agriculture. Since the question is about the agency whose budget is most impacted, but the article doesn't specify, perhaps N/A? Wait, the article says "The Agriculture Department said it canceled its subscription to Politico Pro." So that's one example, but the question is which agency's budget is most impacted. The article doesn't say which was the most, so maybe N/A. Alternatively, the question might be referring to the Department of Agriculture, so USDA?

Wait, the exact quote: "The Agriculture Department said it canceled its subscription to Politico Pro." So that's an example, but the question is which agency's budget Russell Vought (as OMB director) would impact through GSA's actions. Since Vought is OMB, which oversees budgets, but the GSA's action is directed by Trump. The article mentions the Agriculture Department as one affected. Since the question asks which agency's budget was most impacted, but the article doesn't specify, so maybe N/A? Hmm, tricky. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick because the GSA is part of the Executive Office, so maybe not an agency. Maybe the answer is N/A here.

Wait, the question says "which agency's budget, according to Russell Vought, the newly confirmed director of the Office of Management and Budget, would be most impacted..." The article says Vought is an advocate for huge cuts and was confirmed as OMB director. The article says the GSA was directed by Trump to terminate media contracts, leading to the Agriculture Department's action. Since Vought is OMB director, perhaps the Agriculture Department's budget is the answer here. But the article doesn't explicitly state that Vought mentioned it, so maybe N/A. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A.

5. The fifth question asks about the value of the stock award in Trump Media that caused the delay in voting on Jay Monahan. Wait, the article says the Senate delayed the vote on Kash Patel (FBI pick) because he owned a stake in Shein's parent company worth at least $1M and received a $800k stock award in Trump Media. The question mentions Jay Monahan, the PGA commissioner. But the article says the delay was for Patel, not Monahan. The PGA part mentions Trump met with Monahan, but the stock award is about Patel. So the question has a mistake in the name, so answer is N/A because the question refers to Jay Monahan instead of Patel. Since the question's premise is incorrect, answer N/A.

6. The sixth question: Which government department did Marko Elez gain unauthorized access to? The article says Marko Elez had the ability to write code in the Treasury Department payment system. So the answer is Treasury Department.

7. The seventh question: What aspect of the "60 Minutes" interview did Brendan Carr cite to revoke CBS's license? The article says Trump claimed the interview was doctored, and Carr requested a transcript. But the question is what aspect Carr cited. The article states that Carr requested public comment on the interview's accuracy, but the specific aspect isn't mentioned. The article says Trump accused CBS of fraud, but the question is about Carr's justification. The article doesn't state the specific aspect Carr cited, so N/A.

8. The eighth question: Which financial institution was accused by 17 Republican AGs of misrepresenting China risks, leading to a TikTok sale overseen by Vance. The article says 17 Republican AGs accused BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase. The TikTok part is mentioned in a different context (Vance and Waltz overseeing TikTok sale). The question links the accusation to the TikTok sale, but the article says the TikTok part is separate. The question's premise might be incorrect because the TikTok sale isn't connected to the accusation. The accused institutions are BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase, so the answer would be one of them, but the question asks for which one. The question says "which financial institution", so perhaps BlackRock? The question's phrasing might be leading, but the TikTok part isn't linked in the article. Since the TikTok oversight is mentioned in a different context, maybe the answer is N/A because the accusation isn't linked to TikTok. Wait, the question says "leading to a potential government-brokered sale of TikTok overseen by JD Vance". The article says "TikTok. (Punchbowl News)" in the deals section. But the accusation by the AGs is separate. The TikTok sale isn't connected to the AGs' lawsuit. So the question combines two separate points. Since there's no link, the answer is N/A.

9. The ninth question: Warren Buffett's reason for supporting carried interest elimination. The article says opponents include Buffett and Dimon, who say ending it could raise billions. The stated reason is to raise revenue for the government. So answer is to raise government revenue.

10. Tenth question: Venture capital firm co-founded by Dick Kramlich that backed companies in Trump's ETF. The article mentions Dick Kramlich co-founded New Enterprise Associates (NEA) and backed Apple and Silicon Graphics. The ETF includes companies like Rumble, crypto, gun makers, etc., but the question asks for the VC firm's name. The answer is New Enterprise Associates.

11. Eleventh question: Which agency must approve Trump's Bitcoin ETF. The article says some products may need SEC approval, and given the administration's influence, they might get it. So the answer is SEC.

12. Twelfth question: Elon Musk's ownership of Trump Media. The article states Trump owns 53%, but Musk isn't mentioned as an owner. The question might be a trick. The answer is N/A because Musk isn't mentioned as owning any shares.

13. Thirteenth question: Number of Republican AGs who signed the letter. The article says seventeen, so 17.

14. Fourteenth question: Which agency denied Marko Elez's access. The article says Treasury officials denied it, but Elez had access. The agency that denied is Treasury, but the question asks which agency initially denied. The article says "department officials" (Treasury) denied, so Treasury Department.

15. Fifteenth question: Total value of Kash Patel's stock awards. He had a $1M stake in Shein's parent and $800k in Trump Media. Total is 1.8M, so 1.8 million.

16. Sixteenth question: Saudi sovereign wealth fund governor who spoke with Trump. The article mentions Yasir al-Rumayyan, so his name.

17. Seventeenth question: CDC job cuts. The article says the administration plans to eliminate positions in CDC but doesn't give a number. The only specific numbers are USAID (10k), but CDC's number isn't stated. So N/A.

18. Eighteenth question: VC firm co-founded by Kramlich that invested in Apple and the company in "Best of the rest". The "Best of the rest" section mentions Silicon Graphics, which NEA backed. So answer is New Enterprise Associates.

19. Nineteenth question: Tax rate for carried interest vs regular income. The article says carried interest is taxed as capital gains (lower rate) than regular income. So the rate is lower than regular income. The exact rate isn't given, but the comparison is lower. The question asks the specific rate applied to carried interest. Since the article states it's taxed as capital gains, the answer is capital gains tax rate.
