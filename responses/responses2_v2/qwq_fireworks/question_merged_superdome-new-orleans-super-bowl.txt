Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each question precisely. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which architectural firm designed the Astrodome that inspired the Superdome's roof. The article mentions that Dave Dixon toured the Astrodome in Houston and wanted to build something larger. The firm that designed the Superdome was Curtis and Davis. But the question is about the Astrodome's designer. Wait, the article says the Superdome was designed by Curtis and Davis, but it doesn't mention who designed the Astrodome. Hmm, so the answer here might be N/A because the article doesn't specify the Astrodome's architect. Wait, let me check again. The text says: "The stadium opened in August 1975, too late to host Super Bowl IX, which the N.F.L. moved to Tulane. The cost quadrupled to $163 million and included Mardi Grass, an artificial turf. Two million square feet inside, the stadium was an instant attraction, with 200,000 people a year taking tours. Liz Broekman remembered her family's bringing relatives from Chicago to see the stadium..." No, no mention of the Astrodome's architect. So answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many public address announcers were there between 1975 and 2013? The article states Jerry Romig worked as PA announcer for 446 consecutive games until 2013. His son Mark took over. So during that period, it was just Jerry. The answer should be 1.

3. **Question 3:** The final score of the game where Steve Gleason blocked the punt. The article says in the 2006 return game, the first score was a touchdown from the blocked punt, leading to a lopsided win. But the exact score isn't given. The question asks for the final score, which isn't provided. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Which Super Bowl had U2's 9/11 halftime show. The text mentions the Super Bowl after 9/11, which was delayed a week. It says that Super Bowl is best known for U2's show and the Patriots' win. The Super Bowl after 9/11 would be Super Bowl XXXVII in 2003 (since 9/11 was 2001, so the next SB would be 2002, but the article says the season was delayed, so maybe SB XXXVI in 2002? Wait, the article says: "The season was delayed one week, forcing the league to spend millions of dollars to buy out conventions and weddings that were already scheduled. Steeg said, though, that New Orleans was one of the few cities that could accommodate the extra planning needed for that Super Bowl because the league had to deal only with a coterie of local politicians and departments. "There was a lot of continuity there and people who could help you get things done," he said. Outside of the game, that Super Bowl is best known for U2's halftime show..." So the Super Bowl in question was the one that was moved due to 9/11. Since 9/11 happened in 2001, the next Super Bowl would be Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002. The answer is Super Bowl XXXVI.

5. **Question 5:** Square feet of Mardi Grass turf installed. The article states the cost included "Mardi Grass, an artificial turf." But how many square feet? The total square footage of the stadium is mentioned as two million square feet, but that's the entire stadium. The article doesn't specify the area of the turf. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The name of the cemetery near the Superdome leading to curse rumors. The text says the stadium was built near a former cemetery, but doesn't name it. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Number of hotel rooms needed for first Super Bowl. The article says New Orleans had enough convention space and hotel rooms over time. But the exact number required isn't mentioned. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Attendance at the first event in 1975. The article says the first event was in August 1975 but doesn't give attendance. It mentions 200,000 people a year took tours, but that's annual tours, not the first event. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Republican candidate at RNC at Superdome. The article mentions the Republican National Convention was held there, but doesn't name the candidate. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Cost to repair the roof after Katrina. The article says the renovation after Katrina was $560 million, but that's the total renovation, not just the roof. The specific cost for roof repair isn't given. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Millions spent buying out events after 9/11. The article says the NFL spent millions, but exact amount isn't specified. N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Branford Marsalis's role after emotion. The text says he bought season tickets impulsively but couldn't use them. The question asks what role he assumed. Wait, the question might be a trick. The question says "similar to Jerry Romig's 446 consecutive games as public address announcer"â€”but Marsalis didn't hold a role like that. The article mentions he sold programs at Saints games. But after being overcome, he bought season tickets. So the answer is N/A because he didn't assume a similar role to PA announcer.

13. **Question 13:** Architectural feature from Astrodome that was incorporated. The article says the Superdome was built to be larger and more versatile than the Astrodome. The distinctive feature was its Space Age look, curved roof, etc. The Astrodome was a domed stadium, so maybe the dome itself. But the question asks what was incorporated from the Astrodome's design. The article says "meant to impress" with Space Age look. Maybe the dome structure? But the answer is N/A unless specified. The article says "Unlike most stadiums of the era, it was built on one of the city's main thoroughfares..." but not the architectural feature. So N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Event type Tom Benson considered hosting in Mississippi. The article says Tom Benson explored alternatives, including moving the team to Mississippi, considering renovating the Superdome. The question asks for an event similar to Endymion Extravaganza (a Mardi Gras event). The text mentions Benson considered moving to Mississippi but doesn't mention events. N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Legislative act tied to NFL franchise. The article says Dixon enlisted Boggs and Long to help get legislation passed around the same time as the franchise grant. The NFL needed an antitrust exemption for AFL merger. The answer is the legislation that provided the antitrust exemption. The question asks for the name of the act. The article doesn't name it, so N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Material used in renovation like Mardi Grass. The renovation mentions better playing surface, but the article doesn't mention the material used. N/A.

17. **Question 17:** Architectural firm Tom Benson consulted for Mississippi move. The article says Benson explored moving to Mississippi but doesn't mention the firm. N/A.

18. **Question 18:** Final score of the game when Gleason's blocked punt led to return. The article says the first score was a touchdown in a lopsided win. But exact score not given. N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Olivia Manning's position similar to spotter. Mary Beth was the spotter. The article says Olivia stopped attending with her sons due to booing. It doesn't mention her role. N/A.
