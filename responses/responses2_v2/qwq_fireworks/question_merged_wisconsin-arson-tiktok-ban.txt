Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. 

1. **Total monetary value of damage**: The article mentions "moderate damage" to the exterior and "minor damage" inside, but no specific monetary value is given. So, N/A.

2. **Previous TikTok incidents at congressional offices**: The text doesn't mention any prior incidents, so N/A.

3. **ByteDance executive who shut down TikTok**: The article says the Supreme Court upheld the ban, leading to TikTok being unavailable. It doesn't name an executive, so N/A.

4. **Time Grothman's staff discovered damage**: The article states the fire was at 1 a.m., but when staff arrived on Monday isn't specified. N/A.

5. **Number of police officers**: The article doesn't mention how many officers responded. N/A.

6. **Name of the strip mall**: The article refers to it as a "strip mall" but doesn't give a specific name. N/A.

7. **Punishment under Wisconsin's anti-arson statutes**: The suspect was charged with arson, but the specific punishment isn't detailed. The text mentions a charge was referred to prosecutors, but the actual penalty isn't stated. N/A.

8. **Other businesses with smoke damage**: The article doesn't mention other businesses in the mall being damaged. N/A.

9. **Security measures by ByteDance**: The article doesn't state any measures taken by ByteDance post-Grothman's concerns. N/A.

10. **When suspect started following debates**: The article doesn't provide the suspect's timeline of following debates. N/A.

11. **Grothman's commitment on TikTok's status**: The article doesn't mention Grothman making a commitment after the ruling. N/A.

12. **Individuals inside the mall when apprehended**: The police said the mall was unoccupied when they arrived. So, 0.

13. **Government entity infringing First Amendment**: The Supreme Court upheld the ban, so the government (U.S.) is implied. The article says the Supreme Court's decision prioritized national security over free speech. The suspect's motivation was against the ban, so the entity is the U.S. government, but the exact term used might be "the government" or "the U.S. Supreme Court"? The question asks which entity the suspect believed was infringing. The article says the Supreme Court upheld the law, so maybe the answer is "the government" as per the article's statement about national security concerns. But the question specifies "according to the Fond du Lac Police Department's statement." The police statement mentioned the man said it was in response to talks of a ban. The law was upheld by the Supreme Court. The infringing entity would be the U.S. government. But the exact wording in the article says the Supreme Court's decision prioritized national security over free speech. So the entity is the government, perhaps. The article states the Supreme Court upheld the law, so maybe the answer is "the U.S. government" or "the Supreme Court." Hmm. The question is which entity the suspect believed was infringing. The suspect's motive was against the ban, so likely the U.S. government. The article says the law was upheld by the Supreme Court, so the entity would be the U.S. government. The police statement says the man was responding to "recent talks" of a ban. The actual ban was due to the law upheld by the Supreme Court. The answer might be "the U.S. government" or "the Supreme Court." But the question is according to the police department's statement. The police said the man started the fire "in response to recent talks of a TikTok ban." The talks would be the legislative or executive actions leading to the ban upheld by the Supreme Court. Since the police didn't attribute it to a specific entity beyond the talks, maybe it's N/A. Wait the question says "which governmental entity did the arsonist believe was infringing upon the First Amendment rights..." The article says the Supreme Court's decision prioritized national security over free speech, so the ban was the law upheld by the court. The infringing entity would be the government enforcing the law. The suspect's action was against the ban, so the entity would be the U.S. government. But the article doesn't explicitly state the suspect's belief about which entity, only that he was responding to talks of a ban. Since the question asks which entity the Fond du Lac Police Department's statement attributed the belief to, the police statement mentions the man's motive as response to talks of a ban. The entity enforcing the ban is the U.S. government. So maybe the answer is "the U.S. government." But the article might not explicitly name it. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says the Supreme Court upheld the law, so the law was enacted by the government. The suspect's belief would be against the government's action. Since the police report attributes his motive to the talks, the entity is the U.S. government. The answer would be "the U.S. government," but the article might not state it directly. Let me check again. The police statement says the man started the fire in response to recent talks of a ban. The law was upheld by the Supreme Court, so the talks would be the legislative process or executive actions. The governmental entity would be the U.S. government. The answer is "the U.S. government." But maybe the article says "the government's national security concerns," so the answer is "the U.S. government."

14. **Alternative location for migrants before Guantanamo**: The article mentions Guantanamo Bay and says U.S. forces are preparing a tent city. The question asks if there was another location considered before Guantanamo. The article doesn't mention any other location considered before, just that they are using Guantanamo and preparing a tent city. So N/A.

15. **Assistance from USAID to Fond du Lac businesses**: The article states that Trump called for USAID's closure, but it doesn't mention them offering assistance to the mall. N/A.

16. **Legal argument by CBS and The Des Moines Register**: The article mentions First Amendment experts think the lawsuits lack merit but are harassing. The defense's argument would relate to free speech, but the text doesn't specify their exact legal points. N/A.

17. **Trudeau's rationale linking arson to Canada's interests**: The article says Trudeau linked Canada's minerals to Trump's comments about making it a state, but not the arson. So N/A.

18. **Student organizations affected at West Point**: The DEI section says West Point ended a dozen clubs due to Trump's D.E.I. ban. The question links to TikTok's data security, but the article doesn't connect the club closures to TikTok. So N/A.

19. **Financial penalty by Grothman**: The article says Trump pledged no penalties, not Grothman. So N/A.

20. **Year Supreme Court upheld the law**: The article doesn't mention the year. N/A.
