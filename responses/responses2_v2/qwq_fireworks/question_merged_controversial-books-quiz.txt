Okay, I need to tackle these questions based solely on the provided article. Let me read through the questions one by one and check the article for each answer.

1. **Question 1:** Which Supreme Court justice wrote the majority opinion in the Long Island First Amendment case involving "Black Boy"? The article mentions that "Black Boy" was part of a First Amendment case on Long Island that went to the Supreme Court, but it doesn't specify which justice wrote the opinion. Since the text doesn't name the justice, the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many copies of "Ulysses" did Random House initially print after challenging the ban? The article says Random House challenged the ban leading to the lifting, but there's no number given for initial print. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The reviewer who compared the book to prussic acid. The article states a reviewer in England said, "I would rather give... a phial of prussic acid..." but doesn't name the reviewer. Hence, N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Month in 1920 when the complaint was filed. The article mentions the year 1920 but not the month. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Circulation number of The Little Review when they published "Ulysses". The article doesn't provide this figure. Answer N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Years between initial publication and restored version of Anne Frank's diary. The question refers to "The Diary of a Young Girl" which was first published in 1947. The article says the 1947 book was republished decades later to restore material. The exact number isn't given, so N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Vote count in the state court decision. The article says the court declared "Ulysses" obscene but doesn't mention the vote count. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Literary magazine that first published restored passages from Anne Frank's diary. The article doesn't mention any specific magazine, only that it was republished. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Number of countries that banned "Brave New World" in 1932. The article states it was banned in "some countries" but doesn't specify how many. Answer N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Presiding judge in the Random House challenge. The article doesn't name the judge, so N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Author with legal battles involving both the Society and a Supreme Court case. "Black Boy" by Richard Wright went to the Supreme Court, and the Society was involved in "Ulysses". But the question links an author whose case involved both. Since "Black Boy" is Richard Wright's, and the Society was in the Ulysses case, but Wright's case is separate. The article doesn't connect the two, so maybe N/A?

Wait, the question says the author's legal battle involved both the Society and the Supreme Court case related to the memoir. The Society was in the Ulysses case, not Wright's. So maybe N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Years between obscenity ruling against Ulysses (1920) and the dystopian novel (Brave New World in 1932). 1932 - 1920 = 12 years. So 12.

13. **Question 13:** Banned book linked to the First Amendment case involving a memoir with religious skepticism. The memoir is "Black Boy", which was challenged for profanity and sexual content, not religious skepticism. The article says "Ulysses" was banned for obscenity. Maybe the question is referring to another book. Wait, the 1932 dystopian novel was against religion. But the First Amendment case was about "Black Boy". The question says "directly linked", so perhaps the memoir itself? The article says "Black Boy" was part of the First Amendment case, so the answer might be "Black Boy" but the question asks for a banned book linked to that case. However, "Black Boy" was the memoir in the case, so the answer is "Black Boy". But the question says "banned book discussed in the quiz" which includes the others. Wait, the question is phrased as "directly linked to a First Amendment case involving a memoir later challenged for its alleged promotion of atheism". The memoir's challenge was for profanity and sexual content, not atheism. The article mentions "atheists" as an option for Radclyffe Hall's book's objectionable content. Wait, the third question's answer was Lesbians for Radclyffe Hall. So maybe the question is mixing up details. Since the article doesn't mention religious skepticism in "Black Boy", this might be N/A. Alternatively, maybe the 1932 dystopian novel (Brave New World) was against religion, but that's not linked to the Supreme Court case. So perhaps N/A.

Wait the question says "directly linked to a First Amendment case involving a memoir later challenged for its alleged promotion of atheism". The memoir in the case is "Black Boy", but the challenge was for profanity and sexual content. The article says the censors found Radclyffe Hall's book objectionable for Lesbians, not atheism. So there's no mention of atheism in the memoir's challenge, so the question's premise might be wrong, so N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Common justification for banning both the 1932 dystopian (Brave New World) and "Black Boy". The dystopian was banned for being against religion and family. "Black Boy" was challenged for profanity and sexual content. The common justification? Not sure. The question asks for a common reason. Since the article says the dystopian was against religion and family, and "Black Boy" for profanity/sex, maybe "family" is part of both? The article doesn't explicitly state a common reason. So N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Which banned work shares a decade with the memoir (Black Boy, 1945) that faced Supreme Court scrutiny over alleged promotion of atheism. The memoir's challenge wasn't about atheism. The banned works in the quiz: Ulysses (1920s), Radclyffe Hall (1928), Brave New World (1932), Black Boy (1945), and the 1947 book. The question's premise might be off, but assuming the memoir's challenge was about atheism (even though the article says sexual content and profanity), then the 1940s decade would include "Black Boy" (1945) and the 1947 book. The 1947 book is "The Diary of a Young Girl" (1947). So the answer would be "The Diary of a Young Girl". But the question is about a banned work that shares the decade. The article says "The Diary of a Young Girl" was republished later, but the initial was 1947. Since "Black Boy" is 1945, same decade. So the answer is "The Diary of a Young Girl".

16. **Question 16:** Numerical detail connecting the seizure of Radclyffe Hall's novel (800 copies) to the republished edition of the diary. The diary's republished edition restored material, but the article doesn't mention a number. The question might refer to 800 copies seized vs. the restored version's page count or something? Since the article doesn't give numbers for the republished edition, N/A.

Wait, the article says "800 copies were seized by authorities in the U.S." for Radclyffe Hall's novel. The 1947 book (Diary of a Young Girl) was republished decades later to restore material. The numerical connection might be 800 copies seized vs. the restored version's something, but no numbers given. So N/A.

Now I'll go back through each question with these thoughts and answer accordingly.
