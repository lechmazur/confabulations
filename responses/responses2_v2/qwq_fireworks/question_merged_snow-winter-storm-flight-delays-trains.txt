Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly what's asked. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks about the specific model of snow removal equipment that malfunctioned. The article mentions Emily McGee, the airport spokeswoman, saying they closed runways for snow removal, but there's no mention of any equipment malfunction or specific model. So the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2:** FlightAware reports over 9,000 flights delayed/canceled nationwide. The article says airports in the DC area were most affected, with over 80% of National Airport's departures canceled. But it doesn't give a specific number for National Airport alone. The answer is N/A since the exact number isn't provided.

3. **Question 3:** If over 80% were canceled, the remaining would be under 20% operating normally. Since it's over 80, subtracting from 100 gives less than 20. The article doesn't specify exactly, so maybe it's N/A. Wait, the question says "reported as operating normally during that closure period." The closure was to allow snow removal, so maybe during closure, no flights were operating. But the closure was to allow crews to focus on snow removal before temps dropped. The closure period might have had no departures. But the question is about departures canceled, so during closure, maybe 0% were operating. But the article says over 80% of departures were canceled. The closure might have been part of the reason, but the percentage operating normally would be 100 - 80 = 20, but since it's "more than 80%", the exact percentage isn't given. So the answer is N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Nick's connecting flight from Baltimore-Washington to Norfolk was canceled. The article says his flight from Montego Bay to Baltimore was canceled, and the connecting flight to Norfolk was also canceled. But the departure time of the connecting flight isn't mentioned. The original flight was at 2 p.m., but the connecting's time isn't stated. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Congress certified Trump's victory "earlier Monday," so the day was Monday. The question asks the day of the week, which is Monday. The answer is Monday.

6. **Question 6:** Southwest had over 990 delayed and over 500 canceled. The combined total would be 990 + 500 = 1490. But since the numbers are "over," the exact total isn't precise, but the question says "as mentioned in the report," which uses the numbers given. So the answer is over 1490? Wait, the question says "what is the combined total of flights affected by Southwest Airlines as mentioned in the report?" The article states "more than 990 flights, or 27% of its daily schedule, and also canceled more than 500 flights." So total affected is over 990 + 500 = 1490. But since the exact numbers aren't given (just "more than"), the answer would be "N/A" because we can't know the exact total. Wait, but the question might accept the sum of the given figures even if they're approximate. The instructions say if it can be logically inferred, but the exact numbers are "over" so adding them would still be an approximate. The article says "more than 990" and "more than 500," so the combined total is "more than 1490," but the question asks for the exact figure as per the report. Since the report's exact numbers aren't given, the answer is N/A. Hmm, tricky. Let me check again. The question says "as mentioned in the report," which uses the numbers given (over 990 and over 500). Since they are presented as separate figures, perhaps the answer is 990 + 500 = 1490, even if it's approximate? The instructions say to use the article's facts. Since the article states those two numbers, adding them would be the answer. So maybe 1490? But the problem is that the numbers are "over," so the exact total isn't there. The question asks for the combined total "as mentioned," so perhaps the answer is over 1490, but since it's not a specific number, maybe N/A. Wait, the example in the instructions says that if the article says 72% watched, you can infer 28% didn't. But here, the numbers are "more than," so adding them gives a minimum of over 1490. But the question is asking for the combined total as per the report. Since the report mentions those two numbers, the answer should be 990 + 500 = 1490, even if it's approximate. Maybe the answer is 1490? Or N/A? Hmm, the article says "more than 990" and "more than 500". Since they are both over, the exact total isn't known. So the answer is N/A. Because the exact number isn't provided. The question asks for the combined total, which would require knowing the exact numbers, but since it's "more than," we can't. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Chicago O'Hare had over 400 delayed departures. Dallas-Fort Worth's delayed flights "crept up" but the exact number isn't given. The article only mentions Chicago's 400, Dallas's is not specified. So the difference can't be calculated. Answer N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Aleena had her original flight Sunday evening canceled, then three more on Monday canceled. Total is 1 (Sunday) + 3 (Monday) = 4 flights canceled. The article says "her original flight, and then three more on Monday, were canceled." So total is 4. Answer 4.

9. **Question 9:** Runways closed Monday evening, to remain closed until Tuesday morning. The time from Monday evening to Tuesday morning is roughly 12 hours (assuming "morning" is early AM). But the exact hours aren't specified. The article doesn't say how many hours, just "until Tuesday morning." So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Total flights affected nationwide: over 9,000. Train trips canceled: "dozens of train trips" by Amtrak. The question asks the difference between flights (9k+) and train trips (dozens). Dozens is like 24-36. The difference is 9000+ minus 30 (approx) is still over 9000. But exact numbers? The article says "dozens" and "more than 9,000 flights". So the difference is 9000+ minus dozens. Since the exact number of train cancellations isn't given beyond "dozens", we can't compute the exact difference. Answer N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Cities mentioned: Texas (state, but cities?), New York, Washington (DC area?), Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston, Raleigh, Richmond. The article mentions "Washington, D.C., metro area" so Washington is a city. The exact cities listed are: Washington (National Airport), Philadelphia International, Kennedy (NYC), Chicago O'Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth (which is a city?), Raleigh, Boston, Virginia Beach (home of Grimaldi, but not a disrupted city?), Richmond. Let's list all explicitly mentioned cities:

- Ronald Reagan National Airport (Washington, D.C.)
- Philadelphia International Airport (Philadelphia)
- Kennedy International Airport (New York)
- Chicago O'Hare International Airport (Chicago)
- Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (Dallas-Fort Worth, which is a metro area but considered as a single airport location)
- Raleigh, N.C. (from Amtrak destinations)
- Boston
- Richmond, Va. (Aleena's home)
- Virginia Beach (Grimaldi's home, but the disruption was in the airports, so maybe not counted as a travel disruption location? The question says "explicitly mentioned as being impacted by the storm’s travel disruptions". The article mentions Amtrak affecting Boston, Washington, New York, Chicago, Raleigh. The airports listed are in DC area, Philadelphia, NY, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Baltimore-Washington (BWI is in Maryland but part of DC area?), and Montego Bay (outside US, but not counted as a US city). So the distinct cities are:

1. Washington, D.C.
2. Philadelphia
3. New York
4. Chicago
5. Dallas-Fort Worth (as a single entity)
6. Boston
7. Raleigh
8. Richmond
9. Baltimore (BWI airport is in Maryland but part of the DC area? Or is Baltimore counted separately? The article says "Baltimore-Washington International Airport", which is in Maryland, so Baltimore is a city here)
Wait, the question says "cities explicitly mentioned as being impacted by the storm’s travel disruptions". The article mentions:

- Washington (National Airport closure)
- Philadelphia International Airport (Philadelphia)
- Kennedy (New York)
- Chicago O'Hare (Chicago)
- Dallas-Fort Worth (as an airport)
- Amtrak destinations: Boston, Washington, New York, Chicago, Raleigh
- Richmond (Aleena's home but her flight was from National to Cincinnati; the disruption was in National, so maybe Richmond isn't a travel disruption location itself, just her destination)
- Virginia Beach (Grimaldi's home but the disruption was in airports like BWI and others)

So the cities impacted by travel disruptions (airports and Amtrak):

- Washington, D.C. (National, BWI)
- Philadelphia
- New York (Kennedy)
- Chicago
- Dallas-Fort Worth
- Boston (Amtrak)
- Raleigh (Amtrak)
- Baltimore (BWI)
- Richmond might not be a travel disruption location itself, just where Aleena is going.

So that's 8 cities: DC, Philadelphia, NY, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Boston, Raleigh, Baltimore. Wait, Dallas-Fort Worth is one city? Or is it two? The article refers to the airport as "Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport", so as a single location. So total is 8. Wait let me recount:

1. Washington, D.C. (National Airport, BWI mentioned as part of the area)
2. Philadelphia
3. New York (Kennedy)
4. Chicago (O'Hare)
5. Dallas-Fort Worth (airport)
6. Boston (Amtrak)
7. Raleigh (Amtrak)
8. Baltimore (BWI)
That's 8. Wait, the Amtrak destinations include Washington, New York, Chicago, Boston, Raleigh. So those are already counted except Boston and Raleigh. So total is 8 cities. But the article also mentions "Washington and Baltimore could get more light snow" – so Baltimore is included as a city. So total is 8. Wait, the question says "distinct cities explicitly mentioned as being impacted by the storm’s travel disruptions". So:

- Ronald Reagan National (Washington, D.C.)
- Philadelphia
- Kennedy (NY)
- Chicago
- Dallas-Fort Worth (as one)
- Amtrak destinations: Boston, Raleigh, and also Washington, New York, Chicago (already counted)
- Baltimore (BWI)
- Richmond? The article says Aleena is from Richmond but her flight was from National to Cincinnati. The disruption was at National, so Richmond isn't a travel disruption location. So not counted.

So total is 7? Wait:

1. Washington, D.C.
2. Philadelphia
3. New York
4. Chicago
5. Dallas-Fort Worth
6. Boston
7. Raleigh
8. Baltimore

Yes, 8 cities. So the answer is 8.
