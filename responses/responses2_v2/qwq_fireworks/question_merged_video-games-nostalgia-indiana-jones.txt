Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly. Let's start with question 1.

1. The first question asks which graphics card manufacturer is specifically called out as being unable to run Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The article mentions the author's "aging graphics card" but doesn't specify the manufacturer. So the answer is N/A because the text doesn't name a brand.

2. The second question is about the minimum acceptable frame rate. The article says the author tried running the game at "a stuttering 15 frames per second" but doesn't state what the industry standard is. So N/A again.

3. The third question asks for the percentage of development costs for photorealistic graphics. The article mentions "billions in the pursuit of hyperrealistic graphics" but no specific percentage. So N/A.

4. The fourth question is about the indie game developer who pioneered hand-drawn 3D before Mundaun. The article says Mundaun uses "hand-drawn artwork" but doesn't mention another developer before them. So N/A.

5. The fifth question asks the resolution required for the film grain effect in Indiana Jones. The article doesn't mention resolution specifics for that effect, so N/A.

6. The sixth question is how many 2023 indie games used the PlayStation polygonal style. The article says "indie mainstream last year with critical successes like Mouthwashing and Crow Country," but doesn't give a number. Since it lists two, maybe 2? Wait, the question is about how many were released in 2023. The article says "last year" which could be 2023 if the article is recent, but the exact number isn't stated. So N/A.

7. The seventh question asks the frame rate of Star Wars Outlaws with ray-traced lighting. The article doesn't mention frame rates for specific effects here. N/A.

8. The eighth question is the Unreal engine tech for facial animations in Indiana Jones. The article talks about Unreal engine upgrades but doesn't name a specific breakthrough. N/A.

9. The ninth question about Memory of a Broken Dimension's system requirements for glitch textures. The article says nothing about system specs for that game. N/A.

10. The tenth question asks how many pixels were used for Double Dragon faces. The article mentions "a few similarly shaded squares" but not exact pixels. N/A.

11. The eleventh question links Crow Country's inspiration. The article says "blocky, polygonal look of early PlayStation games exploded into the indie mainstream last year with critical successes like Mouthwashing and Crow Country." So the earlier game would be the original PlayStation games, but the specific title? The article mentions "early PlayStation games" as the inspiration, but the question asks for a specific game mentioned. The article lists "Mouthwashing and Crow Country" as examples of the trend, but the inspiration is the early PS games. The question asks for an earlier game that inspired Crow Country. Since the article says "early PlayStation games" were the source, but no specific title is mentioned, so N/A?

Wait, the question says "what earlier game, mentioned in the article as having blocky, polygonal graphics, served as a direct inspiration for the visual style of Crow Country?" The article says "the blocky, polygonal look of early PlayStation games exploded into the indie mainstream last year with critical successes like Mouthwashing and Crow Country." So the inspiration is the early PlayStation games' style, but the article doesn't mention a specific earlier game. Therefore, N/A.

12. The twelfth question is about RoboCop's lighting contributing to nostalgic appeal. The article says "the graphite gray sheen of RoboCop's helmet and the way it picks up the light of a Detroit bodega's neon sign." So the lighting from neon signs is the answer.

13. The thirteenth question asks besides Ender Magnolia, which game used hand-drawn dioramas for folk horror. The article mentions "Mundaun does an incredible job evoking folk horror by building its 3-D dioramic worlds from sketchy, hand-drawn artwork." So Mundaun is the answer.

14. The fourteenth question asks what core mechanic from The Sims would the author use if making an innovative game. The article says The Sims was a sandbox where players could be gods, farmers, etc. The core mechanic is sandbox/free-building. So the answer is sandbox or open-ended simulation.

Wait, the question says "core gameplay mechanic from The Sims". The Sims' core is life simulation, managing sims' needs. But the author's approach would be like Memory of a Broken Dimension's visual style. The question is hypothetical, but the article says "The Sims was a sandbox for the American dream..." so maybe sandbox gameplay. But the question is tricky. The article doesn't say the author would do anything specific, so maybe N/A. Wait, the instructions say if it can be inferred, but the author's view is that the industry should try new things. The Sims' sandbox allows creativity. So maybe "sandbox" or "open-ended simulation" but the exact term? The article says "sandbox for the American dream", so "sandbox" is the mechanic. So answer: sandbox.

15. The fifteenth question is about Alien: Isolation's environment element with slime. The article mentions "Alien's chunky computer screens, splashed with xenomorph slime and android milk." The specific element beyond slime is the chunky computer screens.

16. The sixteenth question is what feature of Indiana Jones is praised by Troy Baker and seen as problematic. The article says "The voice actor Troy Baker channels a young Harrison Ford to play the charismatic archaeologist in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle." The author criticizes games for re-creating the past, so using Baker's voice acting to mimic Harrison Ford is an example of clinging to nostalgia, hence the problematic trend.

17. The seventeenth question is the visual element of Contra characters simplified. The article says "their textured human faces... were mercilessly rendered into a few similarly shaded squares." The specific element is the "war paint and five-o'-clock shadow" which were simplified.

18. The eighteenth question: what game like Tunic is a less egregious example compared to Star Wars Outlaws. The article mentions "smaller-scale indie games can tap into nostalgic desires... Tunic and Death's Door" as Zelda-likes, which are nostalgic but indie. So Tunic is considered less egregious than the big franchises. So the answer is Tunic or Death's Door? The question says "exemplified by Tunic", so the answer is Tunic.

19. The nineteenth question about Star Wars Outlaws' nostalgic element beyond blasters. The article mentions "the glowing red streaks of a 'Star Wars' laser blaster" and "Detroit bodega's neon sign" for RoboCop. For Star Wars, it might be the "chunky computer screens" but that's Alien. Wait, the article says for Star Wars Outlaws: "the glowing red streaks of a 'Star Wars' laser blaster" and "the creative experiences that bring us back to our childhoods". Another element could be the aesthetic of the original films, like the look of the ships or environments. But the question asks beyond laser blasters. The article says "the creative experiences that bring us back to our childhoods when everything felt simpler" so maybe the overall aesthetic. But the exact element? The article says "the graphite gray sheen of RoboCop's helmet" for RoboCop, but for Star Wars, perhaps "the look of the original films' visuals". Since the article mentions "the ability to plausibly rekindle the experience of watching the films", so the specific element beyond blasters might be the "glowing red streaks" but that's the blasters. Wait, maybe the "xenomorph slime" is for Alien. The article's point is that these games recreate the films' visuals. For Star Wars, perhaps the "glowing red streaks" are the blasters, so another element would be the "look of the original films" but the question wants a specific element. The article says "the fealty to classic aesthetics allows them to coast on what we expect to see". Maybe "the aesthetic of the original films" but the exact element? The article doesn't specify another element for Star Wars besides the laser blasters. Hmm. The question says "what specific visual aspect of Star Wars Outlaws, beyond laser blasters, contributes to its nostalgic appeal". The article mentions "the glowing red streaks of a 'Star Wars' laser blaster" and the overall aesthetic. Since the article doesn't list another specific element, maybe N/A? Wait, the first paragraph says "the pores on its Hollywood Nazi faces too multitudinous" for Indiana Jones, but for Star Wars, perhaps the "look of the original films' visuals" in general. Since the article doesn't specify another, maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "their fealty to classic aesthetics allows them to coast on what we expect to see". The aesthetic includes things like the look of the original films. Since the question is about a specific aspect beyond the blasters, maybe "the aesthetic of the original films" but that's too vague. The article doesn't name another specific element, so perhaps N/A.

Wait, the article says "the graphite gray sheen of RoboCop's helmet and the way it picks up the light of a Detroit bodega's neon sign. There's Alien's chunky computer screens, splashed with xenomorph slime and android milk. And of course, there are the glowing red streaks of a 'Star Wars' laser blaster." So for Star Wars Outlaws, the article mentions the laser blasters as a specific visual element. The question is asking beyond that, so perhaps the aesthetic of the original films' environments or characters. Since the article doesn't mention another specific one, maybe N/A.

20. The twentieth question is about Mouthwashing's aspect contrasting with Spider-Man. The article says Mouthwashing is an indie game that used the PS polygonal style, which is innovative compared to the hyperrealistic Spider-Man games. The positive example would be its "blocky, polygonal look" or its "early PlayStation aesthetic". The article says "Mouthwashing and Crow Country" are examples of exploring visual possibilities beyond expected aesthetics. So the aspect is their use of polygonal styles, so the answer is "blocky, polygonal graphics" or "early PlayStation polygonal aesthetic".
