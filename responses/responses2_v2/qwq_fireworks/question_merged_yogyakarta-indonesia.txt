Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. The first question asks about the traditional Javanese dance Siti Adiyati studied. The article mentions she studied Javanese dance when young, and the most famous local performance is the Ramayana. But the Sunday practice dance is mentioned in the Kraton's pavilion. Wait, the article says "the most famous local dance performance is of the Ramayana". However, the question specifies the Sunday morning practice sessions. The text says "the most beautiful of which is a Sunday-morning practice dance, where performers receive instruction from masters". It doesn't name the dance, but the Ramayana is the famous one. But maybe it's the Ramayana? Or another? Hmm, maybe the answer is Ramayana. But the article doesn't explicitly say Siti studied that specific one there. Wait, the question is about the dance she studied under masters at the Sunday sessions. The article says Siti was a student of Javanese dance when young, but the Sunday session is at the Kraton's pavilion. The text says "the most famous local dance performance is of the Ramayana". So maybe the answer is Ramayana. But the question is about the dance she studied there. Since the article doesn't specify the name of the dance at the Sunday sessions, maybe it's N/A? Wait, no, the article says the Sunday session is a practice dance, but the most famous is the Ramayana. So perhaps the answer is Ramayana. Let me check again. The text says "the most famous local dance performance is of the Ramayana, the ancient Hindu epic". So maybe the answer is Ramayana. But the question is about the specific dance at the Sunday practice. Since the article doesn't explicitly name it, maybe N/A? Hmm, tricky. Maybe the answer is N/A because it's not specified.

2. Borobudur's Buddha statues. The article states Borobudur originally had 504 Buddha statues. Now, the question is how many remain visible. It says "originally, 504 Buddha statues" but doesn't say current numbers. However, it mentions the stupas are hollow and you can peer in to see Buddha figures. So perhaps they are still there, so 504? But maybe some are missing. The text doesn't say, so maybe N/A. Wait, the question is about the current visible statues inside the stupas. Since the article doesn't mention any destruction or loss, maybe the answer is 504? Wait, the article says "originally" so maybe some are missing now, but the text doesn't specify. Since it's not stated, answer N/A.

3. Prambanan's destruction cause. The article says "It was mostly destroyed not long after construction, probably by the eruption of nearby, still-active Mount Merapi." So the primary cause is Mount Merapi eruption. So answer: eruption of Mount Merapi.

4. Taman Sari construction dynasty. The Cosmological Axis was built in the 18th century by a sultanate. The article says "built in the 18th century by a sultanate that still governs the region politically and spiritually." But which dynasty? The sultanate of Yogyakarta. The question asks the dynasty name. Since it's the Yogyakarta Sultanate, but the text doesn't mention the dynasty's name beyond the sultanate. So answer N/A? The question says "dynasty", but the article refers to the sultanate. Maybe the answer is the Yogyakarta Sultanate, but the term dynasty might be different. Since the text doesn't specify the dynasty name, answer N/A.

5. Artist collectives by Rangga. The text says Rangga manages one collective. It says "he manages one." The question is how many he established before focusing on photo-based art. The article doesn't mention prior collectives, so N/A.

6. Melinjo herb's symbolic meaning. The article says "brongkos telur... a lemony-bitter herb called melinjo. 'We love peanuts... something nutty, creamy, fatty, sweet, something fermented.' So Sukarso attributes the melinjo's role as part of the root palate which includes bitter or fermented elements. The question is the symbolic meaning Sukarso says. The text says "something nutty, creamy, fatty, sweet, something fermented" are in their root palate. Since melinjo is described as "lemony-bitter", maybe Sukarso sees it as part of the fermented elements? Or the bitter aspect. The article doesn't explicitly state the symbolic meaning, just mentions it's part of the dish. So answer N/A? Wait, the question is asking what Sukarso attributes to the herb. The text says Sukarso mentions "something fermented" but the melinjo is just part of the dish's ingredients. Since the article doesn't state a specific symbolic meaning Sukarso gave, perhaps N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "fermented" but the question is about symbolic meaning, which isn't specified. So N/A.

7. Goddess ritual at eighth gate. The article mentions Siti's infographic with eight gates, pointing north to Merapi and south to the sea goddess. It says "the goddess who looms large in local mythology." But there's no mention of an annual ritual at the eighth gate. So N/A.

8. Universities in Cosmological Axis. The article says Yogyakarta is "dense with universities", but the Cosmological Axis is a specific UNESCO site. The text doesn't mention how many universities are within that area. So N/A.

9. Borobudur's decline connection. The scholar Hudaya says Borobudur was a "pile of Dharma" built not for worship but instruction. The decline of Buddhism and rise of Islam caused abandonment. The architectural layout's connection? The article doesn't link the layout to the decline. So N/A.

10. Architect of mosque's Hindu motifs. The mosque's gates incorporate Hindu motifs, but the article doesn't name the architect. So N/A.

11. Levels at Borobudur before earthly temptation. Borobudur is 10 levels high. The article says visitors ascend from lower peripheries (studying earthly temptation) to the top. So the lower levels have the earthly depictions. So to reach the earthly section, they start at the lower levels. The question is how many levels to ascend before reaching the earthly part. Wait, the question is the reverse: how many levels do visitors ascend before reaching the section dedicated to earthly temptation? Since the earthly is on the lower levels, maybe they start there. The top is unadorned. So perhaps the answer is 0? Or maybe the first levels. The article says "visitors ascend from the lower peripheries, studying carved panels about earthly temptation, to the unadorned top". So the earthly is at the lower levels. To reach the earthly section, they start there, so they don't ascend any levels before. But the question is about how many levels they must ascend before getting to the earthly part. Since the earthly is on the lower levels, they start there. So the answer is 0? But the question might be phrased as ascending to get away from earthly. Alternatively, the question might have a mistake, but based on the text, the answer is N/A because the text doesn't specify the number of levels to ascend before the earthly section. The article just says they start at the lower peripheries (earthly) and go up. So the answer is N/A?

Wait, the question says "before reaching the section dedicated to depictions of earthly temptation". The earthly is at the lower levels, so you don't ascend to get there. So the answer is 0, but maybe the article doesn't state that. Since the question is about how many levels to ascend before reaching the earthly section, the answer is 0. But the article doesn't explicitly state this number. Since it's not given, perhaps N/A. Hmm. The article says "visitors ascend from the lower peripheries, studying carved panels about earthly temptation, to the unadorned top". So the earthly is on the lower levels, so they start there. Therefore, to reach the earthly section, you don't ascend any levels. But the question is phrased as "how many levels does the author suggest visitors ascend before reaching the section dedicated to earthly temptation?" Since the earthly is the starting point, the answer is 0. But the article doesn't specify the number of levels, just that they ascend from the lower. Since it's not stated, maybe N/A. I'll go with N/A because the exact number isn't given.

12. Bali visitors to kampongs. The article says "only a tiny percentage of the millions who flock to Bali make a side trip to Yogyakarta". The question asks the percentage of Bali visitors who go to the kampongs near the mosque. The text doesn't give a percentage, so N/A.

13. Other structure with Ramayana elements. The Cosmological Axis includes the Kraton and other structures. The question is besides Taman Sari, what other structure incorporates Ramayana elements. The article mentions the Kraton's animated display about Javanese life and the Ramayana dance. But the Ramayana is a dance, not a structure. The question asks a structure designed by the sultan. The text says the Cosmological Axis includes the Kraton, the mosque, etc., but no other structure with Ramayana elements. The answer might be the Sonobudoyo museum? Or N/A. The article doesn't mention any other structure with Ramayana elements besides the dance performance. So N/A.

14. Symbolic gates leading to Borobudur's top. Siti's infographic has eight gates of the Cosmological Axis, but the question is about Borobudur's gates. The article says Borobudur has 72 stupas on the top levels. The gates mentioned in Siti's drawing are part of the Cosmological Axis's Kraton. The question is about Borobudur's gates leading to enlightenment. The article doesn't mention gates on Borobudur, only the stupas. So N/A.

15. Artwork referencing Cosmological Axis and Merapi. Rangga's artwork references the anti-communist killings and the Cosmological Axis's connection to Merapi? The article says Rangga's work deals with the 1965 killings, and the artist's collective in Yogya. The Cosmological Axis's connection to Merapi is mentioned in Siti's drawing pointing north to Merapi. The question asks what specific artwork at the museum Rangga created that references this connection. The article doesn't mention Rangga's specific artwork related to Merapi and the Axis. So N/A.

16. Dish combining gudeg and brongkos telur. The article says at a warung, they had brongkos telur, and another warung had gudeg. It mentions "legendary" satays, but no dish that combines both. So N/A.
