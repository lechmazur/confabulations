Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article and follow the instructions strictly.

1. The first question asks about a filmmaker sidelined due to misconduct who directed a documentary with a first lady as executive producer. The article mentions Brett Ratner, who was accused of sexual misconduct and directed Melania Trump's documentary. So the answer should be Brett Ratner.

2. The second question refers to a newspaper with a cartoonist's resignation over a cartoon involving tech CEOs. The article talks about The Washington Post and Ann Telnaes, the cartoonist who quit. So The Washington Post is the answer.

3. The third question is about a business leader optimistic about a political comeback and involved with a controversial newspaper decision. Jeff Bezos is mentioned as proud of his Post decision and hopeful for Trump's second term. So Jeff Bezos.

4. The documentary's production start date relative to a political event. The article states filming began after the election. The answer is after the election.

5. The U.S. president whose policy deregulated pricing in a leisure industry (skiing). The text says President Jimmy Carter ordered the Forest Service to stop regulating lift prices. So Jimmy Carter.

6. The attorney from a renowned firm, advisor in deals, friend of an investor. Samuel Butler from Cravath, friend of Warren Buffett. His last name is Butler.

7. The steel company suing over a blocked merger causing diplomatic issues. U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel sued the government. The question asks for the U.S. company, so U.S. Steel.

8. The former president for whom there's a day of mourning closing markets. The article mentions Jimmy Carter's national day of mourning. So Jimmy Carter.

9. The company using streaming and theatrical release for the documentary. Amazon's Prime Video is mentioned. So Amazon.

10. The tech exec leading a semiconductor firm speaking at CES about AI. Jensen Huang of Nvidia is noted. So Jensen Huang, but the question asks for last name: Huang. Wait, the question says "last name of the veteran attorney"—no, question 10 is about the tech exec. Let me check again. The 10th question says: "Which technology executive... leading a prominent semiconductor firm... headline a trade show..." The article mentions Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia. The answer is Jensen Huang, but the question asks for the last name. The question says "last name" only for question 6. For 10, it's the full name? Wait the question says "last name" only for question 6. For 10, the question asks for the executive's name. The question says "last name" only in question 6. So for 10, the answer is Jensen Huang. Wait, but the instructions say to answer in fragments. The question asks for the company's name? Wait no, the question says "which technology executive... is slated to headline..." So the answer is Jensen Huang, but the question might want the last name? Let me check the question again. The exact wording: "Which technology executive, known for leading a prominent semiconductor firm, is slated to headline..." So the answer is Jensen Huang. But the answer should be in the exact terms from the article. The article says Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia. So the answer is Jensen Huang. The question doesn't specify last name, so full name. Okay.

Wait, let me confirm each again:

1. Brett Ratner – yes.
2. Washington Post – correct.
3. Jeff Bezos – yes.
4. After the election – correct.
5. Jimmy Carter – yes.
6. Butler – correct.
7. U.S. Steel – yes.
8. Jimmy Carter – correct.
9. Amazon – yes, because the documentary is on Prime Video.
10. Jensen Huang – correct.

I think that's all. Let me check if any are N/A. None of these seem to be missing from the article. The only possible edge case is question 9, but the article says Amazon released the documentary on Prime Video and in theaters, so Amazon is correct.
