Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions beyond that.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions a Christmas market attack in Magdeburg, Germany. So the answer should be Magdeburg.

2. **Question 2**: The text says the NYPD uses concrete blocks but doesn't specify a number. Since there's no exact number given, it's N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Steve Allen suggests choosing a specific place away from crowds, like a tall flag or structure. The article doesn't mention a distance, so N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The article mentions carrying a medical ID card, having info in the phone's emergency feature, or a MedicAlert ID. But Weiner specifically is quoted about getting your face out of the phone. Wait, the question is about which system Weiner endorsed. The text says "carry this personal information somewhere on you... not in a bag or purse". It doesn't specify a particular system like Apple Health, so maybe N/A? Or MedicAlert? Let me check again. The exact quote from Allen: "put that information in your phone's emergency information or medical ID feature... carry a card in your wallet, wear a MedicAlert ID, or do all three." The question asks which one Weiner specifically endorsed. But the article says "Deputy Commissioner Weiner" talked about getting your face out of the phone, but the medical ID part is from Steve Allen. So the question is about Weiner, but the article doesn't attribute the medical ID endorsement to her. So answer N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The article states that the threat of terrorism has canceled other big events, but no percentage is given. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The article says "learn a few key phrases in the local language". So "local language" implies one, but the question is how many languages? Since they're talking about international travel, the local language of the destination, so one. The answer is 1.

7. **Question 7**: The article mentions "a threat on social media" but doesn't specify which platform. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The go-bag is described as "small". No capacity size is given. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The NYPD begins preparing and gathering intelligence "well before" a big event, but no specific hours. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The article mentions wearing a MedicAlert ID, which is usually a bracelet or necklace, but not the color. So N/A.

Let me double-check each to ensure I didn't miss any details. The article doesn't mention numbers for most of these, so a lot of N/As. Only question 1 and 6 have answers based on the text.
