Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict format. Let's start with the first question.

1. The question asks about the percentage increase in viewership due to Nikki Glaser's monologue compared to Jo Koy's previous year. The article mentions that viewership this year was 9.3 million, down from 9.4 million last year. So there's actually a slight decline, not an increase. Also, the article doesn't provide any percentage or specific data linking Glaser's performance to viewership numbers. It just says critics praised her. So the answer should be N/A.

2. The second question is about what strategy CBS could have used to surpass the 25M viewers of the football game. The article doesn't mention any strategies CBS could have employed. It just states that the football game had higher viewership. Since there's no info on their strategies, N/A again.

3. For the third question, the trend between this year and last is a drop from 9.4M to 9.3M, a decrease of 0.1M. If that rate continues, next year would be 9.2M. But the question specifies the 85th awards. The article doesn't say when the current year's event is, so we can't know if 85th is next year or further. The article mentions this year's was on CBS first year (so 2023?), so maybe next year is 85th? But the article doesn't explicitly state the current year's number. However, the drop is 0.1M over one year. Assuming the next year continues the same rate, the answer would be 9.2M. But need to check if the question allows inference. The article says "this year" and last, so maybe the next year is the next one. The question says "if the trend continues", so maybe we can infer 9.2. Wait, but the question is about the 85th, but the article doesn't mention which year corresponds to which award number. So maybe N/A? Hmm, the article doesn't mention the current year's award number. So maybe can't answer. The article says "last year" had 9.4, so this is 9.3. If the current is 2023, then next is 2024, but the 85th might not be the next one. Since the article doesn't provide the award number for this year, can't determine. So N/A.

4. The fourth question asks for a specific element from VideoAmp's data beyond the 10.1M number that suggests a resurgence. The article only mentions the 10.1M figure from VideoAmp and proprietary data. It doesn't mention any other elements like engagement, demographics, etc. So N/A.

5. The fifth question is about how the avoidance of Trump comments affected the Nielsen dispute. The article says the political avoidance was a departure but doesn't link it to the Nielsen issue. The dispute is about Paramount not having Nielsen data. No connection mentioned, so N/A.

6. The sixth question asks the primary demographic target based on Nikki's acclaim and the films that won. The article doesn't mention demographics targeted. The films and shows mentioned might suggest awards audience, but the question is about demographic. Since there's no info, N/A.

7. Seventh question: Did the Nielsen dispute influence the decision to award those films? The article states the dispute is about data access, not about award decisions. The awards are based on voters, so no link given. N/A.

8. Eighth question: Jo Koy's critique of the winning films. The article says last year's broadcast was panned by critics, but doesn't mention Jo Koy's specific critiques of the films. So N/A.

9. Ninth question: How many more viewers in the 2010s compared to this year's Globes plus the football game. The 2010s had 20M. This year's is 9.3M, football is 25M. Combined is 34.3M. 20M vs 34.3? Wait, the question is "how many more viewers watched the Globes in the 2010s compared to combined this year and football". Wait, that would be 20M (Globes in 2010s) minus (9.3 +25) = 34.3. So 20 -34.3 is negative, but the question says "how many more", so maybe absolute? But the article says "ratings are far from the Globes' audience of 20 million or so viewers it drew in the 2010s". So the 20M is for the Globes alone. The question is comparing that 20M to the combined 34.3M. The difference would be 20M - (9.3+25) = 20 - 34.3 = -14.3, but phrased as "how many more viewers watched the Globes in the 2010s compared to the combined...", which is 20M minus 34.3M, so the answer would be -14.3, but since the question asks "how many more", perhaps phrased as the difference in favor of the combined. But the article doesn't give exact numbers for the 2010s; it's "about 20 million". The question is precise, so since it's approximate, maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "20 million or so", so exact number isn't given. Also, the question is asking for the difference between the Globes in 2010s and the combined this year's Globes and the football game. The math would require exact numbers, but since the 20M is approximate, and the other numbers are exact, maybe it's possible to compute as 20 - (9.3+25) = 20 -34.3 = -14.3 million. But since the question is asking "how many more viewers watched the Golden Globes in the 2010s", compared to the combined, so the answer would be the difference is 14.3 million fewer. But the question says "how many more", so maybe N/A because it's a negative number? Or since it's a comparison, maybe just the absolute value? The question doesn't specify, but the article's data is approximate. Since the exact difference can't be precisely determined (due to "or so"), the answer is N/A.

10. Tenth question: What partnership with VideoAmp ensured data accuracy due to Nielsen dispute? The article says CBS and Dick Clark used VideoAmp and proprietary data, but doesn't mention a strategic partnership formation. Just that they cited VideoAmp's data. So N/A.

11. Eleventh question: Which network previously broadcast the Globes before CBS? The article says last year was the first on CBS, implying prior networks. The article mentions "the first year it had broadcast on CBS", so previous was another network. But which one? The article doesn't name it. So N/A.

12. Twelfth question: Primary reason for near collapse aside from pandemic. The article says "pandemic and a number of self-inflicted scandals that had nearly killed off the event entirely". So the self-inflicted scandals are the other reason. So answer is "self-inflicted scandals".

13. Thirteenth question: Which administration was avoided? The article says "incoming Trump administration", so the answer is "Trump administration".

14. Fourteenth question: Combined viewership difference between Globes and football. The Globes had 9.3M, football 25M. The difference is 25 -9.3 =15.7M. The question says "combined viewership difference between the 2024 Golden Globes and the competing game". Wait, maybe it's asking the difference between the two. So 25M -9.3M =15.7 million. The article states the numbers, so answer is 15.7 million.

15. Fifteenth question: Which film won top honor in a category dominated by those two? The article says "The Brutalist" and "Emilia Perez" took top honors. So one of them is the answer. Since it says "top honors", maybe both, but the question asks which one won the top honor. The article says "took top honors", plural. So perhaps both, but the question says "which film", so maybe "The Brutalist" or "Emilia Perez". The article doesn't specify which one won which category, just that they "took top honors". Since top honor could be Best Picture or similar, but the article doesn't specify, so can't tell which one. Wait, the article says "Globes voters handed awards out to a number of films, but 'The Brutalist' and 'Emilia Perez' took top honors." So "top honors" plural, so both won top awards? But the question is asking which film won the top honor in a category dominated by them. Since both are mentioned as taking top honors, but the question asks for the primary one, maybe either is acceptable, but the article doesn't specify which one. So N/A? Wait, the question says "the top honor", singular. Since the article says they both took top honors, maybe the answer is one of them, but since it's unclear which, perhaps N/A. Wait, the article says "took top honors", so maybe both, but the question asks for the film that won. Since it's not specified which one, answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe "top honors" includes Best Motion Picture or something. The article doesn't clarify, so N/A.

Wait, let me check again. The article says "The Globes voters handed awards out to a number of films, but 'The Brutalist' and 'Emilia Perez' took top honors." So "took top honors" likely meaning both won major categories like Best Picture. The question is "which film won the top honor in a category dominated by...", so perhaps either one. But since the question asks for the primary one, but the article doesn't specify, so N/A. Alternatively, maybe "The Brutalist" is the answer, but no. The article doesn't say which one won which category. So N/A.

Wait, the question says "in a category dominated by 'The Brutalist' and 'Emilia Perez'". So the category had both as top contenders, and one of them won. The article says they "took top honors", so they both won, but which one in which category? Since it's not specified, the answer is N/A.
