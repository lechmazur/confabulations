Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly what's asked without any extra fluff. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then scanning the article for the correct answers.

1. **Question 1:** The question is about an organization founded during the first Trump administration that leads efforts to counter China's control of battery supply chains via investments in Africa. The article mentions the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) was founded by the first Trump administration and is leading those efforts. So the answer should be DFC.

2. **Question 2:** It asks which two countries' leaders called Trump to reaffirm gas's importance. The article states that European and Japanese leaders called Trump after his re-election, so the countries are Europe and Japan. Wait, but the question says "countries"—Europe isn't a country. Wait, maybe specific countries? Let me check again. The text says "congratulatory calls from Europe and Japan", so Europe is a region, but maybe the answer expects Europe as a placeholder? Or perhaps it's two countries from Europe? The article doesn't specify individual countries, just mentions Europe and Japan. Hmm, but the question asks for two countries. Since Europe isn't a country, maybe it's N/A? Wait, the question says "two countries", but the article says "Europe and Japan". Since Europe isn't a single country, maybe the answer is just Japan and one country from Europe? But the article doesn't name specific countries in Europe, just the region. Therefore, perhaps the answer is Europe and Japan, but since the question specifies countries, maybe it's N/A? Wait, the question says "countries", but the text mentions "Europe and Japan". Maybe the intended answer is Europe and Japan even if Europe is a region. The question might accept that. Let me note that as Europe and Japan, but maybe the user expects country names. Wait, the article says "Europe and Japan", so maybe the answer is Europe and Japan. Since the question says "countries", but Europe is a continent, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, but the article says "European and Japanese officials"—so European countries and Japan. The question says "two countries", but the article mentions multiple European countries and Japan. Since it's plural, but the question asks for two countries, maybe it's impossible. Wait, the exact quote is "congratulatory calls from Europe and Japan"—so perhaps the two regions/countries are Europe (as a collective) and Japan. Since the question is about countries, maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, conflicting. Wait the article says "congratulatory calls from Europe and Japan that Mr. Trump received upon winning re-election". Since Europe isn't a country, perhaps the answer is Japan and one European country, but the article doesn't name specific countries. So maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "two countries' leaders"—so maybe it's two countries like Germany and Japan? But the article doesn't specify. Therefore, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "Europe and Japan", so perhaps the answer is Europe and Japan even if Europe isn't a country. The question might accept that. Alternatively, maybe the answer is European countries and Japan, but the question asks for two countries, so perhaps the answer is N/A. This is tricky. Let me check again. The question says "two countries' leaders reaffirmed...", but the article says "European and Japanese officials". Since Europe is a region, perhaps the answer is Japan and (for example) Germany, but the article doesn't name specific countries. So the answer would be N/A. Wait, but maybe the article's exact wording is "Europe and Japan", so the answer is Europe and Japan even if one is a region. Since the question might expect that, I'll go with Europe and Japan. But the user might consider that incorrect because Europe isn't a country. Hmm. Maybe I should note that as an issue but proceed with the answer given in the text.

3. **Question 3:** The individual who emphasized that U.S. LNG exports would double over the next term is mentioned in the article. The text says Mr. Pyatt noted that U.S. gas exports are set to double over the course of Mr. Trump's upcoming term. So the answer is Geoffrey Pyatt.

4. **Question 4:** The official with a fossil fuel background challenging Biden's approach. The article mentions Chris Wright, who is a fossil fuel executive, is picked to lead the Department of Energy and will assail Biden. So the answer is Chris Wright.

5. **Question 5:** The organization founded during the first Trump administration to lead efforts against China in battery supply chains. Again, the article states the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) was founded by the first Trump administration. So DFC.

6. **Question 6:** The diplomat who asserted energy as a national security advantage. The article says Geoffrey Pyatt said energy is a strategic asset and national security attribute, and mentioned the U.S. is energy secure. So Geoffrey Pyatt.

7. **Question 7:** Whose policies are portrayed as undervaluing energy as a liability. The article says Wright will say Biden viewed energy as a liability. So the answer is Biden.

8. **Question 8:** The nation controlling over 90% of rare earth mineral processing. The text states China controls over 90% of rare earth processing. So China.

9. **Question 9:** The energy export that grew despite renewables. The article mentions U.S. gas exports (LNG) went from near-zero in 2016 to dominating the market. So LNG (liquefied natural gas).

10. **Question 10:** The energy sector with a 70% production boost. The article says U.S. crude oil production is 70% higher over eight years. So crude oil.

11. **Question 11:** The legislative act spurring clean energy growth. The article mentions the Inflation Reduction Act under Biden accelerated U.S. production. So Inflation Reduction Act.

12. **Question 12:** Who received calls from European and Japanese leaders? The article says Trump received congratulatory calls from Europe and Japan after re-election. So Trump.

Wait, let me confirm each one again.

1. DFC, yes. The article says "The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, which has led efforts to counter China's control of that sector, was founded by the first Trump administration."

2. The question is about two countries, but the article says "Europe and Japan". Since Europe is a region, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, but the question says "countries", so perhaps the answer is two countries from Europe and Japan. Since the article doesn't name specific countries, but refers to Europe as a region, maybe the answer is Europe and Japan, even if Europe isn't a country. Alternatively, since the question says "countries", and the article mentions "European and Japanese officials", perhaps it's N/A because they're regions, not specific countries. Hmm. The question might expect the answer as Europe and Japan even if they're not countries. Let me check the exact wording again. The article says "congratulatory calls from Europe and Japan that Mr. Trump received upon winning re-election". Since the question asks for two countries, but the article refers to Europe as a region, the correct answer would be N/A. Wait, but the question says "countries", so maybe it's a mistake in the question. Since the user says to answer based on the article, and the article says Europe and Japan, but the question asks for two countries, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the answer as "Europe and Japan" even if they aren't countries. Since the article uses those terms, maybe the answer is Europe and Japan. I think the user expects that. So I'll go with Europe and Japan, but note the ambiguity.

But let me see the exact question again: "which two countries' leaders reaffirmed..." Since Europe isn't a country, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the countries are European countries (like Germany, France) and Japan, but the article doesn't name them. Since the article doesn't specify individual countries in Europe, the answer would be N/A. Therefore, question 2's answer is N/A. Wait, but the article says "Europe and Japan"—so maybe the answer is "Europe and Japan" even if one is a region. Since the question says "countries", but the text uses those terms, maybe it's acceptable. Alternatively, the user might have intended "European countries and Japan", but the answer requires two countries. Since the article doesn't name two specific countries, perhaps the answer is N/A. Hmm, this is a problem. I need to decide. Since the question asks for two countries' leaders, and the article says "Europe and Japan", but Europe is a region, I think the answer is N/A. Because the question specifies countries, and the article doesn't name two specific countries. So the answer would be N/A for question 2.

Wait, but maybe the user considers Europe as a single entity here, even if it's not a country. The question might have a mistake, but according to the instructions, I must use the article's exact wording. The article says "Europe and Japan", so perhaps the answer is Europe and Japan. The question might have a typo, but I have to go with the text. So I'll put Europe and Japan, but with a note that Europe isn't a country. But according to the user's instructions, if the question has an incorrect premise, answer N/A. Since Europe isn't a country, the question's premise is incorrect, so answer N/A. Therefore, question 2: N/A.

Wait, but the article says "congratulatory calls from Europe and Japan"—so maybe it's two regions, not countries, so the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the countries are the US and another? No. Hmm. I'll have to go with N/A for question 2.

Now let me recheck all answers with this in mind:

1. U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC)

2. N/A (since Europe isn't a country)

3. Geoffrey Pyatt

4. Chris Wright

5. U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC)

6. Geoffrey Pyatt

7. Biden

8. China

9. liquefied natural gas (LNG)

10. crude oil

11. Inflation Reduction Act

12. Trump

Wait, question 12: "who received congratulatory calls from both European and Japanese officials?" The article says "congratulatory calls from Europe and Japan that Mr. Trump received upon winning re-election", so the answer is Trump.

Okay, proceeding with these answers, adjusting for question 2 as N/A.
