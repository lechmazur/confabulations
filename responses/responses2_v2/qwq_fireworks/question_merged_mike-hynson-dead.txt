Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. Let me go through each question carefully and see what the article says.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks which manufacturer Hynson collaborated with for the "Pipeline" model. The article mentions he designed the Red Fin longboard for Gordon & Smith in 1965. Wait, but the question says "Pipeline" model. Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The article says he rode Pipeline in 1961, but the manufacturer for the board was Gordon & Smith for the Red Fin. The Pipeline here might refer to the wave, not the board. Since the question is about the manufacturer for the "Pipeline" model, maybe it's a trick. The article doesn't mention a "Pipeline" model by Hynson, so maybe N/A?

Wait, the question says "collaborate to create the innovative 'Pipeline' model". The article says Hynson was a noted builder of boards, particularly the Red Fin longboard for Gordon & Smith. The Pipeline here might be a mix-up. Since there's no mention of a "Pipeline" model by him, answer N/A?

2. **Question 2**: How many rolls of film from New Zealand did he smuggle in Mumbai? The article mentions he had to tape five 16mm canisters from Cape St. Francis footage. The question specifies New Zealand, but the article says the footage was from Cape St. Francis (South Africa). So the answer would be N/A because it's not New Zealand.

3. **Question 3**: Box office revenue from the first week in landlocked states. The article states "The Endless Summer" grossed over $30 million total, but no info on first week or landlocked states specifically. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Who introduced Hynson to Brotherhood during "Rainbow Bridge"? The article says he joined Brotherhood of Eternal Love in Laguna Beach, but the question links it to the film. The film's director was Chuck Wein. The article mentions Hynson masterminded "Rainbow Bridge" with Chuck Wein, a protege of Andy Warhol. But no mention of who introduced him to the Brotherhood. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Name of the local group in Cape St. Francis. The article says in Senegal, locals used wooden planks, but in Cape St. Francis, they found no surfers. It mentions a crew called the Sultans but that was Hynson's group in his youth. No local group named. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Warner Bros' initial offer. The article says Warner Bros predicted it wouldn't go beyond 10 miles from the beach, but didn't mention an offer amount. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Chemical compound in his hair pomade. The article says he had a Dracula-style hairstyle with sun-whitened hair pomaded back, but doesn't mention the chemical. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Which competition earned him funding. The article says he got $1400 from Hobie Alter, but no competition mentioned. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Average wave height at Pipeline in 1961. The article mentions Pipeline as dangerous but no specific height. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Number of surfboards designed for Sultans before Red Fin. The article doesn't give a number. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Year he conquered Pipeline, enhancing his rep. The article says 1961. So answer 1961.

12. **Question 12**: Where he felt the adrenaline surge. The article mentions the experience at Cape St. Francis in South Africa. So answer Cape St. Francis.

13. **Question 13**: Which wave Bruce Brown compared to a machine. The article says "the waves looked like made by a machine" at Cape St. Francis. So same as question 12, Cape St. Francis.

14. **Question 14**: How draft evasion led to the journey. The article says the trip was the "miracle he needed" after dodging the draft. So answer: The around-the-world trip for the film was the miracle he needed to avoid the draft.

Wait, the question asks how his evasion "inspired him to embark on..." So the answer is that evading the draft led him to take the trip. The article states: "The around-the-world trip for the film, he added, 'was the miracle I needed.'" So the answer is that his prolonged resistance inspired him to embark on the journey. The exact wording? The answer must be direct. The article says "The journey... was the miracle I needed." So the answer is that evading the draft led him to take the trip. The answer should be the trip was the miracle needed due to draft evasion.

15. **Question 15**: Substance leading to rock bottom. The article mentions dependence on drugs, particularly cocaine and methamphetamine. So answer methamphetamine or cocaine. The question says "most prominently implied"â€”since both are mentioned, but the answer should be one. The article says "cocaine and methamphetamine" so either is correct. Since the question asks for the substance, list both? But instructions say to answer in fragments. Maybe "methamphetamine" as it's first mentioned? Or list both. Wait the article says "cocaine and methamphetamine" so perhaps answer both separated by &? The instructions say to answer in a sentence fragment. Maybe "cocaine and methamphetamine".

16. **Question 16**: Method to hide film in Mumbai. The article says he taped the canisters under a baggy Hawaiian shirt. So answer: taped under a baggy Hawaiian shirt.

17. **Question 17**: Media personality who called him a shaping genius. The article mentions Jake Howard in Surfer magazine wrote "one of the greatest surf lives ever lived" and described him as a "hot-dog performer, a shaping genius, a cosmic adventurer". So answer: Jake Howard.

Now, let me go back and check each answer again:

1. N/A (no Pipeline model mentioned)
2. N/A (footage was from Cape St. Francis, not New Zealand)
3. N/A
4. N/A
5. N/A
6. N/A
7. N/A
8. N/A
9. N/A
10. N/A
11. 1961
12. Cape St. Francis
13. Cape St. Francis
14. The around-the-world trip for the film was the miracle he needed (exact quote from article)
15. cocaine and methamphetamine
16. taped under a baggy Hawaiian shirt
17. Jake Howard

Wait for question 14, the exact answer should be the direct quote: "the around-the-world trip for the film, he added, 'was the miracle I needed.'" So the answer is that his prolonged resistance to draft notices led him to embark on the trip which he called a miracle. The question asks how his evasion inspired the journey. The answer is the trip was the miracle needed. So the answer is "The around-the-world trip for the film was the miracle he needed" but in a fragment. The question says "how did his prolonged resistance... ultimately inspire him to embark on...?" The answer is that the trip was the miracle needed due to the evasion. So the exact answer is "The around-the-world trip for the film was the miracle he needed."

But the instructions say to answer in a sentence fragment. Maybe just "The around-the-world trip for the film was the miracle he needed." But the user might want the exact wording from the article. The article says: "The journey brought no shortage of challenges. On a layover in Mumbai... The around-the-world trip for the film, he added, 'was the miracle I needed.'" So the answer is that the trip was the miracle needed. So the answer is "The around-the-world trip for the film was the miracle he needed."

But the question is phrased as "how did his prolonged resistance... ultimately inspire him to embark on what he later called a miraculous journey?" The answer is that the trip was the miracle, so the answer is "The around-the-world trip for the film was the miracle he needed."

But the user wants the answer in fragments. Maybe just "The around-the-world trip for the film was the miracle he needed."

Alternatively, the answer is "evading the draft led him to take the journey", but the exact quote is better.

Proceeding with that.
