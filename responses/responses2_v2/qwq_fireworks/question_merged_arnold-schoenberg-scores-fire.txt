Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful and only use the information given, no external knowledge.

1. **Question 1:** The article says Larry Schoenberg's home was in Pacific Palisades and the inventory was in a 2,000-square-foot building behind his house. But it doesn't mention the home's square footage. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The text states Belmont kept digital backups at its offices, which burned. So none survived elsewhere. Answer: 0.

3. **Question 3:** The article mentions Leon Botstein and others, but no one is said to have contacted Belmont after the fire. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The monetary value isn't provided. The article only mentions the number of items, not their value. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Fred Sherry's last visit isn't dated. He recalls visiting but no specific time before the fire. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The article says ensembles might have to change programs but doesn't state how many canceled. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** No percentage is given for Schoenberg's early works in Belmont's inventory. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The insurance company isn't named. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Number of employees isn't mentioned. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The date of Kamala Harris's meeting isn't provided. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Kamala Harris's assessment isn't discussed regarding percentages of manuscripts. N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Leon Botstein mentioned using manuscripts from the Schoenberg Center in Vienna. So the answer is using Vienna's manuscripts.

13. **Question 13:** The article doesn't compare the building size to the wildfire area Kamala surveyed. N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Fred Sherry mentioned photos, letters, posters, books, etc. The second most after scores might be photos or letters. The article lists "photographs, letters, posters, books and arrangements". The most numerous after scores could be photographs. So answer: photographs.

15. **Question 15:** Larry mentions his father's approach to problem-solving but doesn't cite an insurance policy. N/A.

16. **Question 16:** The article doesn't mention when Belmont relocated to Pacific Palisades. N/A.

17. **Question 17:** The number using atonal method isn't stated. N/A.

18. **Question 18:** The article suggests architectural features like those in wildfire protection articles, but Larry's house's lack isn't specified. N/A.

Wait, let me check again for question 14. The article says "other Schoenberg memorabilia were also destroyed... including photographs, letters, posters, books and arrangements..." So the second most after scores would be photographs, assuming they are the next in number. The question asks for the second most numerous category. Since the list includes several items, but "arrangements by other composers" might be a category. The text doesn't specify quantities, so maybe it's not possible. Wait, the question says "based on Fred Sherry's recollection". He "recalled perusing hundreds of scores, including some with old-school cover art and type". The memorabilia included photos, letters, etc. But the question is about the second most numerous category. Since the article doesn't give numbers, perhaps it's N/A. Hmm, maybe I was wrong here. Let me check again. The article says "other Schoenberg memorabilia were also destroyed, including photographs, letters, posters, books and arrangements..." So the categories are photos, letters, posters, books, arrangements. The answer might be "photographs" as the second category after scores, but since the question specifies "second most numerous", but there's no data on quantity. Maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the user instruction says to answer with what's in the text. The text lists the categories but not their numbers. So maybe N/A. Wait the question says "based on Fred Sherry's recollection of his visits". He mentioned that he took home as much music as he could carry, and the garage had hundreds of scores. But for memorabilia, he recalls seeing photos, letters, etc. The question is about the second most numerous category of memorabilia. Since the text lists them but doesn't rank them, I can't answer. So N/A. Wait but maybe the "arrangements by other composers" is part of the scores? No, the scores are separate. The question says "Schoenberg memorabilia" besides scores. The categories are photos, letters, posters, books, arrangements. The answer might be "arrangements" but not sure. The article doesn't specify which is second, so answer N/A. Hmm, conflicting. Let me think again. The user might consider that the article lists the items, but the question asks for the second most numerous. Since there's no info, answer N/A. So I need to correct that. 

Wait for question 14: "Besides scores, what was the second most numerous category of Schoenberg memorabilia lost..." The text lists the items but doesn't say which was second. So answer N/A. 

So adjusting my answers accordingly. Let me recheck all:

1. N/A (home's square footage not given)
2. 0 (digital backups burned)
3. N/A (no mention of anyone contacting)
4. N/A (no value given)
5. N/A (no date for last visit)
6. N/A (no number of cancellations)
7. N/A (no percentage)
8. N/A (no insurance company name)
9. N/A (employees not mentioned)
10. N/A (no date)
11. N/A (Kamala didn't assess this)
12. Using Vienna manuscripts (Botstein mentioned that)
13. N/A (no comparison made)
14. N/A (no quantity info)
15. N/A (no insurance policy cited)
16. N/A (no relocation year)
17. N/A (no number given)
18. N/A (no architectural feature specified for Larry's house)

Wait for question 12: Leon Botstein said they got scores from Belmont for "Gurrelieder" last year. After the fire, he says they might have to change programs. But the article says Belmont will use Vienna's manuscripts. The answer to 12 is "recreating the lost scores using manuscripts from the Schoenberg Center in Vienna". But the question asks what Leon Botstein suggested. Wait, the article says "Leon Botstein... said Belmont played an essential role... He added that some ensembles could be forced to make changes...". The article also says Belmont would work on digital versions based on Vienna's manuscripts. The suggestion from Leon isn't stated, but the article mentions Belmont's plan. The question says "what alternative method did Leon Botstein suggest..." but the text doesn't say Botstein suggested anything except pointing out the problem. So maybe N/A. Wait the user instruction says to use only the article. The article says Belmont would use Vienna's manuscripts, but it's Belmont's plan, not Botstein's suggestion. Therefore, answer N/A. Wait, need to check again.

The text says: "Leon Botstein... said that Belmont played an essential role... "It's a catastrophe,"... "They were the lenders..." He didn't suggest a method, just commented on the problem. The plan to use Vienna's manuscripts is from Belmont, as stated in the article: "Belmont said it would work on creating digital versions... based on manuscripts... in Vienna." So the answer to question 12 is N/A because Botstein didn't suggest the method. Oops, that's a mistake earlier. So correcting question 12 to N/A.

Another check: question 12: "Leon Botstein suggest for quickly recreating..." The article doesn't say Botstein suggested anything except the problem. So answer N/A.

So adjusting that. Let me recompile the answers now.
