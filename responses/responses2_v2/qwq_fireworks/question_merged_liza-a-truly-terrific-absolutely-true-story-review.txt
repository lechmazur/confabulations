Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the given article. I need to be careful and only use the information provided, no external knowledge.

1. **Question 1:** The director who mentored Liza in developing her style after her mom's death leading to "Cabaret." The article mentions Kay Thompson helped her find a distinct voice and style. But the question asks for a director. Wait, the article says "with the likes of the entertainer and writer Kay Thompson." Hmm, Kay Thompson isn't a director. The director of "Cabaret" was Bob Fosse. But does the article say he mentored her? The article says Klein's documentary examines how she developed her style with Kay's help. The breakthrough role in "Cabaret" was directed by Bob Fosse, but the question is about who mentored her. The article says "with help from... Kay Thompson." So maybe the answer is Kay Thompson? Wait, but the question specifies a Hollywood director. The article mentions Bob Fosse's "Cabaret" as a triumph, but does it say he mentored her? The exact quote: "developed a voice and performance style distinct from her mother's. Even so, it is hard to grasp how Minnelli even survived childhood. Her heaviest burden..." So the mentor here is Kay Thompson. The question asks for the director who mentored her, but Kay is an entertainer/writer. Maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says "with help from the likes of the entertainer and writer Kay Thompson" so maybe the answer is Kay Thompson even if she's not a director? The question might have an error, but according to the text, the answer is Kay Thompson. Wait, the question says "Hollywood director," so if Kay isn't a director, then maybe the answer is N/A? Hmm, tricky. Let me check again. The article says "entertainer and writer Kay Thompson," so not a director. The director of Cabaret was Bob Fosse, but the article doesn't explicitly say he mentored her. The question might be incorrect, so answer N/A. Wait, the article says "with help from the likes of the entertainer and writer Kay Thompson -- developed a voice and performance style distinct from her mother's." So the mentor in that context is Kay Thompson, but the question asks for a director. So maybe the answer is N/A? But the question says "director," so perhaps the correct answer is Bob Fosse? The article mentions "Cabaret" directed by Bob Fosse, and it's her breakthrough. Maybe the mentoring was through working with Fosse? The article doesn't explicitly say he mentored her, so maybe it's N/A. Hmm. I think the answer is Kay Thompson, even though she's not a director. The question might have a mistake. Alternatively, since the question specifies a director, maybe the answer is N/A.

Wait, the article says "the director Bruce David Klein has assembled..." but that's the documentary director. The question is about the Hollywood director who mentored her. The text says "with help from the likes of the entertainer and writer Kay Thompson" so the mentor is Kay, but not a director. So the answer would be N/A. Wait, but maybe the answer is Bob Fosse because he directed her in Cabaret, which was her breakthrough? The article says "triumphs like Bob Fosse's 'Cabaret' (1972)", so Fosse directed her, but does that count as mentoring? The article doesn't explicitly say he mentored her. The question says "mentored... leading to her breakthrough role in Cabaret." Since the article doesn't state Fosse mentored her, maybe it's N/A. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the answer is Kay Thompson, but since the question specifies director, N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Pages Modern Screen dedicated to her first public performance. The article says in 1946, the magazine ran a multi-page story on the new baby Liza. The first public performance with her mom was in 1949's "In the Good Old Summertime." The question is about the London Palladium in 1972? The article says "by the time Minnelli was 18, she was performing with Garland at the London Palladium." The 1946 article was about her birth. The question asks how many pages the magazine dedicated to her first public performance at London Palladium. The article doesn't mention that. The 1946 article had multi-page story on her birth, but the Palladium performance is in 1967 (18 years old). The article doesn't say how many pages were dedicated to that. So answer N/A.

3. **Question 3:** TV special produced by Kay Thompson in 1972. The article mentions "Liza With a 'Z'" released in 1972. The article says "the likes of Kay Thompson" helped her develop her style, and her TV special "Liza With a 'Z'" that same year. So the answer is "Liza With a 'Z'". The question says "produced by Kay Thompson"â€”the article doesn't explicitly state that Kay produced it, but the special is mentioned in the context of her developing her style with Kay's help. Maybe the answer is "Liza With a 'Z'".

4. **Question 4:** Composer of "Liza" sung at her christening. The article mentions Ira Gershwin sang "Liza" to the baby. The lyricist is Ira Gershwin, but the question asks for the composer. The article says "the lyricist Ira Gershwin had sung his old tune 'Liza'". So the composer might be someone else. The article clarifies in the correction note: "An earlier version... He was a lyricist, with Gus Kahn; he was not its composer." So the composer isn't mentioned. So the answer is N/A? Wait, the question is about who wrote the song "Liza" that was performed at her christening. The article says Ira Gershwin sang his old tune "Liza". The song was written by Gershwin, but as a lyricist. The composer isn't named here. Since the question asks for the composer, the answer is N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Medical condition causing Garland's death. The article says Garland had "deeply troubled past and health issues" but doesn't specify the condition. The question asks for the medical condition. Since it's not stated, answer N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Decade when Scorsese cast her in "New York, New York" after her stage role. The film was 1977, so the 1970s. The article says "New York, New York" (1977). Gerald Clarke's book mentions her burden but not the decade. The answer is 1970s.

7. **Question 7:** Box office revenue of "Cabaret". The article doesn't mention specific numbers, so N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Photographer of Judy's color portrait. The article says "a large, glamorous color shot of Garland opposite two much smaller black-and-white photographs". It doesn't name the photographer, so N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Broadway role Ben Vereen helped her prepare. The article mentions Ben Vereen in interviews but doesn't specify the role. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Studio exec who arranged meeting with Feinstein. The article doesn't mention this. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Influential figure who helped her diverge from mom's style, mentioned before TV special. The article says Kay Thompson helped her develop distinct style, and then mentions the TV special. So answer is Kay Thompson.

12. **Question 12:** Central focus of documentary despite detours. The documentary is about Liza Minnelli, so the answer is Liza Minnelli.

13. **Question 13:** Hollywood star in 1946 article alongside baby photos. The article mentions Judy Garland's image with baby Liza, so answer is Judy Garland.

14. **Question 14:** Film receiving scant attention, "eyebrow-raising" contrast. The article says "New York, New York" gets short shrift. Answer is "New York, New York".

15. **Question 15:** Burden during childhood per Gerald Clarke. The article states "being on permanent death watch" as her heaviest burden. Answer is "being on permanent death watch".

16. **Question 16:** Year of early film appearance with famous star's hand. The article mentions 1949 film "In the Good Old Summertime" where she held her mother's hand. Answer is 1949.

17. **Question 17:** Term for diverse visual sources used. The article says "archival material -- culled from films, television, newsreels and the like". The term used is "archival material".

18. **Question 18:** Event after opening that symbolically distances from past. The article says the documentary opens on her mother's death, which is the pivot. The event is her mother's death (1969).

19. **Question 19:** Premature death bringing relief, mentioned in documentary framing. The article says Garland's death brought relief because of her troubled past. Answer is Judy Garland.

20. **Question 20:** Film upheld as success benchmark vs. another's failure. The article contrasts "Cabaret" and "New York, New York", with the latter flopping. So the benchmark is "Cabaret".
