Okay, I need to answer these 18 questions based strictly on the given article. Let me go through each one carefully.

1. **Date of crisis specialist contacting Lively's team:** The article mentions the specialist was hired for a "retaliation campaign" but doesn't give a specific date. So N/A.

2. **Number of journalists in court:** The text says the courtroom was full of journalists but doesn't specify a number. N/A.

3. **PR executive who sent "bury her" message:** The article quotes a publicist's text: "he wants to feel like she can be buried." But it doesn't name the sender. N/A.

4. **Duration of the hearing:** The article doesn't mention how long the hearing lasted. N/A.

5. **Who leaked footage first:** The text says Baldoni's team released it alongside Freedman's statements. No mention of prior leaks. N/A.

6. **Percentage of scenes reshot:** No data on scenes reshot. N/A.

7. **Media outlet with full text messages:** The article says NYT reported using excerpts but didn't publish the full exchange. N/A.

8. **Ryan Reynolds' role in filing complaint:** The complaint was filed by Lively, no mention of Reynolds. N/A.

9. **Contact attempts before counter-lawsuit:** The article doesn't state how many times they tried. N/A.

10. **Conditions for document release:** The judge ordered lawyers to follow ethics, but Baldoni's website already published docs. No specific conditions mentioned. N/A.

11. **State's civil rights department:** The complaint was filed with California's Civil Rights Department. Answer is California.

12. **Acronym for Lively's approach:** The article says Baldoni's team called her strategy DARVO. Wait, actually, the article says Lively's legal team called Baldoni's strategy DARVO. Let me check: "Freedman read statements from Lively's team describing Baldoni's suit as using DARVO." So the question asks which acronym Baldoni's team used to describe Lively's approach. But according to the text, it's the other way around. Since the question is about Baldoni's team's reference, maybe it's not mentioned. Wait, the article says Lively's team used DARVO to describe Baldoni's strategy. The question asks what Baldoni's team referenced to describe Lively's approach. The answer would be N/A because they didn't use that acronym. Wait, the text says: "Mr. Freedman also read aloud statements from Ms. Lively's legal team, including one that described Mr. Baldoni's lawsuit as employing a strategy associated with harassment called DARVO..." So Baldoni's team didn't use that acronym themselves; Lively's did. Therefore, the answer would be N/A because the question asks what Justin Baldoni's legal team referenced. So N/A.

Wait, but the question says "according to statements made during the Manhattan hearing" â€” the article says that Lively's team mentioned DARVO. So Baldoni's team's statements might not have used that term. So the answer is N/A.

13. **Third-party entity orchestrating smear campaign:** The article says the PR team was hired by Wayfarer, but doesn't name a specific third-party company. N/A.

14. **Ryan Reynolds' demand in negotiations:** The article states Reynolds and Lively are accused of extortion to "extract concessions and creative control." The exact demand isn't specified. N/A.

15. **California agency investigation:** The initial complaint was filed with the California Civil Rights Department. So that's the agency. Answer: California Civil Rights Department.

16. **Number of text messages cited:** The article mentions "text messages" but doesn't specify the count. N/A.

17. **Contractual clause violated:** The article mentions workplace safety breaches but doesn't name a specific clause. N/A.

18. **Hollywood guild's arbitration:** The article doesn't mention any guild arbitration before federal court. N/A.

Now, I'll go through each question again to confirm:

1. N/A (no date)
2. N/A (no number)
3. N/A (no name)
4. N/A (no duration)
5. N/A (Baldoni's team released it, but prior leak not mentioned)
6. N/A (no percentage)
7. N/A (no outlet named)
8. N/A (no role for Reynolds)
9. N/A (no count)
10. N/A (no conditions stated)
11. California
12. N/A (Baldoni's team didn't use DARVO, Lively's did)
13. N/A (no third-party name)
14. N/A (no explicit demand listed)
15. California Civil Rights Department
16. N/A (no number)
17. N/A (no clause name)
18. N/A (no guild mentioned)

Wait for question 12: The article says that Lively's team used the term DARVO to describe Baldoni's lawsuit strategy. The question is asking what acronym Baldoni's legal team used to describe Lively's approach. Since the article doesn't mention Baldoni's team using DARVO, the answer is N/A. So yes, N/A.

Question 15: The initial complaint was filed with the California Civil Rights Department. So the answer is California.

Question 12's answer is N/A.

Alright, I think that's all. Now I'll format the answers as required.
