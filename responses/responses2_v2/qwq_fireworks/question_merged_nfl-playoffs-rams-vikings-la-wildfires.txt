Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and don't infer anything beyond what's stated.

1. **Question 1:** The total cost of emergency paint supplies. The article mentions 200 gallons of paint were needed, but it doesn't specify the cost. So, answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Number of Rams season ticket holders who transferred tickets. The text says season-ticket holders got first chance to buy seats, but no number is given. N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Which Cardinals executive coordinated medical and childcare. The article mentions Michael Bidwill sent planes, but not specifically about medical or childcare. N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Final attendance figure. The article states 52,000 seats sold in two hours, then the rest by the public, but doesn't give the total attendance. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Hours for ESPN trucks from Kingman to Glendale. The trucks were in Kingman, then turned around from Ontario, CA. No time mentioned. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Percentage of custom-mixed colors. The article says 9 custom colors were needed, but doesn't state the percentage. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Number of Melon Heads fans. The Pages are part of the group but no number given. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Total refund value for canceled tickets. The article says ticket holders could get refunds or credits, but no monetary value stated. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Emergency personnel reassigned. The article doesn't mention this. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Total relocation cost. No figures provided. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** How the $5M donation influenced the decision. The text mentions the donation but doesn't link it to the relocation decision. N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Precedent with 49ers and Ford Field. The article says in 2022, Buffalo Bills played in Detroit due to snow, and 49ers moved to Arizona during pandemic. Wait, the 49ers moved to Arizona in 2022? Let me check again. The article says: "During the pandemic, outbreaks in locker rooms forced the league to postpone several games, though none were canceled. When pandemic conditions in Santa Clara County, Calif., deteriorated, the San Francisco 49ers moved to Arizona for a month, playing three home games in State Farm Stadium." So Ford Field was for the Bills. The 49ers example is moving to Arizona. The question asks about a precedent involving 49ers and Ford Field? Wait, the question says "San Francisco 49ers and Ford Field in 2022" â€“ but the article says 49ers moved to Arizona (State Farm), not Detroit. So that's a mistake. Therefore, the correct precedent is the 2022 Buffalo Bills in Detroit. But the question specifically asks about 49ers and Ford Field, which the article doesn't mention. So answer N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Rams player evacuated. The article mentions some players and staff evacuated homes, but no specific player named. N/A.

Wait for question 12 again. Let me recheck. The user's question 12 says: "What precedent involving the San Francisco 49ers and Ford Field in 2022 was referenced..." The article says the 49ers moved to Arizona (State Farm Stadium) during the pandemic, but Ford Field was for the Bills in 2022. Since the 49ers didn't go to Ford Field, the answer is N/A. The article's example with the 49ers is moving to Arizona, not Detroit. So the question's premise is wrong, so answer N/A.
