Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I'm only using the information from the provided article and not anything else. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The exact time interval between the two electrical faults detected by Whisker Labs' sensors. The article mentions that the video showed flashes at 6:10 p.m. and another three seconds later. The Whisker Labs data coincided with these, so the interval is 3 seconds. That should be the answer.

2. **Question 2**: The number of homes destroyed in the Hurst fire. The article says the Hurst fire burned 800 acres but doesn't mention the number of homes. So it's N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Employees who lost homes in the Hurst fire. The text mentions 19 employees lost homes in the Eaton fire, not Hurst. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The specific equipment damage linked to arcing. The article says they found signs of damage from arcing on some inactive equipment. So "arcing damage".

5. **Question 5**: The day when technicians saw the flashes during power restoration. The article states on Jan. 19, they tested equipment and noticed flashes. So January 19.

6. **Question 6**: The utility under review for both fires. The article says Edison's equipment might be linked to both Eaton and Hurst fires. So Southern California Edison.

7. **Question 7**: The Maryland company providing sensor data. It's Whisker Labs.

8. **Question 8**: Where arcing damage was found. The text mentions signs of arcing on inactive equipment near the substation several miles from the origin. Wait, the exact location? The article says "near a substation several miles from the origin point of the Eaton fire". So the answer would be "near a substation several miles from the origin point".

9. **Question 9**: Wind speed during the night. The article says winds reached roughly 100 mph. So 100 mph.

10. **Question 10**: The media outlet that released the video. The New York Times is mentioned.

11. **Question 11**: Action taken on the afternoon of the fire. Edison cut power to three distribution circuits in Kinneloa Mesa.

12. **Question 12**: Estimated financial loss by Verisk. The article states up to $10 billion.

13. **Question 13**: Executive who acknowledged employee losses. Pedro Pizarro, as he mentioned 19 employees lost homes.

14. **Question 14**: Month of the incidents. The fires started on Jan. 7, and the review was in January. So January.

Wait, let me check each again:

For question 8, the article says "electrical faults at 6:11 p.m. Jan. 7 on the transmission line near a substation several miles from the origin point of the Eaton fire. It seemed a mystery... arcing damage on some inactive equipment." The question asks where they detected arcing damage on inactive equipment. The answer is "near a substation several miles from the origin point" of the fire.

Yes, that's correct. 

All others seem okay. Let me confirm each answer against the text again quickly.

1. 3 seconds (from the video's three-second interval)
2. N/A (Hurst fire's destruction count isn't given)
3. N/A (Hurst vs Eaton)
4. arcing damage
5. Jan 19
6. Southern California Edison
7. Whisker Labs
8. near a substation several miles from the origin point
9. 100 mph
10. The New York Times
11. cut power to three distribution circuits in Kinneloa Mesa
12. $10 billion
13. Pedro Pizarro
14. January

Yes, that's all covered in the text. I think that's all correct.
