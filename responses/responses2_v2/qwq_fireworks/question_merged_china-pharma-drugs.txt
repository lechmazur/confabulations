Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any external knowledge. Let me start with the first question.

1. **Question 1:** Which foreign pharmaceutical company's blood pressure medication was specifically cited by Dr. Lu Changlin as being more effective than domestic alternatives?

Looking through the article, I see Dr. Lu Changlin submitted a proposal, but the text mentions his proposal was about not forcing the use of procurement list drugs. There's no specific mention of a foreign company's blood pressure medication he cited. The article does mention Bayer's Avelox antibiotic, but that's from Dr. Li Xiang. So, N/A here.

2. **Question 2:** How many doctors reported adverse reactions to domestically produced anesthetics in Shanghai hospitals during the first five years of the procurement system?

The article states a Shanghai surgeon mentioned anesthetics not working, but there's no number given for how many doctors reported this. The first five years' data is about cost savings, not specific numbers of reports. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** What percentage reduction in efficacy did Dr. Xia Zhimin's data analysis reveal when comparing original drugs to their generic counterparts?

The article says Dr. Xia found "too many similarities" in trial data, leading to fraud suspicions, but no specific percentage is mentioned. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Which Chinese province achieved the highest cost savings through the volume-based procurement system according to the Healthcare Security Administration's regional breakdown?

The article mentions the system saved over $50 billion over five years but doesn't specify provinces or which had the highest. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** What was the total monetary value of foreign-branded drugs excluded from the 2023 national health insurance list?

The article says foreign drugs were largely absent but doesn't provide a monetary value. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** How many patients experienced complications from the antibiotics that Dr. Zheng Minhua mentioned caused allergies?

Dr. Zheng gave examples like antibiotics causing allergies, but no number of patients is provided. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** What regulatory changes did the Shanghai medical community propose to address quality concerns before the National Healthcare Security Administration's investigation?

The proposal mentioned was allowing patients to choose branded drugs not on the list, with insurance adjustments. So the answer is allowing patients to use original branded drugs even if not on the list, adjusting insurance reimbursement.

8. **Question 8:** According to Dr. Li Xiang's clinical observations, what was the failure rate of domestic generic medications compared to their imported counterparts?

The article states Dr. Li couldn't find an imported drug needed but no failure rate data. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Which international pharmaceutical quality standards were cited by the National Medical Products Administration in their response to the duplicated trial data?

The response from the administration mentioned "editing errors" but didn't cite specific international standards. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** What percentage of private clinics in China reported maintaining stocks of foreign-branded medications after the procurement policy changes?

The article says private clinics have easier access but doesn't give a percentage. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Which government agency, tasked with overseeing national medical insurance, was reported to have sent officials to Shanghai to review clinical data and meet with doctors following the quality concerns over domestic generics?

The article says the National Healthcare Security Administration sent officials. So that's the answer.

12. **Question 12:** Who is the medical professional that, by comparing clinical trial reports down to two decimal places, suggested that the trial data for domestic generics might have been duplicated due to editing errors?

Dr. Xia Zhimin is mentioned as noting exact numbers to two decimals, pointing to possible fraud. The administration later said it was editing errors. So Dr. Xia Zhimin.

13. **Question 13:** Which hospital role from a leading Shanghai institution expressed worry that the low-price drugs—citing examples such as antibiotics that can trigger allergies and blood pressure medicine that may not function properly—might be compromised in quality?

Dr. Zheng Minhua, director of surgery at Ruijin Hospital, gave those examples. So his role is director of surgery at Ruijin Hospital.

14. **Question 14:** Which government procurement mechanism, known for cutting costs by promoting domestic generics and saving over $50 billion in five years, was criticized for limiting access to imported drugs like the one branded by Bayer?

The article refers to the volume-based procurement system. Bayer's Avelox is mentioned as an example of an imported drug not available. So volume-based procurement.

15. **Question 15:** Who is the individual, formerly linked with a prominent online health platform, that went so far as to accuse domestic drug manufacturers of fraud in the wake of the rising quality concerns?

The article mentions a former editor at Ding Xiang Doctor (a health platform), which is Dr. Xia Zhimin. Wait, no, the former editor is Dr. Xia? Let me check. The article says: "Xia Zhimin, a doctor at Hangzhou Hospital... former deputy editor in chief of Ding Xiang Doctor..." So yes, Dr. Xia Zhimin is the one who accused fraud.

Wait, but the first part of the article says "a former editor at a leading online health platform went as far as to accuse domestic drugmakers of fraud." The name there isn't given, but later Dr. Xia is the one who found data issues. So maybe the former editor is Dr. Xia. So the answer is Xia Zhimin.

16. **Question 16:** Which policy, put into effect in 2018 that guarantees higher volumes for cheaper drug providers, has led to a surge in domestic generics that some doctors now claim have unreliable quality?

The policy is the volume-based procurement system, mentioned as starting in 2018. So that's the answer.

17. **Question 17:** Who, serving as the head of cardiology at Beijing Chaoyang Hospital and a member of the Communist Party, proposed that patients and doctors should not be compelled to use drugs solely from the government procurement list?

The article mentions Dr. Lu Changlin as head of cardiology there, proposing that. So Lu Changlin.

18. **Question 18:** Which nation's government is responsible for the cost-cutting campaign and centralized bidding system that has resulted in a dominant presence of domestic generics in public hospitals?

The article is about China's policies. So China.

19. **Question 19:** Which type of medical facility is noted in the article as providing patients with easier access to a broader selection of medications, including imported foreign brands, contrasting with the limitations found in public hospitals?

The article says private clinics have easier access. So private clinics.

20. **Question 20:** Which medical professional, mentioned in the context of duplicated clinical trial numbers and posting on social media, indicated that the identical two-decimal-place figures in the trials of domestic generics undermined patient trust?

That's Dr. Xia Zhimin again, as he compared the data and found exact numbers. So Xia Zhimin.
