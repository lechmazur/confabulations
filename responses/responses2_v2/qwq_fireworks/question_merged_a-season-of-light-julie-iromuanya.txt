Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. The question asks how Fidelis's reaction to Amara applying lipstick directly leads to his joining the Biafran veterans' battalion. The article mentions he becomes fixated on the Biafran sovereignty after hearing about the abducted schoolgirls. But does it directly link the lipstick to joining the battalion? The article says his fixation on the girls' abduction leads to his mental decline and contact with the veterans. The lipstick reaction is part of his controlling behavior towards Amara, but maybe the connection is that the abduction news made him revisit his past, leading to both the battalion contact and the actions against Amara. But the question specifically asks how the lipstick reaction leads to joining the battalion. Hmm. The article says "the news that 276 schoolgirls have been abducted... he can't help revisiting the war... getting in contact with the veterans." The lipstick incident is a result of his fear for Amara, but the joining the battalion is due to the news, not directly the lipstick. So maybe the answer is N/A?

2. The albino pastor's ritual. The article says Adaobi joins the congregation of an albino pastor who "has a penchant for slapping his parishioners." The question asks about a specific ritual involving physical contact during her first visit. The text doesn't mention a specific ritual, just that he slaps people. So maybe the answer is "slapping parishioners," but the question is about a ritual she performs. Since it's the pastor's action, not hers, maybe N/A?

3. The item from Ugochi that mirrors Amara's. The article says Fidelis thinks Amara resembles his sister Ugochi. The box in the attic has his past, including Ugochi's disappearance. The article mentions he destroys Amara's lipstick, leggings, etc. But is there an item of Ugochi's that matches Amara's belongings? The text says Amara's appearance reminds him of Ugochi, not an object. So maybe the answer is N/A.

4. The traumatic news event that caused Fidelis to revisit his past. The article clearly states it's the abduction of the 276 schoolgirls in Nigeria. So answer is "the abduction of 276 schoolgirls in Nigeria."

5. The incident that caused both his mental decline and losing their home. The same event, the schoolgirls' abduction, led to his mental decline, which led to losing his job and the home. So the answer is the same as question 4, "the abduction of 276 schoolgirls in Nigeria."

6. The connection between Ugochi's disappearance and controlling Amara. The article says Fidelis fears Amara because she resembles Ugochi, leading him to control her. So the implied connection is that her resemblance triggers his fear of losing her like Ugochi. Answer: "her resemblance to Ugochi."

7. Fidelis's past as a child soldier linked to Biafran nationalism. He was a child soldier in the Biafran war, so his past as a prisoner of war and the trauma from that war link to the veterans' group advocating Biafran sovereignty. The answer is his experience as a child soldier and prisoner of war during the Biafran War.

8. Consequence of parents keeping trauma secret. The article states that silence causes the most devastating fracture. So the answer is "the most devastating fracture of all."

9. Development in Fidelis's career mirroring their social collapse. He took an indefinite leave from his firm, leading to losing their home. So the career development is being asked to take indefinite leave.

10. 2014 event that reignited wartime memories. The article starts in late spring 2014 with the schoolgirls' abduction. So the answer is the Chibok kidnappings (abduction of schoolgirls).

11. Amara's resemblance to Ugochi. The text says "his daughter bears an uncanny resemblance to Ugochi," so the specific resemblance is her appearance.

12. Symbolic act showing his control. He destroys her lipstick, cuts her clothes, etc. The symbolic act is "crushed the lipstick, cut holes in leggings, poured bleach on camisoles, threw her phone, locked her door."

13. Theme illustrated by Fidelis's reaction. The theme is how repressed trauma and silence lead to family disintegration. The article mentions "silence that causes the most devastating fracture."

Now, checking each answer against the text for exactness.

1. The question links lipstick reaction to joining the battalion. The text says the abduction news led to his contact with the veterans. The lipstick incident is his reaction to Amara's maturity, but the joining the group is due to the news. So no direct link between lipstick and joining. So N/A.

2. The pastor's ritual: the article says he has a penchant for slapping, but the question is about a ritual Adaobi performed. Since the text doesn't mention her doing a ritual, N/A.

3. No item mentioned, only appearance. N/A.

4. Correct answer is the abduction.

5. Same as 4.

6. The resemblance.

7. His past as a child soldier (prisoner of war).

8. Silence causing fracture.

9. Indefinite leave from firm.

10. Chibok kidnappings (2014 event).

11. Appearance.

12. The acts listed (crushing lipstick etc. are the symbolic acts).

13. Silence leading to family fracture.

Okay, that should cover all questions.
