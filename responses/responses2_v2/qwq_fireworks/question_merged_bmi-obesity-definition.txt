Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge.

1. The first question asks how many of the 18 obesity-related conditions require immediate intervention for someone with a BMI of 30. The article mentions that those with any of the 18 conditions (13 for kids) need treatment. But the question is specifically about BMI 30. Wait, the article says that people with BMI over 25 and excess fat but healthy are pre-clinical. The ones needing treatment are those with the conditions, regardless of BMI. However, the question is about BMI 30. But the article doesn't specify the exact BMI cutoff for requiring intervention based on the conditions. The only specific BMI mentioned for automatic clinical obesity is 40. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question is about the 18 conditions listed. The article says if they have any of the 18, they require treatment. But the question is about someone with BMI 30. Since the 18 are the conditions, not tied to BMI, but the answer is the number of conditions. Wait, the question says "explicitly named as requiring immediate intervention for individuals with a B.M.I. of 30?" The article doesn't list the specific conditions, so we can't count how many. So answer N/A.

2. The second question asks which pharmaceutical company's drug was excluded because of pre-clinical criteria. The article mentions Wegovy and Zepbound as drugs, but the commission's recommendations might affect their use. However, the question says which was excluded. The commission suggested restricting drugs to clinical obesity. The article doesn't say any specific company was excluded. So N/A.

3. Dr. Jessup from the American Heart Association mentions struggling with defining ideal and sick weight. The question is which biomarker they considered replacing BMI with before endorsing the report. The article says the commission's approach fits with the AHA's stance, but the text doesn't mention any alternative biomarker they considered before. So N/A.

4. The minimum BMI for automatic clinical obesity in pediatric patients without further analysis. The article states that those with BMI 40 or over are clinical without further assessment. But for pediatric, the 13 conditions are mentioned, but the BMI cutoff is the same? The article says "for pediatric patients" but the 40 cutoff applies to all? Wait, the article says "those with a B.M.I. of 40 or greater have clinical obesity on the basis of their B.M.I. alone". It doesn't mention a different cutoff for pediatric. So the answer is 40.

5. Which of the 13 adolescent conditions is linked to irreversible organ damage. The article lists conditions like breathlessness, heart failure, hip/knee pain, metabolic abnormalities, and poorly functioning organs. But the question is which one in the 13 specifically leads to irreversible damage. The article doesn't specify which one, so N/A.

6. How does pre-clinical obesity conflict with WHO's metabolic syndrome? The article doesn't mention WHO's stance on metabolic syndrome. So N/A.

7. The percentage of body fat via DEXA for threshold. The article mentions DEXA as a tool but doesn't give a specific percentage. So N/A.

8. Which commission member disagreed about excluding psychological disorders. The article mentions Dr. Rubino and Dr. Jessup, Dr. Nathan, Dr. Cummings. The text doesn't say anyone disagreed on depression. So N/A.

9. Demographic group with highest discrepancy between BMI and waist measurements. The article says waist measurements are often done incorrectly, but no specific group mentioned. N/A.

10. Waist measurement threshold for men with BMI over 40. The article states that for men, the threshold is 40 inches. Even with BMI 40, that's the waist measurement, so 40 inches.

11. Imaging technique as X-ray variant is DEXA scan. The article says DEXA scans, a type of X-ray. So answer DEXA scan.

12. Women's waist circumference indicator: the article says 34.6 inches for women. So that's the answer.

13. The expert from Massachusetts, skeptical about waist measurements, compared to hypertension. Dr. Nathan is at Massachusetts General. He said it's unrealistic to wait until complications, comparing to hypertension leading to stroke. So he is the one. Answer Dr. David M. Nathan.

14. Commission leader consulting for drug companies: Dr. Rubino is the chair and consults for makers. So answer Dr. Francesco Rubino.

15. Term for BMI over 25 with excess fat but no illness: pre-clinical obesity. The article says "pre-clinical obesity".

16. Endorsing organization: American Heart Association.

17. Health event cited as reason for not waiting: the article quotes Dr. Nathan comparing to hypertension not waiting until stroke. So the event is stroke.

18. Journalist's name: Gina Kolata.

19. BMI where no further assessment needed: 40, as stated in the article.
