Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I'll go through each question and check the article for the answers. 

1. **Question 1:** How many paper boats did Tia Xia use to try to catch up to the children after Jorge's electrical surge?  
The article says when Tia Xia appears, she climbs into one of the other boats. There were three paper boats initially. Since Jorge and the others were in one, she took another. So the answer should be 1? Wait, the question is about how many boats she used. It says "one of the other boats", so she used one. Answer: 1.

2. **Question 2:** What type of weapon did Alfonso use to help escape the ironclad?  
The text mentions Alfonso is a drummer boy. It doesn't say he used a weapon. Maybe the cousins used the sword? The question specifies Alfonso. Since he's a drummer, maybe he didn't use a weapon. Answer: N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Precious metal the sword was made of.  
The sword is described as diamond-encrusted. The metal itself isn't specified, but maybe the blade is steel? The text doesn't mention the metal, only the diamonds. So answer: N/A. Wait, the question says "primarily made of". Since it's a sword, maybe steel, but the article doesn't specify. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Animal Camila read about that aided navigation.  
The article says Camila was reading an animal book, but it doesn't specify which animal helped them. So answer: N/A.
