Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and answer exactly as per the instructions. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks which Comedy Central host Roy Wood Jr. directly replaced after leaving The Daily Show. The article mentions that Comedy Central went with a rotating cast of hosts before bringing back Jon Stewart on Mondays. But it doesn't say Wood replaced anyone directly. So the answer should be N/A.

2. Question 2: How many scripts has Roy sold? The article says he sold a few scripts according to NPR. "A few" is vague, so since the exact number isn't given, the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe "a few" is considered an answer? The instructions say to use only direct facts. Since it's not a specific number, it's N/A.

3. Question 3: Percentage decline in interaction? The article references Derek Thompson's "The Anti-Social Century" which uses facts and stats, but Wood's special doesn't cite a specific percentage. So N/A.

4. Question 4: Which presidential candidate did Wood endorse? The article says the special isn't directly about Trump but captures the culture that gave him victory. No endorsement mentioned, so N/A.

5. Question 5: Grocery store chain where he worked as a greeter? The text says he mentions greeters whose job was to say hello, but doesn't name a specific chain. So N/A.

6. Question 6: Minutes into the special where he reveals the title's meaning? The article doesn't mention a specific time, so N/A.

7. Question 7: Statistical evidence Wood presented about self-checkout and isolation? The article says he doesn't use stats, so N/A.

8. Question 8: Comedian who influenced him? The article compares his delivery to Bill Cosby's, but not as an influence. It says he's a correspondent on The Daily Show, but no primary influence named. So N/A.

9. Question 9: Salary figure told to his mom? The article doesn't mention a specific number, so N/A.

10. Question 10: Number of CNN episodes aired? The article only says he's hosting a CNN panel show, but no episode count. N/A.

11. Question 11: Comedian who blends political commentary with essays? The article says Wood's comedy is like a magazine essay, so the answer is Roy Wood Jr.

12. Question 12: Days before Trump's return the special premiered? The first sentence says three days before Trump becomes president again. So 3.

13. Question 13: Retail role symbolizing lost interaction? The cashier and self-checkout are mentioned, so "cashier" or "greeter"? The article says the cashier is the main example, so "cashier".

14. Question 14: Hosting opportunity he humorously implied? The article says he thought he'd take over The Daily Show from Trevor Noah, so "The Daily Show host".

15. Question 15: Employee role where Black customers had an employee follow them? The article mentions greeters, and specifically says "if you were Black because they had an employee who followed you around." So the role is "greeter".

16. Question 16: Tech system criticized for reducing service? Self-checkout machines.

17. Question 17: Comedian who did a set on Musk and MAGA? The article mentions Josh Johnson did a set on Elon Musk and MAGA tensions. So Josh Johnson.

18. Question 18: Stylistic quality blending personal with social commentary? The article says he uses specificity and emotion, making you forget it's standup. The answer might be "specificity and emotion" or "sentimental love story with a pivot". The question asks for the quality introduced, which the article says is "surprising shifts" and "pivot". The exact term used is "pivot", so maybe "surprising shifts" or "pivot".

19. Question 19: Veteran comedian's mannerism evoked? The article compares his animated delivery to Bill Cosby. So Bill Cosby.

20. Question 20: Divisive emblem referenced? The article says he joked about removing the Confederate flag to identify dangerous white people. So Confederate flag.
