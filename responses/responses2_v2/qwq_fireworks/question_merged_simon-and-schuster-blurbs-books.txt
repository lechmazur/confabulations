Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks how many books the Substack post author read for the memorial to Belinda Blurb. Wait, the article mentions a memorial to the author's father, a linguist and translator. The Eritrean novella was part of that memorial. The text says the author managed only two books all year on their list. But the memorial's name isn't Belinda Blurb; Belinda Blurb is the fictional character from the book "Are You a Bromide?" So the question might be mixing up names. Since the memorial is for the father, not Belinda Blurb, the answer is N/A because the question's premise is wrong.

2. **Question 2:** The author mentions encountering conspiracy theories when judging prizes. The example given is " fluoride conspiracy theories or say something sexist, or just suck." The question asks what kind of conspiracy theories, so fluoride is the specific one mentioned here.

3. **Question 3:** The question asks what kind of book is lauded by both Stephen King and Louise Penny and endorsed by experts. The text says that Stephen King and Louise Penny's blurbs indicate a different type than others. But the endorsed by experts part refers to nonfiction. So maybe it's nonfiction? Wait, the author says for nonfiction, they want to know the experts' endorsements. The question combines both blurbs and endorsement. The answer might be nonfiction, but the exact type isn't specified. Wait, the question is asking for the type of book that is both blurbed by those authors and endorsed by experts. Since the nonfiction part is where experts matter, perhaps it's a nonfiction book. But the blurbs from King and Penny might be for fiction. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A because the text doesn't directly state the genre. Wait, the author says "in the case of nonfiction, I want to know... endorsed by respected experts." So maybe the book in question is nonfiction, but the blurbs from King and Penny would be for a different category. The question is a bit confusing. Since the example given for nonfiction is a physician's advice book, maybe that's the case. But the question combines both blurbs and endorsement. Since the text doesn't explicitly name a book type that fits both, maybe N/A? Or is it a trick question where the answer is nonfiction? Let me check again. The question says "endorsed by respected experts in the field" which is for nonfiction. So the book would be nonfiction, but the blurbs from King and Penny would be for a different genre. The question might be a trick because those authors are fiction writers. So perhaps the answer is N/A because there's no direct link. Alternatively, maybe the answer is a nonfiction book. Hmm, not sure. Let me think again. The text says "in the case of nonfiction, I want to know that, say, this physician author's advice has been endorsed by respected experts in the field." So the example is a nonfiction book. The question's first part is about a book blurbed by Stephen King and Louise Penny (probably fiction), but the second part is about nonfiction. The question is asking what kind of book is both blurbed by those authors and has expert endorsements. Since those authors are fiction writers, their blurbs wouldn't be on nonfiction. So the question's premise might be conflicting. Therefore, the answer is N/A because the two parts don't align.

4. **Question 4:** The Eritrean novella is mentioned in the context of the author trying to read it but being distracted by blurb obligations. The question links it to Simon & Schuster's decision. However, the publisher's decision was mentioned as coming "just weeks after" the author's Substack post. The novella itself isn't named in the text. So the answer is N/A because the title isn't provided.

5. **Question 5:** When the publisher over-asked, the author's blurb was relegated to Amazon. The question asks which online bookseller, so the answer is Amazon.

6. **Question 6:** Scott Turow's other novel with Rusty Sabich. The article mentions "Presumed Innocent" and "Presumed Guilty." The question asks for another novel. The text only mentions those two, so N/A because there's no other mentioned.

7. **Question 7:** The father of the Substack author (Rebecca Makkai) was a linguist and translator. The question asks for his profession, so linguist and translator.

8. **Question 8:** The author made one exception (for a friend) but realized it could lead to 50. The question asks how many exceptions she made that year. The text says she made one exception.

9. **Question 9:** The fictional character from Gelett Burgess's book is Belinda Blurb.

10. **Question 10:** The year she decided the "no blurbs" policy was 2023, as mentioned in the article.
