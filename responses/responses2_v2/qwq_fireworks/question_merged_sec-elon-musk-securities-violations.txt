Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article and answer exactly what's asked without any extra fluff. Let's start with question 1.

1. Which hedge fund was responsible for founding DeepSeek? The article mentions "DeepSeek's Rise: The little-known artificial intelligence firm has emphasized research, even as it emerged as the brainchild of a hedge fund." So the hedge fund is the one that's the brainchild behind DeepSeek. The answer is the hedge fund mentioned here, but the name isn't given. Wait, the question says "according to the article's discussion of artificial intelligence companies". The article states that DeepSeek was the brainchild of a hedge fund, but the name of the hedge fund isn't specified. So the answer is N/A because the name isn't provided.

2. How much did Musk's broker pay in legal fees? The article says Musk's broker warned his financial manager to seek legal advice. But there's no mention of the broker paying any legal fees. The $3,000 was Musk paying the SEC for travel, not the broker. So N/A.

3. Stock price increase between January and disclosure in April. The article states that after Musk disclosed his stake, the stock shot up over 27%. The question is between initial purchases in January and his April disclosure. The 27% is after disclosure, but does that mean the increase from before disclosure? The article says "after he announced his position, Twitter's stock shot up more than 27 percent." So the increase after disclosure was over 27%, but the question is between his initial purchases and his disclosure. The article doesn't mention the price before he started buying, just the jump after disclosure. So N/A because the total increase from January to April isn't given except the post-disclosure jump. Wait, maybe the question is asking for the 27% mentioned. The wording says "between initial purchases and disclosure"—the 27% was after disclosure, so that's not the period in question. So N/A.

4. Who did Trump nominate to lead the CFPB? The article says Trump nominated Paul Atkins to succeed Gensler at the SEC. The CFPB isn't mentioned here. The question is about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The article says "the S.E.C. and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have filed a flurry of lawsuits..." but doesn't mention who Trump nominated for CFPB. So N/A.

5. Percentage of privacy staff remaining after restructuring. The article says the FTC investigated whether X had resources after Musk laid off much staff and several senior execs for privacy/security resigned. But it doesn't state a percentage remaining. So N/A.

6. Number of meetings Musk attended at Mar-a-Lago. The article says he's been at Mar-a-Lago almost every day since the election, attending meetings and events. But the exact number isn't given. So N/A.

7. Settlement amount proposed before rejection. The article mentions a letter from Spiro rejecting a settlement offer but doesn't specify the amount. So N/A.

8. Federal judge during Trump's first term. The previous cases against Musk during Trump's first term—first lawsuit was during Trump's first term. The article says in October 2023, the SEC sued to force testimony, and a federal judge in SF denied sanctions. But the first case's judge isn't named. So N/A.

9. Paul Atkins' role in the task force. The article says Trump appointed Musk as co-chair of a task force that Atkins aims to cut the budget. Wait, Paul Atkins is the nominee for SEC chair, not directly related to the task force. The task force's development role isn't specified for Atkins. So N/A.

10. Number of shareholders in the class action. The article mentions former shareholders sued Musk but doesn't state the number. So N/A.

11. Underpaid amount due to delayed disclosure. The SEC says he underpaid by at least $150 million. So answer is $150 million.

12. Days after surpassing threshold before filing. Musk passed 5% in mid-March, disclosed on April 4. The time between March mid and April 4 is about 20 days? Wait the article says "he continued buying shares and did not disclose until April 4. The S.E.C. said he waited 11 days before filing." Wait, the article says "The complaint said he had waited 11 days before filing the required disclosure." Wait, the exact period after surpassing 5% (which is the threshold requiring disclosure) until he filed. The 11 days is the period he waited before filing. So the answer is 11 days.

13. Agency that subpoenaed before the recent lawsuit. The SEC sought to force Musk to comply with a subpoena for deposition before filing the recent lawsuit. The article says "Before filing the lawsuit on Tuesday, the S.E.C. had also sought to force Mr. Musk to comply with a subpoena..." So the answer is SEC.

14. Presidential figure with close advisory relationship. The article says Musk is a close adviser to President-elect Trump. So answer is Donald J. Trump.

15. Month Musk completed acquisition. The article states he completed the purchase that October (2022), then renamed to X. So October.

16. Attorney's surname who called it harassment. The lawyer Alex Spiro said the SEC's action was a "sham" and part of a harassment campaign. His surname is Spiro.

17. Percentage requiring disclosure. The 5% ownership threshold is mentioned. So 5%.

18. Sum Musk paid for travel expenses. The article says he agreed to pay almost $3,000. So $3,000.

19. Overseas location for medical treatment. The article mentions Antigua as where the unproven treatment was done. So Antigua.

20. Bid value Musk made. The purchase was $44 billion. The question asks for the specific bid value, which is stated as $44 billion.
