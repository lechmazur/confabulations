Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information given in the article and follow the instructions strictly. Let's start with the first question.

1. **Which Supreme Court justice authored the majority opinion that Ms. Diei's lawyers cited as precedent in their successful appeal?**
   - The article mentions the Supreme Court ruling in favor of a cheerleader's case, but it doesn't name the justice who wrote the opinion. So the answer is N/A.

2. **How many followers did Ms. Diei gain on Instagram between the initial complaint and the final settlement of her case?**
   - The article says her Instagram followers "stagnated at around 18,000, about where they were when she got into trouble." So she didn't gain any followers. The answer is 0?

   Wait, the question is "how many followers did she gain between the initial complaint and the settlement?" If they were at 18k when she got into trouble (which was when the complaint was made) and stayed the same, then the gain is zero. So answer is 0.

3. **What was the name of the anonymous student who filed the initial complaint about Ms. Diei's social media posts?**
   - The article states the complaint was anonymous, so the name isn't provided. N/A.

4. **During which semester of her pharmacy program did the university's conduct committee first review Ms. Diei's social media presence?**
   - The article says "a month after Kimberly Diei enrolled... the college's professional conduct committee received an anonymous complaint." Since she enrolled as a new student, it would be her first semester. But the article doesn't specify if it's fall or spring. The answer is first semester, but the exact term isn't given. Wait, the question is asking for the semester (like "first" or "second"), so maybe "first" is acceptable. The article says "a month after enrolled," so it's the first semester. So answer is first semester. But maybe the answer is N/A if the article doesn't specify. Let me check again. The article says "a month after enrolled," but doesn't mention the semester. So maybe it's N/A? Hmm. Wait, the question says "during which semester," so the answer would be "first semester" because it was a month after enrollment. The article doesn't explicitly say, but logically, the first semester is the correct inference. Wait, the instructions say to infer if possible. Since she was enrolled a month before the complaint, the committee reviewed it in the first semester. So maybe answer is "first semester". But the article doesn't use the term "semester," so maybe it's N/A. Hmm. The article says "a month after enrolled," but the program's start isn't specified. So maybe N/A. The answer might be N/A because the article doesn't mention the semester, only the time since enrollment. So better to answer N/A.

5. **What percentage of Ms. Diei's current pharmacy customers at Walgreens inquire about sexual health products?**
   - The article states that she mentions "Viagra, sexual lubricants, condoms, all of that. I can't say every day somebody's asking me about sexual products, but it's fairly frequent across the age range." No percentage is given. So N/A.

6. **Who was the chairperson of the university's professional conduct committee that reviewed Ms. Diei's case?**
   - The article doesn't mention the name of the chairperson. N/A.

7. **What was the total amount of student loan debt Ms. Diei accumulated during her pharmacy program?**
   - The article doesn't provide this figure. N/A.

8. **On which social media platform did Ms. Diei post the rap lyrics that initially triggered the university's investigation?**
   - The article says her posts included "racy rap lyrics and tight dresses" on social media, but doesn't specify the platform. The only platform mentioned is Instagram in the later part about her followers. However, the initial complaint could be on another platform. Since it's not specified, N/A.

9. **What was the vote count of the appellate court judges who ruled that Ms. Diei's speech was protected by the First Amendment?**
   - The article states the appellate court found her speech was protected, but doesn't mention the vote count. N/A.

10. **How many days did the university give Ms. Diei to remove her social media posts before threatening expulsion?**
    - The article says the university threatened to expel her but doesn't specify a timeframe. N/A.

11. **If the anonymous complaint had been lodged by a fellow pharmacy student concerned about patient perceptions, mirroring the concerns of the Houston superintendent about structured teaching, how many years would Ms. Diei have been fighting the university in court at the time of her graduation?**
    - The article says she has graduated and has been fighting for four years. The hypothetical scenario doesn't change the duration stated. The answer is 4 years. Because the question is asking "how many years would she have been fighting at the time of graduation?" The article says she has already graduated and it's been four years. So the answer is 4.

12. **If Ms. Diei had chosen to invest her entire settlement in a pharmaceutical company specializing in sexual health products, mirroring Trump's efforts to cut diversity, what percentage of her followers would she need to convert into customers to double her investment, assuming an average customer spend of $50?**
    - This requires calculation. The settlement is $250k. To double it, she needs $500k. Each customer spends $50. So total customers needed: 500,000 / 50 = 10,000. She has 18,000 followers. So percentage needed: (10,000 / 18,000)*100 ≈55.56%. But the question is hypothetical and the article doesn't provide data on conversion rates. However, the question is asking what percentage she needs, not whether it's possible. Since the math can be done with given numbers, the answer is approximately 55.56%, but since the instructions require exact, maybe 55.56% or rounded? But the question says "how many years" for another question, but here it's a percentage. The article doesn't give follower numbers except 18k. So the calculation is possible. The answer would be (10,000/18,000)*100 ≈55.56%. But since the question says "percentage" and the article gives the follower count, this can be calculated. So answer is 55.56%. But the instructions say "prefer to respond in a sentence fragment or words, not in full sentences." Maybe "55.56%" or round to 56%. But since exact numbers are needed, maybe 55.56% is okay. However, the question might be a trick because it's a hypothetical scenario not in the article. Wait, the article doesn't mention anything about her investing, so the question is entirely hypothetical. The instructions say to answer based on the article. Since the article doesn't provide the necessary data except her follower count (18k) and the settlement amount ($250k). The calculation is possible using those numbers. So the answer is 55.56%, but since the question is about converting followers into customers, maybe the answer is 55.56% or 56%. But the instructions say to use only the text. Wait, but the question is a hypothetical, so maybe N/A? Because it's not in the article. Wait, the instructions say to answer based solely on the facts in the text. The hypothetical scenario isn't in the article, so even if the numbers are there, the question is asking for a calculation based on a hypothetical. The article doesn't state anything about her investing or customer conversion rates. So the answer is N/A. Because the scenario is not part of the article's facts. The question is outside the given data, so N/A.

13. **If the professional conduct committee had used the same criteria as the new group suing the University of California, what aspect of Ms. Diei's social media presence, beyond the content itself, might have been cited as grounds for expulsion, considering the committee's initial assessment of her posts?**
    - The new group suing UC is mentioned in the article as arguing the university is "cheating" in admissions, possibly related to race. The UC case is about race-based admissions. The committee's initial concern was vulgarity and professionalism. If using the UC criteria (which is about admissions policies), but the question is about Ms. Diei's case. The UC lawsuit is about admissions, not social media. Since the committee's criteria in the hypothetical would be about admissions policies (as per the UC case), but Ms. Diei's case is about social media content. The question is unclear. Since the UC case is about race, but the committee's criteria would have to relate to her social media. Maybe the UC group's criteria are about race, but that doesn't connect. Alternatively, maybe the UC case's criteria involve race, but the question asks what aspect beyond content (like race?) but the article doesn't link the UC case to her social media. Since the question is hypothetical and the UC case's criteria aren't detailed, the answer is N/A.

14. **Assuming Ms. Diei's experience led to a policy change at the University of Tennessee, similar to the changes in Houston's public schools, what form of student expression, beyond social media, might the university now regulate, given the concerns expressed in the anonymous complaint and the university's initial reaction?**
    - Houston's changes involve "strictly structured teaching" which the district says is working but educators and parents dislike. The article says the Houston superintendent is micromanaging classrooms. The university's concern was unprofessionalism in social media. If the policy change is similar to Houston's structured teaching, maybe the university would regulate dress codes (since her posts had "tight dresses") or other personal appearance aspects. The anonymous complaint was about her posts being vulgar and unprofessional, so perhaps dress codes or personal appearance in public? The answer would be dress codes or attire, but the article doesn't explicitly state this. However, the article mentions "tight dresses" as part of her posts, so maybe attire. So the answer could be "attire" or "clothing choices". Since the question asks for what form beyond social media, and the committee's concern was her posts' content (including dress), maybe the university would regulate dress codes. So answer: attire/clothing. The article mentions "tight dresses" as part of her posts, so the university might start regulating students' clothing in person. So answer: attire or clothing. The exact wording in the article is "tight dresses" so "clothing choices" or "attire".
