Okay, I need to tackle these questions based solely on the provided article. Let me go through each one carefully. 

1. The first question asks how many "shamrock-tinged family yarns" Tracey Lange has written, including "What Happened to the McCrays?", all featuring Claddagh rings and Belleek harps. The article mentions her previous novels "We Are the Brennans" and "The Connellys of County Down" as part of those family yarns. The current novel is her third, so that's three. Wait, but the question says "including 'What Happened to the McCrays?'" which is her third. So total would be three? Let me check the text again. The article says "her previous novels, 'We Are the Brennans' and 'The Connellys of County Down'..." so that's two previous, making the third the current one. But the question is how many including this one? So 3? But the article says "shamrock-tinged family yarns" are the previous ones, and the current is less about that. Wait the article states: "less about what those of us with the pedigree call 'professional Irish' and more about hardworking Americans..." So the current one isn't part of the shamrock-tinged ones. So the answer would be 2? Hmm, need to parse that. The question is asking for all including the current one that have those elements. Since the current one is less about them, maybe the answer is 2. The article says "her previous novels" had those elements, so the third one (current) isn't included. So the answer is 2. 

2. The second question is about Casey receiving a prestigious award from Potsdam for her community work. The article mentions she teaches, manages hockey, and helps her brother, but there's no mention of an award. So N/A.

3. Kyle joined a support group in Spokane after the loss. The text doesn't mention any support group's name, so N/A.

4. The car accident happened when Wyatt was 5. The article doesn't state the year, so N/A unless we can infer. Since Kyle is now in his late 30s (he was 39 when he left), but without knowing current age or year, can't calculate. So N/A.

5. Puffy outerwear isn't specified by brand. The article just mentions "puffy outerwear" generally, so N/A.

6. The fourth novel? The article lists three: "What Happened to the McCrays?" is the third. The previous two are the Brennans and Connellys. The question asks besides those two, what's the fourth? Wait, that can't be. The article says "third novel", so maybe the question is a trick. Since the third is the current one, the previous two are the only ones. So the answer is N/A because there's no fourth.

7. Danny's dog breed isn't mentioned. The article doesn't say, so N/A.

8. Kyle's vehicle as a mechanic. The article mentions his workplace is Railroad Avenue Car Care, but the specific vehicle isn't named. So N/A.

9. Ice cream flavor during reconciliation? The article doesn't mention any specific flavor in a pivotal scene, so N/A.

10. Snowmobile model for Wyatt's accident? Not mentioned, so N/A.

11. The auto mechanic who returned after 2.5 years is Kyle McCray. The article says Kyle returned to Potsdam after that time. So answer is Kyle McCray.

12. The character managing school and hockey, connected to Casey. That's Casey herself. The article says she teaches, manages hockey, and is Wyatt's sister, and ex-wife of Kyle. So answer is Casey.

13. Retired firefighter with stroke is Danny McCray. The article states Danny is the father, retired firefighter recovering from stroke, so Danny.

14. The female with chardonnay and flair is Casey's friend. The text mentions Casey's best friend is described as chardonnay-sipping and sartorial flair. So the friend's name? The article doesn't give her name, just refers to her as "best friend". So the answer would be N/A unless the question allows "Casey's best friend", but the question asks for the character's name. Since it's not given, N/A? Wait, the question says "which character", so maybe the answer is "Casey's best friend" but the text doesn't name her. So perhaps N/A.

15. The setting is Potsdam, N.Y. The question asks which location, so answer is Potsdam, N.Y.

16. The focal point novel is "What Happened to the McCrays?" which is the title of the review's focus.

17. Page count is 341, as stated in the article.

18. The character with the childhood accident is Wyatt, who lost legs at 5. So Wyatt.

19. The novelist contrasted is Tracey Lange, since her previous works had Irish elements, but this one is different. The question asks which novelist, so answer is Tracey Lange.

20. The seasoned author with a courtroom drama is Scott Turow, mentioned in the last section about his new case with Rusty Sabich. So Scott Turow.
