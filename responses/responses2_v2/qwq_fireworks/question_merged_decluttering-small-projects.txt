Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and not my own knowledge.

1. **Question 1:** The question is asking about an ailment Robert F. Kennedy Jr. linked to aluminum in vaccines. The article mentions he blamed aluminum for allergies and other illnesses. The answer should be "allergies and other illnesses".

2. **Question 2:** The author of "Tidy Up Your Life" is Tyler Moore. The article says he has three daughters. So the answer is "three".

3. **Question 3:** The Tidy Dad (Tyler Moore) organized the bathroom by tossing duplicates and coraling items. The system here is "corralling each person's stuff into its own spot". But the question mentions "organizational system similar to clear bins". Wait, the article says Ms. Bremer uses clear bins for snacks. The bathroom's method was corralling. Maybe the answer is "corralling each person's stuff into its own spot".

4. **Question 4:** Dr. Preston struggles with filing papers and moves them out of sight. The question asks for a storage solution similar to clear bins. Maybe "moving them out of sight to another room" or "bins"? The article says Bremer uses clear bins. The answer might be "clear bins" but the question specifies for those like Dr. Preston. Since Dr. Preston doesn't use bins but moves them, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "similar to the clear bins used for snacks" so maybe "clear bins" is the answer. Wait, the article says Bremer uses clear bins for snacks, and Dr. Preston moves papers out of sight. The question is about a storage solution for someone like Dr. Preston. The text doesn't mention a specific system for her, so maybe N/A. Hmm, tricky. Let me check again. The article says Dr. Preston admits she doesn't file and moves papers to another room. The question asks for a storage solution similar to clear bins (used by Bremer). Since Dr. Preston's method isn't a system but moving, maybe the answer is "moving items to another room" but that's not a storage solution. Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait the question says "storage solution recommended by Ms. Bremer for individuals like Dr. Preston". Wait, the question says "decluttering too much, mirroring Dry January" but that's Q1. Wait, Q4's exact wording: "What organizational system, similar to the clear bins used for snacks, did the Tidy Dad implement in the bathroom to prepare for the afternoon slump?" Wait, Tidy Dad is Tyler Moore. The bathroom's solution was "corralling each person's stuff into its own spot". But the question mentions "afternoon slump", which is in the article's section on how to beat the slump. The article says Moore's bathroom method was for a better start to the day. The "afternoon slump" section is separate. Maybe the answer is N/A because the question ties bathroom organization to the afternoon slump, but the article links bathroom to starting the day. So the answer might be N/A. Hmm, maybe the answer is "corralling each person's stuff into its own spot".

5. **Question 5:** Scientists found organic molecules on Bennu. The question asks what confirmed Ms. Bremer's advice about keeping original packaging. Since Bremer decants snacks (so removes packaging), the discovery of organic molecules doesn't relate to packaging. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Dr. Berkman says small wins build habits. The question asks max rooms for "rage cleaning" to build habit. The article says "rage cleaning" is about doing every room over a weekend. But Dr. Berkman's advice is about small wins. The question might be asking if there's a max, but the text doesn't specify. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Tidy Dad organized charging cables, leading his wife to suggest stopping. The question asks for a common item near cables he organized. The article says he organized chargers and cords, so maybe "chargers" is the answer. The item near cables would be chargers, so the answer is "chargers".

8. **Question 8:** The teenager and her mom were happy with the perfume area. Scientists studying Bennu felt "shed light on how life arose" so maybe "excitement" or "satisfaction". The article says the girl and mom were "so happy", and scientists found "a wide assortment of organic molecules that shed light..." so the emotion mirrored is "happiness" or "excitement". The answer would be "happiness".

9. **Question 9:** Mr. Moore recommended a container similar to dog food for sneakers. The article says for sneakers, a storage solution like shoe storage. Maybe "shoe storage containers" or "bins". The article mentions "better shoe storage" as a solution for sneakers, so "shoe storage containers".

10. **Question 10:** The quote "be the boss of the junk drawer" is from Ms. Bremer. The article says "Ms. Bremer said. 'If it's one junk drawer, be the boss of the junk drawer.'" So the answer is "Ms. Bremer".

11. **Question 11:** The teenager's room area that was repeatedly looked at was the under-sink area. The article mentions the under-sink area where the perfume was organized. So answer "under-sink area".

12. **Question 12:** The pantry is blamed for excess packaging. Ms. Bremer says people keep too much packaging in the pantry. So answer "pantry".

13. **Question 13:** The bathroom was considered satisfying to overhaul by Moore because tossing duplicates and organizing. The article says "Mr. Moore said he thought the most satisfying small project was the bathroom". So answer "bathroom".

14. **Question 14:** Dr. Preston recommended scheduling an hour session. The article says Dr. Preston advised setting a time goal like an hour on Tuesday. So answer "Dr. Preston".

15. **Question 15:** The Tidy Dad (Moore) spent 30 minutes on chargers, and his wife said to stop. The question says "thirty-minute session organizing a box full of charging cables", so answer "Mr. Moore".

16. **Question 16:** Dr. Berkman talks about "small wins". NASA's asteroid study is separate. The question asks which expert could be mistakenly linked to NASA's work because of "small wins". Since Berkman's "small wins" are organizational, not related to NASA, so answer "Dr. Berkman".

17. **Question 17:** The psychology professor who said "rage cleaning" is stimulating is Stephanie Preston. The article says "Stephanie Preston... 'rage cleaning' every room over a long weekend works." So answer "Stephanie Preston".

18. **Question 18:** The expert advising to focus on problematic objects (like sneakers) instead of rooms is Tyler Moore. The article says if multiple areas are cluttered, focus on the item causing issues. So answer "Tyler Moore".

19. **Question 19:** The expert warning about sentimental items in shared homes is Dr. Preston. The article says "you have to come to some sort of agreement" in shared homes, from Dr. Preston. So answer "Dr. Preston".
