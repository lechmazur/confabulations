Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. Let me start by going through each question carefully and see what the article says.

1. **Total number of subsidized rehearsal studios including the black box theater?** The article mentions "three rehearsal studios" and a black box theater. So total would be 4? Wait, but the question says "subsidized rehearsal studios available for artists at 651 Arts' new location, including the black box theater?" The article states "the new digs, which include a black box theater and three rehearsal studios". But the subsidized part is mentioned in the context of "a program offering artists subsidized space rental". So the subsidized spaces would be those three studios plus the theater? The answer is 4? Wait, but the question says "including the black box theater" so total is 4? Let me check again. The exact line: "the new digs, which include a black box theater and three rehearsal studios". So yes, the answer is 4? Hmm. Wait, but the question says "subsidized rehearsal studios". The article says "three rehearsal studios" but the subsidized program is for space rental. It might be that the black box is part of the subsidized spaces. So the answer is 4. But maybe the black box is a theater, not a rehearsal studio. The question says "rehearsal studios including the black box theater". Wait, the wording is tricky. The question is asking for the total number of subsidized rehearsal studios, including the theater. If the theater is counted as a rehearsal studio, then 4. But the article says "three rehearsal studios" and a "black box theater", so they are separate. But the subsidized program includes all spaces. The question might just be asking how many rehearsal studios plus the theater. Wait, the question says "subsidized rehearsal studios available... including the black box theater?" So maybe the black box is also a rehearsal space. The article says "a black box theater and three rehearsal studios". So total 4 spaces, but the question specifies rehearsal studios including the theater. Maybe the theater is considered a rehearsal studio. The answer is 4. I'll go with 4. 

2. **Founding member responsible for producing Anna Deavere Smith's early works?** The article says "Shepard and Leonard Goines, both of whom had produced Black dance and music events at the Brooklyn Academy, were tasked with responding to that call. Soon, 651 was backing music and theater works by artists including Anna Deavere Smith..." So Shepard or Goines? The question is which founding member. The founders are mentioned as Shepard and Leonard Goines. The answer is either Mikki Shepard or Leonard Goines. The question says "producing Anna Deavere Smith's early works before the organization secured its original Fulton Street space?" Since they were the ones producing events at BAM before moving, and the article says 651 backed her works, but the question is about who produced her works before the original space. The answer is either of them, but the text doesn't specify which one. Hmm, maybe the question is looking for one of them. The article says "Shepard and Leonard Goines, both of whom had produced Black dance and music events at the Brooklyn Academy..." So they both produced those works. Since the question asks for which founding member, but both are founders. But the question says "which founding member", so maybe Mikki Shepard? Wait, the founders are listed as "Mikki Shepard, one of its founders" and "Shepard and Leonard Goines". So both are founders. The question is about who produced Anna Deavere Smith's works. The text doesn't specify which one, so maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "651 was backing music and theater works by artists including Anna Deavere Smith, Sekou Sundiata and Carl Hancock Rux, and boosting the careers of choreographers like Ronald K. Brown..." So the producing was done by the founders, but since both are mentioned together, perhaps the answer is both, but the question asks for which founding member. Since the question might expect one name, but the text doesn't single out one, so maybe N/A. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is Mikki Shepard? Wait, the text says "Mikki Shepard, one of its founders" but the producing was done by both. Hmm. The question might have a typo or the answer is N/A. Wait, let me check again. The article says "Shepard and Leonard Goines, both of whom had produced Black dance and music events at the Brooklyn Academy, were tasked with responding to that call. Soon, 651 was backing music and theater works by artists including Anna Deavere Smith..." So they both produced those works. Since the question asks for which founding member, but both are founders, the answer would be both, but since the options might require one name, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is Mikki Shepard? But the text doesn't specify. Hmm, tricky. I'll go with N/A because it's not specified which one.

3. **Annual event with poetry workshops inspired by Brooks?** The article mentions "a poetry workshop based on Brooks's poems" as part of the community engagement for "Against Gravity". The question is during which annual event? The article says "Following its practice of introducing artists... 651 has presented a series of community engagement workshops related to "Against Gravity." One was a poetry workshop..." The question says "annual event". The article mentions Juneteenth celebrations as recent events. Wait, the Juneteenth is an annual event. The question asks if the poetry workshop is part of an annual event. The article says "Juneteenth celebrations have become some of the liveliest in the city." But the workshops related to "Against Gravity" might not be part of Juneteenth. The article doesn't tie the Brooks poetry workshop to an annual event. The answer might be N/A because the question is about an annual event, but the article doesn't link it to one. Alternatively, maybe the premiere of "Against Gravity" is an annual event? The premiere is on Jan 16. The question says "annual event", so perhaps N/A.

4. **Architectural feature symbolizing resistance to cultural erasure?** The article says "Lillard has been working to make sure that the community... feels invited. "With the aggressive gentrification... there's been a lot of cultural erasure... 651 Arts as a counterforce. On a recent tour, she was especially excited about the archives room filled with boxes, which are "receipts" to say, 'We've been here.'" So the archives room with boxes is the feature. The answer is the archives room? The question asks for an architectural feature. The archives room is part of the space. The article mentions "a room filled with boxes -- the not-quite-finished location of the organization's archives". So the archives space is the architectural feature. The answer is the archives room or "archives filled with boxes" but the exact wording might be "the archives" or "room filled with boxes". The question says "architectural feature", so maybe the archives room. The answer is "archives" or "archival space". The article says "the archives are 'receipts'... way to say, 'We've been here.'" So the answer is the archives.

5. **1980s Brooklyn Academy renovation that housed 651 before?** The article says "651 began as an outgrowth of the Brooklyn Academy, and until 2014 it was given office space at 651 Fulton Street, on the site of the Majestic Theater that the Brooklyn Academy renovated in 1987 (and that is now called BAM Harvey)." So the renovation was in 1987. The answer is the Majestic Theater renovation in 1987. The question asks for the project's name. The article refers to it as the renovation of the Majestic Theater by the Brooklyn Academy in 1987. The answer is the Majestic Theater renovation or BAM Harvey. Since the question asks for the project's name, the Majestic Theater's renovation by BAM in 1987. The answer is "the renovation of the Majestic Theater" but the article says "the Brooklyn Academy renovated in 1987". So the answer is the 1987 renovation of the Majestic Theater.

6. **Focus of "Black Revival" workshop?** The article says "Black Revival: A Healing Movement Ritual for Men," Zachery led participants through movement exercises, some focused on the sensation of being held. "That's a sensation we men often lose," he said. "But you can remember through your body what it means to be supported." So the focus is on the sensation of being held and supported, related to themes of "Against Gravity" which deals with manhood beyond traditional roles. The answer is "sensation of being held" or "movement exercises focused on being held". The question asks for the primary focus related to the themes. The theme of the performance includes questioning manhood and support. The workshop's focus is on being held as part of male support. The answer is "being held" or "sensation of being held".

7. **Infrastructure delay before 2022?** The article says "Construction delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic were followed by more delays. When Lillard came onboard in 2022, she expected to open the next year." So the major delay was due to the pandemic. The question asks for the infrastructure delay. The answer is the pandemic (Covid-19). But the question says "major city infrastructure delay". The article mentions "Construction delays caused by the pandemic" so the infrastructure delay is the pandemic-related construction delays. The answer is "Covid-19 pandemic".

8. **Centennial celebration mentioned coinciding?** The last paragraph says "Maria Tallchief, widely considered America's first prima ballerina, is being celebrated by New York City Ballet, where she was a Balanchine muse, in her centennial year." So Maria Tallchief's centennial. The answer is Maria Tallchief.

9. **When did executive director start tours at 10 Lafayette?** Lillard came onboard in 2022 and expected to open next year. But construction delays meant opening happened later. The article says "When Lillard came onboard in 2022, she expected to open the next year. 'My first year... was basically a crash course..." Now that it's done, she's been doing tours. The question is when did she start the tours? The article says "Lillard has been focusing on... conducting 'friends and family tours' for local artists..." but when did she start? Since she came in 2022, and the opening was delayed, the tours would have started when the building was ready. The article doesn't specify the exact year, but since she started in 2022, and the opening was delayed beyond her first expected year (2023?), maybe the tours started in 2023. The question says "during the building’s final phase marked by city-run capital projects and Covid delays, in what year did the executive director first begin conducting..." The final phase was after delays. Since she started in 2022, and the building was completed when? The article says "now that it's done", so the tours started in 2023? But the exact year isn't stated. The article says "Lillard has been focusing on..." but the exact start year isn't given. So maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "during the building’s final phase... in what year did... first begin conducting her community tours at the 10 Lafayette headquarters?" The final phase would be when the building was nearing completion. Since she started in 2022 and the opening was delayed, perhaps the tours began in 2023. But the article doesn't specify the exact year. The answer is N/A.

10. **Street number referenced from former location?** The original address was 651 Fulton Street, which is in the name of the organization. The question asks what street number from its former location is referenced. The answer is 651 (as in 651 Arts).

11. **Choreographer responsible for solo piece using flight metaphor?** The solo performance is Andre Zachery's "Against Gravity: Flying Afrikans + Other Legends". The answer is Andre Zachery.

12. **City's legacy invoked via historical figures activist, mayor, athlete?** The three figures mentioned are Fred Hampton (Black Panther), Harold Washington (mayor of Chicago), and Ben Wilson (athlete from Chicago). So the city is Chicago.

13. **Numeral designating the building housing 651 Arts?** The new location is at 10 Lafayette. The numeral is 10.

14. **Poet binding the performance's literary fabric?** The answer is Gwendolyn Brooks.

15. **Executive director's declaration about renewed potential?** The article says Lillard said, "We can determine how best to use the space and how best to serve our community." That's the declaration. The question asks for the declaration expressing renewed potential. So the answer is "We can determine how best to use the space and how best to serve our community."

16. **Folk tale collection cited as source for "flying Africans"?** The article mentions Virginia Hamilton's "The People Could Fly" among the sources. So the answer is "The People Could Fly".

17. **Whose excitement about the archive is highlighted?** The article says "Lillard was especially excited when showing a room filled with boxes -- the not-quite-finished location of the organization's archives." So Toya Lillard.

18. **Classic dance work referenced associated with Alvin Ailey?** The article mentions Ronald K. Brown's "Grace" as a 25th-anniversary piece for Alvin Ailey. So the answer is "Grace".
