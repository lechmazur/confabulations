Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1:** What literary prize did Donna Barba Higuera win for her novel about a six-toed girl from another planet?  
   The article says Donna Barba Higuera wrote "The Last Cuentista," which won the Newbery Medal and Pura Belpre Medal. But the question is about the novel with the six-toed girl. Wait, the six-toed girl is from "What Fell From the Sky" by Adrianna Cuevas, not Higuera. The question is mixing authors. Since Higuera's book isn't the one with the six-toed girl, the answer should be N/A. Because the prize she won is for her own book, not the one mentioned in the question.  

2. **Question 2:** In what year did the U.S. military take over the town of Soledad, as described in Guojing's graphic novel?  
   The military taking over Soledad is in "What Fell From the Sky" by Cuevas, set in 1952. The question mentions Guojing's book (which is "Oasis"), but the military part is from the other book. So this is incorrect context. Answer N/A because Guojing's book doesn't mention that.  

3. **Question 3:** What type of structure did the A.I. robot overlords design, build, and run in the book reviewed alongside *What Fell From the Sky*?  
   The article says in "Oasis," the A.I. runs a "domed city of Oasis." So the structure is a domed city.  

4. **Question 4:** What color was Luisa's skin, the character whose story mirrors that of the "left-behind children" in *Oasis*?  
   Luisa's skin is described as blue-gray. The left-behind children are in "Oasis," and Luisa is from the other book. The question links them, but the color is directly stated.  

5. **Question 5:** How many pages long is the book where Pineda pleads with the townspeople to unite against the soldiers, mirroring JieJie and DiDi's struggle against the A.I. robot overlords?  
   Pineda is in "What Fell From the Sky," which is 304 pages. The mention of mirroring JieJie and DiDi's struggle is just context, so the page count is correct here.  

6. **Question 6:** What is the name of the town in Texas where the children stumble upon a landfill and scavenge a dismantled robot?  
   The landfill and robot are in "Oasis," but the setting is a postapocalyptic desert, not Texas. The Texas town is Soledad, but that's from the other book. The question is mixing elements. The children in "Oasis" are in a desert, not Texas. So answer N/A.  

7. **Question 7:** What is the name of the festival that A.I. Mom simulates, which is also the title of Donna Barba Higuera's forthcoming novel?  
   A.I. Mom simulates the moon festival. The forthcoming novel by Higuera mentioned is "Firesnake," not the moon festival. The question's second part is wrong, so N/A.  

8. **Question 8:** What profession does Rusty Sabich, mentioned in the same article as *Oasis*, hold at the age of 77?  
   The article says Rusty Sabich is a prosecutor introduced in "Presumed Innocent," and he's taking a new case in "Presumed Guilty." So his profession is prosecutor.  

9. **Question 9:** What kind of event, similar to the raging sandstorms in *Oasis*, brought Luisa to Earth in the novel by the author of *Alebrijes*?  
   Luisa came via a meteoroid landing. The event is a meteoroid fall. The author of *Alebrijes* is Higuera, but the novel in question is "What Fell From the Sky," so the event is the meteoroid.  

10. **Question 10:** What is the name of the award-winning science fiction and fantasy writer, mentioned in the same article as *What Fell From the Sky*, who explores a traumatic event in her most autobiographical novel yet?  
   The article mentions Nnedi Okorafor in the section after the main reviews. She's an award-winning sci-fi writer who wrote an autobiographical novel. The answer is Nnedi Okorafor.
