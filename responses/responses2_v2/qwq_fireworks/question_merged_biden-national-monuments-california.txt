Okay, I need to go through each question and answer them based strictly on the given article. Let me start by reading through each question one by one and then check the article for the answers.

1. **Question 1:** Which Native American tribe specifically requested protection for the rock formations in the Chuckwalla National Monument that they consider sacred?  
   The article mentions that the Chuckwalla area includes rock formations sacred to Native tribes, but it doesn't specify which tribe. Wait, the Sattitla monument is linked to the Pit River Tribe and Modoc Nation. The Chuckwalla part mentions "Native tribes" generally. The specific tribes for Chuckwalla aren't named, so maybe N/A? Wait, looking again: the question is about the rock formations in Chuckwalla. The article says "rock formations that are considered sacred by Native tribes." But no specific tribe is named here. So answer N/A?

2. **Question 2:** How many acres of land did President Biden protect through his environmental proclamations during his last month in office?  
   The article states that with the two monuments (totaling over 848,000 acres), plus previous actions, he protected over 674 million acres. The "last month" part: the article says "in his final days in office," and the Chuckwalla/Sattitla are part of that. The total is 674 million acres, which includes all his actions up to then. The question is about the last month's proclamations. The article mentions the two monuments (848k acres) plus the Ruby Mountains and Black Hills. But the exact number for "last month" isn't given. The total is 674 million acres, but the question is about the last month's actions. The article says the two monuments plus others (Ruby Mountains and Black Hills) were part of the "flurry of final environmental proclamations." The exact acreage for just the last month isn't specified, so maybe N/A? Wait, the two monuments are 848,000 acres, plus others. The total is 674 million. But the question is about the last month's proclamations. Since the article doesn't break it down, maybe N/A? Hmm.

3. **Question 3:** What was the primary reason cited by renewable energy companies for supporting the Chuckwalla monument designation?  
   The article says the boundaries were drawn to avoid areas suitable for clean energy and transmission lines, which helped win support. Raisa Lee from Clearway Energy Group said it shows conservation and clean energy can go hand in hand. So the primary reason is that the designation avoids areas needed for clean energy projects, allowing them elsewhere. The answer should be that it allowed for clean energy development elsewhere, so "avoid areas suitable for clean energy projects" or similar. The exact quote is "boundaries were drawn to avoid areas that would be suitable for clean energy and for the construction of electric transmission lines. That helped win support..." So the reason is the avoidance, which allows them to build elsewhere. The answer is the reason given by the companies: "conservation and clean energy progress go hand in hand" as per Lee. So the primary reason is that it allows both conservation and clean energy development. The answer should be that the designation avoids areas suitable for clean energy projects, so they support it because it doesn't block their projects elsewhere. The question asks for the primary reason cited by the companies, so the answer is that the boundaries avoided areas suitable for clean energy, allowing their projects elsewhere. The exact answer from the text: "the boundaries were drawn to avoid areas that would be suitable for clean energy and for the construction of electric transmission lines. That helped win support..." So the reason is that the designation doesn't block their projects, so they support it. The answer is "boundaries avoided areas suitable for clean energy projects" or "conservation and clean energy progress go hand in hand" as per Lee's quote. The question asks for the primary reason cited by the companies, so the answer is the latter.

4. **Question 4:** What federal agency conducted the environmental impact assessment that led to the selection of these particular monument boundaries?  
   The article doesn't mention any specific agency doing the assessment. It mentions the Antiquities Act, but no agency named. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** What percentage of the protected Sattitla monument lands were previously used for commercial logging operations?  
   The article doesn't mention logging or any prior uses for Sattitla. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** How many endangered species were identified in the biological survey of the Chuckwalla monument area before its designation?  
   The article mentions "endangered desert tortoises" and chuckwalla lizards (but not endangered). So only one endangered species named. So answer is 1? The text says "endangered desert tortoises" and "critical habitat for... endangered desert tortoises". So that's one. So 1.

7. **Question 7:** What annual economic impact did the Department of Interior project these monument designations would have on local communities?  
   No numbers given about economic impact. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Which conservation organization's research was instrumental in identifying the 600-mile wildlife corridor along the Colorado River?  
   The article says the Biden administration carved out the corridor, but no specific organization mentioned. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** What compensation package was offered to mining companies who had existing claims within the newly designated monument areas?  
   The article doesn't mention compensation. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** How many public meetings were held with local stakeholders before finalizing the boundaries of these two monuments?  
    No mention of the number of meetings. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** How many migrants suspected of gang affiliations, currently held at Guantanamo Bay, will be relocated to the tent city being prepared by U.S. Forces?  
    The article states that 10 are held at Guantanamo, and the tent city can hold 30,000. But it doesn't say how many will be relocated. The question asks how many will be relocated, but the info is not there. N/A.

12. **Question 12:** What legal precedent, established during the Obama administration, did Senator Alex Padilla cite as the basis for California's readiness to defend the newly designated monuments in court?  
    The article mentions that Trump tried to shrink monuments created by Obama, and Padilla says CA will defend them in court. The legal precedent is likely the case where Obama's monuments were defended, perhaps the Bears Ears case? But the article doesn't name a specific precedent, just mentions Trump's actions. The answer might be N/A since the text doesn't name the precedent. The article says Padilla refers to previous actions (Obama's), so maybe the precedent is the Antiquities Act itself? But the question is about a legal precedent established during Obama's time. Since the article doesn't specify, N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Which Native American tribe, central to the Sattitla creation narrative, sought the closure of the U.S. Agency for International Development, according to the article?  
    The article mentions the Pit River Tribe and Modoc Nation for Sattitla. The closure of USAID was mentioned in a separate section as a Trump action. The tribe didn't seek it. So N/A.

14. **Question 14:** What type of energy development, specifically excluded from the Chuckwalla National Monument boundaries, was championed by Raisa Lee as aligning with conservation efforts?  
    The article says the boundaries avoided areas suitable for clean energy, so clean energy (solar, transmission lines) were allowed elsewhere. Raisa Lee's company is a renewable energy group, so the type excluded is mining/drilling, but the allowed is clean energy. The question is what was excluded? The monument excludes mining, drilling, wind, solar, etc. But the answer is that the exclusion allowed clean energy elsewhere. Wait, the question is about the type excluded. The article says "prevented mining and drilling as well as wind, solar and other energy development". So all those are excluded. But Raisa Lee said that the designation allows conservation and clean energy to coexist. The energy development excluded is solar, wind, etc., but the answer is that they were excluded, but the question asks which type was excluded and championed by Lee. Wait, the exclusion of those areas allowed clean energy in other areas. The answer is that the excluded development types were mining, drilling, wind, solar, etc., but the type that Lee supports as aligned is clean energy (solar projects). The question is what type was excluded that Raisa Lee's company supports. The article says "many solar companies wanted to build on the land around Chuckwalla, and the boundaries avoided areas suitable for clean energy, so solar was allowed elsewhere. So the excluded areas were not suitable, but the energy development excluded in the monument is solar, etc. So the type excluded is solar energy, but the answer is "solar energy development" or "clean energy projects". The exact wording says "prevented... solar and other energy development". So the type excluded is solar. The question asks which type was excluded that Raisa Lee's group supported. Since they wanted solar projects, the exclusion of solar in the monument allowed it elsewhere. So the excluded type is solar, but the question is which one was excluded that the company supports. So the answer is solar energy development.

15. **Question 15:** Besides the Pit River Tribe, what other tribal organization considers the woodlands north of Mount Shasta, now designated as the Sattitla National Monument, a spiritual center?  
    The article says "the local Pit River Tribe and the Modoc Nation". So Modoc Nation.

16. **Question 16:** What action, taken by West Point leaders in compliance with President Trump's directive, directly led to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's concerns about Canada's sovereignty?  
    The article's DEI section says West Point ended clubs complying with Trump's D.E.I. ban, but that's unrelated to Trudeau's comments. Trudeau's part mentions that Trump's comments about making Canada a state were due to minerals. The question links West Point's action to Trudeau's concerns. Since the two are separate sections, there's no connection. So N/A.

17. **Question 17:** What specific environmental disaster prompted President Biden to relocate the announcement of the two California national monuments to the White House?  
    The article says he postponed because of windy weather, then wildfires killed 24. The relocation was due to wildfires caused by high winds. The environmental disaster is the wildfires in LA area.

18. **Question 18:** What was the total acreage protected by President Biden, combining both land and water, immediately prior to the designation of the Chuckwalla and Sattitla National Monuments?  
    The article states that with the new monuments, he has protected over 674 million acres. So prior to adding the 848,000, it was 674M minus 848k? The exact prior number isn't given. The article says "more than 674 million acres... more than any president" after the monuments. So prior to this, it was 674M minus 848k, but the article doesn't state the exact previous total. The answer would be N/A because we don't know the exact number before adding the new monuments.

19. **Question 19:** What specific environmental disaster prompted President Biden to relocate the announcement of the two California national monuments to the White House?  
    Same as question 17, which is the wildfires. The answer is the wildfires in LA area.

20. **Question 20:** What governmental position, held by Deb Haaland, was directly responsible for negotiating the transmission corridor agreement that facilitated the creation of the Chuckwalla National Monument?  
    Deb Haaland is the Interior Secretary. The article says she was involved, and her position is Interior Secretary. So the answer is Secretary of the Interior.
