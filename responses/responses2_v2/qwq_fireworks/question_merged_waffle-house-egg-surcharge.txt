Okay, I need to answer these questions based solely on the provided article. Let me go through each question one by one and check the article for the answers.

1. The first question asks for the approximate cost of a single Midwest large egg at Waffle House after including the 50-cent surcharge. The article mentions that the surcharge is 50 cents per egg. It also states that the current price for a dozen eggs is around $7.79, which is about 65 cents per egg. Adding the 50-cent surcharge would make it 65 + 50 = $1.15. Wait, but the article says "each egg in their omelet or scrambled eggs" will have an extra 50 cents. So the base price is 65 cents, plus 50 cents makes $1.15. That's the total.

2. The second question is about the quality designation of the eggs. The article says Waffle House uses "Grade-A large eggs". The exact phrase is in the quote from the company: "fresh-cracked, Grade-A large eggs will remain a key ingredient". So the answer is Grade-A.

3. The third question asks on which day the surcharge was introduced. The article states that Waffle House announced it on Monday, and it went into effect the same day. So the day is Monday. But the exact date isn't given, just the day of the week. The question is about the day, so "Monday".

4. The primary illness causing the egg shortage is bird flu, specifically "highly pathogenic avian influenza". The article mentions this as the cause of the egg shortage. So the answer is bird flu or avian influenza. The question says "primary illness", so bird flu.

5. The percentage increase in cost for a dozen eggs. The article says the price went from $3.33 a year ago to $7.79 now. To find the percentage increase: (7.79 - 3.33)/3.33 *100. Let me calculate that. The difference is 4.46. 4.46/3.33 â‰ˆ 1.34, so about 134% increase. The question says "approximately", so 134%.

6. The total number of eggs served annually is mentioned as over 272 million. The article says "Waffle House serves more than 272 million eggs a year". So the answer is 272 million.

7. The market phenomenon they attributed to the surcharge instead of a broader increase. The article states that the surcharge is due to the egg shortage and rising egg prices caused by bird flu. The exact quote is "to address the rising cost of eggs resulting from the bird flu". So the underlying phenomenon is the egg shortage or rising egg prices. The question asks for the market phenomenon, so "rising cost of eggs" or "egg shortage". The article says "the continuing egg shortage caused by..." so the answer is the egg shortage.

8. The nominee for secretary of agriculture mentioned is Brooke Rollins. The article says Brooke Rollins, Trump's nominee, prioritized handling animal disease outbreaks. So her name is Brooke Rollins.

9. The number of chickens culled recently is over 30 million. The text states "More than 30 million chickens have recently been killed to prevent the spread of disease".

10. The tangible economic indicator consumers use is the price of eggs. The article mentions "the price of eggs has become a tangible barometer of the economy and the rising cost of food".

Let me double-check each to ensure accuracy.

1. The $7.79 per dozen is current, so per egg is ~65c. Adding 50c surcharge gives $1.15. Correct.
2. Grade-A is explicitly stated.
3. The day is Monday, as per the announcement.
4. Bird flu is the primary illness mentioned.
5. 7.79 vs 3.33 gives (7.79-3.33)/3.33 = ~134% increase. Correct.
6. 272 million eggs annually.
7. The shortage is the reason for the surcharge instead of overall price hikes.
8. Brooke Rollins is the nominee.
9. 30 million chickens culled.
10. Egg prices as the indicator.

All answers are directly from the article. I think that's all.
