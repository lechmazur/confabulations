Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I'll start by going through each question and then check the article for the exact information needed.

1. The first question asks about the material of the plinth used for the restored Iron Horse, which should be the same as the medium of Pattison's first commission. The article mentions the first commission was a marble sculpture. The restored plinth is described as Georgia granite. So the answer is Georgia granite.

2. The Iron Horse was hidden behind a barn for five years before L.C. Curtis moved it. The text states it was hidden for five years until Curtis took it to his farm.

3. The question is about another campus organization besides the Order of the Greek Horsemen that caused damage. The article mentions a secret Greek society, the Order of the Greek Horsemen, but the other group isn't named. Wait, actually, the article says opposing football fans spray-painted it, but the other group that corrected it was the Order. The question asks for the one that contributed to damage. The initial prank involved students using manure and balloons. Maybe the football fans? But the question specifies "student pranks" and "damage that necessitated restoration". The article mentions "opposing football fans" spray-painted it, so maybe that's the answer. Wait, the question is about the group that caused damage besides the Greek Horsemen. The article says "spray-painted at least twice by opposing football fans (and spray-painted back to black by a secret Greek society..." So the football fans are one, but the question is asking for the other besides the Greek Horsemen. The other group causing damage would be the football fans. But the question says "besides the Order of the Greek Horsemen", so the answer would be opposing football fans. But the question specifies "campus organization"â€”football fans might not be an organization. Hmm. Wait, the article says "spray-painted at least twice by opposing football fans (and spray-painted back to black by a secret Greek society..." so maybe the football fans aren't an organization, but the Greek society is. The question asks besides the Order, so maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the initial vandalism included students, but the question is about the restoration needing. The restoration was due to missing pieces and damage. The article mentions that during the initial protest, students used graffiti, manure, etc. But the restoration was also due to later damage like spray paint from football fans. Since the question asks for another organization besides the Greek Horsemen that contributed to damage, maybe the answer is N/A because the football fans aren't an organization mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the article doesn't name another group. Hmm, tricky. Let me check again. The article says "spray-painted at least twice by opposing football fans (and spray-painted back to black by a secret Greek society..." So the football fans aren't an organization, so the answer might be N/A. Wait the question says "besides the Order of the Greek Horsemen, what other campus organization..." So the other organization is the Order? Or maybe the answer is N/A because only the Order is mentioned as a group, and others are just students. Hmm. Maybe the answer is N/A here. Wait, the question says "student pranks" and "damage that necessitated the Iron Horse's six-month restoration". The restoration involved missing pieces and corrosion. The article mentions the graffiti and manure, but the specific groups causing damage in addition to the Greek Horsemen (who climbed it) might be the football fans, but they aren't an organization. So perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the article mentions another group. Let me check again. The article states that the Order of the Greek Horsemen climbed it, and the football fans spray-painted. But the question asks for another organization besides the Greek Horsemen. Since the football fans aren't an organization, the answer is N/A. Hmm, but maybe I'm missing something. Wait, the question says "contributed to the damage that necessitated the Iron Horse's six-month restoration". The article says the restoration team had to fix corrosion and missing parts. The missing parts were from when it was taken from the cornfield. The initial vandalism included the balloons and manure. Maybe the answer is N/A because the only other group mentioned as causing damage is the football fans, not an organization. So I'll go with N/A here.

4. The question is about the artistic movement that the Mother and Child sculpture represents. The article mentions Cubist planes in describing the sculpture. So the movement is Cubism.

5. The publication that had the critical review and Pattison's letter. The student newspaper The Red & Black is mentioned. The cartoon and the letter were in that publication.

6. The agricultural product at the current location and the original unveiling. The current location is a cornfield, so corn. The original unveiling had manure under the tail, but the question is about the same product present at both. Wait the original unveiling had manure, but the current is cornfield. The question says "cultivated on the land where the Iron Horse now resides" (corn) and "also present at the original... unveiling" (manure is not cultivated). Wait, maybe the question is asking for a product present at both? Or the same product? The article says when it was first installed, students placed manure under the tail. The current location is a cornfield, so corn is cultivated there. So the answer is corn, since that's the agricultural product at the current site and the original had manure (but manure isn't a cultivated product). Wait maybe the question is a trick. The article says "the sculpture was extricated from a concrete pad in a cornfield outside Athens for conservation", so now it's in a cornfield. The original unveiling was on campus, but the question asks for a product present at the original unveiling. The original had manure, but that's not a cultivated product. The article mentions the manure was brought by Don McMillian in his car. The question is about an agricultural product cultivated there. Maybe the answer is corn, since the current location is a cornfield, and the original event had manure (but manure isn't a crop). The question might be a bit confusing, but the answer is corn.

7. Don McMillian used a Studebaker Commander convertible to bring the manure.

8. The institution where Pattison taught and has his works is the Art Institute of Chicago. The article mentions the Art Institute of Chicago and Whitney Museum of American Art have his works. He taught at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

9. The color used by football fans was mentioned as unspecified, but the article says they spray-painted it, and the Greek society repainted it black. The question says opposing football fans used a color, which was corrected. The article says "spray-painted at least twice by opposing football fans (and spray-painted back to black by a secret Greek society..." So the color they used isn't specified, but maybe the answer is "unspecified" but the question requires the color. Wait, the question is what color did the football fans use. Since the article doesn't say the color, but the Greek society repainted it black, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, no, the article just says "spray-painted at least twice by opposing football fans (and spray-painted back to black..." but doesn't specify the color the football fans used. So the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "what color, applied to the Iron Horse by opposing football fans..." so since the article doesn't state the color, answer is N/A.

Wait, but maybe the article says that the Greek society repainted it black, implying that the football fans used a different color. But the article doesn't specify which color they used. So the answer is N/A.

10. The object placed between the hind legs was two balloons, as mentioned in the text.

11. The number of missing components when they removed it for restoration was 32 pieces.

12. The famous protest work compared to the sculpture's lines is Picasso's "Guernica", which is a Cubist work.

13. The unwanted substance under the tail was manure.

14. The individual whose farm became the temporary venue was L.C. Curtis.

15. The graffiti incident mentioned was "What the hell is this thing?" written on it.

16. The two-word title during conservation was "Pegasus".

17. The anti-communist period referenced was the McCarthyism and Red Scare era.

18. The years from debut to restoration being seen complete again: the sculpture was unveiled 70 years ago (1954) and restored 70 years later, so it was seen complete again after 70 years.

19. The phrase the artist used was "shadow of the presence of spite, ignorance, and intolerance".

20. The unconventional accessory was underwear fashioned into a hat over the forelock.

Now I'll go through each and confirm with the article text.

1. Plinth material: Georgia granite. Yes, "black paint, sitting atop a Georgia granite plinth."

2. Hidden for five years before moving to Curtis's farm: "languished for five years until a horticulture professor, L.C. Curtis, got permission to take it to his farm..."

3. Other organization besides Greek Horsemen causing damage: The article mentions football fans but they aren't an organization. The only other group mentioned is the students in general, but the question specifies a campus organization. So N/A.

4. Cubist movement: "Cubist planes" in Mother and Child. So Cubism.

5. The Red & Black published the review and Pattison's letter: "student journalist... in the Red & Black... Pattison penned a letter to the editor..."

6. Agricultural product: corn, since now it's in a cornfield, and original had manure (but manure isn't cultivated). So corn.

7. Studebaker Commander convertible: "Don McMillian... Studebaker Commander convertible".

8. Art Institute of Chicago: "permanent collections of the Art Institute of Chicago..."

9. Football fans' color: article doesn't specify, so N/A.

10. Balloons: "tying two balloons between its hind legs".

11. 32 missing pieces: "missing 32 pieces".

12. Guernica: "Cubist lines somewhat resemble the horse in Picasso's famed protest piece, 'Guernica'".

13. Manure: "shoveling manure under its tail".

14. L.C. Curtis's farm.

15. Graffiti: "What the hell is this thing?".

16. Pegasus: "briefly titled 'Steel Horse' and then 'Pegasus'".

17. McCarthyism and Red Scare: "the era of McCarthyism and the Red Scare".

18. 70 years: "the Iron Horse had not been seen in its complete form since the day it was unveiled 70 years ago".

19. "shadow of the presence of spite, ignorance, and intolerance": Pattison's letter.

20. Underwear hat: "Underwear has been fashioned into a hat stretched over its forelock."

Alright, that should cover all. Now I'll format the answers properly.
