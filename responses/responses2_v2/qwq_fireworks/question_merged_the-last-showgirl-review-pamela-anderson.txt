Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the given article. I need to make sure I only use the information provided and answer exactly what's asked. Let's start with question 1.

1. How many years did Pamela Anderson perform in "Le Razzle Dazzle" before the show began its decline?

The article says Shelly has been in the show for "decades, if she's being honest." But the exact number isn't specified. Since it's decades, maybe 20+ years, but the question asks for the number of years. Since it's not a specific number, I have to say N/A because "decades" is too vague.

2. What was the significance of the Blue Angel statue's placement during Frank Sinatra's residency that made it particularly meaningful to Shelly's character arc?

The Blue Angel was installed when the Rat Pack were in residence. Frank Sinatra was part of the Rat Pack. The statue's placement during their time is significant because Shelly's status as a monument is compared to it. The article says the Blue Angel was installed when the Rat Pack were there, so the significance is that it's from the Rat Pack era, which is part of Vegas's history that Shelly's career mirrors. The question is about the placement's significance to Shelly's arc. Since she's a long-time performer like the Rat Pack, maybe the statue's historical placement ties her to that legacy. But the article doesn't explicitly state the significance beyond being from that time, so maybe the answer is that it was from the Rat Pack era, which Shelly's career parallels. The exact wording in the article: "was installed when the Rat Pack were in residence." So the significance is that it was there during the Rat Pack era, which is part of Vegas's history Shelly is a part of. So the answer is that it was installed during the Rat Pack's residency, which Shelly's career mirrors.

3. Which Broadway musical did Shelly perform in before joining the Las Vegas show?

The article mentions Pamela Anderson was in a Broadway production of "Chicago" a few years back. Since Shelly is her character, that's probably the answer. The question is about Shelly's Broadway musical before joining the Las Vegas show. So the answer is Chicago.

4. What medical condition does Hannah discover about her mother that leads to their emotional reconciliation?

The article doesn't mention any specific medical condition. The mother-daughter plot is about making peace, but no medical issue is stated. So N/A.

5. How much did ticket sales for "Le Razzle Dazzle" drop in the quarter before the events of the film?

No specific numbers are given about ticket sales drop. The show is on its "last fishnet leg," indicating decline, but no percentage or figure is mentioned. So N/A.

6. What was the name of the casino where Shelly's show took place?

The article doesn't mention the casino's name. It refers to the show as "Le Razzle Dazzle" but not the casino's name. So N/A.

7. Which famous Vegas performer mentored Shelly when she first started dancing in the show?

No mention of a mentor. The article talks about her being part of the show for decades but doesn't name a mentor. So N/A.

8. What color were the custom lenses used to create the nimbus effect in Shelly's close-up scenes?

The article says the custom lenses blur the edges, creating a luminous nimbus. The color isn't specified. The lenses are described in terms of their effect, not color. So N/A.

9. How many dancers were in the original cast of "Le Razzle Dazzle" when Shelly first joined?

No number is given for the original cast size. The article mentions a "bevy of similarly bejeweled, semi-clothed dancers" but no exact count. So N/A.

10. What was the selling price of the souvenir brochure featuring Shelly's image?

The article mentions her image adorns the souvenir brochure but doesn't state the price. So N/A.

11. In the film review, which actress portrays the veteran performer hailed as a modern monument of Las Vegas—a character whose poignant journey in a fading casino revue is likened to the revered Blue Angel?

The title character is Shelly, played by Pamela Anderson. So the answer is Pamela Anderson.

12. Who is the aspiring photographer with a troubled bond that, despite her occasional hectoring, unwittingly highlights the inner life of the aging showgirl in the narrative?

Hannah is Shelly's daughter, an aspiring photographer who nurses a grudge. The article mentions her as the one whose presence sheds light on Shelly. So the answer is Billie Lourd (since she plays Hannah).

Wait, the question asks for the name of the character or the actress? The question says "who is the aspiring photographer" in the narrative. The article says Hannah (the character) is played by Billie Lourd. Since the question is about the character, the answer is Hannah. But the question might be asking for the actress. Wait, the question says "in the film review"—the review mentions the actress. Let me check the article: "the aspiring photographer who nurses a grudge against her. This mother-daughter thread... Hannah (Billie Lourd)". So the answer is Billie Lourd as the actress. Wait, the question says "who is the aspiring photographer"—the character's name is Hannah, but the question is phrased as "who is... in the narrative"—so the character's name is Hannah, but the question might want the actress. The review's text says "Hannah (Billie Lourd)", so the answer is Billie Lourd as the actress. But the question says "in the narrative"—so the character's name is Hannah. Hmm, need to check the exact wording. The question says "the aspiring photographer with a troubled bond... in the narrative?" So the answer is Hannah, but the options given in the article refer to the actress. Wait, the question is from the film review's perspective, so the review would mention the actress. The article says "Hannah (Billie Lourd)", so the answer is Billie Lourd. The question is phrased as "who is the aspiring photographer...", so the answer is the character's name is Hannah, but since the question is in the context of the review, which refers to the actress, maybe it's Billie Lourd. Let me check the exact question again: "who is the aspiring photographer with a troubled bond...". The review would refer to the actress, so Billie Lourd.

13. Which actor, featured as the supportive friend sharing intimate, reflective moments with the aging performer, is captured in scenes enriched by diffused light and custom camera lenses?

The supportive friend is Annette, played by Jamie Lee Curtis. The article mentions "sharing drinks and worries with her friend, Annette (a sensational Jamie Lee Curtis)". So the answer is Jamie Lee Curtis.

14. What is the name of the casino stage show that has long defined the career of the aging star, as celebrated in the nostalgic portrayal of a fast-disappearing Vegas spectacle?

The show is called "Le Razzle Dazzle".

15. Which filming medium, mentioned in connection with Gia Coppola and her cinematographer, is credited with imparting a soft, luminous quality to the portrayal of both neon nights and bridal sunlight in the film?

The article states "shooting in 16-millimeter film" with Autumn Dural Arkapaw. So the answer is 16-millimeter film.

16. In the ensemble cast that frames the delicate interplay of age and youth, which actress plays one of the younger dancers whose presence subtly deepens the film’s reflection on the inevitable decline of Vegas glamour?

The younger dancers include Jodie (Kiernan Shipka) and Mary-Anne (Brenda Song). The question asks for one of them. The first listed is Kiernan Shipka. Since the question asks for the name of the actress, it's Kiernan Shipka.

17. Which actress embodies the character of the second dancer whose role in the film, though understated, reinforces the thematic contrast between ephemeral beauty and enduring legacy?

The second dancer mentioned is Mary-Anne, played by Brenda Song. So the answer is Brenda Song.

18. Who is the actor cast as the theater’s stage manager, whose gruff and needy persona anchors the backstage reality of the glamorous revue depicted in the review?

The stage manager is Eddie, played by Dave Bautista. The article says "the show's stage manager, the gruffly needy Eddie (Dave Bautista)".

19. Drawing on an iconic sentiment quoted in the article, which classic Hollywood song's line is invoked to underscore the contrast between genuine allure and its less costly imitation?

The article starts with "Diamonds are a girl's best friend," which is from the song "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" from "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" sung by Marilyn Monroe. The article mentions that line as cooed by Monroe, so the song is "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend".

20. Who is the aging showgirl at the center of the film’s narrative, whose decades of performance and imminent career crossroads are artfully captured amidst the luminous backdrop of 16‐millimeter imagery and intricate personal ties?

That's Shelly, played by Pamela Anderson. The title of the film is "The Last Showgirl", and the main character is Shelly.
