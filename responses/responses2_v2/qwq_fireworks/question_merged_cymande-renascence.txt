Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I don't use any outside knowledge and only the information from the text.

1. **Question 1:** Which member served as attorney general of St. Vincent? The article mentions Steve Scipio became attorney general of Anguilla. St. Vincent isn't mentioned here, so maybe it's a trick. Answer should be N/A because the text says Anguilla, not St. Vincent.

2. **Question 2:** Years from 1974 to first streaming album. The article says their 2012 album wasn't on streaming, and "Renascence" in 2023 (since released on Friday of the article's context, probably 2023). So 2023-1974=49 years. Wait, but the article says "first widely available new album in 41 years" which would be 2015 (1974+41=2015). Wait, conflicting info. The article states the 2012 LP was limited, and "Renascence" is the first widely available in 41 years. So 41 years after 1974 would be 2015. But the current album is released on Friday (probably 2023 when the article was written). Wait, the exact wording: "their slow-rolling comeback will finally reach full speed with the release of 'Renascence,' Cymande's first widely available new album in 41 years; an LP with a more limited release arrived in 2012." So 41 years from 1974 is 2015, but the 2012 album wasn't widely available. So the answer is 41 years. The question asks how many years after 1974 until the first streaming album (which is "Renascence" in 2015? But the article says the current release is "Renascence", so maybe the article is written in 2023, but the 41 years is the time since 1974, so 2015-1974=41. So the answer is 41.

3. **Question 3:** Which two countries' educational systems are contrasted? The article says Guyana had the best system in the Caribbean, but when they moved to London, the teachers didn't encourage them. So Guyana and the UK (England). The question says "countries", but England is part of the UK. The article says "London class" so UK's England. So answer: Guyana and United Kingdom (or England). The exact quote: "Guyana had the best educational system... I was far more advanced than the other kids in my London class. But instead of encouraging that..." So the two are Guyana and (England/UK).

4. **Question 4:** Prince Paul's age when he first heard "Bra" during the peak of British punk. The article says he was 10 in the late '70s. But the British punk movement's peak was around late '70s, so maybe that's correct. The exact text: "In the late '70s, when the star hip-hop producer Prince Paul was just 10 years old, he heard a song that stopped him cold." The punk movement's peak was late 70s, so answer is 10. But the question adds "during the peak of the British punk movement"—if the article doesn't link the time he heard "Bra" to the punk movement's peak, but the question assumes that. Since the article doesn't mention punk movement timing, but just says late '70s when he was 10, answer is 10.

5. **Question 5:** Which two founding members are in the 2022 documentary? The documentary is "Getting It Back: The Story of Cymande" released in 2022. The article mentions Scipio and Patterson as primary members who became lawyers. The others were sidelined for health. So the prominent ones would be Steve Scipio and Patrick Patterson.

6. **Question 6:** How did their educational experiences influence lyrical themes of 1972 album? The article says their lyrics either celebrated their culture or commented on racism. The educational experiences in London were negative, leading them to address racism. So the answer is that the lyrical themes addressed racism they faced.

7. **Question 7:** Who first heard breakbeat at a park party and later credited Cymande? Prince Paul is the one mentioned: he heard "Bra" at park parties, and later used it in his production. The answer is Prince Paul.

8. **Question 8:** The attorney general (Scipio) originally played what role in Cymande? The article says Steve Scipio was the bassist. So bassist.

9. **Question 9:** Which track's bass and guitar inspired sampling? The article mentions "Bra" and "Dove". The interplay between bass and guitar in "Bra" inspired De La Soul's track. Also "Dove" was sampled by others. The question asks for the one noted for that interplay. The first mention is "Bra" for the bass and guitar loop. So "Bra".

10. **Question 10:** Which Caribbean island had a member as attorney general? Scipio was attorney general of Anguilla. So Anguilla.

11. **Question 11:** Title of most recent album for revitalized presence? "Renascence" is the new album released on Friday.

12. **Question 12:** Hip-hop track built on a one-bar loop from Cymande? The article says De La Soul's "Change in Speak" (probably "Change" or "Change (in Speak)" from 1989) used a one-bar loop from "Bra". So the track is "Change in Speak".

13. **Question 13:** Colonial past recalled in members' early lives? The article mentions Guyana was a colony. So Guyana.

14. **Question 14:** British producer contributing to renewed direction? Jazzie B, mentioned as a guest artist and founder of Soul II Soul, a Cymande fan. So Jazzie B.

15. **Question 15:** Instrument described as conversational by a producer? The article says Prince Paul likened the guitar and bass to a perfect conversation, with the guitar being subtle. So the guitar is the one described as speaking gently. Wait: "Patrick's guitar symbolizes the subtleness of the sound," Scipio said. Prince Paul said the interplay was like a conversation where no one talks over each other. The metaphor is about both, but the question asks which instrument is portrayed as gentle. The answer might be the guitar, as it's the one mentioned as "subtleness" and part of the conversation. Or the bass? The article says "the bass in the track is what drew me first. It hits your spirit so deep..." but the metaphor of conversation is between guitar and bass. The question is about "gentle, conversational manner"—maybe the bass? Or the guitar? The exact quote: "the play between the instruments remains light and elegant, with lots of space left for dreaming. 'Patrick's guitar symbolizes the subtleness of the sound,' Scipio said. Prince Paul likened the sensual relationship between the band's guitar and bass to 'a perfect conversation, where no one talks over each other.'" The guitar is described as subtle, so maybe that's the gentle one. Answer: guitar.

16. **Question 16:** Title of the recent documentary? "Getting It Back: The Story of Cymande" released in 2022.
