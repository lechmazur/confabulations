Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to go through each question and find the answer in the provided article. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks for the percentage of global greenhouse gas emissions from the four countries (including the U.S.) that are part of the Paris Agreement withdrawal. The article mentions Iran, Libya, and Yemen, plus the U.S. as the fourth. But the article doesn't provide any specific emission percentages. So the answer is N/A.

2. Trump set a specific date for the 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico. The article says "starting on Feb. 1", so the date is February 1. Answer is Feb. 1.

3. The number of pardons beyond the Jan 6th event. The article states he pardoned "nearly 1,600 people charged in connection with the Jan. 6..." plus commuted sentences of 14. The question is about pardons beyond that event. Wait, the first sentence says "pardoning nearly all of the Jan. 6 rioters" and then the pardon order also commuted sentences. The question is asking for pardons beyond the Jan 6 event. Wait, the article says "a sweeping grant of clemency to all of the nearly 1,600 people... pardons to most of the defendants and commuted the sentences of 14..." So the pardons are mostly for Jan 6. The question is how many more pardons beyond those. But the article doesn't mention any other pardons. The total pardons given are the 1,600 (including commutations?), but the question is about pardons beyond Jan 6. Since the article only mentions pardons related to Jan 6, the answer is 0? Or maybe the total pardons issued that day were 1,600 (with some commutations). Wait the first paragraph says "pardoning nearly all of the Jan. 6 rioters. By Chris... He had signed dozens of executive orders and issued nearly 1,600 pardons." Wait, so total pardons are nearly 1,600, but the Jan 6 ones are part of that. The question is how many more beyond Jan 6. The article says "nearly all of the nearly 1,600 people charged in connection with the Jan. 6..." So the total pardons issued that day were nearly 1,600, most for Jan 6. The question is how many pardons beyond Jan 6. Since the article says "nearly all" were for Jan 6, but the total is nearly 1,600, so the remaining (not all) would be the difference. But since the exact number isn't given, it's N/A. Wait, maybe the total pardons issued that day were 1,600, all related to Jan 6. The first paragraph says "pardoning nearly all of the Jan. 6 rioters" and "issued nearly 1,600 pardons". So the nearly 1,600 pardons are all for the rioters. Therefore, the answer is 0? But the question says "pardons beyond those related to January 6th event". If all the pardons were related, then the answer is 0. But maybe "nearly all" implies some others. Since the article doesn't specify, it's N/A. Hmm. The question says "how many more pardons beyond those related to the January 6th event"â€”so the answer would be the total pardons minus the Jan 6 ones. But since the total is nearly 1,600, and most of them are Jan 6, but the exact number of non-Jan 6 pardons isn't given. So answer is N/A.

4. The federal agency targeted for an extended hiring freeze beyond the general freeze. The article says "calling for the freeze to stay in place longer for that agency" and mentions the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) received a boost under Biden. So the answer is Internal Revenue Service.

5. The legal precedent cited for cutting birthright citizenship. The article says "birthright citizenship in particular is protected by the Constitution." The question asks what precedent Trump cited. The article doesn't mention any specific precedent, only that it's protected by the Constitution. So the answer is N/A. Because he didn't cite a precedent, the article just states that the Constitution protects it, but Trump's order is testing the legal limits. Since the question is about what he cited, which isn't mentioned, so N/A.

6. The alternative international body proposed after leaving WHO. The article doesn't mention any alternative. It only states the withdrawal from WHO. So N/A.

7. The rationale for dismantling diversity programs linked to reducing the workforce. The article says "to dismantle federal programs that promote diversity, equity and inclusion, and to gut Biden policies protecting transgender Americans" as part of reducing the workforce. The rationale is reducing the federal workforce. So the answer is reducing the federal workforce.

8. Sum of pardoned individuals and commuted sentences. The article says "pardons to most of the defendants and commuted the sentences of 14 members..." So the total is nearly 1,600 (pardons) plus 14 (commuted). But "nearly all" were pardoned, so total pardons would be around 1,600 minus the 14? Wait, the 14 had their sentences commuted, not pardoned. So total pardons are 1,600 minus 14? Or is the 1,600 the total charged, with most pardoned and 14 commuted? The first paragraph says "nearly 1,600 people charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack... pardons to most of the defendants and commuted the sentences of 14..." So the total pardons would be (1600 -14) approximately, but exact numbers aren't given. The question asks for the sum of the count of those pardoned (most) plus 14. Since the exact numbers aren't given, but the article says "nearly all" were pardoned and 14 had commuted sentences. The total charged were nearly 1,600. So the sum would be (1600-14) +14 = 1600. But the question is "cleared under the broad pardon and the militia members whose sentences were commuted". So the total is 1,600 (pardons) plus 14 (commuted)? Wait, the 14 are part of the 1600 charged? The article says "commuted the sentences of 14 members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers militia, most of whom were convicted of seditious conspiracy." So those 14 are part of the 1600 charged. So total pardoned (most) plus commuted (14) would be the total? Since the total charged are nearly 1600, and the pardons cover most, the exact number is unclear. The question asks for the sum, but since it's approximate, maybe the answer is 1614? But the article says "nearly all" pardons and 14 commuted. Since "nearly all" could mean 1586 pardons plus 14 commuted, totaling 1600. But the exact numbers aren't given, so maybe the answer is N/A. Wait the question says "the count of individuals cleared under the broad pardon and the militia members whose sentences were commuted". The militia members are part of the 14. The broad pardon was for most of the 1600. But the total is 1600 charged, so the sum would be 1600 (all charged) but the pardons and commutations cover all of them? The article says "a sweeping grant of clemency to all of the nearly 1,600 people charged... pardons to most of the defendants and commuted the sentences of 14". So "all" are covered by clemency, but split into pardons and commutations. Therefore, total is 1600 (since all are either pardoned or commuted). The question asks for the sum of the two groups: pardons (most) plus commuted (14). So the exact number would be 1600 (since all are covered), but the sum would be 1600 = (1600 -14) +14. But since the question wants the sum, the answer is 1600 +14? No, that can't be. Wait, the total charged is 1600. The clemency covers all of them, with most pardoned and 14 commuted. So the sum of pardoned and commuted is exactly 1600. But the question specifies "cleared under the broad pardon" (so pardons) and the militia members (14). So the sum is (1600 -14) +14 = 1600. But the article says "nearly all" were pardoned. Maybe it's exactly 1600, but the article says "nearly" so maybe the exact number isn't given. Hmm. Since the question is asking for the count, but the exact numbers are approximated as "nearly all", the answer is N/A. Alternatively, if we take "nearly 1,600" as 1600, then the answer is 1600. But the question says "cleared under the broad pardon" (the pardons) plus the 14 commuted. Since the total is 1600, that's the sum. So maybe the answer is 1600. But the question says "cleared under the broad pardon" (pardons) and the 14. So total is 1600.

9. The environmental accord the U.S. withdrew from, which includes Iran, Libya, Yemen. The article says the Paris climate agreement. The question is asking the name of the accord, so answer is Paris climate agreement.

10. The agency singled out for extended freeze: IRS as before, so Internal Revenue Service.

11. Total number of major policy actions on day 1. The article says "eight of the most significant moves". But the question is asking the total. The first paragraph mentions "signed dozens of executive orders and issued nearly 1,600 pardons". The eight are highlighted, but the actual number isn't given. So the answer is N/A. Because "dozens" is vague. The article lists eight as the "most significant", but total is unknown. So N/A.

12. The tariff percentage on neighboring countries (Canada and Mexico) is 25%, as per the question. The article says 25%, so answer is 25%.

13. The international organization withdrawn from regarding public health: World Health Organization.

14. The executive order violating constitutional principle on citizenship: the one cutting birthright citizenship, which is protected by the Constitution. The article says "birthright citizenship in particular is protected by the Constitution". So the order is the one attempting to cut it off, which is the bid to cut off birthright citizenship. The question asks which executive order, so the answer is the executive order to cut off birthright citizenship for children of noncitizens.

15. The declared condition justifying military deployment: national emergency to seal borders. The article says "declaration of a national emergency to deploy the military to the border".

16. The directive targeting rollback of programs supporting transgender Americans: the executive order to dismantle DEI programs and gut Biden policies protecting transgender Americans. The question asks for the administrative directive, so the answer is the executive order dismantling diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and gutting policies protecting transgender Americans.
