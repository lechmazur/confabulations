Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. Let's start with question 1.

1. The first question asks about the percentage of Fubo that Fox acquired. The article says Disney will own 70% of Fubo after the acquisition. But the question is about Fox's acquisition. Wait, the article mentions that Disney, Fox, and Warner Bros. Discovery paid to settle the lawsuit, but the actual acquisition by Disney is 70%. The question is specifically about Fox's acquisition. The article doesn't state that Fox acquired any percentage directly; instead, Disney is the one taking the 70%. So maybe the answer is N/A because the article doesn't mention Fox acquiring a percentage. Hmm, but I need to check again. The article says "Disney will now own 70 percent of Fubo," so Fox's share isn't mentioned here. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

2. The second question is about the square miles burned by the Palisades fire. The article states: "the Palisades fire between Santa Monica and Malibu, had been 8 percent contained, while the Eaton fire, near Altadena and Pasadena, had been 3 percent contained." Wait, but the question is about the square miles burned specifically by Palisades. The article mentions "at least 11 people have been killed and 56 square miles of land have been burned by the various blazes," but that's the total for all fires. The Palisades and Eaton are two of them, but their individual burned areas aren't specified. The question asks for the square miles of the Palisades fire specifically. Since the article only gives the total, not the breakdown, the answer is N/A.

3. The third question is about the act introduced by the incoming VP that would ban D.E.I. The article mentions VP-elect JD Vance introduced the "Dismantle D.E.I. Act." So the answer should be "Dismantle D.E.I. Act."

4. The fourth question asks for the specific Patek Philippe model Zuckerberg flaunted. The article mentions he wore a Patek Philippe 5236P and a pair of F.P. Journe. So the model is 5236P.

5. The fifth question is about the total settlement and loan. The article states they paid $220 million to settle and a $145 million loan. So combined, 220 +145 = 365 million. The answer is $365 million.

6. The sixth question: Which company lost NBA games to Amazon? The article says Warner Bros. Discovery lost NBA to Amazon. So the answer is Warner Bros. Discovery.

7. Seventh question: Low-end valuation of Greenland using Alaska's price adjusted for US GDP. The article says the low end was $12.5 billion using the Virgin Islands' adjustment, and the high end (using Alaska) was $77 billion. Wait, the question asks for the low-end valuation using Alaska? Wait, the article says Barker used the Virgin Islands for the low end (adjusted for Denmark's GDP) and Alaska for the high end (adjusted for US GDP). So the low-end was $12.5B, and the high was $77B. The question is specifically about the low end using Alaska? Wait, no. Let me check again. The article says: "Adjusting the $7.2 million cost of the Alaska purchase for the growth in U.S. G.D.P. produced the high end of $77 billion." So the low end was from the Virgin Islands adjustment, and the high from Alaska. The question asks for the low end using Alaska? That's conflicting. Wait the question says "low-end valuation of Greenland, calculated by adjusting the purchase price of Alaska..." But according to the article, the low end was from the Virgin Islands. So maybe the question is wrong, but since the user says to answer based on the article, perhaps the question is incorrect, so answer N/A? Wait no, maybe I misread. Let me check again: "For the low-end valuation, he adjusted the purchase price of the Virgin Islands... produced the high end of $77 billion." So the low end was $12.5B (from Virgin Islands), and the high (Alaska) is $77B. The question is asking for the low-end valuation using Alaska's price. Since the article says the low end uses Virgin Islands, the answer would be N/A. Wait the question might be a trick here. Alternatively, maybe I misunderstood. Let me read again: "The low end of $12.5 billion. Adjusting the $7.2 million cost of the Alaska purchase for the growth in U.S. G.D.P. produced the high end of $77 billion." So the question is about the low end using Alaska? The article says the low end is from Virgin Islands. Therefore, the answer would be N/A. Wait the question says "calculated by adjusting the purchase price of Alaska..." So that's the high end. The question is asking for the low end using Alaska, which the article doesn't mention. So the answer is N/A? Or maybe I made a mistake here. Wait the question is phrased as: "What was the estimated low-end valuation of Greenland, calculated by adjusting the purchase price of Alaska for the growth in U.S. G.D.P., reflecting a historical perspective on territorial acquisitions?" But the article says that adjusting Alaska's price gives the high end. Therefore, the question is wrong, so answer N/A. Because the article says the low end comes from Virgin Islands, so the answer would be N/A.

Wait, but the question is asking specifically for the low end using Alaska's adjustment. Since the article states that the Alaska adjustment gives the high end, the answer is N/A. Because the question is mixing up the two. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

8. Eighth question: The Swiss watchmaker's model Hand Made 1 that Zuckerberg wore is Greubel Forsey, as stated in the article.

9. Ninth question: The largest wildfire between Santa Monica and Malibu is the Palisades fire.

10. Tenth question: The Supreme Court case is about the law that could ban TikTok. The article says the law requires ByteDance to sell TikTok by Jan 19 or face a ban. The name of the law isn't mentioned, but the question asks for the name of the act. The article doesn't state the specific name of the law, just mentions it's a law requiring sale or ban. So answer N/A.

Wait, the article says "the justices heard arguments in a case challenging a law that requires the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to either sell the social media platform by Jan. 19 or face an effective ban in the United States." The name of the law isn't given here, so the answer is N/A.

11. Eleventh question: The high-end valuation using Alaska's adjustment. The article says the high end was $77 billion.

12. Twelfth question: How many historical deals are referenced as defense benchmarks? The article mentions the Virgin Islands and Alaska as precedents. So two deals.

13. Thirteenth question: The combined settlement and loan amount is $220M + $145M = $365M, same as question 5.

14. Fourteenth question: The multiplicative factor for Denmark's GDP since 1917. The article says "Denmark's G.D.P. since 1917" had 500-fold growth. So 500.

15. Fifteenth question: The original Alaska purchase in 2025 dollars. The article states "In 2025 dollars, the deal was worth more than $150 million." So the answer is over $150 million. Since it says "more than," maybe the exact figure isn't given, but the approximate is $150 million. The question says "approximate total Dollar figure," so $150 million.

16. Sixteenth question: The other deal cited alongside Alaska for defense is the Virgin Islands.

17. Seventeenth question: The tech company that acquired NBA rights is Amazon, as Warner Bros. lost them to Amazon.

18. Eighteenth question: The loan amount was $145 million as part of the settlement.

19. Nineteenth question: The political figure is Trump, as stated in the article: "President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to intensify this pressure when he takes office this month."

20. Twentieth question: The Swiss watchmaker with the limited production is Greubel Forsey, mentioned in the article as the maker of the Hand Made 1.
