Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly based on the text and not use any outside knowledge. Let me go through each question step by step.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which former Biden economist predicted a 0.75% rate cut in the second half of 2025. The article mentions Yelena Shulyatyeva from the Conference Board thinking the Fed would pick up cuts in H2 2025 with 0.75 points. The question specifies a former Biden admin economist. The article says Ernie Tedeschi was Biden's adviser. Wait, but the prediction is by Yelena. Wait, let me check again. The last part says Yelena Shulyatyeva is the one who thinks the Fed would lower by 0.75. The article states: "Yelena Shulyatyeva, senior U.S. economist for the Conference Board, thinks the pause will be shorter, with the Fed picking back up in the second half of the year and eventually lowering rates by 0.75 percentage points..." But the question asks which former Biden economist? The article mentions Ernie Tedeschi as a former top adviser in the Biden admin. Since Yelena isn't linked to Biden, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "former Biden administration economist". The only one mentioned is Ernie Tedeschi. But he's not the one who made that prediction. Yelena isn't connected to Biden. So the answer might be N/A. Hmm, tricky. Alternatively, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The article says: "Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab and a former top economic adviser in the Biden administration." The prediction about 0.75 is from Yelena. So the answer here is N/A because the question asks for a former Biden economist, and Yelena isn't mentioned as such. So answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Richard Clarida lowered rates by how many points during 2019's insurance cuts. The article states: "the Fed's decision in the middle of 2019 to deliver cuts that lowered interest rates by 0.75 percentage points..." So the answer is 0.75.

3. **Question 3:** Howard Lutnick's reason for supporting country-wide tariffs. The article says he "favored 'across-the-board' tariffs that would hit entire countries." The primary reason given? The article doesn't state the reason, just his preference. So the answer is N/A. Wait, the question is asking for the primary reason he gave. The text only states his preference but not the reason. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** University of Michigan survey's percentage of consumers planning to stockpile. The article mentions a survey by the University of Michigan where consumers braced for price increases and some planned to buy ahead. However, the exact percentage isn't provided. The other survey by Weber's team (University of Chicago) found consumers were moving purchases and stockpiling, but the percentage isn't given. So the answer is N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Which Fed governor said the dollar would offset inflation from tariffs. The article mentions Christopher J. Waller saying tariffs wouldn't have a significant effect. Also, Clarida mentions the dollar strengthening could offset. The question asks which governor argued the strengthening dollar would completely offset. The text says Clarida (now at Pimco) said "other factors could offset... especially if the dollar strengthens." But the question specifies a Fed governor. The article says "one governor, Christopher J. Waller, stood by his call for further rate cuts..." but his statement was about tariffs not having significant effect, not about the dollar. Clarida was former vice chair now at Pimco. The answer might be N/A because the Fed governor (Waller) didn't mention the dollar, Clarida isn't a current governor. So the answer is N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Morgan Stanley's prediction after March and June cuts. The article states Seth Carpenter (Morgan Stanley) forecasts the Fed to cut in March and June before pausing. The question asks what rate they would cut to. The article doesn't specify the rate, just that they cut by certain amounts. Since the question asks for the rate, but the article only mentions cuts (not the target rate), so N/A.

7. **Question 7:** How much did importers reduce profit margins for first-term China tariffs. The article says in 2018 tariffs on China, "U.S. importers absorbed much of the increased costs, but consumers ended up paying more..." But the exact percentage reduction in profit margins isn't mentioned. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Powell cited which economic indicator as key threshold for rate cuts. The article says the Fed is waiting for "real progress on inflation or some weakness in the labor market." The key threshold would be those two. The question asks for the indicator, so "inflation" or "labor market" but the exact phrase is "real progress on inflation or some weakness in the labor market." The answer is "real progress on inflation or weakness in the labor market" but maybe the question wants one. Since the question is phrased as "the key threshold", perhaps the answer is either, but the article says they're waiting for either. The question might expect "real progress on inflation or some weakness in the labor market" as the exact phrase. But the answer should be in the article's wording. So the answer is "real progress on inflation or some weakness in the labor market".

9. **Question 9:** Matthew Luzzetti's analysis on months for rolling price shock effects. The article says Luzzetti warned that a gradual approach could mean rolling shocks complicating Fed's view. But the exact number of months isn't stated. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Country pressured to accept migrants by tariff threat. The article states Colombia had tariffs rescinded after complying with Trump's demands to accept migrants. So the answer is Colombia.

11. **Question 11:** Tariff percentage for Mexico and Canada. The article says Trump is to impose 25% on Mexico and Canada, and 10% on China. So 25%.

12. **Question 12:** The "insurance" rate cut of 0.75 points. The article mentions the 2019 cuts as the insurance move. So the answer is the 2019 rate cuts.

13. **Question 13:** Which Fed chair hinted supply chains would blunt inflation. The article says Powell mentioned supply chains in his news conference. "Powell also hinted... that a reordering of supply chains... could help to blunt the inflationary impact..." So Powell.

14. **Question 14:** Institution conducting the long-running survey on consumer inflation expectations. The article says "a long-running one by the University of Michigan". So University of Michigan.

15. **Question 15:** Country in retaliatory trade war disrupting supply chains. The article refers to the 2018 tariffs on China leading to retaliation. So China.

16. **Question 16:** Factor turning one-time shock into recurring inflation. The article says consumers' expectations make it a rolling shock. The answer is "consumers' expectations" or "consumers' anticipatory behavior". The exact phrase from the article is "consumers' expectations will make the life of the Fed more complicated... a self-fulfilling prophecy." The question asks the factor transforming it into recurring risk. The answer is "consumers' expectations".

17. **Question 17:** Non-tariff measure affecting labor market dynamics. The article mentions mass deportations and tax cuts, etc. The non-tariff measure contributing to negative growth via labor is deportations. So "mass deportations".

18. **Question 18:** Market reaction to offset inflation via trade adjustments. The article says a stronger dollar and foreign companies reducing costs. The answer is "strengthening dollar" or "foreign companies reducing costs". The article mentions "if the dollar... strengthens... foreign companies are forced to reduce costs". So the market reaction is foreign companies reducing costs, but the answer might be "strengthening dollar".

19. **Question 19:** Period when Fed implemented rate cuts as an insurance move. The article refers to 2019's cuts as the example. So "2019".

20. **Question 20:** Former Fed vice chair now at Pimco defending traditional approach. The article mentions Clarida, now at Pimco, said "the old playbook of looking through it may work." So Richard Clarida.
