Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to make sure I only use the information given in the article and follow the strict instructions.

1. The first question asks about a nursing home chain in New York similar to iCare's model. The article mentions iCare operates in Connecticut, Vermont, and Massachusetts but doesn't name one in New York. So the answer should be N/A.

2. The second question is about how many nursing homes the DOC contacted for Jose Saldana. The article mentions Jose Saldana worked in a department that helped with releases, but it doesn't specify the number contacted for him. However, when discussing John Teixeira, it says 16 declined him. But the question is about Jose Saldana, so N/A.

3. The third question asks the average wait time for the 90 inmates. The article states nearly 90 were granted parole between 2020-2023 but doesn't give an average wait time. A 2018 study mentioned six of 36 died before placement, but that's a different time frame. So N/A.

4. Arthur Green needed kidney dialysis, as stated in his case. The answer here is kidney dialysis.

5. The study from 2013-2015 found six of 36 died before placement, implying 30 might have transitioned, but the question asks for the percentage. 30/36 is about 83%, but the article doesn't explicitly state the success rate. Since it's not directly provided, maybe N/A? Wait, the question is about successfully transitioning. The article says six died, so 30 out of 36 (83.3%). But since the article doesn't state it as a percentage, maybe N/A? Hmm, the instructions say if it can be logically inferred, we can use it. The question asks for the percentage, so 83%? Wait, the exact numbers are 36 total, 6 died, so 30 succeeded. 30/36 = 83.3%. The article says "six of the 36 inmates granted medical parole died before a placement could be found." So the percentage that successfully transitioned would be (36-6)/36 = 83.3%. Since it's a direct calculation, maybe answer 83%? Wait, but the question is phrased as "successfully transitioned". The article doesn't explicitly state the number who succeeded, but the 6 died before placement, so the rest presumably did get placed. So the answer is (36-6)/36 = 83.3%, which can be rounded to 83%. But the article might not state it as a percentage, so maybe the answer is N/A? The question specifies "percentage", so unless the article states it, N/A. Let me check again. The article says "six of the 36 inmates granted medical parole died before a placement could be found." So 30 were placed. The percentage is 30/36 = 83.3%, but the article doesn't present it that way. Since the user wants exact info from the text, and the percentage isn't stated, maybe N/A. Hmm, tricky. The instructions say if it can be logically inferred, then okay. Since the math is straightforward, maybe answer 83%? But the question is about the percentage of those granted parole who successfully transitioned. Since 6 died before placement, the rest (30) did get placed. So 30/36 is 83.3%, so maybe 83%. But the question says "successfully transitioned", which might mean they got a placement, so yes. But the article doesn't explicitly state the percentage, so maybe N/A? I'm a bit confused here. The user says to answer N/A if it's not provided and can't be inferred. Since the numbers are there, maybe it can be inferred. Let me note that and see later.

6. The sixth question asks what Mount Sinai Hospital offered to charge for Steve Coleman's care. The article mentions they offered to provide care and help transition, but there's no mention of a cost. So N/A.

7. The primary reason the 16 nursing homes declined Teixeira was they couldn't manage his medical needs. The article states "they could not manage his medical needs."

8. The eighth question is about how many medical ethicists signed the letter for Westil Gonzalez before the group for Coleman. The article mentions fourteen signed for Coleman, but nothing about Gonzalez. So N/A.

9. The ninth question asks the monthly savings Connecticut reported from iCare. The article mentions iCare's program saves money via Medicaid but doesn't specify Connecticut's monthly savings. So N/A.

10. The tenth question asks which court precedent established the state's authority to hold inmates until placement. The article says courts have upheld the state's right, but no specific case name is given. So N/A.

Wait, let me go through each question again carefully:

1. Nursing home chain in NY similar to iCare? The article says iCare has facilities in CT, VT, MA. NY's situation is different, so answer is N/A.

2. Number of nursing homes contacted for Jose Saldana. The article talks about Saldana's role in coordinating releases, but the question is about him after his own parole? Wait, Jose Saldana is the director of a nonprofit, so maybe the question is a trick. Wait the article says "Jose Saldana, the director of a nonprofit... was incarcerated at Sullivan Correctional Facility from 2010 through 2016, he worked in a department that helped coordinate parolees' releases." So he was an inmate there, but the question is about him after his own medical parole? The article doesn't mention his own medical parole or placement. The question says "after his medical parole"—but the article doesn't state that he was granted medical parole. So the answer is N/A. The question might be mixing up Jose Saldana the nonprofit director with another inmate. Since the article doesn't mention the DOC contacting homes for him, answer N/A.

3. Average wait time for the 90 inmates. The article says "nearly 90 people were granted medical parole between 2020 and 2023." But no data on their average wait time. The 2018 study covers 2013-2015. So N/A.

4. Arthur Green's condition requiring weekly treatment: kidney dialysis. Correct.

5. The 2013-2015 study had 36 inmates, 6 died, so 30 got placements. 30/36 is 83.3%, so 83%. Since the question asks for the percentage that successfully transitioned, this is an inference. The instructions say "if the answer is not provided and cannot be logically inferred, write N/A". Since the math is straightforward, maybe 83% is acceptable. But the article says "six of the 36 inmates granted medical parole died before a placement could be found." So the rest (30) presumably got placements. So the percentage is 83.3%, which can be rounded to 83%. But the question says "percentage of New York inmates granted medical parole between 2013-2015 successfully transitioned"—so yes, that's 83%. So answer 83%.

6. Mount Sinai's charge: no info, N/A.

7. The 16 nursing homes declined Teixeira because they couldn't manage his medical needs. Correct.

8. Medical ethicists for Gonzalez: the article mentions 14 for Coleman, but nothing about Gonzalez. N/A.

9. Connecticut's savings: article says iCare's facilities save money via Medicaid but no specific figure. N/A.

10. Court precedent: the article states "Courts have previously upheld the state's right..." but doesn't name a specific case. N/A.

So, updating my answers with these considerations.
