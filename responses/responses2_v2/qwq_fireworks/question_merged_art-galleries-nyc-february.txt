Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start by reading through the questions and then refer back to the article to find the answers.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks about Ina Archer's medium in the "Writing's on the Wall" exhibition, similar to Ademola Olugebefola's approach. Ademola used etchings moving towards abstraction, but the user is asking about Ina Archer's medium. Looking at the article, under the Hill Art Foundation section, it mentions Ina Archer's three-channel video "Black Black Moonlight: A Minstrel Show". The key here is the medium: video. So the answer should be "three-channel video".

2. **Question 2:** The year the Black Emergency Cultural Coalition staged their rebuttal at Acts of Art. The article states that the coalition's show was in response to the Whitney's 1971 exhibition. The Met's "Harlem on My Mind" was 1969, and the Whitney show was two years later, so 1971. The answer is "1971".

3. **Question 3:** The artist who depicted themselves as a ghost in a self-portrait. The article mentions Nigel Jackson's self-portrait where he looks like a ghost. The question also mentions the Where We At collective, but the artist here is Jackson. So "Nigel Jackson".

4. **Question 4:** Vija Celmins' material in the Hill show. The article says Celmins made a king-size rubber eraser. So "rubber".

5. **Question 5:** Number of artists from Acts of Art in Hunter's exhibition. The article says 14 artists. The question also asks if this mirrors the number of digital installations in Techne at BAM. The article mentions "four digital installations" in Techne. Since 14 ≠4, maybe the question is a trick. Wait, the question says "mirroring the number of digital installations" but the answer would just be 14. The user wants the number from the article, so "14".

6. **Question 6:** Address on 10th Avenue for the exhibition on language/silence. The Hill Art Foundation is at 239 10th Avenue. So "239 10th Avenue".

7. **Question 7:** The Hunter professor who co-organized the show with Katie Hood Morgan. The article says Howard Singerman, art history professor, and Katie Hood Morgan. So "Howard Singerman".

8. **Question 8:** Thomas Schutte's establishment similar to Acts of Art. The article mentions a MoMA retrospective of Schutte with humorous angst, and the example given is "Don't run from failure". But the question asks about an establishment function similar to Acts of Art (a gallery). The article doesn't mention Schutte establishing a gallery. So "N/A".

9. **Question 9:** Biblical scene by Ann Tanksley. The article says Ann Tanksley has a "haunting biblical narrative". The exact scene isn't named, so "N/A".

10. **Question 10:** Artist who left for Africa and did a ghostly self-portrait. That's Nigel Jackson, as mentioned earlier. So "Nigel Jackson".

11. **Question 11:** The Whitney show that spurred the protest. The article says the Whitney's 1971 show "Contemporary Black Artists in America" by a white curator led to the rebuttal at Acts of Art. The name is "Contemporary Black Artists in America".

12. **Question 12:** Artist with torn-paper collages. Frank Wimberley's torn-paper collages are mentioned, and there's a survey at Berry Campbell in Chelsea. So "Frank Wimberley".

13. **Question 13:** Artist using scrap materials with African influence. Lloyd Toone uses scrap wood, shoe leather, nails. So "Lloyd Toone".

14. **Question 14:** All-women Black collective at Acts of Art. The article mentions "Where We At". So "Where We At".

15. **Question 15:** Artwork with matchbox instruction paired with Baldwin. The article says Andy Warhol's matchbox with "Close Cover Before Striking" paired with Baldwin's quote. So "Andy Warhol's matchbox painting".

16. **Question 16:** Three-channel video on minstrelsy. Ina Archer's "Black Black Moonlight: A Minstrel Show". So that title.

17. **Question 17:** Hunter professor organizing the Acts of Art revival. Howard Singerman again. So "Howard Singerman".

18. **Question 18:** Artist with signature-like abstract drawings. The article mentions Agnes Martin and Cy Twombly's abstract drawings as "light and fleet as signatures". The question asks for the credited artist. Since both are mentioned, but the answer needs to pick one? Wait, the question says "which artist"—probably either. But the article says "abstract drawings by Agnes Martin and Cy Twombly... as light and fleet as signatures". The question asks for the one credited, so maybe either. But the question says "credited with a signature-like", so perhaps Twombly is known for scribbles, but the answer expects both? Wait, the question says "which artist"—so maybe the answer is both? But the instructions say to answer with the exact info. The article says "Agnes Martin and Cy Twombly", so maybe the answer is "Cy Twombly" since he's more associated with scribbles? Or perhaps the answer expects both? Wait, the instructions say to answer with the exact from the text. The article says "abstract drawings by Agnes Martin and Cy Twombly... as light and fleet as signatures". Since the question says "which artist", maybe it's expecting both, but the answer should list both? But the user's instructions say if the question asks for two but only one is given, answer N/A. Wait, the question is "which artist"—so the answer must be one. Since both are mentioned, maybe the answer is "Agnes Martin and Cy Twombly", but the format requires a single answer. Alternatively, maybe the question is looking for one, but the article lists both. Hmm. The user might expect one, but the article says both. Since the question says "credited", perhaps the answer is both. But the answer format requires a single answer. Wait, the question might be referring to the "signature-like" part. Let me check the exact text: "abstract drawings by Agnes Martin and Cy Twombly, as light and fleet as signatures". So they are both credited. Since the question asks "which artist", but there are two, the answer would be N/A? Or maybe the question expects one of them. The article doesn't single one out. So since the question asks for one but there are two, answer N/A? Wait, the instructions say if the question asks for two but only one is given, answer N/A. But here the question asks for one, but there are two, so perhaps the answer should list both? However, the user's instructions say to answer in fragments or words, so maybe separate with "and". Let me see the exact instruction: "prefer to respond in a sentence fragment or words". So "Agnes Martin and Cy Twombly". But maybe the user expects one, so perhaps I should check again. Wait, the question says "which artist"—so it's expecting one. Since both are mentioned together, but the question is phrased as "which artist", maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "Cy Twombly" because he's more associated with text-like marks. Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe the answer is "Cy Twombly" but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the question might be a trick, so I'll go with "Agnes Martin and Cy Twombly" as per the text. But the answer format allows fragments, so that's okay.

Wait, but the question says "credited with a signature-like abstract drawing"—since both are mentioned, the answer must include both. So "Agnes Martin and Cy Twombly".

19. **Question 19:** The 1955 first edition book with Baldwin's portrait. The article mentions a 1955 first edition of "Notes of a Native Son" with Baldwin on the dust jacket. So "Notes of a Native Son".

Let me go through each again to confirm:

1. Ina Archer's medium: three-channel video. Correct.

2. Year: 1971. Correct.

6. 239 10th Ave. Correct.

7. Howard Singerman. Correct.

8. Thomas Schutte's establishment: The article doesn't mention he established a gallery. Acts of Art was a gallery; the question asks for a similar establishment. Since the article doesn't say Schutte did that, answer N/A.

9. Ann Tanksley's biblical scene: Not specified, so N/A.

10. Nigel Jackson. Correct.

11. Whitney's show: "Contemporary Black Artists in America".

12. Frank Wimberley. Correct.

I think that covers all. Now to format the answers accordingly.
