Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to be careful and make sure I only use the information from the article provided. Let me start by going through each question and checking the text for the answers.

1. The first question asks for the total number of enslaved people in Brooklyn's seven townships according to the 1811 census referenced by John Jea. Wait, the article mentions a 1786 census document for Brooklyn's seven townships that counts 2,669 white inhabitants and 1,317 slaves. But John Jea's account is from 1811. The question might be mixing up the years. Let me check again. The article says: "A 1786 census document for Brooklyn's seven townships counts 2,669 white inhabitants and 1,317 slaves." So the 1811 is Jea's account, but the census number is from 1786. Since the question specifically asks about the 1811 census that John Jea referenced, but the article doesn't mention a 1811 census, only his account. The census data given is from 1786. Therefore, the answer here would be N/A because the 1811 census isn't referenced for the count.

2. The second question is about the prominent Dutch family's historic house in Marine Park where Mercy learned to read. The article mentions the Lefferts family in the context of Mercy's bill of sale. It says the historic house in Marine Park is part of the Lott family's commemorations. Wait, the Lott family? The article says: "the Lott family name is commemorated in an elaborate oversize family tree in the center's collection; a historic house in Marine Park; and a three-block street in Downtown Brooklyn." So the historic house in Marine Park is the Lott family's, not Lefferts. But the bill of sale for Mercy was from the Lefferts family. The question is asking which family's house had the hidden room where Mercy learned to read. The article states the bill of sale was for Mercy owned by a Lefferts family member, but the house in Marine Park is Lott's. The article doesn't mention a hidden room, so maybe the question is conflating. Since the house in Marine Park is Lott's, but Mercy's owner is Lefferts, perhaps the answer is Lott? Or is there confusion? The article says the Lefferts family owned Mercy. The house in Marine Park is Lott's. The question might be incorrect, so the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "Dutch family's historic house in Marine Park" which is Lott's. The article doesn't mention Mercy's learning in that house. The bill of sale mentions teaching Mercy to read, but the location isn't specified. Therefore, answer N/A.

3. The third question asks how many members of the Afro-American Historical and Genealogical Society were interviewed by The Brooklyn Eagle about their methods. The article mentions that the group contributed to the show and that members were at the exhibition's opening, but there's no mention of them being interviewed by the Eagle. The Eagle article mentioned was the 1897 interview with Samuel Anderson. So no info on the number of members interviewed, so N/A.

4. The fourth question is about the year the Center changed policy to allow Black genealogists access. The article doesn't mention any specific policy change date, so N/A.

5. The fifth question asks which street in Downtown Brooklyn was renamed after Samuel Anderson. The article says the Lott family has a three-block street named after them. Samuel's name was nearly forgotten, but there's no mention of a street being renamed for him. So N/A.

6. The sixth question is about the number of performers in the "Black America" exhibition. The article states "hundreds of performers," but the exact number isn't given. Since it's approximate, but the question asks for an exact number, answer N/A.

7. The seventh question asks the purchase price for Mercy in the 1814 bill of sale. The article mentions the contract but doesn't state the price. So N/A.

8. The eighth question is which Netherlands Consulate official attended the exhibition opening. The article mentions the exhibition is funded by the Netherlands Consulate's commemoration but doesn't name any official. So N/A.

9. The ninth question about the database Stacey Bell used. The article says she uses 19th-century archives and 21st-century databases but doesn't name the system. So N/A.

10. The tenth question on how many portraits were removed to make space for Mildred Jones's. The article says the Center has portraits of 19th-century burghers, and Jones's portrait is displayed alongside Lott's, but there's no mention of removing others. So N/A.

11. The eleventh question asks whose ancestor is focused on through the retired teacher's discovery, the 1897 interview, and the judge's portrait. The retired teacher is Mildred Jones, whose ancestor Samuel Anderson is mentioned. The 1897 interview was with Anderson. The judge's portrait is John A. Lott, who enslaved Anderson. So the answer is Samuel Anderson.

12. The twelfth question about the enslaved girl with a behavior promise in the display. The bill of sale for Mercy included the promise she would "behave." So Mercy.

13. The thirteenth question asks who is the chronicler countering Dutch slavery myths. John Jea's 1811 account criticized the Dutch, so his name.

14. The fourteenth question: until which year did some remain enslaved under gradual abolition? The article says the 1799 law led to some being enslaved until 1827. So 1827.

15. The fifteenth question asks which exhibition is funded by the European consulate. The "Trace/s" exhibition is mentioned as funded by the Netherlands Consulate, so "Trace/s".

16. The sixteenth question about the family celebrated in Downtown Brooklyn. The Lott family has a street named there, contrasting with Anderson's erased narrative. So Lott.

17. The seventeenth question: which retired educator spurred exploration? Mildred Jones, as she's the teacher mentioned.

18. The eighteenth question: which act endangered free Black citizens? The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.

19. The nineteenth question: which society recovered Anderson's story? The New York chapter of the Afro-American Historical and Genealogical Society.

20. The twentieth question: which newspaper omitted Black laborers in 1946? The Brooklyn Eagle's 1946 feature didn't mention them.
