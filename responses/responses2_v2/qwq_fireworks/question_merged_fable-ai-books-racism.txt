Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by skimming through the article again to get the key points.

1. The first question asks which employee discovered the problematic summaries before users reported them. The article mentions that users flagged the issues, and specifically Tiana Trammell shared her summary. It says Fable started receiving complaints, but doesn't mention any employee finding it internally first. So maybe it's N/A.

2. Kim Marsh Allee, the head of community, said two users received summaries that were unacceptable. The question is how many she confirmed. The answer should be two.

3. The percentage of users opting out isn't mentioned. The article doesn't provide numbers on user actions post-controversy. So N/A.

4. The article says Gallello mentioned filters failed, but there's no specific date when he implemented them. So N/A.

5. The article mentions San Mateo County public libraries in California provided Fable access. But it doesn't say they suspended it after the controversy. It just says they offered premium access. So N/A.

6. The book club where Tiana shared her summary isn't named. The article says she shared with fellow book club members, but the name isn't given. So N/A.

7. The safeguards mentioned include disclosures, opt-out, and a thumbs-down button. That's three. The question asks how many were implemented before removing the feature entirely. The article says they introduced those safeguards before deciding to remove AI features. So 3.

8. The thumbs-down button was meant to alert the app to potential problems. The article says it would alert the app, but the question asks what role it played in identifying biased responses. The answer is it was used to alert the app.

9. The reader suggested hiring professional copywriters, but no specific name is mentioned. So N/A.

10. The article states a new app version was being submitted but doesn't give a date. So N/A.

11. The automated element causing backlash was the personalized summaries generated by AI. The article mentions the AI creates summaries, so that's the feature.

12. The interactive control introduced was the thumbs-down button to flag issues.

13. The specific suggestion was to "surface for the occasional white author" after reading Black narratives.

14. The disclosure was that summaries were generated by AI.

15. The metaphor here might be "leaving mainstream stories gasping for air" from the first example.

16. The simile comparing to a slow creature is "making me wonder if you're ever in the mood..." no, wait, the other example: "could earn an eye-roll from a sloth" â€“ that's the one about disability books.

17. The reader noted the AI capitalized "Black" but not "white," showing imbalance.

18. The public institution was San Mateo County public libraries in California.

19. The feature causing issues was the AI-generated summaries meant to be fun sentences from book descriptions.

20. The action taken after the social media exposure and user exodus was removing all AI features, including summaries and year-end wraps.

Okay, let me verify each answer against the text to make sure I didn't miss anything.

1. Employee first discovered? No info, N/A.

2. Kim confirmed two, yes.

3. No percentage given, N/A.

4. No date for filters, N/A.

5. San Mateo didn't suspend, just offered access, so N/A.

6. No book club name, N/A.

7. Three safeguards: disclosures, opt-out, thumbs-down. So 3.

8. Thumbs-down role: alert app to potential problem, yes.

9. No name, N/A.

10. No date, N/A.

11. The summaries, so the AI's personalized summaries.

12. Thumbs-down button.

13. The suggestion to read white authors.

14. AI disclosure.

15. The "gasping for air" metaphor about mainstream stories.

16. Sloth simile.

17. Capitalizing Black but not white.

18. San Mateo County libraries.

19. The summaries feature.

20. Removing AI features.

That should cover all.
