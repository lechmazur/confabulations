merged_tko-saudi-arabia-boxing-league.txt
Okay, I need to go through each question one by one and find the answers strictly from the provided article. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks how many millions in management fees TKO earned from previous boxing league partnerships before the Saudi deal. The article mentions that TKO would earn management fees of close to $30 million a year if the deal is completed. But this is about the new deal, not previous ones. There's no info on prior partnerships, so the answer is N/A.

2. The second question is about which former U.S. president introduced Dana White to Turki al-Sheikh at the Madison Square Garden event. The article says Trump was there with al-Rumayyan and Musk, but it doesn't mention an introduction between White and al-Sheikh by Trump or any other president. So N/A.

3. The third question is about the total amount Saudi paid for Ring Magazine. The article states that Turki al-Sheikh purchased Ring Magazine but doesn't mention the price. So N/A.

4. The fourth question asks who replaced Yasir al-Rumayyan as governor of the PIF after the UFC talks began. The text doesn't mention any replacement, so N/A.

5. The fifth question is about revenue from the Boxing Grand Prix's first year. The article talks about creating the Grand Prix but doesn't give revenue figures. N/A.

6. The sixth question asks the percentage of TKO's equity given to Meta when White joined their board. The article says White joined Meta's board but doesn't mention equity stakes related to that. N/A.

7. The seventh question asks the first European venue for the new league's debut. The article mentions the U.S. and Europe but no specific city. N/A.

8. The eighth question is about the settlement amount Endeavor paid to restore their relationship after returning $400 million. The article says they returned $400 million but doesn't mention paying anything else. So N/A.

9. The ninth question asks the number of weight divisions in the initial league. The article doesn't specify this. N/A.

10. The tenth question is about the minimum purse guarantee TKO set. The article mentions fighters' revenue shares but not specific guarantees. N/A.

11. The eleventh question asks Dana White's personal revenue percentage from the deal. The article says TKO gets management fees and revenue shares but doesn't specify White's personal cut. N/A.

12. The twelfth question refers to a Muhammad Ali Act clause that's a hurdle. The article states that boxing requires a separation between manager and promoter per the Act, which is a hurdle compared to UFC's model. So the answer is the clause mandating separation between manager and promoter.

13. The thirteenth question is about the hosting fee for the inaugural Boxing Grand Prix. The article says Saudi is expected to pay more, with two fights bringing over $40 million, but doesn't specify for the WBC event. N/A.

14. The fourteenth question asks attendance at the MSG event. The article doesn't provide attendance numbers. N/A.

15. The fifteenth question projects Saudi's investment increase by 2034. The article mentions Vision 2030 but no specific projected billions. N/A.

16. The sixteenth question asks the percentage UFC fighters demanded before settling for $375M. The article says fighters claimed UFC suppressed pay and settled for $375M, with docs showing UFC paid under 20% to fighters. Since boxing fighters get over 50%, the UFC's was under 20%, so the answer is less than 20% or 20%? The exact figure mentioned is "less than 20%", so 20% is the threshold, but the exact answer is under 20. The question asks what percentage they demanded, but the article says fighters claimed UFC paid less than 20, but the settlement's demand isn't specified. The question might be tricky here. The answer is N/A because the demand isn't stated, only the actual payout. So N/A.

17. The seventeenth question about the cancer type treated in Antigua. The article mentions an unproven blood filter used to treat cancer patients, but doesn't specify the type. So N/A.
