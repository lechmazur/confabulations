Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to make sure each answer is directly from the text or logically inferred.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions "12 million acres of Nevada to solar, including by one estimate 220,000 acres in the Amargosa Basin." So the answer is 220,000.

2. **Question 2**: Mark Jacobson says transportation is the largest portion of emissions. The text states, "More than a quarter of the country's emissions come from the transportation sector."

3. **Question 3**: Naomi Fraga studies plants like the Amargosa niterwort. She reached out to Donnelly over Tiehm's buckwheat. The article says she worked on Tiehm's buckwheat which was the catalyst.

4. **Question 4**: The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is sued by Donnelly and the Center. The question mentions Bruce Jabbour's support for Ioneer's mine, which the BLM approved.

5. **Question 5**: The Green Path North was the transmission line Donnelly opposed. The article says his first major fight was against Green Path North. But the question asks for the name of the project that led him to join the Center? Wait, the article states he joined the Center for Biological Diversity in 2017 after opposing the Ruby Mountains oil drilling. The Green Path North was his first fight, but when did he join the Center? The article says he opposed Green Path North before joining? Wait, the article says "his first major conservation fight was against the Green Path North... He joined the Center for Biological Diversity in 2017." So the transmission line project that prompted him to join the Center? No, joining the Center was later. The question says "the transmission line that he worried would harm the California desert. He joined the Center for Biological Diversity in 2017..." So the transmission line project's name is Green Path North. The question asks for the name of the transmission line project that prompted him to join the Center? Wait no, the question says "designed to deliver wind and solar energy to Los Angeles, that prompted Donnelly to join the Center for Biological Diversity". Wait, the article says he joined the Center in 2017, and his first major fight was against Green Path North. But the question's wording is tricky. The answer is Green Path North.

6. **Question 6**: The Smackover Formation in Arkansas is mentioned as Exxon's first lithium project. Also, Trump approved a mine near the Oregon-Nevada border with the nation's largest lithium deposit. Wait, the article says "one of Donald Trump's last actions during his first term was to approve a mine near the Oregon-Nevada border, where the nation's largest known lithium deposit lies." But the Smackover Formation is in Arkansas. The question asks for the formation in Arkansas that's also where the largest deposit was approved. Wait, the text says the largest deposit is near Oregon-Nevada, but the Smackover is in Arkansas. The question is asking for the formation in Arkansas that is also home to the nation's largest deposit approved by Trump. Hmm, maybe there's confusion here. Wait, the text says "the nation's largest known lithium deposit lies" near Oregon-Nevada, but the Smackover Formation in Arkansas is mentioned as Exxon's first project. The question says "formation in southern Arkansas... also home to the nation's largest known lithium deposit approved by Trump." But the largest deposit is in Oregon-Nevada, not Arkansas. So maybe the question has a mistake, but according to the article, the Smackover Formation is in Arkansas, and the largest deposit's location was approved by Trump. The answer should be Smackover Formation.

7. **Question 7**: Fraga contacted the Amargosa Conservancy (then directed by Donnelly) in 2015. The article states she wanted to get involved beyond fieldwork and contacted Donnelly, who was the director of the Amargosa Conservancy at the time.

8. **Question 8**: Donnelly set up Google Alerts for lithium projects. The article says he used Google Alerts, which first revealed Rover's location. The answer is Google Alerts.

9. **Question 9**: The Inflation Reduction Act is mentioned as part of Biden's legislation. The question asks for the legislative act that set green projects in motion. The article says "President Joe Biden's signature piece of legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act..."

10. **Question 10**: The town is Pahrump, where Donnelly shopped. The article states Rover initially said the mine was in Pahrump but later it was near Ash Meadows.

11. **Question 11**: The ban was made a week before Trump's inauguration. The article says "With a week until Trump's inauguration, the Biden administration granted a temporary two-year ban..." So month and year is January 2025 (since Trump's second term would be 2025? Wait, the article mentions Trump's second inauguration, implying he was re-elected. The article's timeline: In June 2024, Donnelly was at a meeting. The ban was in January 2025, a week before Trump's inauguration.

12. **Question 12**: Donnelly began monitoring in 2021. The article says "Since 2021, he has set up 30 or so Google Alerts..."

13. **Question 13**: The mining firm claimed their project was outside "any area of environmental concern." The article quotes Rover's response to Donnelly's Twitter message: "We are well outside any area of environmental concern."

14. **Question 14**: The endangered resource is groundwater, as the aquifer sustains species. Donnelly mentioned the carbonate aquifer system.

15. **Question 15**: The plant is Tiehm's buckwheat. The article states their joint focus was on this plant.

16. **Question 16**: The answer is Donnelly, as he's known for lawsuits. The question asks who initiates litigation over environmental review failures. The article mentions Donnelly's lawsuits against BLM.

17. **Question 17**: The method using acid is leaching with sulfuric acid. The article describes this method as blasting rock and using acid.

18. **Question 18**: Laura Daniel-Davis is mentioned as the acting deputy secretary under Biden, who talks about balancing conservation and energy. The question is about who critics mistakenly attribute the federal role to.

19. **Question 19**: Donnelly warned of a "speeding freight train" collision with biodiversity, so the consequence is devastation or collision.

20. **Question 20**: Amargosa Valley is the town with anti-government sentiment opposing the mine. The article mentions Amargosa Valley residents opposing Rover.
