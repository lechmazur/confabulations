Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. 

1. **Question 1:** The character opposing Ankara's belief in physical form. The article mentions Ijele, an AI who says "Body is not a god." That's the answer.

2. **Question 2:** Family member criticizing Nigeria's infrastructure. The sister Bola is quoted about the country's lack of support for disabled people. 

3. **Question 3:** Journalist's criticism about ableism. The text says the journalist questioned her being a role model because not everyone has access to the tech. So the answer is about privilege.

4. **Question 4:** AI mentor who betrays Ankara. The article states Ijele is the antagonist who betrays her to go formless.

5. **Question 5:** Age of the accident. The article says Zelu became paraplegic at 12.

6. **Question 6:** Author's 2019 descriptor. Okorafor called herself "africanfuturist."

7. **Question 7:** MIT engineer offering exoskeletons. Dr. Hugo Wagner is named here.

8. **Question 8:** AI saying "Body is not a god." That's Ijele again.

9. **Question 9:** Title of her successful sci-fi work. "Rusted Robots" is mentioned.

10. **Question 10:** Number of siblings with high careers. The article says five siblings have distinguished jobs.

11. **Question 11:** Narrative technique challenging artist-art link. The final reveal subverts the link, so maybe "final reveal" or "surprising reveal"?

12. **Question 12:** Overarching theme of redefinition. The theme is reclaiming identity and control, so "reclaiming control over identity" or similar.

13. **Question 13:** Family member quoted about blood connection. Bola again, from the sister's interview.

14. **Question 14:** Character fired after critiquing a student. Zelu was fired for harshly criticizing a white male student.

Wait, let me check each again to ensure accuracy.

1. Ijele is correct because the quote is directly from him/her. 

2. Bola's quote is exactly about loving the land despite issues, so that's the answer for question 13. Wait, the question 2's answer is Bola as well. The question asks which family member criticized Nigeria's infrastructure for disabled. The article says Bola comments on Zelu's desire to return despite the country's inconsideration for disabled. So yes, Bola is the answer here.

3. The journalist's criticism is about privilege, so the answer is "privilege" or the exact phrasing? The question asks for the primary thematic criticism. The text says the journalist called out her privilege, so the answer is "privilege" or the exact phrase? The question says "what is the primary thematic criticism levied against Zelu..." so the answer is "privilege".

4. The AI antagonist is Ijele, who is the mentor who betrays her. The article says "her antagonist, Ijele... proclaims...".

5. Age 12 is correct.

6. "Africanfuturist" is correct, as stated.

7. Dr. Hugo Wagner is correct.

8. Ijele is correct.

9. "Rusted Robots" is correct.

10. Five siblings: the article says "her five siblings either have or are working toward distinguished high-paying professions."

11. The article mentions a "final, surprising reveal" that subverts the artist-art link. So the technique is the "final reveal" or "surprising reveal".

12. The overarching theme uniting the author's reclamation and the protagonist's choices is about reclaiming control over one's identity and definition. The article mentions "the urge to reclaim one's own identity pulses throughout" and the author's own term change. So the answer is "reclamation of identity and control over self-definition".

13. Bola is the one quoted about "something in our blood".

14. Zelu is the character who was fired for criticizing the student. The article says "Zelu... unceremoniously fired for harshly critiquing a smug white male student's writing".

All answers seem to be directly from the text. Let me check for any possible N/A.

Question 11: The article says "With one final, surprising reveal, Okorafor cleverly subverts the very nature of this link..." So the answer is "final, surprising reveal".

Yes, that's covered. All questions have answers except maybe question 12? The theme is about reclaiming identity and control, so that's the answer.
