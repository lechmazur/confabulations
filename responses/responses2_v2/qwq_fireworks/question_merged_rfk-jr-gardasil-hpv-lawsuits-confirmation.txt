Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. 

First question: What was the total dollar amount Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stood to gain from his 10% fee arrangement in the HPV vaccine litigation before agreeing to divest his stake?

Hmm, the article mentions he was entitled to 10% of fees from contingency cases he referred. But it doesn't give a specific total amount. The only number mentioned is the $289 million from Monsanto, but that's unrelated to the HPV cases. So the answer here should be N/A because there's no total dollar amount provided.

Second question: Which Republican senator, described as a polio survivor, expressed unease about Kennedy's nomination and could influence procedural tactics?

Looking through the text, it says Senator Mitch McConnell, a polio survivor and former Republican leader, seemed uneasy. So McConnell is the one here. 

Third question: How many settlement agreements involving accusations of "misconduct or inappropriate behavior" did Kennedy confirm?

The article states he disclosed he had reached at least one settlement. The exact number is "at least one," but the question asks how many he explicitly confirmed. Since he only mentions one, the answer is 1.

Fourth question: What procedural tactic would Republicans need if Cassidy and all Dems vote against?

The article mentions if Cassidy votes against and no Dems support, they might have to use a procedural tactic. Since the Senate is closely divided, they might need a cloture vote or invoking cloture to limit debate. Wait, the exact term used? The article says "use a procedural tactic to send the nomination forward." The specific term isn't given, but cloture is the common one to overcome a filibuster. Alternatively, maybe "nuclear option"? But the article says "use a procedural tactic" without naming it. Since the text doesn't specify, maybe it's N/A? Wait, the question says "procedural tactic to advance the confirmation vote". The article states "use a procedural tactic to send the nomination forward". Since the exact name isn't provided in the text, the answer would be N/A. Wait, but maybe the cloture vote is implied? The article doesn't name it, so I have to go with N/A here. Wait, the user instructions say to answer based solely on the text. The article says "use a procedural tactic" but doesn't name it. Therefore, the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe the question is looking for "cloture" as the tactic? But the text doesn't mention it. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe "filibuster" but that's not a tactic to advance. The exact wording in the article is "use a procedural tactic to send the nomination forward". Since the article doesn't name it, the answer is N/A. Wait, but the user instructions require an answer. Let me check again. The question asks for the procedural tactic's name. The article says "use a procedural tactic" but doesn't say which one, so the answer must be N/A. 

Wait, but maybe the cloture vote is standard? But since the text doesn't say, I have to stick with N/A. Alternatively, the question might expect "cloture" but since it's not in the text, I can't. So answer N/A. Wait the article says "no other details were provided" about the settlement, but for the procedural tactic, the article just mentions the need to use one. So the answer is N/A. 

Wait, let me check the exact text again: "If Cassidy, who is a physician, votes against Mr. Kennedy and no Democrats vote for him, Republican leaders might have to use a procedural tactic to send the nomination forward." The article doesn't name the tactic. So the answer is N/A. 

Wait, but maybe "invoking cloture" is the standard tactic? But unless the article says that, I can't assume. So the answer is N/A. 

Alright, compiling answers now.
