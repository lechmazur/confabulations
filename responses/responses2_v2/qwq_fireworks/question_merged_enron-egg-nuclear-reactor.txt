Okay, I need to go through each question and find the answers based strictly on the provided article. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks which Silicon Valley executive's presentation style Daniel Wong emulated during the nuclear egg announcement. The article mentions Connor Gaydos standing on a stage dressed and sounding a bit like Steve Jobs. However, the question is about Daniel Wong. Wait, the article says that during the announcement, Daniel Wong was the CTO who spoke about the 20% enriched uranium. But the presentation style part refers to Gaydos being like Steve Jobs. The question is about Daniel Wong's style. Hmm, the article doesn't mention Wong's presentation style, so maybe this is a trick. Since the article only says Gaydos emulated Jobs, the answer would be N/A for Daniel Wong.

2. The second question is about the maximum power output capacity of the Enron Egg. The article says the reactor could power a home for up to 10 years, but doesn't mention power output in terms of watts or similar. So N/A.

3. The third question asks in which quarter of 2021 Connor Gaydos registered the trademark. The article says he bought the trademark but doesn't specify the date or quarter. So N/A.

4. The fourth question is how many former Enron execs endorsed the revival. The article doesn't mention any endorsements from former execs, so N/A.

5. The fifth question asks the percentage of Birds Aren't Real followers who invested. The article doesn't provide any data on investments from followers, so N/A.

6. The sixth question is which government agency approved the reactor. The article states it's a parody, and no agency is mentioned, so N/A.

7. The seventh question about the retail price isn't mentioned in the article. N/A.

8. The eighth question on pre-orders in the first 24 hours: article doesn't give numbers. N/A.

9. The ninth question asks which major energy company blocked the trademark. The article doesn't mention any company opposing the trademark, so N/A.

10. The tenth question is about the percentage of enriched uranium. The article says the CTO mentioned 20%, which is the answer. So 20.

11. The eleventh question asks for another residential dwelling besides suburban. The article says "residential suburban use," but no other type is mentioned. N/A.

12. The twelfth question: the trademark for a wearable item associated with military. The article lists "dog tags for wear by humans," so dog tags.

13. The thirteenth question: financial instrument beyond crypto. The article mentions crypto services but not others. Wait, the question says "intended to offer" beyond crypto. The article doesn't mention another, so N/A? Wait, the article says "crypto currency services, though one wonders..." but no other financial instruments are listed. So N/A.

14. The fourteenth question: beverage besides fruit drinks and punches. The article lists "fruit drinks and punches" as part of the trademark applications. The only other is mentioned in the list? Wait, the article says "fruit drinks and punches" and "crypto currency services" but not another beverage. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The article says: "fruit drinks and punches. Also: crypto..." So N/A for another beverage.

15. The fifteenth question: kitchen utensil beyond cookie cutters. The article lists cookie cutters, paper plates, and others. The other items include "golf tees, puppets, and crypto..." So maybe "cookie cutters" are listed, but the question asks for another. The article mentions "tote bags, cookie cutters, paper plates, polo shirts, golf tees, puppets..." Wait, kitchen utensils: cookie cutters are one, but others? The article says "kitchen utensil beyond cookie cutters" but the other items listed aren't kitchen utensils except maybe none. So N/A.

16. The sixteenth question: sporting equipment, typically used on a course. The article mentions "golf tees," which are used in golf, a course sport. So golf tees.

17. The seventeenth question: printed material beyond paper plates. The article lists "tote bags, cookie cutters, paper plates, polo shirts, golf tees, puppets..." So printed material like paper plates, but another? The article also mentions "terms of use" on the website, but that's not a product. The items listed include "tote bags" which are printed but maybe not "printed material." The question might refer to something like posters or cards? The article doesn't mention that. So N/A? Wait, "paper plates" are printed, but another printed material? The article says "paper plates" so perhaps nothing else. So N/A.

18. The eighteenth question: toy associated with children. The article mentions "puppets," so puppets.

19. The nineteenth question: the quarter when Gaydos vowed to release the product. The article says "by the end of Quarter 1," so Q1.
