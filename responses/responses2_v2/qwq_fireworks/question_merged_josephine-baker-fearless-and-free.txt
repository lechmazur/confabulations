Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to be careful to only use the information given and avoid any outside knowledge.

1. **Question 1:** How many years after her initial success in Paris did Baker perform for the survivors at Buchenwald? The article says her initial success was in the late 1920s, and Buchenwald was liberated in 1945. The memoir excerpts go up to the war years. The text mentions her performing at Buchenwald after liberation. Let me calculate: from late 1920s (say 1927) to 1945 is about 18 years. The answer is 18 or maybe 17? Wait, the article says Buchenwald was "just-liberated," so exact years might not be given. The question might require exact. The article says "recorded between 1926 and 1949" and Buchenwald was in 1945. So from her initial success (late 20s) to 1945 is roughly 17-18 years. But the question is how many years after her initial success in Paris. The article says she became a superstar in the late 1920s. Let's say 1927 to 1945: 18 years. So answer 18? Wait, the question says "as described in her memoir reviewed by Lesley M. M. Blume". The article states she performed at Buchenwald after liberation. The liberation was 1945. Her initial success was in the late 1920s. The exact year isn't given, so maybe it's N/A? Wait the question might not require exact number. Wait the article says "recorded between 1926 and 1949" so the Buchenwald part is in the war years. The answer might be 17 years (1945-1928). Hmm, but the article says "after the war", so maybe 1945. Since the initial success is late 1920s, the exact number isn't given, so perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "set off riots of sanctimonious protest — across Europe" in the late 1920s. Then Buchenwald performance was during the war? Wait no, the article says "Buchenwald death camp: 'Someone needed to try and distract them, restore their hope,' she says, describing "the poor souls there — the dying, skeletons, ghosts with burning fevers." The camp was liberated in 1945. The text says "after the war" she toured the US in 1948. Wait, but the Buchenwald part is part of her wartime experiences? The article says "recounts the flagrant racism she encountered while touring the United States in 1948". The Buchenwald part is mentioned as a separate event. The article says "Baker recounts singing in the just-liberated, typhoid-racked Buchenwald death camp". So that was around 1945. Her initial success was in the late 1920s. The exact number of years isn't provided. Since the question requires an exact number, but the article doesn't specify, maybe it's N/A. Wait, perhaps the time from her initial success (late 1920s) to 1945 is about 17-18 years. The article doesn't give exact years, so the answer is N/A. But maybe the article says "recorded between 1926 and 1949". The Buchenwald account was part of the war years, so maybe 19 years (from 1926 to 1945). Wait, but her initial success in Paris was in the late 1920s. Maybe the answer is 18 years? Hmm, not sure. The article might not give the exact years, so I'll put N/A. Wait the question says "as described in her memoir", so maybe the memoir mentions the time difference? The article says "FEARLESS AND FREE: A Memoir, by Josephine Baker... recorded between 1926 and 1949" and "beginning in 1926 and continuing through the war years." The Buchenwald event would be in the war years (during WWII, so up to 1945). Her initial success was in the late 1920s, so the difference between late 1920s and 1945 is roughly 17-18 years. Since the article doesn't state the exact years, maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, tricky. Let me check the article again: "FEARLESS AND FREE: A Memoir | By Josephine Baker | Tiny Reparations | 282 pp. | $32 Back to the Courtroom: The novelist Scott Turow is 75. Rusty Sabich, the now-retired prosecutor he introduced in "Presumed Innocent," is 77 -- and taking on a new case in "Presumed Guilty." Mining Her Country's Nightmares: In her fiction, Han Kang has probed at the seams of South Korea's historic wounds. The Nobel laureate's latest novel, "We Do Not Part," delves into why atrocities must be remembered. A 'Renaissance' in African Publishing: A new ecosystem of publishers, bookstores, literary magazines and festivals is promoting African writers and changing the stories told about the region. A Turn to Reality: Nnedi Okorafor, an award-winning science fiction and fantasy writer, explores a traumatic event in her most autobiographical novel yet. The Book Review Podcast: Each week, top authors and critics talk about the latest news in the literary world. Listen here." So the main article is about Baker's memoir. The article says "Baker recounts singing in the just-liberated, typhoid-racked Buchenwald death camp". The liberation was in 1945. Her initial success in Paris was in the late 1920s (the late 1920s part is from the first paragraph: "In mid-1920s Paris, she redefined..." but she was a superstar by late 1920s. So from say 1927 to 1945: 18 years. Since the article doesn't specify exact, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, perhaps the memoir's timeframe is from 1926 to 1949, so the Buchenwald part is 19 years after 1926. But the question is about initial success, which might be 1926. Hmm, maybe the answer is 19. But I'm not sure. Wait the question says "initial success in Paris". The article says "In mid-1920s Paris, she redefined..." so maybe mid-1920s, like 1926. So from 1926 to 1945 is 19 years. So the answer is 19? Maybe that's it. Let me tentatively put 19. But I'm not 100% sure.

2. **Question 2:** What aspect of American society did Walter Winchell find more reprehensible than Europe's post-war atrocities? The article says Baker's remarks on Harlem's conditions led Winchell to accuse her of antisemitism. Wait the question says "according to Baker's memoir, what aspect... did Winchell find more reprehensible than the atrocities witnessed in post-war Europe?" Wait, the article states that Baker's comments on Harlem led Winchell to accuse her of antisemitism. But the question is about what aspect of American society Baker described that Winchell found worse than Europe's atrocities. Wait the text says "Baker recounts the flagrant racism she encountered while touring the United States in 1948: 'After the war and so much unprecedented atrocity, after so much misery,' she says, 'it's heartbreaking. And I'm furious.' Yet despite Baker's righteous fury at what she saw as America's 'race policy' — which she describes as 'more insidious, more hideous' than Nazi Germany's — she reserves equal ire for the New York Jews..." Then Walter Winchell accused her of antisemitism citing remarks in the memoir. So the aspect of American society that Baker described as worse than Nazi Germany's policies was America's race policy. So Winchell was criticizing her for her antisemitic statements, not agreeing that race policy was worse. Wait the question is phrased as "according to Baker's memoir, what aspect... did Walter Winchell find more reprehensible than the atrocities witnessed in post-war Europe?" Wait, no. The article says Baker's memoir describes her view that the US race policy was worse than Nazi Germany's. Winchell's criticism was about her antisemitic remarks. The question is asking what aspect of American society, according to Baker's memoir, did Winchell find more reprehensible than post-war Europe's atrocities. The answer would be the race policy, but the question is about Winchell's view. Wait, no. The article says that Baker claimed the US race policy was worse than Nazi Germany's. Winchell accused her of antisemitism because of her comments on Jewish landlords. The question is asking, per Baker's memoir, what aspect of American society did Winchell consider more reprehensible than the European atrocities. Wait the article says "Baker's memoir" includes her view that the US race policy was more hideous than Nazi Germany's. But Winchell was criticizing her for antisemitism, not agreeing with that view. So maybe the answer is N/A because Winchell's opinion isn't stated. Alternatively, the question might be a trick. The article says Baker's memoir states that she thought the US race policy was worse. The question is asking what aspect Baker's memoir says Winchell found more reprehensible. Since Winchell accused her of antisemitism, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased as per Baker's memoir, so the aspect she described as more hideous (race policy) is what Winchell found worse? No, Winchell was against her comments, not agreeing. The answer is N/A. Wait the question is "according to Baker's memoir, what aspect of American society... did Walter Winchell find more reprehensible..." The article doesn't state Winchell's view on that, only that he accused her of antisemitism. So the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** In what city did Baker experience the "cold fever" of the sweating ground? The article says she described her time as a homeless, teenage performer in NYC: "The ground sweated at night; a cold fever." So the city is New York City.

4. **Question 4:** What symbolic item from her early career was carried in her funeral? The article mentions her banana belt as part of her early career. "her banana belt gyrations might have faded from memory if she had not crushed it as a French Resistance fighter..." So the banana belt was part of her early career. The funeral procession had her flower-covered coffin, but the question is about an item carried through Paris streets. The article says "when she died in 1975, thousands lined the Paris streets to glimpse her funeral procession; the police locked arms to restrain crowds as her flower-covered coffin was driven by." It doesn't mention the banana belt being carried. The question asks what symbolic item representing her early career was carried. The article doesn't say, so maybe N/A. Wait the first paragraph says "her banana belt gyrations" were part of her early career. The article mentions "the police locked arms to restrain crowds as her flower-covered coffin was driven by." Maybe the coffin had something, but the symbolic item isn't mentioned. The answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "as noted by Ijeoma Oluo in the foreword." The foreword by Oluo is mentioned in the article: "In a separate foreword to this new edition, the author Ijeoma Oluo takes a crack at reconciling Baker's language..." The article doesn't mention Oluo discussing the coffin's contents or items carried. So answer N/A.

5. **Question 5:** What honor by Macron prompted Marcel Sauvage to begin compiling her memoir? The article says that in 2021, Baker was inducted into the Pantheon by Macron. But the memoir was compiled by Sauvage starting in 1926. The question asks what honor prompted Sauvage to start compiling. Since the Pantheon induction was in 2021, long after Sauvage's work (which started in 1926), the answer is N/A. The honor wasn't the reason for Sauvage's work.

6. **Question 6:** What literary technique did Peggy Caravantes say Baker used? The article states: "Baker had always commandeered her own narrative... her various recountings... have created headaches... Peggy Caravantes... 'Her memories became more and more fanciful, more romantically embellished... I'm not sure that, by the end of her life, Josephine herself could separate fact from fiction.'" So the technique is "fanciful, romantically embellished" or "embellishments". The question asks for the term used by Peggy Caravantes, which is "fanciful, more romantically embellished" but the technique would be "embellishments" or "fanciful storytelling". The article says "embellishments" are mentioned as Baker's own term ("I improve on life"), but Caravantes refers to her memories as "fanciful, more romantically embellished". So the technique is "embellishments" or "fanciful embellishments". The question says "literary technique... used to describe her experiences touring the US in 1948". The answer is "embellishments".

7. **Question 7:** What emotion felt by the crowds at her funeral was also felt by her regarding Harlem conditions? The article says crowds were so moved that police had to lock arms. The emotion Baker felt was "heartbreaking" and "furious". The question is what emotion the crowds felt that was also hers. The article says the police had to restrain crowds, so the emotion might be "furious" or "heartbreaking". But the text says Baker felt "heartbreaking. And I'm furious" about Harlem. The crowds at her funeral were perhaps emotional, but the article doesn't state their emotion. The question says "emotion... also felt by the crowds who witnessed her funeral procession, according to police reports". The article only mentions the police locking arms, not their feelings. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** What establishment did Baker frequent in NYC before fame, similar to Scott Turow's "Presumed Guilty"? The article mentions she was homeless in NYC, maybe she frequented places like shelters? But the question says "mentioned in the review of 'Fearless...' did Baker frequent... mirroring the setting of Scott Turow's 'Presumed Guilty'?" The article says "Presumed Guilty" involves Rusty Sabich, a retired prosecutor taking a new case. The setting might be a courtroom. The article says Baker was homeless in NYC, so maybe she frequented streets or shelters, but the text doesn't mention specific establishments. Alternatively, "Presumed Guilty" is a legal drama, so maybe the answer is N/A. The question is unclear, but since the article doesn't link Baker's NYC places to Turow's book's setting, answer N/A.

9. **Question 9:** What decoration awarded for her wartime service did she liken to the Rainbow Tribe? The article says she was a decorated war hero. The decoration isn't named, but the Rainbow Tribe was her adopted children. The question asks what decoration she likened to the Rainbow Tribe. The article says "emerged from the conflict a decorated war hero and an outspoken civil rights activist" but doesn't say she compared the decoration to the Rainbow Tribe. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** What literary prize was awarded to Baker for her memoir's contribution to understanding US race policy? The article mentions Han Kang won the Nobel Prize, but Baker's memoir is by her. The article doesn't mention any literary prize for Baker's memoir. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** What internal state did she aim to reinstate among Buchenwald survivors? The article says she sang there to "distract them, restore their hope". The internal state is "hope".

12. **Question 12:** What garment was absent in her impoverished childhood? The article says "My childhood was the type where you have no stockings. I was cold, and I danced to keep warm". So stockings.

13. **Question 13:** What policy did she say was more hideous than Nazi Germany's? The article states she called the US race policy "more insidious, more hideous" than Nazi Germany's.

14. **Question 14:** Which interviewer's work is responsible for the memoir's impressionistic account? The article says the memoir is compiled from interviews by Marcel Sauvage starting in 1926.

15. **Question 15:** Which national leader praised her upon Pantheon induction? President Macron.

16. **Question 16:** What metaphor did she use for NYC's nighttime? The article says "The ground sweated at night; a cold fever." So "sweating ground".

17. **Question 17:** What term describes her adoptive family as a symbol of unity? The "Rainbow Tribe".

18. **Question 18:** What did Baker claim to justify her narrative alterations? She said "I don't lie. I improve on life."

19. **Question 19:** Which commentator contextualized her language on intercommunal issues? Ijeoma Oluo.

20. **Question 20:** What financial benefit does the publisher get from purchases via the site? Affiliate commission.
