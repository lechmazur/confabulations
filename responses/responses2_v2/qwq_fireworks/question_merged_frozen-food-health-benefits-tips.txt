Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks which vitamin showed the most consistent increase across all tested frozen vegetables compared to fresh. The article mentions a 2015 study where frozen corn, green beans, and blueberries had higher vitamin C than fresh. Vitamin E was higher in frozen green beans, peas, blueberries, and spinach. Frozen broccoli had higher B2. The question is about the "most consistent increase." Since vitamin E appears in four items (green beans, peas, blueberries, spinach) and vitamin C in three (corn, green beans, blueberries), maybe vitamin E is more consistent. Wait, but the question specifies vegetables, so blueberries are fruits. Let me check. The study included eight types: strawberries, spinach, broccoli, corn, carrots, peas, green beans, blueberries. So blueberries are fruits. The vegetables would exclude strawberries and blueberries. Then, for vegetables: vitamin C in corn, green beans (veg). Vitamin E in green beans, peas, spinach. B2 in broccoli. So vitamin E shows up in three vegetables (green beans, peas, spinach) and B2 in one. So the most consistent would be vitamin E. But the question says "across all tested vegetables"—maybe the answer is vitamin E? But I need to check the text again. The article says "frozen green beans, peas, blueberries and spinach were higher in vitamin E than fresh versions." So vitamin E is higher in four items (including blueberries, which is a fruit). Since the question specifies vegetables, maybe the answer is vitamin E because it's in three vegetables (green beans, peas, spinach), while vitamin C is in two vegetables (corn and green beans). So the answer would be vitamin E? Wait, the question says "most consistent increase across all tested vegetables." Alternatively, maybe the answer is vitamin C? The article says "frozen corn, green beans and blueberries, for example, had significantly higher levels of vitamin C than their fresh counterparts." The "for example" might imply there are others, but the text lists vitamin C in three items. The vitamin E is higher in four items (including blueberries). But since blueberries are fruits, maybe the answer is vitamin C for vegetables. Hmm. Wait the question says "vegetables"—so blueberries (fruit) are excluded. So for vegetables, vitamin C is in corn and green beans. Vitamin E in green beans, peas, spinach. So vitamin E is higher in three vegetables. Therefore, the most consistent would be vitamin E. But the question says "across all tested vegetables"—maybe the answer is vitamin E. Let me check the exact wording again. The article states: "the vitamin E levels in frozen green beans, peas, blueberries and spinach were higher than in the fresh versions. And the vitamin B2 levels were also higher in frozen broccoli versus fresh." So for vegetables (excluding blueberries), vitamin E is in three (green beans, peas, spinach), B2 in broccoli (one), and vitamin C in corn and green beans (two). So vitamin E is the most consistent. The answer should be vitamin E.

2. **Question 2**: How many miles does locally-grown produce typically travel before reaching consumers during peak growing season? The article mentions a 2003 study stating produce travels nearly 1,500 miles on average. But that's before reaching consumers, not specifying local vs. seasonal. The question is about locally-grown during peak. The article says "fresh peach in February, when it is not locally in season, it will probably have been picked at a faraway farm and then transported many miles..." So the 1,500 is average, but for locally-grown during peak, maybe it's less, but the article doesn't give a number. The question is about locally-grown, which the text doesn't provide a specific mileage. The 1,500 is for conventionally grown, not local. So answer N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Temperature for thawing before air frying. The text says Dr. Wallace recommends thawing under lukewarm water, then draining and drying. The question asks for the temperature. The answer is lukewarm. But the question is about the temperature, so "lukewarm" is the answer. Wait, the question says "temperature did Dr. Wallace recommend for thawing..." so "lukewarm" is the temperature. So answer: lukewarm.

4. **Question 4**: Which Brooklyn-based nutritionist conducted the original study? The article mentions Maya Feller as a dietitian in Brooklyn, but the study was done by the researchers in the 2015 study. The article doesn't name the specific researcher who conducted it. The question is incorrect because the study's authors aren't mentioned. So answer N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Percentage cost savings for frozen blackberries. The article says average prices of fruits like blackberries are lower when frozen, but no specific percentage is given. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Month with greatest nutritional difference for peaches. The article says the differences are greatest during off-seasons. For a peach in February (off-season), so the answer is February.

7. **Question 7**: How many times to rinse frozen veggies? Ms. Barone says "frozen spinach takes the work out of... multiple rinses and blanching." So "multiple" is mentioned, but the question is about rinsing before cooking. The answer is "multiple," but the question asks "how many times"—the article says "multiple rinses" but doesn't specify a number. So N/A, since it's not a specific number.

8. **Question 8**: Maximum storage duration using double-bag method. The text says Dr. Wallace uses double bags if they're "going to be in there a long time," but doesn't specify the duration. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Cooking method preserving vitamin C. The article doesn't mention specific cooking methods preserving vitamin C. However, it says frozen are better because they're picked at peak. The only cooking tips are about texture. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Temperature threshold causing nutrient loss. The article doesn't mention any specific temperature threshold. It talks about time and transport but not temperature during storage. So N/A.
