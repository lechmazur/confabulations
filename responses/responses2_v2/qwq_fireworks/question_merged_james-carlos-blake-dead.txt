Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly what's asked. Let's go through each question carefully.

1. **First literary magazine that published Blake's short story about his twin brother's death?** The article mentions he wrote an essay for The New York Times about his twin, but it doesn't say it was a short story or the magazine. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Years between leaving snake-catching job and publishing "The Pistoleer"?** He worked as a snake catcher during teenage years, then enlisted in the Army, went to college, got a master's, then published his first novel in 1995. The exact years aren't given, so can't calculate. N/A.

3. **Name of the dance hall where parents met?** The article says they met at a dance hall but doesn't name it. N/A.

4. **Which wife inspired the protagonist in "The Friends of Pancho Villa"?** The article doesn't mention any of his wives inspiring characters. N/A.

5. **Title of essay about grandmother and Mexican Revolution?** The essay mentioned is about his twin, not the Revolution. N/A.

6. **Month in 1985 Cormac McCarthy congratulated Blake?** The article says Blake's "In the Rogue Blood" won the LA Times Prize, but McCarthy's "Blood Meridian" was 1985. No info on McCarthy congratulating him. N/A.

7. **Maid's name who killed his twin?** The article says a maid was carrying him but only mentions her as "a maid" and the grandmother told him. No name given. N/A.

8. **Number of Apache scalps collected?** The article lists types of violence but no specific number. N/A.

9. **Final salary as a professor at Bowling Green?** Not mentioned. N/A.

10. **Character based on great-grandfather the pirate?** The article says Blake's ancestor was a pirate, but doesn't link to a specific character in the Wolfe series. N/A.

11. **University giving honorary doctorate?** No mention of any honorary degree. N/A.

12. **Number of times as paratrooper equal to marriages (4)?** The article says he was a paratrooper once, but marriages were four. The question says "served as a paratrooper" the same number as marriages, but he was a paratrooper once (enlisted, so probably one stint). So 1 vs 4. So N/A.

13. **Prize for "The Pistoleer"?** The article mentions "In the Rogue Blood" won the LA Times Prize, but not "The Pistoleer". So N/A.

14. **Sequel to "In the Rogue Blood"?** The article says he wrote more novels later, including the Wolfes series, but no sequel named. N/A.

15. **Type of snake he caught near Everglades?** The article mentions snake catcher but no specific type. N/A.

16. **Maid's name responsible for twin's death?** Same as question 7. N/A.

17. **Paternal grandfather's rank in Mexican Army?** His father's father was a colonel. The article says Blake's father's father was a colonel. So "colonel".

18. **Year he won Pulitzer for borderlands novel?** The article doesn't mention a Pulitzer. N/A.

19. **First short story published in a magazine named like a weather phenomenon?** The article lists Glimmer Train, Quarterly West, etc., but none named after weather. N/A.

20. **Editor's name at Firsts magazine?** The article mentions the interview in Firsts but not the editor's name. N/A.
