Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks what illness Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attributed to the substance in the regurgitalite. The article mentions Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the section about aluminum in vaccines, where he blames aluminum for allergies and other illnesses. The regurgitalite is vomit, which contains sea lily parts, not aluminum. Since the question links his claim to the regurgitalite's substance, but the article doesn't connect them, the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The person describing the vomit as the "most famous piece of puke" is Dr. Jesper Milan. The article states he works as the curator of the Geomuseum Faxe. His field is related to geology or museums, so the answer is "curator" or "geomuseum work." But the question asks for the field. Since the article says he's a curator, maybe "museum curation" or "geology." Wait, the exact wording is "works in" his field. The article mentions he's a curator, so his field is geology or museum work. The article says "curator of the Geomuseum Faxe," so his field is geology or museum curation. The answer should be "geology" or "museum curator"? The exact answer might be "museum curator" but the question might expect "curator" as the field. Alternatively, the article says he's a curator, so his field is in geology (since it's a geology museum). But the question is phrased as "field," so maybe "geology" is better. Wait, the exact quote is "Jesper Milan, the curator of the Geomuseum Faxe." So his work is as a curator in a geology museum. The answer is "curator" or "geology"? The question says "field," so perhaps "geology" is the field. Hmm. Alternatively, the article doesn't explicitly state his field beyond being a curator. The answer might be "curator" but the question might expect "geology." Let me check again. The article says "Dr. Milan, the curator of the Geomuseum Faxe." His work is in geology, so the field is geology. So answer: geology.

3. **Question 3:** The question asks what scientists discovered from asteroid Bennu samples related to Jesper Milan's discussion. The article mentions that scientists studying Bennu samples found organic molecules linked to how life arose. The sea lilies part is separate. The answer is "organic molecules that shed light on how life arose."

4. **Question 4:** The reporter covering the Port Jackson shark's regurgitalite is Victor Mather, as the article starts with his byline. The answer is Victor Mather.

5. **Question 5:** The Danish island where danekrae was found is Zealand, per "Cliffs of Stevns... on the Danish island of Zealand." So answer: Zealand.

6. **Question 6:** The substance in Cliffs of Stevns is vomit (regurgitalite). The article mentions aluminum in vaccines as the substance Robert F. Kennedy Jr. talked about. But the question asks what's found in the cliffs. The regurgitalite is vomit, so the substance in the cliffs is sea lily parts. The article doesn't mention aluminum there. So the question is incorrect, answer N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The amateur fossil hunter who found the substance (danekrae) is Peter Bennicke. The article says he discovered the vomit. The substance here refers to the sea lilies' remains, so answer is Peter Bennicke.

8. **Question 8:** The town where the substance (danekrae) is displayed is Geomuseum Faxe in Faxe, which is 48 miles south of Copenhagen. The question mentions the substance Robert F. Kennedy Jr. blamed (aluminum), but danekrae is vomit. Since the question links the displayed substance to aluminum, which is not related, answer N/A. Wait, the question says "the substance that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. blamed for allergies" which is aluminum, but the article states that the museum displays the vomit. Since they're different substances, answer N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The UNESCO site where drug trials are happening is the Cliffs of Stevns? The "Sick in the Name of Science" section mentions drug trials involving volunteers, but the article doesn't link that to a UNESCO site. The Cliffs of Stevns are the UNESCO site, but the drug trials are a separate section. So answer N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The substance in Germany that journalists like stories about would be regurgitalites (vomit). The article says Dr. Milan knows of 150M-year-old finds in Germany, and journalists like vomit stories. So answer: regurgitalite or vomit. Since the question asks for the name, the scientific term is regurgitalite but the article uses "vomit" often. The question might expect "regurgitalite" but the article mentions "fossilized vomit" and "regurgitalite" as the formal term. The answer is regurgitalite.

11. **Question 11:** The UNESCO site involved in the 150M-year-old German regurgitalite isn't mentioned. The article only says Germany has older finds, but doesn't name a site. Answer N/A.

12. **Question 12:** The organic molecules from Bennu are linked to how life arose, but the sea lilies' indigestibility isn't connected. The question links them, but the article doesn't. Answer N/A.

13. **Question 13:** The Geomuseum is 48 miles south of Copenhagen. The question asks how many miles north? Since it's south, the answer would be negative, but the article says "south," so the distance north is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick. Answer N/A.

14. **Question 14:** The drug trials using volunteers for aluminum-induced effects are mentioned in the "Sick in the Name of Science" section. The answer is "drug trials that purposely make people vomit, shiver and ache." The specific name is not given, so the answer is the trials themselves, but the question asks for the name. Since there's no name, answer N/A. Wait, the section title is "Sick in the Name of Science: Since the pandemic, drug trials..." but no specific name. Answer: drug trials (but the question asks for the name, so N/A).

15. **Question 15:** The bird flu milestone contradicts pandemic predictions. The article says scientists say a pandemic isn't inevitable but the outbreak passed milestones. The exact milestone isn't stated, so N/A.

16. **Question 16:** The connection between Peter's discovery and drug trials: the article doesn't link them. The vomit story is separate from the drug trials section. Answer N/A.

17. **Question 17:** The number of danekrae specimens before 2023: the article says this is the first find in Denmark. So prior to this, there were 0. Answer: 0.
