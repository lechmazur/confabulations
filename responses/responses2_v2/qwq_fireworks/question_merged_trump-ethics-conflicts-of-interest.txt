Okay, I need to answer these 20 questions based solely on the provided article. Let me go through each question one by one and check the article for the answers.

1. **How many millions of dollars in Secret Service room charges did the Trump Organization agree to refund from the first administration as part of the new ethics agreement?**
   - The article mentions "More than a million dollars in such bills accumulated during Mr. Trump's first term" and that they will provide discounted rates. But it doesn't say they agreed to refund any amount. The question is about refunding, which isn't mentioned. So answer N/A.

2. **Which former Trump administration official did William A. Burck represent during the Mar-a-Lago classified documents investigation?**
   - The article states Burck represented Bannon and Priebus in the special counsel investigation. So the answer is Stephen K. Bannon and Reince Priebus. Wait, but the question asks for "official" (singular). Maybe either one is acceptable, but the question might expect both? But the instruction says to answer exactly. The question says "which official", so maybe the answer is "Stephen K. Bannon" since he's listed first. But the article mentions both. Hmm, but the question might accept either. Wait, the question is about the Mar-a-Lago investigation, which is the one about classified documents. The article says he represented Bannon and Priebus in the special counsel (Russian interference) investigation. The Mar-a-Lago case is a different one. Wait, the article says "He represented a number of witnesses in the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, such as the former Trump White House aides Stephen K. Bannon and Reince Priebus." The classified documents case is a separate one. The user might have mixed up. The question is about the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case. But the article says Burck interviewed to represent Trump in that case but declined. So he didn't represent any officials in that case. So the answer would be N/A because the question is about representing a former official in that case, but the article only mentions he represented Bannon and Priebus in a different investigation (Russian interference). So the answer is N/A.

3. **What percentage discount did the Trump Organization commit to providing government agencies for hotel rooms under the new ethics agreement?**
   - The article says they will provide "discounted rates" but doesn't specify a percentage. So N/A.

4. **How much did the State Democracy Defenders Fund calculate the Trump family would save in taxes through the new ethics structure?**
   - The article mentions the fund but doesn't state any tax savings calculation. N/A.

5. **What was the minimum dollar threshold William A. Burck set for reviewing international business deals involving the Trump Organization?**
   - The article says Burck reviews transactions over $10 million. So $10 million.

6. **Which foreign government official's stay at Trump properties triggered the new profit donation policy mentioned in the ethics agreement?**
   - The policy applies to stays by diplomats or delegations from foreign governments. The article mentions the Saudi-sponsored golf tournament, but the policy is for stays. No specific official is named as triggering it. So N/A.

7. **What role did Richard W. Painter play in developing the Trump Organization's new ethics guidelines?**
   - The article says Painter criticized them but didn't help develop. He was a former Bush ethics lawyer. So N/A.

8. **How many members of the Trump family signed the legally binding commitment to avoid conflicts of interest?**
   - The article doesn't mention the number of signatories. N/A.

9. **What monthly reporting requirements did the ethics agreement establish for tracking foreign government payments to Trump properties?**
   - The article doesn't specify monthly reports. It mentions donating profits from such transactions but no monthly requirement. N/A.

10. **Which regulatory agency did William A. Burck previously work for that qualified him to oversee cryptocurrency-related conflicts?**
    - The article mentions Burck's role but doesn't say he worked for a regulatory agency related to crypto. The crypto part is about World Liberty Financial, but Burck's background isn't linked to that. N/A.

11. **Which federal building's lease default led to preliminary discussions about the Trump family potentially regaining control of a hotel that previously hosted foreign diplomats and lobbyists during the first administration?**
    - The article mentions the Trump International Hotel in Washington (now Waldorf Astoria), whose lease was sold and the buyers defaulted. So the answer is Trump International Hotel in Washington.

12. **What constitutional clause did Richard W. Painter reference when criticizing the Trump family's decision to host a Saudi government-sponsored golf tournament at Trump National Doral in April?**
    - Painter mentions the emoluments clause. The article says "emoluments clause of the Constitution" which prohibits accepting value from foreign governments. So the answer is the Emoluments Clause.

13. **How many countries are explicitly named in the article as locations for recent Trump family real estate deals involving branded hotels or resorts, excluding Saudi Arabia?**
    - The article mentions Dubai, Vietnam, and Saudi Arabia. Excluding Saudi, that's two countries: Dubai is part of UAE, so UAE and Vietnam. But the article says "Dubai, Vietnam and Saudi Arabia" so excluding Saudi leaves two countries (Dubai as part of UAE counts as a country? Wait, Dubai is a city in UAE. The question might count UAE as a country. So total two countries (UAE and Vietnam). So answer 2.

14. **Which Trump-owned property is mentioned as the venue for a LIV Golf tournament that ethics lawyers argue violates the emoluments clause due to its foreign government sponsorship?**
    - Trump National Doral resort in Miami.

15. **What financial threshold triggers a mandatory review by the outside ethics lawyer appointed under the Trump Organization's new agreement for property acquisitions or sales?**
    - Over $10 million.

16. **Which federal agency is responsible for regulating the cryptocurrency company World Liberty Financial, creating a potential conflict unaddressed by the Trump family's ethics agreement?**
    - The SEC, as it's mentioned the SEC chair is being named by Trump, and the company is in crypto, which SEC regulates.

17. **What is the name of the publicly traded social media platform mentioned in the article that could allow stock buyers to financially benefit Mr. Trump through market manipulation?**
    - Truth Social.

18. **Which former White House ethics lawyer created an organization to track legal issues in the new administration and criticized the Trump family's self-imposed limitations as ineffective?**
    - Norman L. Eisen.

19. **What specific monetary amount did the Trump family agree to donate from profits generated by foreign government stays at their properties, as outlined in the ethics pledge?**
    - The article says they donate profits from such transactions but doesn't specify an amount. N/A.

20. **Which federal law explicitly exempts the president and vice president from divesting holdings that could create conflicts of interest, as referenced in the article?**
    - The article mentions they are exempt from federal conflict of interest laws. The exact law name isn't given, but the Emoluments Clause is mentioned. Wait, the article says "the president is legally exempt from federal conflict of interest laws". The question asks for the law's name. The article doesn't state the law's name, so N/A. Wait, but the question might be referring to the Emoluments Clause? The Emoluments Clause is part of the Constitution, not a federal law. The article says "the president is still subject to the so-called emoluments clause of the Constitution". The exemption from conflict of interest laws is different. Since the question asks for the federal law that exempts them, but the article doesn't name the law, so answer N/A.
