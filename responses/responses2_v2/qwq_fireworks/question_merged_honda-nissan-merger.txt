Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information given and answer strictly according to the instructions.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions that some Honda executives were "sour on the idea of merging with Nissan." It says "a number of executives at Honda were sour," but doesn't provide a percentage. Since there's no specific data on polling, the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The article states the merger was meant to "share the financial burden" but doesn't mention specific billions of dollars in cost savings projected. No number given, so N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The text doesn't mention any investment banks advising the companies. No info, so N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The article compares their sales numbers (3M vs 4M) but doesn't state market cap difference. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** No mention of a government official recommending the merger. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The article talks about cuts to global operations but doesn't specify the number of manufacturing facilities to be consolidated. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The proposed holding company name isn't mentioned. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** No current Nissan board member with prior Honda experience is named. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The article says talks are ongoing and nothing formal until earnings reports next week, but no specific deadline mentioned. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The article mentions Nissan's restructuring cuts but doesn't state the number of layoffs. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Honda required Nissan's restructuring progress as a condition. The specific milestone related to Europe isn't detailed. N/A.

12. **Question 12:** No third-party supplier named in the text. N/A.

13. **Question 13:** The article mentions a drop in sales but doesn't specify consecutive years in North America. N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Honda wanted a bigger say but the exact equity percentage isn't stated. N/A.

15. **Question 15:** The article mentions Bangkok and Tokyo but doesn't name a Southeast Asian country as an obstacle. N/A.

16. **Question 16:** The timeline for the subsidiary proposal isn't dated. N/A.

17. **Question 17:** No VW executive is quoted. N/A.

18. **Question 18:** The article mentions Nissan's restructuring and battery tech but no specific patent portfolio. N/A.

19. **Question 19:** No government agency mentioned intervening. N/A.

20. **Question 20:** The article notes share price changes (Nissan down 5%, Honda up 8%) but not the numerical market cap difference. Without exact numbers, can't calculate, so N/A.

All questions require N/A except maybe some? Wait, let me check again.

Looking back, the article says "Honda pushed for a structure that would give it a bigger say in the holding company and proposed that Nissan become its subsidiary -- a plan that Nissan rejected." But no percentage equity (Q14). Also, Nissan's sales drop and restructuring, but no specific milestones (Q11). The other points don't have the required data. So all answers are N/A except maybe some? Wait, no, all the questions don't have answers in the text. The article doesn't provide numbers for any of the questions except maybe the sales figures (3M vs 4M), but that's not for Q4 (market cap difference). So all answers must be N/A.
