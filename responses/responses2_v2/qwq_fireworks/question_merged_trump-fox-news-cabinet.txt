Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict instructions. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks which former Fox News medical expert who covered the pandemic was appointed to lead Operation Warp Speed 2.0. The article mentions Dr. Janette Nesheiwat as the one who explained the Covid pandemic to Fox viewers and is nominated for surgeon general. However, the question is about Operation Warp Speed 2.0, which isn't mentioned in the text. The article says she's nominated for surgeon general, not a specific operation. So the answer might be N/A because the role isn't stated as leading that operation.

2. The second question is about how many meetings Trump had with CNN and NBC execs at Mar-a-Lago. The article mentions a meeting with Fox News executives (Wallace and Suzanne Scott) but doesn't mention CNN or NBC executives meeting there. So it's N/A.

3. The third question asks the primary reason Jay Wallace gave for Peter Doocy's change in style. The article says Wallace attributed changes to Trump's openness, so the answer is Trump's relative openness with the media.

4. Fourth question: Which Fox alumnus did Trump criticize but nominate due to Republican pressure? The text mentions Morgan Ortagus. Trump said she fought him but has Republican support, so the answer is Morgan Ortagus.

5. Kimberly Guilfoyle's role at Fox before her admin position. The article lists her as among those going to the administration but doesn't specify her Fox role. So N/A.

6. How many Fox employees were terminated due to defense department positions? The article says Fox terminated contracts for anyone tapped by Trump, but doesn't specify numbers for the defense department alone. So N/A.

7. Duration of the Mar-a-Lago meeting? The article says the Jan 7 meeting was off the record and participants declined to comment. No duration given, so N/A.

8. Monica Crowley's role in State Department. The article says she's headed to State but doesn't specify her exact position there. So N/A.

9. Percentage of cabinet nominees from Fox? The article states 19 and counting, but doesn't give a percentage. So N/A.

10. When did Tulsi Gabbard join Fox? The article says she left a Fox gig in August (no year given) before being nominated. The question asks when she first joined, which isn't specified. So N/A.
