Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict formatting rules. Let's start with question 1.

1. The first question asks how many minutes into "Alarum" the character described as a bargain-bin Ryan Reynolds first appears. The article mentions that Sylvester Stallone appears after almost 25 minutes. Since Scott Eastwood is compared to Ryan Reynolds, I think that's the character in question. The article says we wait almost 25 minutes for Stallone's character, implying Eastwood's character is there from the start. Wait, the question is about the "bargain-bin Ryan Reynolds" which is Joe, played by Scott Eastwood. The article says "we'll wait almost 25 minutes to experience the soupcon of pleasure his world-weary assassin, Chester, provides. Until then, we're stuck with the blandly boring Scott Eastwood..." So Eastwood's character is present from the beginning, so his first appearance is at 0. But the question is about when he first appears. Wait, maybe the question is a trick? The answer might be 0, but the article says "until then, we're stuck with Eastwood", meaning he's there from the start. The question might be a bit confusing. Wait, the question is about the character described as a bargain-bin Ryan Reynolds (Joe) first appearing. Since the article says that before Stallone's Chester appears at 25 minutes, Eastwood's Joe is already there. So the answer is 0? But the question says "how many minutes into the movie does he first appear?" Since the movie starts with him, it's 0. But maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the question is about when the character Chester appears, but no, the question specifies the "bargain-bin Ryan Reynolds" which is Joe (Eastwood). So the answer is 0? Wait the article says "we'll wait almost 25 minutes to experience the soupcon of pleasure his world-weary assassin, Chester, provides. Until then, we're stuck with the blandly boring Scott Eastwood..." So Eastwood's character is present from the start. So the first appearance is 0. But the question is phrased as "how many minutes into..." So the answer would be 0, but maybe the article says "almost 25 minutes to experience" Chester, so Joe is there from the start, so the answer is 0. Hmm, but maybe the question is a trick. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about when the character Chester first appears. Wait no, the question specifically refers to the "bargain-bin Ryan Reynolds" which is Joe. So the answer is 0? But the user might have intended the 25 minutes as when Chester appears, so Joe is there before that. So the answer is 0, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick, and the answer is 25, but that's when Chester appears. Wait, the question is about Joe (the "bargain-bin Ryan Reynolds") first appearance. Since the article says "until then, we're stuck with...", that implies Joe is there from the start. So the answer is 0. But the question might have a different interpretation. Let me check again. The article says "we'll wait almost 25 minutes to experience... Chester". So before that, Joe is already present. So the answer is 0. But the question is phrased as "how many minutes into the movie does the character... first appear?" Since the movie starts with him, the answer is 0. But maybe the question is a trick and the answer is 25? Wait no, that's Chester's appearance. The question is about Joe. So 0 is correct. But maybe the article says "almost 25 minutes to experience" so maybe the first 25 minutes are before Chester appears, so Joe is there from the start. So the answer is 0. Hmm. Let's proceed and note this in the other section.

2. The second question asks about the type of surgery performed by Willa Fitzgerald's character. The article mentions "impromptu stomach surgery" in the rating section. Since she's the wife, that's the surgery. So answer is impromptu stomach surgery.

3. The question asks besides "Alarum", another production with a supervillain killing his own men. The article mentions Mike Colter as a supervillain in "Alarum" who kills his own men. But the question is about another production. The article says Colter's role in "Evil" is mentioned. So "Evil" is the series where he was a priest. But the question is about another production that features a supervillain. Wait, the article says "Colter's hot, tormented priest in the fabulously wicked series 'Evil' (2019-24) is praying..." So "Evil" is the other production where Colter played a different role (the priest), but the question is about another production that features a supervillain. Wait, the question is asking besides "Alarum", what other production has a supervillain who kills his own men. Since Colter is the supervillain in "Alarum", but the question is about another production. The article doesn't mention another production with a supervillain, so maybe N/A? Wait, the question might be referring to "Evil" but that's a series where he was a priest, not a supervillain. So the answer is N/A because the article doesn't mention another production besides "Alarum" with such a supervillain. Hmm, the question is tricky. Alternatively, maybe "Evil" is the answer, but it's not a production featuring a supervillain who kills his own men, since in "Evil" he's a priest. So N/A.

4. The streaming service for Tom Green's new projects is mentioned as Amazon Prime Video, as per the first paragraph after the review: "Tom Green's Return: The Y2K-era phenomenon... is back in the spotlight with a flurry of new projects for Amazon Prime Video." So the answer is Amazon Prime Video.

5. The European city where the majority of action takes place is described as "bleakly undifferentiated East European locations". The article doesn't specify a city name, so answer N/A.

6. The name of the series with Mike Colter as the priest is "Evil" (2019-24). The question is in the same section as Tom Green's projects, which is the "What to Watch" section after the movie review. The "Evil" series is mentioned there, so the answer is Evil.

7. The character tasked with terminating Joe in "Alarum" is Chester, played by Sylvester Stallone. The question asks for the character's name, so Chester.

8. The profession of Willa Fitzgerald's husband before joining Alarum: the article says Joe and Lara have been rogue agents for five years. So before joining Alarum, he was an agent. But the question is before he allegedly joined Alarum. Since they were rogue agents before, perhaps he was an agent (presumably a spy) before going rogue. The article says "Joe and his slinky German wife, Lara... have been rogue agents for five years, after a meet-cute..." So before going rogue, they were agents. But the question is about before he allegedly joined Alarum. Wait, the article says Joe is suspected of having joined Alarum, so before that, he was a rogue agent. The question is "what is the profession... before he allegedly joined the intelligence network known as Alarum?" Since being a rogue agent is part of his profession, but maybe the answer is spy or agent. The article refers to them as rogue agents, so the profession is spy/agent. But the exact term in the article is "rogue agents", so maybe "spy" is acceptable. The question asks for the profession, so "spy" or "agent". The article says "smarmy spy, Joe", so spy is correct.

9. The weapon mentioned alongside code names and cleaning crews is "inexhaustible gun magazines" from the R rating description. The question asks for the weapon, so gun magazines? Or maybe "guns"? Wait, the article says "Rated R for inexhaustible gun magazines and impromptu stomach surgery." So the weapon is guns, but the exact term is "gun magazines" (which are ammunition). The question asks for the weapon, so perhaps "guns", but the article lists "inexhaustible gun magazines" as part of the rating, so maybe the answer is "gun magazines". Alternatively, the question is about weapons used in the plot elements listed with code names and cleaning crews. The plot elements are "code names and cleaning crews, drone strikes and shootouts." So the weapons would be guns (shootouts), drones. The question is which is mentioned alongside code names and cleaning crews. The article says "the bullet-riddled plot is a flavorless tossed salad of code names and cleaning crews, drone strikes and shootouts." So the weapons here are drones and shootouts (guns). The question asks for the weapon mentioned alongside code names and cleaning crews. The code names and cleaning crews are part of the plot elements, while the weapons are drones and shootouts. But the question might be looking for "guns" as part of shootouts. Alternatively, the exact term from the rating is "gun magazines". Since the question says "mentioned alongside code names and cleaning crews", the answer is "drone strikes and shootouts" but the question asks for the weapon. Maybe "guns" (since shootouts imply guns). Alternatively, the answer is "guns" or "drones". Wait, the question says "what weapon... is mentioned alongside code names and cleaning crews?" The article lists "code names and cleaning crews, drone strikes and shootouts." So the weapons here are drone strikes and shootouts. The question asks for the weapon, so perhaps "guns" (since shootouts involve guns). Alternatively, the answer could be "drones" but that's part of the list. The question might expect "guns" as the weapon. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "guns" because the plot is bullet-riddled. Alternatively, the exact term from the rating's "gun magazines" is part of the R rating, which is mentioned in the article. The question is about the plot elements, so perhaps the answer is "guns" (from shootouts). Hmm, tricky. Let me check the exact wording again. The plot is described as "a flavorless tossed salad of code names and cleaning crews, drone strikes and shootouts." So the weapons used in the plot would be drones and guns (shootouts). The question asks for the weapon mentioned alongside code names and cleaning crews. The code names and cleaning crews are part of the plot elements, while the drone strikes and shootouts are also part of the list. The question wants the weapon from that list. So the weapons are drones and guns (shootouts). Since the question is singular, maybe "guns" is the answer. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "drones and shootouts", but the question says "what type of surgery...", no, wait, the question is about the weapon. Alternatively, the weapon mentioned in the R rating is "gun magazines", but that's part of the rating, not the plot elements. The article says "Rated R for inexhaustible gun magazines and impromptu stomach surgery." So the weapon in the rating is gun magazines (ammunition). But the question is about the plot elements. Hmm, perhaps the answer is "guns" as in shootouts. Alternatively, the question might have a different answer. Let me think again. The question is asking for the weapon mentioned alongside code names and cleaning crews in the plot. The plot elements are code names, cleaning crews, drone strikes, and shootouts. So the weapons here are drones and guns (shootouts). The question asks for the weapon, so maybe "guns" (since shootouts imply guns). Alternatively, the answer is "guns" or "drones". Since the question uses "weapon" singular, maybe "guns". Alternatively, the answer is "drones and shootouts" but that's two items. The question might expect "guns" because the plot is bullet-riddled, implying guns. Alternatively, "guns" is the answer.

10. The name of Scott Eastwood's character, described as having the personality of a spent bullet casing, is Joe. The article says "smarmy spy, Joe".

11. The character who stabilizes the movie briefly, appearing after 25 minutes, is Chester, played by Stallone.

12. The actor lamented for his brief appearance as a supervillain, who had a previous role in "Evil" as a priest, is Mike Colter.

13. The spy with little personality is Joe (Scott Eastwood), contrasted with Chester the assassin.

14. The female character who claims to be the best trained killer is Lara (Willa Fitzgerald).

15. The duration mentioned for waiting before the assassin (Chester) appears is almost 25 minutes.

16. The project for Tom Green on Amazon Prime is not named, but the question refers to "the title of this project". The article only mentions "new projects for Amazon Prime Video" without specific titles. So answer N/A.

Wait, the question says "what is the title of this project?" but the article doesn't name the specific project, just mentions "new projects". So answer N/A.

17. The streaming platform highlighted both for Tom Green's comeback and among the best offerings is Amazon Prime Video (mentioned in Tom Green's part) and the "Streaming Guides" section mentions Amazon Prime as one of the platforms. So the answer is Amazon Prime Video.

18. The runtime is 1 hour 35 minutes.

19. The intelligence network is Alarum.

20. The operative tasked with terminating the ally is Chester (Sylvester Stallone's character).

Now, let me check each answer again against the article to ensure accuracy.

1. The first question's answer is 0? Wait the article says "we'll wait almost 25 minutes to experience the soupcon of pleasure his world-weary assassin, Chester, provides. Until then, we're stuck with the blandly boring Scott Eastwood..." So Eastwood's character is present from the start, so first appearance is 0. But the question is about the "bargain-bin Ryan Reynolds" (Joe) first appearance. So the answer is 0. But maybe the user expects 25? No, that's when Chester appears. So 0 is correct.

2. impromptu stomach surgery.

3. N/A because the other production is "Evil" but that's not a supervillain role.

4. Amazon Prime Video.

5. N/A.

6. Evil.

7. Chester.

8. spy (since he's a smarmy spy).

9. guns? Or "drone strikes and shootouts" but the question asks for the weapon. Alternatively, the exact term from the R rating is "gun magazines", but that's part of the rating, not the plot elements. The plot elements include shootouts (guns). So "guns".

10. Joe.

11. Chester.

12. Mike Colter.

13. Joe.

14. Lara.

15. almost 25 minutes (so answer is "almost 25 minutes" or "25 minutes". The question says "nearly a certain time", so the duration is 25 minutes. The answer should be "25 minutes".

16. N/A because the project's title isn't given.

17. Amazon Prime Video.

18. 1 hour 35 minutes.

19. Alarum.

20. Chester.
