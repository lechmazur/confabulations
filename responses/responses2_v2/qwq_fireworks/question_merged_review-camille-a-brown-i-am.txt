Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly.

1. The first question asks about the opening of "I AM" resembling a fusion of majorette and classical dance elements by another choreographer. The article mentions "as if majorette dancing met Twyla Tharp's 'In the Upper Room'". So the answer should be "In the Upper Room".

2. The second question is about a section in "I AM" that mirrors the style from "Hell's Kitchen". The article says Camille choreographed "Hell's Kitchen" and "Gypsy" on Broadway. But the article doesn't mention any specific section in "I AM" linked to "Hell's Kitchen". So maybe N/A? Wait, the user might think of her Broadway style, but the article doesn't specify a section. Hmm, probably N/A.

3. The third question is if "ink" had a robotic voice like "I AM", what instruction referencing another TV show would it have? The robotic voice in "I AM" references "Lovecraft Country". The article doesn't mention another TV show linked to "ink", so N/A.

4. The fourth question asks which other dancer besides Camille had spiritual fervor to a classic song. The article mentions Curtis Thomas to "Papa Was a Rollin' Stone" in "Throwback #1". So Curtis Thomas.

5. The first installment of the trilogy was from 2012 ("Mr. TOL E. RAncE" started the trilogy). So 2012.

6. The prop contributing to the atmosphere besides lighting. The article says "a blanket of fog" is used. So fog.

7. Educational guides for earlier works might include West Coast Swing. The article mentions West Coast Swing in the closing news, but "I AM" doesn't mention it. Since the question is hypothetical, but the article says West Coast Swing has few traditional markers. So the aspect would be "few traditional markers of swing".

8. The ballet with anniversary and female artistic journey. The article mentions Maria Tallchief's centennial and NYCB. Her role as a prima ballerina and Balanchine muse. Maybe "Maria Tallchief" but the ballet's name isn't given. The question asks for the ballet's name, but the article doesn't specify which one. So N/A.

9. Another NYC venue for Balanchine works. The Joyce Theater is mentioned, but NYCB's home is City Center or the Ballet's theaters. So maybe New York City Ballet's venue, but the exact name? The article says NYCB is where Tallchief was a muse. So "New York City Ballet" venue? But the question is about a venue, like City Center? Not sure, but the article doesn't specify. N/A?

10. Influence of "Lovecraft Country" leads to a dance style absent in its universe. The article mentions "I AM" uses Lindy Hop, voguing, etc. Since "Lovecraft Country" is set in the past, maybe a modern style like voguing? But the question says "incorrectly attributed". Wait, the article says "Lovecraft Country" inspired the robotic voice. The narrative universe might not have voguing? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe West Coast Swing, but it's mentioned later. The question is tricky. N/A.

11. African diasporic dance incorrectly attributed to a 90s music video scene. The article mentions "Throwback #1" with '90s music video and Miki Michelle. The dance styles listed there include Lindy Hop, voguing, stepping, breaking. The geometric projections might be confused with a different style. The question says which is incorrectly attributed. Maybe voguing? But the article says voguing is present. Hmm. Maybe "stepping" is part of the scene, but the article says "flashes of Lindy Hop, voguing, stepping, breaking". The question is about an incorrect attribution. Maybe the answer is "Lindy Hop" if it's not part of the '90s music video choreography? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the article says "Throwback #1" is '90s, so maybe breaking is from 80s? The question is unclear. Maybe N/A.

12. Musician contributing to retro-futuristic with an instrument not their primary role. The musicians are Deah Love Harriott (piano), Juliette Jones (violin), Jaylen Petinaud (drums). The article says "retro and futuristic" via geometric lighting. The robotic voice might be from the music? The violinist mirroring in Camille's solo. So Juliette Jones with violin, which is classical, but in a modern context. Maybe violin? The question asks for the musician whose instrument isn't typical for their role? Not sure. Maybe N/A.

13. Historical figure linked incorrectly to cultural liberation through ballet fusion. Maria Tallchief is mentioned as a ballet figure. The article says she's being celebrated in her centennial. Since Camille's work is about African-American identity, Maria Tallchief is a different context. So Maria Tallchief.

14. Viral dance style inaccurately described as in "Throwback #1". The closing mentions West Coast Swing as viral. The article says "Throwback #1" has '90s hip-hop and R&B. West Coast Swing isn't mentioned there. So West Coast Swing would be the incorrect one, so the answer is "West Coast Swing".

Now, let's check each again.

1. "In the Upper Room" is correct.

2. N/A because no specific section linked to Hell's Kitchen.

3. N/A.

4. Curtis Thomas.

5. 2012.

6. fog.

7. "few traditional markers of swing" but the question is about "I AM's" hypothetical guide. Since West Coast Swing is mentioned in the article's closing, but not in "I AM", the answer would be that aspect. So the answer is "few traditional markers of swing".

8. The ballet's name isn't given, so N/A.

9. N/A.

10. Maybe "West Coast Swing" since it's mentioned in the closing but not in "I AM". The question says "incorrectly described as incorporated", so yes, that's it.

11. The question asks which African diasporic dance is incorrectly attributed. The article lists Lindy Hop, voguing, etc. in the context of "I AM". The '90s section has "flashes of Lindy Hop, voguing..." so maybe Lindy Hop is part of the 90s? But Lindy Hop is from the 30s. So Lindy Hop would be the incorrect one here. So answer is "Lindy Hop".

12. The violinist Juliette Jones uses violin, which is classical, but in a modern setting. The question says "not typically associated with their primary role". Maybe the drummer plays something else? The article says "retro and futuristic" via lighting, not the instruments. Maybe N/A.

13. Maria Tallchief.

14. West Coast Swing.

Alright, let's put them in the required format.
