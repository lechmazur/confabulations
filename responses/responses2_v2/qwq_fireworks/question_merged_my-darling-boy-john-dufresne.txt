Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and answer each exactly as per the instructions. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about the Florida city where Olney worked at the Daily Sun. The article mentions "the Daily Sun of Anastasia, Fla." So the answer is Anastasia.

2. **Question 2**: The name of the priest who assaulted Sister Robbie isn't provided in the text. It just says she reported a priest's rape, but no name given. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The article states "the plots of too many of the romance novels..." but doesn't specify a number. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The 50-year-old woman mentions progressive dysphagia as her fatal condition. That's explicitly stated.

5. **Question 5**: The text doesn't mention a specific rehab facility where Cully had his longest sobriety. It talks about rehab stints but no name. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Dufresne's debut was 1994 ("Louisiana Power & Light"), and "My Darling Boy" is current (2023?), but the article says "thirty years on" from his debut. So 30 years.

7. **Question 7**: Cully was a star athlete in high school, specifically mentioned as excelling in sports. The exact sport? The article says "star athlete" but doesn't specify which. Wait, no, the article says "star athlete in high school, but then he fell into depression..." No specific sport named. Hmm, but wait, the article mentions "odd jobs at a kosher pet boarding facility called Katz Meow and a pawnshop called Pawnography". But the sport isn't specified. So N/A? Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check again. The article says: "Cully was a star athlete in high school, but then he fell into depression, self-harm and drug use." No specific sport. So answer N/A. Wait, but maybe the sport is implied? No, the text doesn't say. So N/A.

Wait, the user's instructions say to answer exactly. So if it's not there, N/A. So 7 is N/A? Wait, the article says "star athlete in high school" but not which sport. So N/A. Hmm, but maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The article: "Cully was a star athlete in high school, but then he fell into depression..." No further details. So yes, N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The owner of Pawnography isn't mentioned. The text says Cully had odd jobs there but doesn't name the owner. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The final question Olney asked before Cully ran away. The article mentions "Well-meaning Olney inadvertently asks him questions that make him feel worse about himself, such as: 'So what are your plans?' Cully bolts." So the question was "So what are your plans?"

10. **Question 10**: The number of arrests during the decade of addiction isn't specified. The text says "decade-plus of rehab stints, drug counseling, lies, thefts, arrests, A.A. meetings and disappearances." But no exact number. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The time it took Olney to track down Cully isn't mentioned. The article doesn't specify the duration. N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Why did Sister Robbie establish the boardinghouse? The text says she left the convent after her reports of rape were brushed aside. But the reason for the boardinghouse? The article just mentions she runs it now. No explicit reason given. So N/A.

13. **Question 13**: The housebound neighbor reads romance novels, as stated: "regaled with the plots of too many of the romance novels on which a housebound neighbor subsists." So romance.

14. **Question 14**: What was Cully doing at Katz Meow? The article says his odd jobs included Katz Meow, but the exact activity isn't stated. N/A.

15. **Question 15**: The writing manual is "The Lie That Tells the Truth", mentioned in the text.

16. **Question 16**: The 50-year-old woman only has progressive dysphagia mentioned. No other ailment stated. So N/A.

17. **Question 17**: Olney's career before journalism? The article says he was a retired journalist, but no prior career mentioned. So N/A.

18. **Question 18**: The debut novel's event mirroring Cully's struggles? The article says Dufresne's debut's narrator talks about stories having moral force, but the specific event? The article mentions "Louisiana Power & Light" but doesn't link it to Cully's struggles. Wait, the article says "probing at the seams of South Korea's historic wounds" for Han Kang, but for Dufresne's debut, it's about stories and memory. The user's question is about an event mirroring Cully's struggles. Since the article doesn't mention a specific event in the debut related to addiction or similar, so N/A.

19. **Question 19**: The object given for Cully's birthday. The article says Olney thought about getting him "a future?" and wanted to tell him it's not too late. But no specific object given. So N/A.

20. **Question 20**: The paranoiac who shot Olney isn't named. The text mentions a "tightly wound paranoiac at Sister Robbie's boardinghouse" but no name. So N/A.

Okay, that's all. Let me make sure each is addressed with correct answers based on the text.
