Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks for the percentage increase in profit Meta projected for the current quarter. The article mentions they gave a lighter-than-expected revenue forecast and increased spending. Looking at the article, the fourth quarter's profit was up 49%, but the current quarter's projection isn't a percentage increase—it just gives a revenue range. Since they're asking for profit percentage increase for the current quarter, the text doesn't specify that. So maybe N/A?

Wait, the question is about the projected profit increase for the current quarter. The article says Meta reported a 21% revenue jump and 49% profit increase for Q4, but the current quarter's forecast is for revenue, not profit. The profit projection isn't mentioned. So answer N/A.

2. The second question is about how much Meta agreed to donate to Trump's foundation and museum, mirroring ABC's $15M settlement. The article says ABC agreed to donate $15M to Trump's foundation and museum, and Meta's settlement followed similar terms. So Meta's $22M goes to the library, but the question asks for the amount to the foundation and museum. Wait, the article says Meta's $22M is for the library, with $3M for legal and others. ABC's $15M went to the foundation. Since the question is asking if Meta's donation mirrors ABC's terms, but Meta's allocation is different (library instead of foundation), maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "mirroring the terms"—the ABC case had the money go to the foundation. The Meta settlement's terms are similar in structure but the destination is different. The question might be a trick here. The article states that ABC's $15M went to the foundation, and Meta's $22M to the library. So the answer is N/A because the terms aren't the same in destination. Wait, the question says "mirroring the terms of the ABC News settlement"—so the amount ABC donated to the foundation and museum was $15M. The Meta settlement's terms are similar but the allocation is different. The question is asking how much Meta donated to the foundation/museum, but the article says Meta's $22M is for the library. Therefore, the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is just asking for the total amount, but the destination is different. Hmm, tricky. The question might be a bit ambiguous, but according to the article, Meta's terms are similar but the $22M is for the library. So the answer is N/A because the specific amount to the foundation isn't mentioned, only the library.

Wait, the question says "how much did Meta agree to donate to... mirroring the terms". Since ABC's terms had the money go to the foundation, and Meta's terms have it going to the library, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking the total, but the article says $22M to the library. So the answer would be N/A because the question specifies "future presidential foundation and museum", but Meta's donation is to the library, not the foundation. So N/A.

3. The third question asks for the name of the tool unveiled by DeepSeek that can gather info and synthesize reports. The article mentions OpenAI unveiled a tool called Deep Research. Wait, the article says: "OpenAI unveiled a new tool, called Deep Research..." So that's the name. But the question is about DeepSeek. Wait, the article says "the Chinese A.I. start-up DeepSeek has raised questions... created a new A.I. model... using freely available A.I. tools shared by tech companies like Meta..." But the tool named is Deep Research by OpenAI. So the answer for DeepSeek's tool isn't named here. The question is about DeepSeek's tool, but the article doesn't mention a specific tool name for DeepSeek. The only named tool is OpenAI's Deep Research. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

4. The fourth question is the total revenue from Reality Labs. The article states that Reality Labs lost $5 billion in Q4. So revenue is not mentioned, just the loss. The question is about revenue generated, but the division lost money. Since revenue isn't specified, just the loss, the answer is N/A. Because "revenue generated" would be the income, but the loss is the net. The article doesn't say revenue, only the loss. So N/A.

5. The fifth question asks what new content moderation policies Zuckerberg implemented. The article says he made sweeping policy changes to allow more types of speech and eliminated diversity initiatives. The question is about content moderation policies, so allowing more speech types is the answer. So the answer is "allowing more types of speech".

6. The sixth question is the month when George Stephanopoulos made remarks leading to the ABC settlement. The article says ABC's settlement was in December, and the remarks were during a televised interview in March. The article states: "In December, ABC News agreed to pay... the network and its star anchor, George Stephanopoulos, also published a statement saying they 'regret' remarks that were made about Mr. Trump during a televised interview in March." So the month is March.

7. The primary reason for Meta's revenue increase besides AI? The article says advancements in ad targeting and suggesting relevant posts/videos due to AI investments. But the question asks besides AI, so maybe "advancements in its systems for advertisement targeting and suggesting relevant posts and videos to users" but that's part of the AI. Wait the article says: "increased revenue and profit for the fourth quarter were driven largely by advancements in its systems for advertisement targeting and suggesting relevant posts and videos to users. Those improvements came from its continued investments in artificial intelligence". So the primary reason besides AI would be the advancements in those systems, but since AI is the source, perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait the question says "besides advancements in artificial intelligence". The primary reason was the systems (which were powered by AI). Since AI is excluded, maybe there's no other reason given. The answer would be N/A because the reason given is the AI-driven systems. The question is phrased as "besides advancements in AI", but the advancements in the systems are due to AI. So the answer is N/A.

8. The eighth question asks what government regulations Zuckerberg praised the Trump admin for supporting. The article says he praised them for "supporting American tech companies and defending our values". The exact regulations aren't specified. The question is about specific regulations, but the text doesn't mention any specific laws or policies. So N/A.

9. The ninth question is how many billions VC invested in DeepSeek. The article mentions that Venture capitalists invested billions in OpenAI and others, but for DeepSeek, the article doesn't state the amount. It only mentions that DeepSeek raised questions because they built their model at lower cost. The answer is N/A.

10. The tenth question is the total spent in 2023 on capital expenditures. The article says Meta's capital expenditures this year (current year, which the article is written in 2024?) would be over $60B-$65B this year, up from $38B-$40B in 2024. Wait the article says "it spent in 2024". Wait the current year in the article's context is probably 2024, so the 2023 spending was the prior year's. The article says "Meta said its capital expenditures this year would total more than $60 billion to $65 billion... up from the roughly $38 billion to $40 billion it spent in 2024". Wait, that's confusing. Let me check again: "Meta said its capital expenditures this year would total more than $60 billion to $65 billion on data centers and other infrastructure, up from the roughly $38 billion to $40 billion it spent in 2024". Wait that can't be. If "this year" is 2024, then 2024's spending was $38-40B, but the article is written in 2024? Or maybe "this year" refers to 2025? The exact timing is unclear. The question is asking for 2023's spending. The article says "spent in 2024". So the 2023 amount isn't mentioned. The answer is N/A.

11. The eleventh question asks which company had the $25M settlement and 21% revenue increase. The article says Meta did both. So answer is Meta.

12. The twelfth question is which company projected lower revenue but plans to spend over $60B. The article says Meta's current quarter forecast is lower than expected, and they plan to spend over $60B. So answer Meta.

13. The thirteenth question is the individual who supported Trump and eliminated diversity initiatives. The article says Zuckerberg did that. So answer Mark Zuckerberg.

14. The fourteenth question is who sued Meta in 2021 after account suspensions post-Jan 6. The article says Trump filed the lawsuit. So answer Donald Trump.

15. The fifteenth question is who labeled DeepSeek as a new competitor and emphasized an American standard. The article quotes Zuckerberg doing that. So answer Mark Zuckerberg.

16. The sixteenth question is which company's Reality Labs lost $5B. The article mentions Meta's Reality Labs. So answer Meta.

17. The seventeenth question is who made policy changes and praised Trump's support. That's Zuckerberg again.

18. The eighteenth question is the company with AI investments, 49% profit increase, and lawsuit settlement for a library. That's Meta.

19. The nineteenth question is the business leader talking about infrastructure and American advantage. Zuckerberg, again.

20. The twentieth question links the settlement and new government relationship strategy. Again, Trump and Meta, so the individual is Trump? Or Zuckerberg? The question says "individual linked to both the settlement and the announcement". The settlement was with Trump, but the strategy announcement was by Zuckerberg. The question asks for the individual linked to both. The article says Zuckerberg announced the strategy during the investor call. So the answer is Mark Zuckerberg.
