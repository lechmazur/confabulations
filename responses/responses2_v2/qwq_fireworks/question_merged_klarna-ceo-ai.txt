Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. 

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions that Sequoia sent a partner first, then Michael Moritz was brought in after Siemiatkowski questioned why the whole firm wasn't there. So the answer is Sequoia.

2. **Question 2**: The article states the bot resolves cases "an average of nine minutes faster than humans (under two minutes versus 11)". The difference between 11 and 2 is 9 minutes. So 9 minutes.

3. **Question 3**: The text says the union doubled after the downsizing in 2022. The primary reason would be the layoffs leading to more unionization. But the question specifies "according to internal company documents"—the article doesn't mention internal docs stating the reason, so maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "the union roughly doubled in size, to over 1,000 employees, not long after the downsizing announcement in May 2022." So the reason is the downsizing/layoffs. But since the question says "according to internal company documents," which the article doesn't reference, maybe N/A. Hmm, tricky. The question might be expecting the answer as the layoffs, but since it's specified as per internal docs and the article only states the timing, perhaps N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The article says Klarna used an AI version of Siemiatkowski to announce third-quarter results last year. Assuming the article was written in 2024 (since IPO is upcoming), last year would be 2023. So the answer is third-quarter 2023.

5. **Question 5**: He likened union leaders to the pigs in "Animal Farm." The metaphor is pigs from Animal Farm.

6. **Question 6**: The article mentions a tweet about needing fewer photographers, but doesn't specify how many were laid off. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The article doesn't state the percentage resolved without human intervention. It says the chatbot does the work of 700 agents and resolves faster, but no % given. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The legal department's time was reduced to 10 minutes from an hour. The cost saving isn't a monthly figure but annual savings of $10M for marketing. The question is about legal, but the article doesn't mention the legal cost in dollars, only time saved. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: After using ChatGPT in late 2022, he met with Sam Altman of OpenAI. So Sam Altman.

10. **Question 10**: Klarna sought over $50B in 2022 but settled for $6.7B. The initial target was above $50B.

11. **Question 11**: The article says they used Amazon's "two pizza" rule and a hiring process like a Silicon Valley startup. So Amazon and (another company? The hiring process might be like Google? Wait, the article says the hiring process "resembled that of a Silicon Valley start-up" but doesn't name another company. Wait, the engineering recruitment used logic tests and coding demos, similar to startups, but the two pizza rule is from Amazon. The question asks for two companies: Amazon and possibly another? The text says "From Amazon, he borrowed the 'two pizza' rule... Former employees said the company's hiring process for engineers resembled that of a Silicon Valley start-up." So maybe Amazon and another company isn't specified. Wait, the question says "two companies' hiring practices"—but only Amazon is named. Hmm. Maybe the second is not mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the hiring process was like a generic Silicon Valley startup, but the question requires two companies. Since only Amazon is explicitly named, perhaps N/A. Wait, the question says "two companies' hiring practices did Klarna directly emulate"—the two practices are from Amazon (two pizza) and the hiring process like a startup (maybe Google? But not named). The article doesn't name the second company, so maybe N/A. Wait, the question might be combining both aspects: hiring process and team size. The hiring process was like a startup (Silicon Valley start-up), and the team size from Amazon. Since the question asks for two companies, the answer would be Amazon and (another company's hiring process? But the article doesn't name another. Maybe the answer is just Amazon and another isn't specified. So perhaps N/A? Wait, the question says "two companies' hiring practices"—maybe the two are Amazon (for the two pizza rule) and another company for the hiring process? Since the hiring process is described as resembling a Silicon Valley start-up but not named, perhaps the answer is Amazon and the other is not specified, so N/A. Alternatively, maybe the start-up is considered a company, but it's vague. Hmm, maybe the answer is Amazon and the other is not given, so N/A. But the question might expect Amazon and the start-up's practices. Not sure, but the article says "resembled that of a Silicon Valley start-up" but doesn't name a specific company. So the answer is N/A.

12. **Question 12**: The investors who doubted the $50B valuation in 2022 leading to Klarna's pivot. The article says when Klarna tried to raise money in 2022 seeking over $50B, investors had other ideas, resulting in a $6.7B valuation. The doubters are the investors, but the question asks for the group. The article doesn't name them specifically except that the funding round was led by someone? Not sure. The answer might be "investors" but the question wants a specific group. Since it's not named, maybe N/A.

13. **Question 13**: The joke with Sam Altman was about replacing CEOs, bankers, and lawyers. The three are CEOs, bankers, and lawyers.

14. **Question 14**: The 2022 funding was $6.7B, and the IPO is expected to triple that (since "could fetch triple the valuation that followed its 2022 swoon"). So triple would be 3x. The exact multiple is 3.
