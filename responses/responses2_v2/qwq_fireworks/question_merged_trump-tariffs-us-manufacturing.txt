Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article provided. Let me start by reading through the questions again and then cross-referencing with the article.

1. **Question 1**: Lantech's challenges with workers, but the question is about CRG Automation's parts sourcing from countries under tariffs (excluding Mexico). The article says CRG uses 25% foreign parts, with robotics from Japan, electronics from China, machinery from Mexico. But Mexico's tariffs were suspended. So excluding Mexico, the remaining parts would be from Japan and China. The threatened or imposed tariffs mentioned are on China (duties imposed) and Mexico was suspended. So Japan wasn't mentioned under current tariffs? Wait, the article says "duties on China were imposed as scheduled on Tuesday and drew immediate retaliation...". So China is facing tariffs. Japan's status? The article mentions tariffs on Mexico and Canada were suspended, but no mention of Japan. So maybe only China? So the parts from China and Japan? Wait, the question says "countries currently facing, or recently facing, threatened or imposed tariffs by the US". Threatened or imposed. The article says "Threatened tariffs on Mexico and Canada were suspended on Monday... But duties on China were imposed as scheduled on Tuesday". So China is facing imposed tariffs. Japan isn't mentioned as facing tariffs here. So parts from China (25% total, but how much of that is from China vs Japan vs Mexico? The article just says 25% from foreign suppliers, but doesn't break down percentages. Wait, the article says "robotics from Japan, electronic controllers from China, basic machinery from Mexico." So those three countries. Since Mexico's tariffs were suspended, so the parts from China and Japan? But Japan isn't under tariffs here. The question excludes Mexico. So only China is under imposed tariffs. So the parts from China would be part of that 25%. But the question is asking for the percentage of CRG's parts from countries under tariffs (excluding Mexico). Since the article doesn't specify the exact breakdown between Japan, China, Mexico, but mentions all three as sources, but only China is under tariffs. So the answer would be the percentage from China. But since the total is 25% foreign parts, and we don't know the split between the three countries, maybe it's impossible to determine. Wait the question says "what percentage of CRG Automation's parts are sourced from countries currently facing, or recently facing, threatened or imposed tariffs by the United States, excluding Mexico?" Since the only country under tariffs (China) and Japan isn't, then the parts from China would be part of that 25%, but without knowing the exact % from China, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait the article says "robotics from Japan, electronic controllers from China, basic machinery from Mexico." So maybe the parts from China (electronic controllers) are part of the 25%. But without the exact %, can't answer. Hmm. The question might be expecting to use the 25% total and subtract Mexico's portion? But since Mexico's tariffs were suspended, so excluded. If the 25% includes Mexico, then subtract Mexico's part. But the article says "foreign suppliers for about 25 percent of its parts and raw materials: robotics from Japan, electronic controllers from China, basic machinery from Mexico." So the 25% is divided among those three countries. Since Mexico is excluded, the remaining 25% minus Mexico's part. But without knowing how much is from Mexico, can't calculate. So maybe the answer is N/A. Wait the question says "excluding Mexico", so the 25% includes Mexico, so subtract Mexico's portion. But since the breakdown isn't given, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the total percentage from the countries facing tariffs (China) plus any others, but since only China is under tariffs, the percentage would be the portion from China. But since the article doesn't specify, I think the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "countries currently facing, or recently facing, threatened or imposed tariffs". China is under imposed tariffs. Japan and Mexico (suspended). So only China. But the exact % from China isn't stated, so the answer is N/A. Hmm. Wait the article says "25 percent of its parts and raw materials: robotics from Japan, electronic controllers from China, basic machinery from Mexico." The list is examples, but the total is 25%. So perhaps the 25% includes all three, but the question is excluding Mexico, so the remaining would be parts from Japan and China. But Japan isn't under tariffs, only China. So the parts from China would be part of that 25%, but without knowing how much, can't answer. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The EU's retaliatory tariffs in response to US steel tariffs. The article says "When the first Trump administration imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported steel, the European Union responded with duties on American whiskey." So the EU's retaliation was on American whiskey. The question asks what alternative product the EU targeted, but the answer is whiskey. Wait the question says "what alternative product", but the article says that the EU retaliated with duties on American whiskey. So the answer is whiskey. Wait, but the question might be a trick? Let me check again. The question states: "what alternative product did the European Union target with retaliatory tariffs in response to the initial steel tariffs, according to the Kentucky Distillers Association?" The article says the EU retaliated with duties on American whiskey. So the answer is whiskey. But the question says "alternative product"—maybe the answer is whiskey. So answer: American whiskey. But the question asks for the product name, so "whiskey".

3. **Question 3**: If Zoeller moved control panels to China instead of Canada, what hourly wage would employees get? The article says Zoeller's employees start at $24/hour. The question is hypothetical—if they moved to China, but the article doesn't mention wages in China. Since the question is about Zoeller's employees, moving production to China would likely mean lower wages, but the article doesn't provide specific numbers. So the answer is N/A. Because we don't know the wage in China, only that Zoeller's own workers start at $24. So the question is about Zoeller's employees' wages, which wouldn't change based on where the control panels are made. Wait, the question says "based on the article", but the article doesn't give data on wages in China. So answer N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Other Kentucky product threatened by EU tariffs due to steel. The article mentions whiskey and the EU tariffs on steel leading to whiskey tariffs. But Sarah Davasher-Wisdom says "The goal is to increase domestic production... but this inhibits our global companies' ability to sell their products abroad." But the specific product? The article says "American spirits have traditionally been targeted for retaliatory tariffs." So whiskey is the product. But the question asks for another product. Wait, the question says "what other Kentucky-based product... is directly threatened by potential retaliatory tariffs from the EU due to reliance on imported steel?" Wait maybe the steel itself? Or another product? The article mentions Zoeller's pumps might be affected indirectly, but the question is about the product that's threatened. The article says the EU imposed duties on American whiskey in response to steel tariffs. So the other product is whiskey. But the question is "other than whiskey?" Wait the question says "besides the impact on whiskey, what other Kentucky-based product...". The article only mentions whiskey as the product affected by EU retaliatory tariffs. So maybe N/A? Or maybe the article mentions another product? Let me check again. The article says "American spirits have traditionally been targeted for retaliatory tariffs." So spirits (whiskey). The question asks for another product. The article might not mention another, so answer N/A? Wait the question might be trickier. Sarah Davasher-Wisdom says "this inhibits our global companies' ability to sell their products abroad." The 'this' refers to the tariffs. So maybe other products besides whiskey, but the article doesn't specify. So answer N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Specific port strike threatening Shanghai supply chain. Jim Lancaster mentions "Labor strife at railroads and ports has exposed the risks... When you think of all the points... to get something from Shanghai to here, it's risk. And risk has cost." He specifically mentions "longshoremen go on strike and you are freaking hosed." Longshoremen work at ports. The question asks which port strike is mentioned. The article doesn't name a specific port, just mentions "longshoremen" in general. So the answer is N/A because no specific port is named.

6. **Question 6**: How many workers did the five swing-arm robots replace? The article says "five swing-arm robots oversee work previously handled by a dozen people." So replaced 12 workers. Answer: 12.

7. **Question 7**: Company that moved motor manufacturing to Mexico besides GE. The article says Zoeller's supplier GE moved to Mexico, so Zoeller bought another domestic manufacturer. The question is asking which company moved to Mexico besides GE. The article doesn't mention another company moving to Mexico except GE. So answer N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Fraction of CRG's parts from foreign suppliers facing tariff price hikes. The article says CRG's parts from foreign suppliers (25%) include Japan, China, Mexico. The tariffs on China were imposed, Mexico's were suspended. Japan not mentioned under tariffs. So the parts from China would be subject to tariffs, but how much of the 25% is China? The article lists three countries, but without breakdown, maybe it's N/A. Wait the question is about parts from suppliers that could see price increases due to tariffs. So any country facing tariffs (China) plus those under threat (maybe others? The article mentions threatened on Mexico and Canada were suspended, but China's are imposed. So only China is under tariffs. The parts from China would be part of the 25%, but without knowing the % from China, can't say the fraction. So answer N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 25% (the total foreign parts) minus Mexico's part. But since Mexico's tariffs were suspended, they wouldn't be subject. So the parts from China and Japan? But Japan isn't under tariffs. So only China. So the fraction is the portion from China. Since the article doesn't specify, maybe answer N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Pump manufacturer using swing-arm robots. The article says Zoeller Pump Company uses five swing-arm robots to inspect parts. So answer: Zoeller Pump Company.

10. **Question 10**: Nation whose tariffs were implemented despite suspensions elsewhere. The article says "Threatened tariffs on Mexico and Canada were suspended... But duties on China were imposed as scheduled on Tuesday and drew immediate retaliation by China". So China was the one that faced tariffs that were imposed, while others were suspended. But the question is which nation's tariffs (US's tariffs on them?) were implemented. The US imposed tariffs on China. So the nation is China. The answer is China.

11. **Question 11**: City famous for bourbon and suffered from whiskey tariffs. The article mentions Louisville is famous for bourbon and the distillers lost sales due to EU tariffs. So answer: Louisville.

12. **Question 12**: COO at a company benefiting from manufacturing but worried about tariffs. The article mentions CRG Automation's COO is Paul Lauritzen. He's worried about tariffs. So answer: Paul Lauritzen.

13. **Question 13**: Company relying on Canadian control panels for pumps. Zoeller Pump Company uses a Canadian factory for control panels. So answer: Zoeller Pump Company.

14. **Question 14**: Form of labor disturbance threatening supply chains. The article mentions "Labor strife at railroads and ports" as a threat. The specific form is strikes by longshoremen (dock workers). The question asks for the single form: longshoremen strikes. But the question says "single form of industrial labor disturbance"—the answer is "longshoremen go on strike" but needs to be concise. The article says "Labor strife at railroads and ports has exposed the risks... all that has to happen is the longshoremen go on strike". So the answer is longshoremen strikes.

15. **Question 15**: Robotics start-up benefiting from global turmoil. The article says CRG Automation benefits from global turmoil. So answer: CRG Automation.

16. **Question 16**: Country whose tariffs led to retaliation. The article says US imposed tariffs on China, leading to China's retaliation. So the country is China (since the US imposed on China, and China retaliated). The question asks which nation's imposition caused retaliation. The US imposed on China, so the answer is China (the tariffs on them were implemented, leading to their retaliation). Wait the question is phrased as "which nation’s tariffs were implemented on schedule despite suspensions elsewhere". The US imposed tariffs on China (the country being referred to is the US, but the question says "nation’s tariffs"—maybe the country that imposed tariffs? The US imposed on China. So the country whose tariffs (US's tariffs on China) were implemented. The question might be asking which country's tariffs (the US's) were implemented on China. But the question says "nation’s tariffs"—maybe the country being tariffed? The answer would be China, as the US tariffs on them were implemented, leading to retaliation. Alternatively, the question is asking which country had its tariffs (imposed by the US) implemented, so China. So answer: China.

17. **Question 17**: Company deploying robots for ribbon-tying on weights. The article says CRG Automation helped an Indiana business making weights for balloons by testing a system using robots to tie ribbons. So the company is CRG Automation.
