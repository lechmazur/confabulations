Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start by going through each question and checking the article for the answers.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks about Howard Lutnick's action that could trigger the second wave of tariffs. The article mentions that Lutnick said a second wave could follow a comprehensive review of trade ordered by Trump by April 1. So the action is the completion of that review.

2. **Question 2:** This is about Canada redirecting oil exports to offset a 2% economic loss. The article states Canada exports 80% of its oil to the US. But it doesn't specify how much they need to redirect, so I'll need to see if there's a number given. Since there's no exact percentage mentioned for redirection, this might be N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Mexico's budget deficit linked to avocado exports. The article mentions a budget shortfall but doesn't specify avocado's contribution. Since the question asks for a percentage and there's no data, N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The GDP reduction figure is mentioned as $200 billion by Peterson Institute. That's directly stated, so that's the answer.

5. **Question 5:** Mexico's sector with over a million workers and complex supply chains. The auto industry is mentioned here, employing over a million.

6. **Question 6:** The trading partner at risk of avocado export disruptions. Mexico is the one exporting avocados to the US, so Mexico.

7. **Question 7:** Country with bailout plans for potash/uranium industries. Canada's officials are noted for considering bailouts, and those commodities are Canadian exports.

8. **Question 8:** Nation in an $800B trade relationship with the US. The article says the US-Canada trade is $800B annually.

9. **Question 9:** Number of countries in the trade pact (USMCA). It's the US, Mexico, Canada, so 3.

10. **Question 10:** Labor union opposing export restrictions. The United Auto Workers and United Steelworkers are mentioned first as opposing restrictions.

11. **Question 11:** Canadian retaliation target from a southern state. The article mentions Florida orange juice, Tennessee whiskey, Kentucky peanut butter. So Florida's orange juice is one.

12. **Question 12:** Mexico's GDP growth decline. The article says 2 percentage points from Noland's estimate.

13. **Question 13:** Total trade value between US and partners. The article states $1.5 trillion total for both Canada and Mexico.

Now, I need to check each answer against the text again to ensure accuracy. For questions 2 and 3, since no specific numbers are given, they should be N/A. Others have direct answers. Let me confirm each one more carefully.
