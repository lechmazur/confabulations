Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and answer exactly based on that. Let me start with question 1.

1. The first question asks which Malaysian film required altering a scene involving police harassment and a transgender character. The article mentions "Abang Adik" as Malaysia's submission for the 2025 Oscars, which includes undocumented people dealing with police harassment and a transgender character, and it was released uncut. Wait, but the question is about a film that had to alter the scene. Hmm, maybe I misread. Wait, the question says "despite its international version featuring a transgender character"—so the domestic version had to make changes? Wait, but the article says "Abang Adik" was released uncut. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, maybe I missed another film. Let me check again. The article mentions "Snow in Midsummer" had multiple cuts but still became a sensation. But the question is about police harassment and transgender character. The article says "Abang Adik" includes undocumented people dealing with police harassment and a transgender character, and it was released uncut. So if the question is about a film that required altering such a scene, but the article says that "Abang Adik" was uncut, then perhaps there's another film? Wait, maybe "Tiger Stripes" but that's about a girl's period. Hmm. Maybe the answer is N/A here. Wait, let me check the question again. The question is about a film that had to alter a scene involving police harassment despite the international version having a transgender character. Since "Abang Adik" was uncut, maybe it's the international version that had the transgender character but the domestic didn't require cutting that? The question is a bit confusing. Wait, maybe I need to re-examine the article. 

Wait, the article says: "Some films have thrived in Malaysia even after heavy censorship. 'Snow in Midsummer' (2023)... became a sensation even after it was released with multiple cuts." But the question is about a film that had to alter a scene involving police harassment and a transgender character. The other film mentioned with a transgender character is "Abang Adik" which was uncut. So perhaps the answer is N/A here. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to "Abang Adik" even though it was uncut. But the question says "despite its international version featuring a transgender character"—if the domestic version didn't have to cut it, then maybe the answer is "Abang Adik" but the question is about a film that had to alter the scene, so maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, this is tricky. Let me note this and move on, maybe I'll come back.

2. The question asks what the primary reason was for expanding review rules in 2023 to include embassy and festival screenings. The article says the board's rules were expanded, among other changes, to include movies shown at embassies, festivals, etc. under the same restrictions. The reason isn't explicitly stated, but the article mentions that the government is under pressure from conservative Malay political forces, and Khoo Gaik Cheng attributes the censorship to linking Islam with Malay identity. But the question is about the reason given by the board. The article doesn't state the primary reason, so maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "according to unnamed industry sources"? Wait no, the question is asking what was the reason cited by the board. The article says the board didn't respond to inquiries. So perhaps the answer is N/A. The expansion's reason isn't given in the text, so maybe N/A.

3. The director facing acid attacks and professional decline is mentioned in the part about "Mentega Terbang" (Butterfly). The director and producer were charged with blasphemy. The article states that Anwar's car was splashed with acid, and Tan Meng Kheng's work as a drama teacher fell off. So the director here is Khairi Anwar. The question is about the director who faced acid attack and decline, so the answer is Khairi Anwar.

4. The film with a lingerie shop in a conservative village and audio modifications is "La Luna" directed by Raihan Halim. The article says the audio in a lovemaking scene was altered to make the sex less obvious. So the answer is La Luna.

5. The controversial element in "Snow in Midsummer" that caused curiosity despite censorship. The film is about racial riots in the 1960s. The censorship made audiences curious, so the answer is the racial riots or the historical racial unrest. The article says it was about racial riots in Kuala Lumpur in the 1960s, so the answer is racial riots.

6. The banned film submitted for 2025 Oscars without cuts is "Abang Adik". The article says the 2025 submission was "Abang Adik" and it was released uncut. However, the question says "banned"—but the article mentions "Abang Adik" was uncut, so perhaps it wasn't banned. The question might be a trick here. Alternatively, maybe "Tiger Stripes" was submitted but required cuts. Wait, the question says "banned" but the article says "Abang Adik" was not banned. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "Snow in Midsummer" had cuts but was a sensation. Maybe the question refers to "Abang Adik" being submitted without cuts, so the answer is "Abang Adik". The question says "despite being banned"—but if it wasn't banned, then maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "banned Malaysian film's storyline revolves around..." but the article doesn't mention "Abang Adik" being banned. The only banned film mentioned is "Lelaki Komunis Terakhir" from 2006 by Amir Muhammad. The question is about a film submitted for 2025 Oscars. Since "Abang Adik" was submitted and uncut, maybe it wasn't banned. So perhaps the answer is N/A here. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me check again. The article says "Abang Adik" was Malaysia's submission for 2025, released uncut. So if it wasn't banned, then the question is wrong. But the question says "banned film"—maybe it's a trick. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to "Tiger Stripes" but that wasn't banned, just censored. Maybe the answer is N/A here.

7. The justification by the Malaysian government for censoring "Tiger Stripes" despite its Cannes success. The article says the authorities presented an ultimatum to submit it to the Oscars only if inappropriate scenes were cut for local audiences. The reason given would be the domestic censorship rules, but the article doesn't state the specific justification. The unnamed sources might have said something, but the article says the Film Censorship Board didn't respond to inquiries. So perhaps the answer is N/A.

8. The punishment under blasphemy laws for depicting religious boundaries. The article says the director and producer of "Mentega Terbang" could be imprisoned for up to a year if convicted. So the answer is imprisonment up to a year.

9. The film exploring racial tensions through dystopia funded by non-traditional means. The article mentions "Pendatang" ("Immigrants") was funded entirely by crowdfunding. So the answer is Pendatang.

10. The visual element removed from "Maryam Pagi Ke Malam" related to interracial marriage. The article says private screenings were stopped, but it doesn't mention what was cut. The question asks for a specific visual element removed. Since the article doesn't specify, the answer is N/A.

11. The element removed from "Tiger Stripes" to comply with censorship. The article says the domestic version was cut, specifically the original exuberant ending. So the answer is the original ending.

12. The film made on a $1,000 budget is "Mentega Terbang" which had a budget of $1,000. So the answer is Mentega Terbang.

13. The film about historical racial unrest in Kuala Lumpur with cuts is "Snow in Midsummer" which is about the 1960s racial riots. The answer is Snow in Midsummer.

14. The film about a Malay woman and a Sierra Leonean man with halted private screenings is "Maryam Pagi Ke Malam". The article says private screenings were stopped, so the answer is Maryam Pagi Ke Malam.

15. The director who defended the audio change in an intimate scene is Raihan Halim, director of "La Luna", who said the cuts didn't compromise integrity. The answer is Raihan Halim.

16. The dystopian film funded by crowdfunding is "Pendatang" as mentioned earlier. The answer is Pendatang.

17. The screening venue now under censorship is embassies and festivals, as the rules expanded to include them. The answer is embassies.

18. The film's director with acid attack is Khairi Anwar from "Mentega Terbang". The answer is Khairi Anwar.

19. The English title for "Mentega Terbang" is "Butterfly", as stated in the article. The answer is Butterfly.

20. The person who called censorship an occupational hazard is Amir Muhammad. The article quotes him saying censorship is an occupational hazard. The answer is Amir Muhammad.

Now, going back to question 1: The film that had to alter a scene involving police harassment and a transgender character. The article says "Abang Adik" includes undocumented people dealing with police harassment and a transgender character, but it was released uncut. The question is about a film that had to alter such a scene. Since "Abang Adik" was uncut, maybe the answer is N/A. But the question says "despite its international version featuring a transgender character"—so perhaps the domestic version had to cut that part, but the article says it was uncut. So maybe the answer is N/A here.

Similarly, question 6: the banned film submitted for Oscars. The article says "Abang Adik" was submitted and uncut, so not banned. The only banned film mentioned is "Lelaki Komunis Terakhir". Since the question specifies 2025 Oscars, which "Abang Adik" was part of, but it wasn't banned, so N/A.

Question 2: the reason for expanding rules. The article doesn't state the board's reason, so N/A.

Question 7: the government's justification for censoring "Tiger Stripes"—the article says they required cuts for local audiences but doesn't give the reason beyond censorship board's rules, so N/A.

Okay, I think I can fill in the answers now.
