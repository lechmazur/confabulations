Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions Mark Epstein is the only brother but doesn't state how much he inherited. It says the trust's beneficiaries are unclear. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The article doesn't mention a law firm representing Karyna Shuliak. It only states she's a beneficiary. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: William LaPiana commented that overvaluation of properties (including the mansion) led to the refund. But the article doesn't specify the percentage attributed to the mansion alone. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The article says remaining assets go into the 1953 Trust. The question asks for another vehicle, but no other is named. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: $164 million divided by ~200 victims. Let me calculate that. 164,000,000 / 200 = 820,000. The answer is $820,000.

6. **Question 6**: The article says Kahn called the trust "poorly drafted" but doesn't cite a legal precedent. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Fees to lawyers are mentioned as tens of millions, but the exact portion of $145M isn't given. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The probate filing shows assets at $145M after refund, but total property value isn't broken down. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The judge's name isn't mentioned. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The $190M payment was in July 2020. The article states "July 2020", so the answer is July.

11. **Question 11**: The trust named is the 1953 Trust. So that's the answer.

12. **Question 12**: The girlfriend's name is Karyna Shuliak. Correct.

13. **Question 13**: Mark Epstein says he doesn't know if he's a beneficiary. The answer is "doesn't know".

14. **Question 14**: Richard Kahn was the accountant. Yes.

15. **Question 15**: Leon Black is mentioned as a client. Correct.

16. **Question 16**: The refund was received "last fall" (in the article's context, likely 2020). Fall is September-December, so the season is fall.

17. **Question 17**: The mansion sold for nearly $40M below asking price. The exact figure is stated as "nearly $40 million below the asking price". So $40 million.

18. **Question 18**: The article says $164M paid to victims. That's the total.

19. **Question 19**: The U.S. Virgin Islands settlement was $105M. Correct.

20. **Question 20**: Richard Kahn testified in spring 2023. The answer is Richard Kahn.
