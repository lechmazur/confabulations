Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not rely on any external knowledge. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks which American jazz musician Ebo Taylor cited as his primary influence when developing highlife in the 1960s. The article mentions that Taylor was influenced by American jazz and soul, specifically naming James Brown and Miles Davis. But it doesn't say he "cited" them as primary influences explicitly. Wait, actually, in the last paragraph, it says "Taylor's music was profoundly affected by American jazz and soul, particularly artists like James Brown and Miles Davis." Since the question is about his primary influence, but the article lists two, so maybe the answer is both? But the question asks for one. Hmm, maybe the question is expecting one of them, but since it's not specified which is primary, perhaps it's N/A? Wait, the exact wording: the question says "cited as his primary influence". The article says "profoundly affected by... particularly artists like James Brown and Miles Davis". The word "particularly" might mean those are the primary ones. But since the question asks for one, but the article lists two, maybe the answer is N/A because it's not stated which one is primary. Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong, so answer N/A. Wait, but the question might have an incorrect premise. Let me check again. The article says "particularly artists like James Brown and Miles Davis". So perhaps both are primary, but the question asks for one. Since the question requires a single answer and the article lists two, I should answer N/A. Or maybe the question is tricking me. Wait, the article also says "he feels like he's still playing jazz but with Ghanaian rhythms. There are American influences in my music but there's African culture behind it." But no specific citation of a single primary. So I think the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many songs did Ebo Taylor record during his initial session at Linear Labs studio before deciding on the final track listing for "JID022"? The article mentions that Jazz Is Dead started recording after his 2022 shows, and the album was recorded at Linear Labs. However, there's no mention of the number of songs recorded initially. The article says they built out arrangements but no specific number. So answer N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The name of the Ghanaian radio station that first played Taylor's music in the 1970s leading to collaboration with Fela Kuti. The article doesn't mention any specific radio station. It says he was tight with Fela Kuti but doesn't link a radio station to that collaboration. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Which instrument did Taylor master during his 20-year teaching tenure at the University of Ghana? The article says he taught music there but doesn't specify which instrument he mastered. He's known as a guitarist, but the teaching tenure's focus isn't stated. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Attendance figure at Taylor's LA Lodge Room performance that attracted Janelle Monae. The article mentions the concert in LA but doesn't provide attendance numbers. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Month in 1996 when Henry first performed with his father. The article says Henry started in 1996 at 17, but no specific month. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Title of the Caribbean-influenced song that became his first highlife hit. The article mentions that highlife incorporated Caribbean melodies, but no specific song title is given. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Hours to record vocals for "Get Up" due to his post-stroke condition. The article doesn't mention the time taken. It discusses his voice being raspy but not recording time. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Which co-founder of Jazz Is Dead discovered Taylor while working as a DJ in Trinidad. The article says Adrian Younge discovered him through compilation records. It doesn't mention Trinidad or another founder. The founders include Ali Shaheed Muhammad, but no info on where they discovered him. The question mentions Trinidad, but the article doesn't. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Name of the Jamaican soldier who introduced calypso rhythms. The article mentions Jamaican soldiers in the British army brought calypso, but no specific name. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Year he re-launched with "Love and Death". The article says in 2010 he re-emerged with that album. So answer is 2010.

12. **Question 12:** Instrument he can no longer play due to physical limitations. The article says he can't play guitar anymore. So answer guitar.

13. **Question 13:** Genre he helped popularize. The article says highlife. So answer highlife.

14. **Question 14:** Label founded by two A Tribe Called Quest members. Jazz Is Dead was founded by Adrian Younge and Ali Shaheed Muhammad (who is in A Tribe Called Quest). So Jazz Is Dead.

15. **Question 15:** Higher education institution where he taught and where a musicologist discussed his work. The University of Ghana, mentioned both as where he taught and where John Collins (musicologist) works. So University of Ghana.

16. **Question 16:** Year he first appeared in the US, featuring Janelle Monae. The article says Jazz Is Dead brought him in 2022 for his first US shows, including LA Lodge Room where Monae attended. So 2022.

17. **Question 17:** Track with frenetic blend of horns, synths, etc., and haunting vocals. The article describes "Get Up" as having that. So "Get Up".

18. **Question 18:** Native dialect he uses. The article mentions Fante dialect of Akan. So Fante.

19. **Question 19:** American influences that affected his original work. The article mentions James Brown and Miles Davis. So James Brown and Miles Davis. But the question says "which American musical influences", plural. But the answer should list both? The question might expect a single answer, but the article lists two. However, since it's asking for the influences, the answer is both. Wait the question says "which American musical influences are noted as having deeply affected his original work". The article says "particularly artists like James Brown and Miles Davis". So the answer is James Brown and Miles Davis. But the format requires a single answer? The question might accept both names. Let me check the instructions: "if the question is about exactly how many students..." but here it's asking for the names. The answer would be both. Since the question allows for multiple, but the article lists two, so the answer is both. But the format requires sentence fragment. So "James Brown and Miles Davis".

20. **Question 20:** Age at recording session for the album released seven years after a hiatus. The album in 2022 (since released in Jan 2023? Wait the article says "On Jan 31, it will release 'Ebo Taylor JID022', the first album in seven years by Taylor, who is now 90." So the album was released when he was 90. The recording happened in 2022, so he was 90 at the time? Wait, in 2022, he was 90? The article says "Taylor is now 90" when talking about the 2023 release. So if the recording was in 2022, and he turned 90 that year, then his age would be 89 or 90. Wait the article says "Taylor is now 90" at the time of the article (which is when?), but the album was recorded in 2022. Let me check the timeline. The article mentions the album was recorded after the 2022 shows. So in 2022 he was presumably 89 or 90. The article says "Taylor is now 90" in the current context (when the article was written, perhaps 2023). So if the album was recorded in late 2022, and he turned 90 in that year, then his age during recording would be 90. The question is asking "how old was the musician at the time of the recording session for his album released seven years after a long hiatus?" The album was his first in seven years (since Love and Death was 2010, so 2017 would be seven years later, but the new one is in 2023). Wait, the article says "first album in seven years by Taylor, who is now 90." The previous album was 2010, so seven years later would be 2017, but the new one is released in 2023. Wait maybe the seven years is from 2016? Wait the article says "In 2010, he re-emerged with an album... then released an album in 2023, seven years after his previous one?" The article says "first album in seven years by Taylor" so the previous album was seven years prior. The previous one was "Love and Death" in 2010, so 2010 +7 is 2017, but the new album is 2023, which is 13 years later. Hmm maybe the article says he released an album in 2010 and then nothing until 2023, so seven years is a mistake? Wait the article says "the first album in seven years by Taylor, who is now 90." The release is in 2023, so seven years before would be 2016. But the last album mentioned before that was 2010. Maybe there was another album in 2016? The article doesn't say. Anyway, the question is about his age when recording the album (released in 2023, recorded in 2022). The article says he is now 90, so likely he was 90 during recording. So the answer is 90.
