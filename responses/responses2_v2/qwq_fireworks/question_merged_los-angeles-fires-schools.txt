Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. The first question is about the percentage of Buncombe County's school budget cut related to FEMA funding delays. The article mentions that Buncombe County cut nearly $5 million (4%) from the school budget. The county board chair said she would replenish it once FEMA funds come in. So the percentage cut was 4%. The answer is 4%.

2. The second question asks how many Methodist Preschool locations in Santa Monica were temporarily housing displaced students. The text says the preschool is operating out of a temporary location in Santa Monica. Since it's singular, the answer is 1.

3. The third question is about which specific instrument Lincoln Bruno requested donations for. The article mentions he wants to source instruments for the marching band but doesn't specify a type. So N/A.

4. Stephanie Forshee's children are 9 and 6. The closure was a month due to Hurricane Helene. The article doesn't state specific grades missed, just that they were out for a month. Since they are 9 and 6, likely 4th and 1st grades, but since the exact grades aren't mentioned, it's N/A.

5. The fifth question asks for the name of the makerspace teacher. The article doesn't mention the teacher's name, only that Lincoln contacted his makerspace teacher. So N/A.

6. The number of closed child care facilities in Marina del Rey? The article says over 300 in LA, but Marina del Rey specifically isn't mentioned. So N/A.

7. The Palisades fire's date isn't given. The article mentions it happened, but no exact date. N/A.

8. The business that reopened before schools during Covid were hair salons and restaurants, as per parents' complaints. So answer is hair salons and restaurants.

9. The principal said about 40% of the campus was damaged, but the question is about displaced students. The article doesn't specify the percentage of students displaced, only the campus damage. So N/A.

10. The parent who was trapped on the road was Erin Kyle. She moved her daughter to Manhattan Beach for in-person school. The answer is Erin Kyle's decision to enroll her daughter at Manhattan Beach school.

11. The cautionary example is Buncombe County, which cut the budget despite disaster. So Buncombe County.

12. Lincoln Bruno remained committed to Pali High despite the fire. So Pali High.

13. The educator facing school building loss and cautious hope is Estela Maldonado. She works at Methodist Preschool.

14. The preschool with halved student body is Methodist Preschool of Pacific Palisades.

15. The 45-minute road ordeal emphasizes being trapped on the road with fire on both sides. The hardship is being trapped on the road.

16. The federal agency mentioned was FEMA, with Trump proposing elimination. So FEMA.

17. The hands-on class is makerspace classes (shop class equivalent).

18. The lost event mentioned is the first homecoming dance. The article says mourning missing milestones like first homecoming.

19. The mountain city that had a flood was Asheville, NC.

Alright, let me check each again to ensure accuracy.
