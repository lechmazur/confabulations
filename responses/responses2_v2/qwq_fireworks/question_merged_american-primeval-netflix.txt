Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information provided in the article. 

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions that the tepees were hung with elk and buffalo hide, stitched by Native artisans. It doesn't specify which tribe constructed them, but since Isaac is raised by Shoshone and the tribes involved include Shoshone, maybe they did? Wait, the text says "Ute tribes" and others. But the specific construction isn't attributed. Hmm, actually, the article says "Native artisans" but not the exact tribe. So maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "primarily responsible"â€”but the text just mentions they were "dyed and stitched by Native artisans." Since the Shoshone are part of the tribes involved, but it's not explicitly stated. The answer might be N/A.

Wait, no, the article says "the skeletons of tepees, which were originally hung with elk and buffalo hide, dyed and stitched by Native artisans." Since the artisans aren't specified by tribe, the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The article mentions Taylor Kitsch's character and that filming was interrupted by the SAG-AFTRA strike. But how many days before the strike? The text says the series was shot in 2023 with a break for the strike, but no days mentioned. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Betty Gilpin talks about freezing cold nights and extreme heat during desert shoots. The question asks for the average temperature. The article doesn't provide numbers, so N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Dudley Gardner mentions historical artifacts in the store. The article says "some were historical artifacts. Holding something that is literally from the past..." but doesn't name which one was most significant. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Julie O'Keefe worked on names and customs, but the question asks about a Paiute ceremony during the massacre. The article doesn't mention any specific ceremony, so N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The costume department used 1,300 garments and hundreds of moccasins, but pounds of dirt? The text says they used oil, powders, etc., but no specific pounds. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Brigham Young's decision causing escalation in episode 3? The article says the Utah War conflicts included the Mountain Meadows Massacre, but doesn't mention Brigham Young's specific decision. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Derek Hinkey demonstrated a hunting technique? The article says he's Shoshone and appreciated the regalia, but no mention of a technique. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Percentage of Fort Bridger set using authentic materials? The article says "exact replica" with items from 1857, some historical artifacts, but no percentage. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Diary entries used for weapon sounds? The sound designer made field recordings and researched weaponry, but no mention of a diary. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Removed element for tension? The article says "eliminated all birds. There are no birds in 'American Primeval.'" So the answer is birds.

12. **Question 12**: Replica structure built near a reservation that was burned? The article mentions Fort Bridger replica near Santa Fe (a reservation area?), which was burned as in real life. So Fort Bridger.

13. **Question 13**: Brigham Young was played by Kim Coates from Sons of Anarchy. The article states: "Brigham Young, the church president and a governor of Utah, played by Kim Coates of 'Sons of Anarchy.'" So yes.

14. **Question 14**: Julie O'Keefe hired consultants and suggested the name Winter Bird instead of Pine Leaf. The article says O'Keefe hired others and the consultant suggested the name change. So Julie O'Keefe.

15. **Question 15**: Filming location with extreme weather? The article says filming was in Santa Fe, NM, and mentions freezing nights and desert heat. So Santa Fe, New Mexico.

16. **Question 16**: Substance for uncleanliness? The makeup used dirt, mud, blackened fingernails, etc. The article mentions "dirt painted inside an actor's ears" and Berger's direction to use more dirt. So dirt.

17. **Question 17**: Filming year was 2023, as stated: "shot on location... in 2023."

18. **Question 18**: Stylistic mandate avoiding vistas? The article says the show "eschews [scenery], preferring tight shots and close-ups. 'I want the audience to feel like they're in it with our characters,' Berg said. 'Primeval is not glamorous. These folks are not in a position to sit back and enjoy the vistas.'" So the mandate is using tight shots/close-ups instead of vistas.
