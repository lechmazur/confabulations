Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and answer exactly what's asked without any extra fluff. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. The first question asks about Jessica Yang mentioning a specific ice cream flavor that was photographed melting. The article mentions Folderol's owners had customers not tasting the ice cream, just letting it melt. But the flavor isn't specified. The text says "ice cream" generally, so I think this is N/A because no flavor is named.

2. Keith Lee is the food critic who samples takeout in his car. Vivoli is known for their fancy affogatos. The question is about a unique preparation beyond the four-sided spreading. The article mentions the affogato with ice cream on all four sides, but the unique method is the affogato itself. So maybe "affogato" is the answer, but the question says "beyond the four-sided spreading." Wait, the affogato is the method. The article says "fancy affogatos" so maybe "espresso drowned" or "affogato" is the answer. Let me check: "Vivoli Gelateria, a shop in Florence, Italy, known for its fancy affogatos." So the unique preparation is the affogato, so that's the answer.

3. The food critic (Keith Lee) has 16.8 million followers. The Australian creator (Jorden Tually) has 3.7 million. The question asks how many more Keith has compared to Jorden. 16.8M minus 3.7M is 13.1 million. But the question says "assuming the travel creator's follower count remains constant"—so yes, the answer is 13,100,000. Wait, but the numbers are in millions? The answer should be in numerical terms. The question says "how many more followers"—so 16.8 - 3.7 = 13.1 million. The answer is 13,100,000? Or just 13.1 million? The article uses "16.8 million" and "3.7 million". So the answer is 13.1 million. But maybe written as 13,100,000. The question might want the numerical value with commas. Alternatively, the article says "16.8 million" so maybe 13.1 million. Hmm. The answer should be precise. Let me check the exact numbers again: Keith Lee has 16.8 million, Jorden has 3.7 million. So the difference is 13.1 million. So 13,100,000.

4. The question is about Saint Honore anticipating a percentage increase after mirroring Un Poko Krazy's success. The article mentions that when Ms. Gay posts, businesses sell out or get lines. But there's no specific percentage given. So N/A.

5. @vegasstarfish focuses on Las Vegas and her followers like her for advice on buffets, clean hotels, and local entertainment. The question is about the cuisine type leading to sell-outs like With Love, Always. The article says "restaurants like With Love, Always and The Pepper Club" which are mentioned in the context of being popular due to her posts. The type of cuisine isn't specified here. Wait, the article says "restaurants like With Love, Always and The Pepper Club and the Mexican snack shop Un Poko Krazy". The Mexican snack shop is Un Poko Krazy, but the other restaurants' cuisines aren't mentioned. Since the question is about the type that leads to sell-outs, maybe the answer is "Mexican" but the example given for the restaurant is Un Poko Krazy (Mexican), but the question says "most frequently feature". The article says she features buffets (which are varied) but maybe the cuisine isn't specified. So N/A?

Wait, looking again: "restaurants like With Love, Always and The Pepper Club" – those might be other cuisines. The article doesn't specify, so the answer is N/A.

6. Mr. Goff prefers trustworthy sources. Yogyakarta is described as having temples, food scene, and Cosmological Axis. The aspect he'd find most appealing based on his preference for trustworthy content might be the "thriving food scene" since he mentioned content from people who seem trustworthy. The article says he likes TikTok because it's presented in a clean format from trustworthy people. The description of Yogyakarta includes a thriving food scene, which might align with his preference for authentic recommendations. So the answer is "thriving food scene".

7. Jorden Tually recommends searching phrases on TikTok. The example given is "epic travel destinations" but the question asks for another phrase similar to what drew Goff to Cabo. The article says Mr. Goff went to Cabo because of a video. The phrase that would find similar content might be "luxury travel" or "five-star hotels" since he stayed at Waldorf Astoria. Alternatively, maybe "hidden gems" or "under-the-radar". The article mentions "under-the-radar gems" in the context of TikTok's algorithm. So the phrase could be "under-the-radar gems". Alternatively, "luxury hotels" or "exclusive destinations". The article says "a single video on the app convinced him to book his trip to the Waldorf Astoria", which is a five-star hotel. So maybe "five-star hotels" or "luxury resorts". The question says "similar to those that initially drew Mr. Goff to Cabo San Lucas"—so the video was about a luxury hotel. The phrase could be "luxury travel destinations" or "exclusive resorts". The exact phrase isn't in the text, but the closest might be "under-the-radar gems". Wait, the article says "under-the-radar gems" are part of what TikTok offers. Since the Cabo trip was to a five-star hotel, maybe "luxury travel" is the key. The answer would be "luxury travel destinations" but I need to see if there's a specific phrase in the text. Alternatively, the article says "global travel destinations and under-the-radar gems". Since the Cabo example is a five-star hotel (a luxury destination), maybe "luxury travel" or "five-star hotels". But the exact phrase isn't given. Since the question asks for a specific phrase beyond "epic travel destinations", maybe "hidden gems" or "under-the-radar destinations". The article says "under-the-radar gems", so "under-the-radar destinations" would be the phrase. So answer: "under-the-radar destinations".

8. The next viral backdrop similar to Quebec City (which is an old European settlement in Canada) would be another historic European city. The article mentions Venice and Yogyakarta, but Venice is in Italy. Since Quebec is in North America, maybe a similar European city. Wait, the question says "similar to Quebec City", so maybe another old European settlement. The article's 52 Places include Yogyakarta (Indonesian), Barbados, Venice. The next one could be Venice. But the question says "location similar to Quebec City"—which is a historic city. The answer might be Venice, but the article's 52 Places list includes Venice. Alternatively, maybe Yogyakarta? No, it's in Indonesia. The article's cross-references for European dessert trends (like Vivoli in Florence) might point to another Italian city. But the question is about a location for airport to beach videos. Maybe a coastal city with historic sites. Alternatively, maybe "Venice" is the answer since it's listed. The question states "similar to Quebec City", which is a historic city. The 52 Places include Venice, which is an ancient city. So answer: Venice.

9. The Italian city with Vivoli Gelateria (Florence is mentioned) is Florence. The question asks which Italian city is associated with the gelateria known for affogatos. The answer is Florence.

10. The marketing director who changed travel plans to Waldorf Astoria in Cabo is Ryan Goff. The article says: "Mr. Goff, the social media and marketing director for a Baltimore-based marketing agency called MGH, but a single video on the app convinced him to book his trip."

11. The Vegas-based influencer with 1.7 million followers is Jennifer Gay, known as @vegasstarfish.

12. The creator with an orange baseball cap is Jorden Tually. The answer is Jorden Tually.

13. The travel publication mentioned at the end with 52 Places is The New York Times Travel, as the article ends with "Follow New York Times Travel on Instagram..." and mentions "52 Places to Go in 2025".

14. The country with the regulatory measure cutting off 170 million users is the United States, as the article mentions "the United States' ban potentially going into effect".

15. The total number of posts under #travel is 56.5 million.
