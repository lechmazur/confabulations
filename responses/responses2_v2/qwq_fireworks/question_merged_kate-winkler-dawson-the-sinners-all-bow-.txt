Okay, I need to go through each question and find the answers strictly from the provided article. Let me start with the first question.

1. The Methodist minister who discovered Sarah's body. The article says, "One was her Methodist pastor, Ira Bidwell." So the answer is Ira Bidwell.

2. Hawthorne visited the waxwork 12 years before writing "The Scarlet Letter" in 1850. The article mentions he visited "12 years before he wrote The Scarlet Letter." The book was published in 1850, so 12 years prior would be 1838. But the question is how many years after Cornell's death (1832) was that visit? 1838 minus 1832 equals 6 years. So 6 years.

3. The question asks which Fall River newspaper published the initial coverage. The article doesn't mention any newspaper by name. It talks about Catharine Williams's book, but not a newspaper. So N/A.

4. Sarah's mother's occupation. The text mentions her mother provided testimony, but doesn't state her job. The article says she was a factory girl, but her mother's occupation isn't given. N/A.

5. Number of anonymous letters found. The article states "anonymous letters were found that arranged secret meetings" but doesn't specify the count. So N/A.

6. The farm where the body was found. The article mentions a farmer found her, but the farm's name isn't provided. N/A.

7. The medical examiner for the second autopsy. The article says the body was exhumed and a new verdict was delivered, but doesn't name the examiner. N/A.

8. Days between death and charges. Cornell died Dec 21, 1832. The second verdict came after exhumation, but the exact date Avery was charged isn't specified. The trial was in 1833, so the time between death and charge is over a year, but the exact days aren't given. N/A.

9. The judge's name. The article doesn't mention the judge's name. N/A.

10. Title of Hawthorne's journal entry. The article says he described the effigy in his journal but doesn't give the entry's title. N/A.

11. Forensic technique similar to Fitbit data. The article mentions "Fitbit data" as an example of modern tools. The question asks what technique could link Avery to the pole. The article doesn't specify another technique, just lists examples. So N/A.

12. Years between Williams's book (1833) and Dawson's podcasting start. The article says Dawson is a podcaster but doesn't state when she started. N/A.

13. Other crime used to tarnish Cornell's reputation. The defense tried to make her seem bad. The article says they dragged her reputation through the mud, but specifically mentions shoplifting and being pregnant. Wait, the article states: "the defense team dragged Cornell's reputation through the mud... prove the deceased a perfect fiend." The question asks for another crime besides shoplifting. The article says she was pregnant, but that's not a crime. Wait, maybe infidelity? The text says she was impregnated by Avery, but the defense might have used that as a moral failing. But the question specifies "other crime." The article says "the defense team dragged Cornell's reputation through the mud. This was... first time that a victim was 'put on trial in order to exonerate her murderer.'" The scholar's quote says they tried to prove she was a fiend. Maybe promiscuity? But not a crime. The article mentions her being impregnated by Avery, but that's not a crime. The text says she was publicly shamed for shoplifting. Maybe they used the pregnancy as a moral failing, but not a crime. Since the article doesn't name another specific crime, N/A.

14. Fabric around her neck. The article says a cord was wrapped around her neck, cutting into flesh. It doesn't mention fabric type related to her profession. Her job was seamstress, but the article doesn't specify fabric used. N/A.

15. Number of children Avery had. The article says Avery was a "married father of four." So 4.

16. Title of the waxwork show. The article doesn't name the waxwork show's title. It just mentions Hawthorne visited a waxwork show of murderers and their victims. N/A.

17. The writer who rushed to warn Avery. The article says after identifying the body, "Bidwell rushed off to warn Avery." Wait, the question asks who was the popular writer incensed by the tactics. The answer is Catharine Read Arnold Williams. The article says Williams was incensed by the trial tactics and went to investigate. So the answer is Catharine Read Arnold Williams.

18. Page count of Williams's book. The article states "Fall River: An Authentic Narrative" was "the first narrative book of macabre murder in America" and "Putnam | 320 pp." Wait, no, the page count is for Dawson's book. The article says "THE SINNERS ALL BOW... 320 pp." Williams's book's page count isn't mentioned. So N/A.

19. Wave of single women in mills. The article refers to them as "factory girls" and mentions the Industrial Revolution's mills. The specific term used is "wave of single women who found work in the mills of the Industrial Revolution." The question asks for the name of the wave. The article doesn't name it, so N/A.

20. Name of the New School professor who reviewed the book. The article starts with "Liesl Schillinger is a critic and translator and teaches journalism at the New School..." So the answer is Liesl Schillinger.
