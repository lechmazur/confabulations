Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and follow the strict format. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks about an instrument Dede's original manuscript called for, which modern orchestras don't use, related to the Sultan's opulent lifestyle. The article mentions "ophicleide" in the section where they talk about transcribing the manuscript. So the answer should be ophicleide.

2. The second question is about James Trotter's mention of Dede's physical appearance. The article states that critics called Dede "ungainly" and "by no means graceful." But James Trotter's 1878 book says Dede threw "his whole soul" into music and was "very popular." Wait, the question asks what Trotter specifically mentioned about his performance style's physical aspect. The article says critics made disparaging remarks about his appearance, but Trotter's own description might not mention that. Wait, let me check again. The article says Trotter's passage mentions Dede was "very popular" and threw his soul into music, but doesn't specify physical traits. The physical traits like "ungainly" were from critics, not Trotter. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "James Trotter specifically mentioned in his 1878 publication when describing Dede's performance style." The article says Trotter wrote that Dede "threw his whole soul into his music onstage and was very popular." The physical aspect mentioned by critics is separate. So the answer would be N/A here because Trotter didn't mention physical appearance, only the critics did.

3. The third question asks what jazz standard by Dede, like "Mon pauvre coeur," did Joseph hope to use for funding. The article mentions "Mon pauvre coeur" as one of the oldest published by a Black American. The question says "specific jazz standard," but Dede's work was classical. The article says "Morgiane" has influences from the American South and popular French music, but "Mon pauvre coeur" is the only specific composition mentioned. Maybe that's the answer? The question is about a jazz standard, but the article says Dede wanted to be like Mendelssohn and Brahms, so maybe "Mon pauvre coeur" is the answer even if it's not jazz? The question might be a trick because Dede's work isn't jazz, but the article mentions the New Orleans scene leading to jazz. The answer would be "Mon pauvre coeur" but since it's a song, maybe that's it. The question says "jazz standard," but the article doesn't specify, so maybe N/A? Wait the question says "composed by Dede" so if the article says "Mon pauvre coeur" is one of the oldest published by a Black American, then that's the answer even if not jazz. The question might be wrong in assuming it's a jazz standard, but the article says "Morgiane" has influences from the South and French music. The answer might be "Mon pauvre coeur".

4. The fourth question asks for another opera by Dede besides "Morgiane" that was part of the Harvard collection. The article mentions the Peyrotte collection had "operas by Verdi, Wagner and some of the biggest French composers of the 19th century" but nothing specifically about another Dede opera. The article says Dede composed orchestral pieces, ballets, and one-act operettas. Since the question specifies another opera by Dede, but the article only mentions "Morgiane" as his magnum opus and other works like ballets, the answer would be N/A.

5. The fifth question asks the year the Richard F. French librarian (Virginia Danielson) traveled to Paris. The article says in fall 2000, Cox and Danielson went to Peyrotte's house. So the answer is 2000.

6. The sixth question is about the legal document free people of color in New Orleans had to carry. The article says Dede had to carry proof of his free status when walking the streets. So the document would be a "free papers" or "papers proving free status." The exact term might be "free papers" as commonly known, but the article says "proof of his free status," so the answer is "proof of free status" but maybe the term used was "free papers." The article doesn't specify the exact name, so perhaps N/A? Wait the question asks for the specific legal document's name. The article just mentions "proof of his free status," so without the exact term, maybe N/A? But maybe the legal term was "free papers," which is a known historical term. Since the article doesn't use the exact term, I should answer as per the text. The article says "proof of his free status," so the answer would be that exact phrase. But the question asks for the legal document's name, so if the article doesn't name it, then N/A.

Wait, the article states: "laws required him to carry proof of his free status when walking the streets." So the document is "proof of free status," but that's not a specific legal document name. Since the question asks for the specific legal document's name, and the article doesn't provide it, the answer is N/A.

7. The seventh question asks the name of the French conductor who collaborated with Bernard Peyrotte. The article mentions Jean-Marie Martin as the conductor who collected scores with Peyrotte. So the answer is Jean-Marie Martin.

8. The eighth question asks the theatrical form similar to Dede's Bordeaux shows that Idina Menzel participated in before "Rent." The article mentions Dede's shows were "more like vaudeville than high art." Idina Menzel's pre-"Rent" role was in "Wicked"? Wait, no. The article says in the last paragraphs: "Idina Menzel Goes Out on a Limb: Menzel, who had her breakout role in 'Rent' and then won a Tony for 'Wicked,' is back on Broadway in 'Redwood,'..." So her breakout was "Rent," and before that, perhaps she was in something else? Wait the question says "before her breakout role in 'Rent'" â€“ but the article doesn't mention any prior role except "Rent" as her breakout. However, the question refers to a theatrical form similar to Dede's vaudeville-like shows. The article mentions Dede's shows were "more like vaudeville," and Idina Menzel was in "Rent" first. But the question says "participated in before her breakout role in 'Rent'". The article doesn't mention any prior role, so maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article's last section mentions "A Blue Man Group Farewell..." and "Idina Menzel Goes Out on a Limb..." but the Blue Man Group is a separate part. The question might be linking the theatrical form (vaudeville) to the Blue Man Group, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "vaudeville" but the question asks for the form that Idina was in before Rent. Since the article doesn't say, it's N/A. Wait, the question says "theatrical form similar to the shows Dede produced... did Idina Menzel participate in before her breakout role in 'Rent'?" The article says Dede's shows were like vaudeville. The article says Idina's breakout was "Rent," so before that, she might have been in something else, but the article doesn't specify. Since the question is about the form, perhaps the answer is "vaudeville," but the article doesn't connect her to it. So N/A.

9. The ninth question asks the specific location in Paris where Lisa Cox examined the collection. The article says Peyrotte's house was "outside Paris," so the answer is "outside Paris" or the exact place? The article says "traveled to Peyrotte's house outside Paris." So the location is Peyrotte's house outside Paris. The question asks for the specific location within Paris, but the house is outside, so maybe the answer is N/A. Wait the question says "within Paris," but the house was outside. So the answer would be N/A because it's not in Paris.

10. The tenth question asks which university Sally McKee taught at before retiring. The article says Sally McKee is a retired professor at the University of California, Davis. So the answer is University of California, Davis.
