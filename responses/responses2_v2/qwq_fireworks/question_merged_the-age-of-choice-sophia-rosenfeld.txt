Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict format. Let me start by reading each question carefully and cross-referencing the article.

1. The first question asks about Lynn Hunt's argument on human rights origins and Kant's anxieties, linking it to a sales technique by Christopher Cock that Protestant reformers used for religious choices. The article mentions Cock's auction techniques as starting shopping, which influenced choice culture. But Protestant reformers are linked to religious tolerance, not sales techniques. The text says Protestantism allowed individual belief choices, but the sales technique was shopping. Wait, the question is about what Protestant reformers employed using Cock's technique. Hmm, maybe the answer is "N/A" because Cock's technique was shopping, not directly used by reformers. But the question says "mirroring the shift from compulsion to choice" so maybe the sales technique is the answer? Wait, the question says "what specific sales technique... did Protestant reformers initially employ". The article states that Protestantism led to individual autonomy in religion, but Cock's sales techniques are separate. I don't see a direct link here. So answer N/A?

Wait, the question says "what specific sales technique, pioneered by Christopher Cock, did Protestant reformers initially employ to encourage individual decisions in matters of faith". The article says Cock's sales techniques (like auctions) were the start of shopping, which is part of the shift to choice. But Protestant reformers' influence was on religious tolerance, not sales techniques. So the answer would be N/A because there's no mention of them using Cock's sales techniques. So first answer is N/A.

2. Second question: Helena Kelly's assessment of Austen and shopping as feminine. The question asks what innovation by Cock led to the somber epilogue about "pro-choice" rhetoric. The epilogue is about abortion rights using "pro-choice" being insufficient. The article says the epilogue is about the rhetoric of choice in abortion. The innovation by Cock was shopping. Since Rosenfeld links shopping to the culture of choice, which is tied to the pro-choice rhetoric, maybe the answer is "shopping" or "auctions". The question says "specific innovation similar to African publishing" which is a new ecosystem. But the question's second part asks what led to the epilogue's topic. Since shopping is the root of the choice culture, the answer would be "shopping". So answer: shopping.

3. Third question: "Inventing Human Rights" links to France, Rosenfeld links shopping to republicanism. The question asks what section of "The Age of Choice" analyzes Han Kang's influence on ballot voting. The article mentions Han Kang's work in a different section (her novel "We Do Not Part"), but Rosenfeld's book sections include commerce, religion, partner selection, voting. The question links Han Kang to ballot voting, but the article doesn't connect her to that. So N/A.

4. Fourth question: Transformation from compulsion to choice, Maggie Nelson's "On Freedom". The question asks what choreographed behavior Elizabeth Cary used to defy Protestants, similar to Cock's techniques. The article says Elizabeth Cary defied Protestants and her husband, mirroring Anne Askew. The "choreographed behavior" might refer to something like dance cards, but the question says "akin to Cock's techniques". Cock's was shopping. The answer might be "defiance through choice", but the article states that the bounded choices like dance cards were examples. Wait, the question is about Elizabeth Cary's defiance. The article says she defied Protestants, but the method? It just says she defied, not specifying. So maybe N/A. Alternatively, the answer is "choosing beliefs" but that's not a behavior. Hmm. The question says "choreographed behavior akin to Cock's techniques (shopping)" but Elizabeth's defiance is about belief choices. Maybe "choosing religious beliefs" but not choreographed. So N/A.

5. Fifth question: Rosenfeld's interconnectedness of agitators and bargain hunters, linked to African publishing. The question asks which fictional work Rosenfeld analyzes that shows tension between choice and societal constraints, like voting and the defiance of Anne Askew and Elizabeth Cary. The article mentions Jane Austen's novels, especially Emma's Harriet. The answer is probably a Jane Austen novel, specifically "Emma" since Harriet is in it. The article says Rosenfeld analyzes Austen's novels, so answer: Emma.

6. Sixth question: Bounded choices like dance cards and Kant's anxieties. The question asks what literary technique Jane Austen and Scott Turow used to show shift from arranged marriages to individual choice. The article says Austen's novels have shopping expeditions, and Turow's work is about a prosecutor. The technique might be "fictional narratives" or "storytelling". The article says Rosenfeld uses fiction for evidence, so maybe "narrative analysis" or "fictional analysis". Alternatively, "drama over purchases" but not sure. The question mentions "literary technique" like both authors use. Since Austen uses shopping scenes, maybe "shopping expeditions" but that's a plot element, not a technique. Alternatively, "free indirect discourse" but the article doesn't specify. The article says Rosenfeld's analyses of fiction illuminate her points. The question is about the technique used by both authors that Rosenfeld uses. Maybe "portrayal of decision-making" but not sure. Since the answer must be direct, perhaps "shopping expeditions" as a technique. Wait, the article says "the novels of Jane Austen, with their multiple shopping expeditions, take on a different character." So maybe "shopping expeditions" as the technique. But Scott Turow's work isn't linked to shopping. The question says "literary technique used by both". Since Turow's book is mentioned in the article's end part as a novel, but not connected to shopping. Maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, the technique is "drama over decisions" but not clear. Hmm, perhaps N/A because the article doesn't link Turow's technique to Rosenfeld's analysis in that context. So answer N/A.

7. Seventh question: How did Cock's invention of shopping influence Austen's portrayal of female decision-making? The article says that shopping was coded as feminine, and Austen's novels' shopping scenes are analyzed by Rosenfeld. So the answer is that it led to portraying female characters' indecision (like Harriet with muslins), showing the link between consumer choice and individual agency. The answer would be "portrayal of indecision in shopping scenarios" but the article says "Harriet Smith, 'still hanging over muslins and changing her mind'". So the answer is "depictions of female characters' indecision in shopping situations".

8. Eighth question: How does Rosenfeld reconcile Augustine's condemnation with 18th-century consumer culture using Kant? The article says Augustine saw freedom to err as bad, but Rosenfeld links shopping (consumer culture) to democratic ideals. Kant's writings are mentioned as saying freedom awakened nations but caused anxiety. So Rosenfeld uses Kant's point that while freedom caused anxiety, it also enabled democratic progress. The answer is "Kant's acknowledgment that freedom brought both anxiety and self-determination, bridging Augustine's fears with consumer-driven democracy".

9. Ninth question: Which Austen novel does Rosenfeld analyze with Harriet Smith's muslin indecision? The article mentions Harriet Smith in Emma, so answer is "Emma".

10. Tenth question: Empirical evidence that 18th-century marketing inspired secret ballots. The article says Rosenfeld links shopping to republicanism but doesn't mention marketing strategies directly influencing ballots. So N/A.

11. Eleventh question: Connecting Seabright's "divine economy" to suffragists' strategies. The article states that the divine economy is a marketplace of beliefs, and suffragists wanted voting rights. Rosenfeld's analysis might link choice in beliefs to political choices. The answer could be "the concept of individual choice in beliefs as a model for voting rights". But the article says the suffragists' defiance (Anne Askew and Elizabeth Cary) relates to religious choices, so maybe the answer is "the principle of individual autonomy in religious belief (Locke) applied to voting rights". But the question asks for how Rosenfeld connects Seabright's concept to suffragists. Since the article says the Reformers' autonomy in belief led to that principle applying to women's soul and thus voting, the answer might be "the marketplace of beliefs analogy extended to political choices". But the exact evidence? The article says "the principle applied to every woman's soul as well. Hence in the 16th century..." So maybe "the principle of individual autonomy in religious belief (Locke) was extended to voting rights". But the question specifically mentions Paul Seabright's "divine economy". The article says Seabright coined the term, so Rosenfeld uses that to show that the same market-like freedom in beliefs was applied to suffrage. The answer is "the 'divine economy' concept, where choice in beliefs paralleled the demand for voting rights".

Wait, the article says "the divine economy, a marketplace of competing beliefs any one of which... believers may choose. Still, the Reformers' refusal to submit to the pope ultimately licensed the claim to individual autonomy in religious belief. 'The care, therefore, of every man's soul belongs unto himself.' The principle applied to every woman's soul as well. Hence in the 16th century the Protestant Anne Askew defied the Catholic authorities (including her enraged husband), just as a few decades later the Catholic Elizabeth Cary comparably defied the irate Protestants (and yet another enraged husband) arrayed against her." So the suffragists (women like Askew and Cary) used the principle of individual autonomy in belief (from the divine economy idea) to challenge societal constraints, which parallels voting rights. So the answer is "the principle of individual autonomy in religious belief (from 'divine economy') provided a model for suffragists' arguments for voting rights".

But the question asks for how Rosenfeld connects Seabright's concept to suffragists. Since the article mentions Seabright's term and the suffragists' defiance, the answer is "the 'divine economy' analogy, where choice in beliefs was extended to political choices like voting".

So the answer would be "the 'divine economy' concept, linking individual choice in beliefs to suffrage demands".

But need to be precise. The exact answer from the article? The article states that the Reformers' move allowed individual autonomy in belief, which applied to women's souls, leading to their defiance. So Rosenfeld connects the divine economy (marketplace of beliefs) to suffragists' strategies by showing that the same principle of choice in religion was applied to political rights. The answer is "the principle of individual autonomy in religious belief (from 'divine economy') was extended to voting rights".

But the question specifies "political strategies of 19th-century suffragists". The article mentions 19th-century dance cards as bounded choices, but the suffragists' defiance is from earlier. Maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the article doesn't explicitly connect Seabright's concept to suffragists' strategies. It's inferred through the principle of autonomy. Since the question requires empirical evidence from Rosenfeld, and the article doesn't state that directly, perhaps N/A. Alternatively, the answer is "the marketplace of beliefs analogy", but the article doesn't explicitly say Rosenfeld made that connection to suffrage. So maybe N/A.

Wait, the article says Rosenfeld's analysis includes "voting by ballot" as a topic, and that the principle of autonomy applied to women's souls. So she might link the divine economy (marketplace of beliefs) to the need for voting as a choice. So the answer is "the 'divine economy' concept, where choice in beliefs justified women's right to vote".

But since the article doesn't explicitly state that Rosenfeld made this connection, maybe it's N/A. Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. The question might require N/A because the article doesn't explicitly mention suffragists and Seabright together. The answer would be N/A.

Now compiling all answers:

1. N/A
2. shopping
3. N/A
4. N/A
5. Emma
6. N/A
7. depictions of female characters' indecision in shopping situations
8. Kant's acknowledgment that freedom brought both anxiety and self-determination, bridging Augustine's fears with consumer-driven democracy
9. Emma
10. N/A
11. N/A (or maybe "the principle of individual autonomy in religious belief", but not sure)
Wait, let me check question 11 again. The article says "the principle applied to every woman's soul as well. Hence in the 16th century..." and later mentions suffragists (Anne Askew and Elizabeth Cary). So the suffragists used that principle of autonomy in belief to challenge authority, which is similar to voting rights. Rosenfeld connects Seabright's "divine economy" (marketplace of beliefs) to the idea that individual choice in religion led to autonomy in other areas like voting. So the answer might be "the 'divine economy' concept, where choice in beliefs was extended to voting rights". But the question says "how does Rosenfeld connect...", and the article says she does analyze the principle's application to women's souls and their defiance. So the answer is "by showing that the principle of individual autonomy in religious belief (from the divine economy concept) was extended to demand voting rights".

But the answer must be concise. The article's text says "the principle applied to every woman's soul as well" which allowed their defiance, so the answer is "the principle of individual autonomy in religious belief (from the divine economy concept) was extended to suffrage demands".

But the question specifically mentions 19th-century suffragists. The examples given (Anne Askew is 16th century, Elizabeth Cary a few decades later, so maybe 17th). The 19th-century part might not be covered, so N/A? Hmm, maybe N/A.

Alternatively, the answer is "the marketplace of beliefs analogy, which suffragists used to argue for voting rights". Since Rosenfeld's analysis includes voting as a topic, she might have made that connection. But the article doesn't explicitly say so. Since the question requires empirical evidence from the text, and the article doesn't explicitly link Seabright to suffragists, the answer is N/A.

Alright, proceeding with that.
