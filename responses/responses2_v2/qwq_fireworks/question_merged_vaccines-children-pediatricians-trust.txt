Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the given article and follow the instructions strictly. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks about the percentage of American adults who trust the M.M.R. vaccine specifically, based on a July 2024 study. The article mentions a July 2024 study where trust in physicians dropped to 40% from 72% in 2020. But that's about trust in doctors, not specifically the M.M.R. vaccine. The article also mentions a survey in October 2023 where 16% thought vaccines were unsafe, including M.M.R., but that's about perceived safety, not trust in efficacy. Since the question is specifically about trust in the efficacy of M.M.R., and the study in July 2024 doesn't mention that, the answer is N/A.

2. The question asks which alternative vaccine schedule Dr. Boucher convinced parents to follow. The article says many pediatricians accommodate alternative schedules but support the CDC's. Dr. Boucher asked parents to consider just R.S.V. and pertussis vaccines, but he didn't name a specific alternative schedule. The answer is N/A.

3. Dr. Jeffery might recommend a government resource for DTaP. The article mentions non-government resources like Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Emily Oster. The government resources aren't named, so N/A.

4. Dr. Huggins works at TriBeCa Pediatrics in Brooklyn. The question asks for the practice's name. The answer is TriBeCa Pediatrics.

5. The audio production's title is mentioned as produced by Sarah Diamond. The article says "Audio produced by Sarah Diamond" at the end. The title of the article is "Covid-19 Guidance..." but the audio's title isn't given. So N/A.

6. Dr. McWhirter noted a surge in refusal for a specific illness after the pandemic. The article says she noted a surge in refusing even parents who previously vaccinated, but the specific illness isn't named. The answer is N/A.

7. The family medicine physician in Monroe, LA is Dr. Marina Jeffery. The question asks for her name, so that's straightforward. Answer: Marina Jeffery.

8. The pediatrician on Instagram is Dr. Playforth, handle @thepediatricianmom. The article mentions her sharing on Instagram under that handle. Answer: @thepediatricianmom.

9. The pediatrician in Columbus, GA is Dr. Susan McWhirter. The article states she noted a surge in refusal post-pandemic. Answer: Susan McWhirter.

10. Dr. Boucher addressed R.S.V. and pertussis with the 2-month-old's parents. The question asks for the specific illness mentioned. The answer is R.S.V. or pertussis? The question says "vaccine-preventable illness mentioned by name". The article says he mentioned R.S.V. and pertussis. Since it's asking for the name, both are mentioned, but the answer expects one. Wait, the question says "specific illness", so maybe it's asking for one of them. But the article says "exposed to R.S.V. and pertussis". The answer would need to pick one? The question says "the" so perhaps the one he specifically addressed. The parents booked an appointment, so maybe he asked them to vaccinate for those, so the answer could be either. But the article doesn't name a single one. Hmm, maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "specific illness mentioned by name". The article mentions both, but the question might want one. Since the answer requires a single name, perhaps the answer is pertussis (since R.S.V. is not a vaccine-preventable illness, but pertussis is). Wait, RSV isn't preventable by vaccine, but pertussis is via DTaP. The article says "exposed to R.S.V. and pertussis over the coming winter months, which could be dangerous". Pertussis is vaccine-preventable. So the answer is pertussis. But the question says "specific illness mentioned by name" so that's pertussis.
