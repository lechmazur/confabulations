Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the provided article and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **First instrument at uncle's funeral home**: The article mentions he played in public at St. Luke's church and his uncle's funeral home. It lists instruments like organ, sax, accordion, etc., but specifically mentions the organ as central. Wait, the first instrument he learned there? The text says "He first played in public at St. Luke's Anglican Church in London and at an uncle's funeral home," but doesn't specify which instrument. Hmm, maybe the organ? But the question is about the first instrument he learned there that was central to his work. The article states his work with the organ was central, so maybe organ? But the exact instrument isn't specified here. Wait, the first sentence says "intricate swirls of Lowrey organ helped elevate the Band." The funeral home part might not specify the instrument. So maybe this is N/A? Wait, no—the article says he played "saxophone, accordion, synthesizers, trumpet, French horn, violin" etc., but the first instrument at the funeral home? The text doesn't say. So answer N/A.

2. **Year of Bach training influencing "Chest Fever"**: The article mentions he studied Bach preludes and fugues growing up. But when? His birth year is 1937. The article says he studied music theory, harmony, counterpoint as a kid. No specific year given. So N/A.

3. **Salary increase with Ronnie Hawkins**: The text says he was offered an extra $10 a week. So answer is $10.

4. **Who suggested "music consultant" to appease parents**: The article states he was offered the title "music consultant" so his parents would feel better. But who suggested that? The text says "until he was offered... the title 'music consultant'—all so that his parents would feel better..." So it doesn't mention who suggested it. The question asks which member of the Band suggested it. Since the article doesn't say who proposed the title, answer N/A.

5. **Name of the recording studio in the pink house**: The article says "the pink ranch house in Saugerties, N.Y., where Bob Dylan and the Band recorded more than 100 songs that came to be known as the basement tapes." The studio's name isn't mentioned; it's referred to as the basement. So the answer is N/A.

6. **Number of songs on debut album with Charles Ives elements**: The article mentions "arranged the music on the group's albums and painstakingly tweaked and honed its recordings. He added brass, woodwinds and eclectic flourishes that accentuated the group's homespun authenticity... Hudson was the wizard behind the scenes adding pastoral touches... out of Aaron Copland or Charles Ives." But how many songs on the debut album? The article doesn't specify a number, so N/A.

7. **Duration of longest "Chest Fever" improvisation**: The article says "virtuoso improvisation leading into the song 'Chest Fever,' which... veered off in whatever direction... at whatever length." No duration given. N/A.

8. **Classical composition studied under mother influencing Lowrey organ**: The article says he studied Bach with his mother? Wait, the text says his mother played piano and accordion, and he studied Bach preludes and fugues growing up. It doesn't specify which parent taught which. The question asks which classical composition his mother studied that influenced him. Since the article doesn't specify the composition studied under his mother, just that he studied Bach, maybe Bach's works? But the question is about a specific composition. Since it's not stated, N/A.

9. **Value of equipment sold by landlord**: The text mentions "sold off much of Mr. Hudson's personal property in 2013" but doesn't state the value. So N/A.

10. **Number of nights at Winterland Ballroom**: The article says the final concert was a Thanksgiving concert there, but doesn't mention consecutive nights. So N/A.

11. **Award same year as "The Last Waltz" filming**: The film was in 1976? Wait, the Band disbanded in 1976, and the concert was their last. The article says "The Band disbanded in 1976 with an all-star Thanksgiving concert... documented in the Martin Scorsese film 'The Last Waltz.'" The question asks what award Hudson received that same year. The text doesn't mention any award for Hudson in 1976. So N/A.

12. **Instrument father mastered central to "The Weight"**: The article says his father played drums, C melody sax, clarinet, flute, piano. The Band's song "The Weight" features organ, but maybe another instrument? The question asks which instrument his father mastered that's central to "The Weight." The song's central instruments might include piano or organ. The father played piano. The article says Garth played organ, so maybe the piano? But the question is about the father's instrument. The article says father played piano. So answer piano? Wait, but the Band's "The Weight" uses organ prominently. Hmm. The question is which instrument the father mastered that was central to the song. Since the father played piano, but the song's central organ is Garth's, maybe the question is a trick. The article doesn't explicitly say, so maybe N/A. Wait, but the question says "central to the Band's sound in 'The Weight'". The song uses organ, but the father's instruments include piano. So maybe piano? But the article doesn't link the father's piano to "The Weight." So N/A.

13. **Brand of mixing console**: The article says he set up recording equipment but doesn't mention the brand. N/A.

14. **Other keyboard besides Lowrey**: The article mentions he played "Lowrey organ" and other instruments like sax, accordion, etc. But another keyboard? Maybe the Hammond? Wait, the text says he used Lowrey instead of Hammond. But the question is about another keyboard he mastered. The article doesn't mention another specific keyboard model, just the Lowrey. So N/A.

15. **Canadian honor after 1976**: The Band was inducted into the Rock Hall in 1994. The question asks for a Canadian-specific honor. The article doesn't mention any Canadian award for Hudson. So N/A.

16. **Year of endorsement deal**: The article mentions financial struggles and Hudson being sought after, but no specific endorsement deal year. N/A.

17. **Orchestration technique from Bach**: The article says he used Bach's counterpoint in arrangements. The technique could be "counterpoint" or "Bach's counterpoint." The question asks for the specific technique's name. The article uses "counterpoint," so maybe that's it. But the question asks for the specific orchestration technique's name. Since it's stated as "counterpoint," answer "counterpoint."

18. **Legal battle against manager**: The article mentions a legal battle with his landlord, not a manager. So N/A.

19. **Synthesizer model**: The article says he played synthesizers but doesn't name a specific model. N/A.

20. **Title of 1990s solo album**: The article mentions he released three albums in the 1990s with additional musicians but doesn't name the solo album. So N/A.
