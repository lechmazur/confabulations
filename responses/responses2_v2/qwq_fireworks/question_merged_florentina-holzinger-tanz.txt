Okay, I need to go through each question one by one and find the answers strictly from the provided article. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question asks what material Florentina Holzinger compares the sensation of body suspension hooks to when discussing pain artistry versus ballet's illusion. The article mentions that in circus sideshow, performers have trained their bodies to handle pain, and Holzinger contrasts this with ballet. She says that in ballet, pain isn't acknowledged, unlike in circus where it's seen as art. Wait, but the exact comparison... Let me check again. The text says she compares the circus suspension to ballet's pointe work. She says that both involve pain but present it differently. The material she uses for the comparison might be velvet? Wait, no, that's in the fondu part. Wait, the question is about the material she compares the hooks to. Wait, looking at the section where she talks about circus and ballet: "How different is it to what people feel when they see a ballet dancer in pointe shoes looking like it's completely effortless? They are all also a bit like, 'That is something I could not do. How is it possible?'" So she's comparing the circus suspension (which seems painful) to ballet's pointe work (which looks effortless). But the question is about what material she compares the hooks to. Wait, maybe I'm missing it. Let me re-read the relevant part. 

Wait, the article says: "In the sideshow arena, people are proud to call themselves pain artists, Holzinger said, 'but a ballerina would never call herself a pain artist. It's exactly about the illusion: It is painful, but it should not look painful. And let's not talk about the pain. It's effortless.'" So she's contrasting the circus performers (who embrace pain) with ballerinas (who hide pain). The question asks what material she compares the hooks to. Wait, maybe when she describes the hooks as "urban broomsticks"? Wait, no, that's a different part. Let me check again.

Wait, the question says "based on her discussion of pain artistry in circus acts versus ballet's illusion of effortlessness." The article states that she compares the circus suspension to ballet's pointe work. She says that both involve pain but present it differently. The material part might be in another section. Wait, looking back to the fondu part: "It's velvet. It's a very strong and woven material. With a very soft top." That's Cordua describing fondu. So that's question 11. For question 1, maybe there's another part. Wait, the question is about the material she compares the hooks to. The article says "body suspension, in which hooks pierce the skin of a performer's upper back and are connected to cords that lift her into the air." But does she compare the hooks to a material? Wait, maybe the answer is "velvet" but that's from the fondu part. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again.

Wait, the first question says Holzinger compares the sensation of body suspension hooks to a material. The article mentions that circus performers' skin doesn't rip, making it seem magical, like ballet's illusion. She says that when people see ballet, they don't question the pain, but in circus, they are shocked. The material comparison might not be directly stated here. Wait, perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, no, the user might think of the velvet part. Wait, no, the velvet is for fondu. Let me re-read the question again. The question is about Holzinger comparing the hooks' sensation to a material in her discussion of pain artistry vs ballet. The article says she says that circus performers can handle pain, and ballet hides it. The material she uses as an analogy? Maybe the pointe shoes? No. Wait, maybe the answer is "velvet" but that's from Cordua's description. Since the question is about Holzinger's comparison, maybe there's a different part. Wait, perhaps there's no direct material mentioned here. Maybe I'm missing it. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is "skin" since she mentions skin not ripping? But the question is about a material. Hmm, maybe I need to skip and come back.

Moving on to question 2: Which historical ballet technique from the 19th century does the hair bun lifting parody? The article mentions that when the piece turns into witches, it references "La Sylphide" and "Giselle." In the part about the motorcycles being called "urban broomsticks," which alludes to flying on broomsticks like in La Sylphide's witch. The hair bun lifting might be referencing the witches' scenes. The article says "they are lifted into the air by their buns" and Holzinger refers to the witches from Romantic ballets. The specific technique might be from "La Sylphide" or "Giselle." The question is about the stunt parodying a technique. The article says "they are lifted into the air by their buns." The historical technique might be the way witches fly, like in "La Sylphide" where Madge, the witch, uses a broomstick. The lifting by hair could parody that. So the answer might be "La Sylphide" or "Madge's flight." But the question asks for a ballet technique, not the ballet itself. Wait, the technique might be "flying on a broomstick," but that's not a dance technique. Alternatively, the lifting by hair could be parodying the Romantic ballet's use of supernatural flight. The article says "the effect of weightlessness... what Romanticism was about... to get to a higher sphere." So maybe the answer is "La Sylphide's flight" or the technique of flight in Romantic ballet. But the question says "technique from the 19th century." Maybe the answer is "flying on a broomstick" from La Sylphide? The article mentions "Madge, the old witch, from 'La Sylphide,' and Myrtha, the queen of the Wilis, who forces men to dance to their death, from 'Giselle.'" The stunt with hair buns might be a parody of the witch's flight in La Sylphide. So the answer is "La Sylphide's flight" but the question might expect the ballet name. The question says "historical ballet technique from the 19th century," so perhaps the ballet itself is the answer. But the question specifies "technique." Hmm, maybe the answer is "broomstick flight" but that's not a technique. Alternatively, the answer might be "La Sylphide" as the ballet referenced. The question says "technique," but maybe the answer is La Sylphide. Let me see the exact text: "the piece moves into more ominous territory, making reference to more sinister characters in Romantic ballet: Madge, the old witch, from 'La Sylphide,' and Myrtha, the queen of the Wilis, who forces men to dance to their death, from 'Giselle.'" The stunt with hair lifting could be parodying the flight on a broomstick, which is part of the witch's role in La Sylphide. Since the question asks for the ballet technique, maybe the answer is "La Sylphide's witch scene" but the exact term isn't given. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "La Sylphide" as the ballet referenced. The question might expect the ballet's name. So I'll go with "La Sylphide."

Question 3: Which somatic practice does Holzinger criticize for avoiding pain? The article says "contemporary dance, with its focus on somatic ideas of internal attentiveness, was that pain was negative. 'Like as a dancer, you should not feel pain. When it's painful, you stop. That was, I guess, also a big fascination for me, to deal with my body in a different way.'" So the somatic practice is contemporary dance's approach, but the question asks for the practice. The term used is "somatic ideas of internal attentiveness." The specific practice might be "somatic practices" in contemporary dance. The answer is "somatic practices in contemporary dance" but maybe the exact term is "somatic ideas." Wait, the question says "somatic practice," so the answer is "somatic practices in contemporary dance." But the options might need a specific name. Alternatively, the answer is "somatic practices" as the term. But the question asks for the name of the practice. Since the article mentions "somatic ideas of internal attentiveness," the answer is "somatic practices (in contemporary dance)" but maybe the answer is "somatic practices." Let me check the exact quote: "contemporary dance, with its focus on somatic ideas of internal attentiveness, was that pain was negative." So the practice is the somatic practices within contemporary dance. The answer is "somatic practices" or "somatic practices in contemporary dance." Since the question requires the exact term from the text, maybe "somatic ideas of internal attentiveness" but that's a description. Alternatively, the answer is "somatic practices."

Question 4: Which Pina Bausch role is referenced as inspiration for the witches? The article says Cordua mentions Pina Bausch as an influence. But the question is about witches' choreography. The article says Holzinger's work references "La Sylphide" and "Giselle" for the witches. Pina Bausch's own works aren't specifically named here. Wait, the text says Cordua admired Holzinger's radical approach like Pina Bausch. But the question is about the witches' choreography's inspiration. The article says "the second act... witches' choreography" but the specific Pina Bausch role isn't mentioned. Wait, maybe it's N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "N/A" because the text doesn't mention a specific role from Pina Bausch's repertoire for the witches. The article says Cordua admired Pina Bausch but doesn't tie her works to the witches. So the answer might be N/A. Wait, the question says "which iconic role from Pina Bausch's repertoire does Holzinger reference..." but the text doesn't mention any specific role. So the answer is N/A.

Question 5: Which injury from motorcycle stunts does Holzinger analogize to ballet pointe work? The article says motorcycles are called "urban broomsticks" and "stinky, unfriendly things. They represent actually monsters nowadays." The injury part: Holzinger says that people think the skin will rip when suspended, but it doesn't. She compares this to ballet where the pain is hidden. The question is about an injury common in motorcycle stunts analogous to pointe's toll. The article doesn't mention specific injuries like fractures. It talks about skin ripping, but that's in the suspension. The injury might be "skin ripping" but the question is about motorcycle stunts. Wait, the article says "when you see people suspended, they are shocked that I make my people do something as violent as that. In the sideshow arena, people are proud to call themselves pain artists, but a ballerina would never call herself a pain artist. It's exactly about the illusion: It is painful, but it should not look painful." The analogy is between the pain of circus (suspension) and ballet (pointe). The injury from motorcycle stunts would be the skin ripping, but the question is about what Holzinger compares to pointe's toll. She says that ballet's pointe work is also painful but presented as effortless. So the injury she's analogizing is the same as the suspension's skin ripping, but the question asks for the injury from motorcycle stunts. Since motorcycles are used in Tanz, maybe the injury is "skin ripping" but that's from suspension. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "skin ripping" even if it's from suspension. The article says "they see the skin doesn't rip" in suspension. So the injury would be the expected skin ripping, which is analogous to the pain in ballet. The answer might be "skin ripping" but the question specifies motorcycle stunts. Since motorcycles are used in the performance, perhaps the injury is "skin ripping" from the hooks. But the question says motorcycle stunts, so maybe it's a different injury. Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A because the text doesn't name a specific injury. Hmm, tricky. The article says that the motorcycles are part of the suspension, but the injury is skin ripping from the hooks. Since motorcycles are the prop, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the injury is "skin tearing" but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The question is asking for an injury common in motorcycle stunts that Holzinger compares to pointe work's toll. The text doesn't mention motorcycle-related injuries, only the suspension's skin not ripping. So maybe the answer is N/A.

Question 6: The 83-year-old dancer leading the ballet class is Beatrice Cordua, also known as Trixie. The article starts with her name and nickname. Answer is "Beatrice Cordua (Trixie)" but the question asks for the nickname. The question says "known by a distinctive nickname," so the answer is "Trixie."

Question 7: How many female performers are in the cast? The article states "an all-female cast of 11." Answer is "11."

Question 8: Which Romantic ballet figure is cited as causing a fatal dance? The article mentions Myrtha from "Giselle," who forces men to dance to their death. Answer is "Myrtha" (queen of the Wilis from Giselle).

Question 9: The "urban broomsticks" are motorcycles. The article says "motorcycles, which Holzinger referred to as 'urban broomsticks'". Answer is "motorcycles."

Question 10: The practice with hooks and cords is body suspension. The article mentions "body suspension, in which hooks pierce the skin..." Answer is "body suspension."

Question 11: The material for fondu is velvet. The article says "It's velvet. It's a very strong and woven material. With a very soft top." Answer is "velvet."

Question 12: The pioneering modern ballet figure Cordua admired is George Balanchine. The article states "My first choreographer was George Balanchine..." Answer is "George Balanchine."

Question 13: The performance is "Tanz" by Florentina Holzinger, reviewed by Gia Kourlas at NYU Skirball. The question asks for the performance's name, so "Tanz."

Question 14: Who trains to withstand extreme discomfort? The circus performers. The article says "people who have trained their bodies to deal with pain levels..." Answer is "circus performers (pain artists)."

Question 15: The number of evenings is two. The article says "Opening at NYU Skirball on Feb. 14 for an all-too-brief two-night run." Answer is "2."

Now, going back to question 1: I think I missed it earlier. The question asks what material Holzinger compares the body suspension hooks to in her discussion of pain artistry vs ballet. The article says she compares the circus suspension to ballet's pointe work. She says that in circus, they do things that look like magic (skin not ripping), while ballet's pain is hidden. The material comparison isn't directly stated except for the velvet in fondu, which is Cordua's part. Maybe the answer is N/A here because the question is about Holzinger's comparison, and the article doesn't mention a material she uses for that. Alternatively, perhaps she compares the circus's "magic" to ballet's illusion. But the question specifies a material. Since the text doesn't mention a material comparison from Holzinger in that context, the answer is N/A. Wait, but the article says "the skin doesn't rip" so maybe the material is "skin"? But the question is about the hooks being compared to a material. Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, I'm confused here. Let me recheck the article's relevant section again.

The article says: "Holzinger sees the body modification scene similarly. In the circus sideshow world, people have trained their bodies 'to deal with pain levels so that they can do this physical suspension,' Holzinger said. 'People who have not seen or experienced this themselves, they think, this is physically not possible. The skin will rip. We will see all the skin rip! And then they see the skin doesn't rip, and of course, for them, it's like magic.' How different is it 'to what people feel when they see a ballet dancer in pointe shoes looking like it's completely effortless?'" 

Here, she's comparing the circus suspension (skin not ripping) to ballet's pointe shoes (effortless). The material she's contrasting is the skin's integrity vs the ballet's presentation. But the question asks what material she compares the hooks to. There's no mention of a material like velvet here. The only material mentioned in that context is skin, but the comparison is about the illusion of pain. Since the question asks for a material she uses to compare, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, if the question is about the material the hooks are made of, but the article doesn't say. So I'll go with N/A for question 1.

Wait, but the user might think the answer is "velvet" because that's a material mentioned, but that's from the fondu part, which is Cordua's description, not Holzinger's comparison. So yes, question 1's answer is N/A.

Now I'll compile all answers.
