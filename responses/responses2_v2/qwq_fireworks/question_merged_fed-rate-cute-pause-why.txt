Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article. I need to be careful to follow the instructions strictly and not infer anything beyond what's written. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks which former Fed official who retired in June specifically predicted that Trump's tariff policies would lead to three consecutive months of accelerating inflation. Scanning through the article, I remember a part where Karen Dynan and Joseph Gagnon are mentioned. Wait, the article says: "Karen Dynan... said it would be 'dicey to apply the old conventional wisdom that you should look through supply shocks at this point' because of the high starting point for inflation this time around... If tariffs come on the high side and if deportations bite more than expected, you could very well imagine inflation going back up..." But she didn't specifically mention three consecutive months. Joseph Gagnon is quoted as saying that the neutral rate is around 3.5%, but the part about three months? The article states "the third month in a row it has accelerated" regarding the Consumer Price Index. However, the question is about a prediction by a retired Fed official in June. Loretta Mester retired in June, but she said, "There is no compelling reason to cut," and didn't mention tariffs causing three months. The article mentions that "the data reported since the turn of the year has allayed some concerns but has not eliminated them completely. Overall inflation... rose more than expected in December to 2.9 percent compared with the same time last year — the third month in a row it has accelerated." But no specific official is cited as predicting this. Hmm, maybe I missed it. The question might be a trick because the text doesn't explicitly name someone who predicted the three months. So answer N/A?

Wait, the user might be referring to Joseph Gagnon's statement. Let me check again. The exact quote from Gagnon is: "If tariffs come on the high side and if deportations bite more than expected, you could very well imagine inflation going back up and that could put the Fed on pause for the whole year." He's talking about possible future scenarios, but not specifically three months. The three months of acceleration is a fact from the data, not a prediction by someone. So the answer here is N/A.

2. The second question: How many percentage points did Fed officials increase their 2026 inflation projections by when incorporating assumptions about Trump's proposed immigration policies? The article says: "policymakers halved their projections for interest rate cuts in 2025 to just half a percentage point in December, as they raised their expectations for inflation over the course of 2025 and 2026. For some officials, that shift incorporated assumptions about what another Trump term would bring, given his promises to enact tariffs on trading partners, slash red tape, lower taxes and deport millions of immigrants." But the question is about the increase in 2026 inflation projections specifically due to immigration policies. The text mentions that projections for inflation in 2025 and 2026 were raised, but the exact percentage points aren't given. Since the article doesn't state the exact number of percentage points, the answer is N/A.

3. The third question: The primary reason in December minutes for halving 2025 rate cuts. The article says: "policymakers halved their projections for interest rate cuts in 2025 to just half a percentage point in December, as they raised their expectations for inflation over the course of 2025 and 2026." The primary reason cited would be increased inflation expectations. The minutes also mention "almost all participants judged that upside risks to the inflation outlook had increased." So the answer is increased inflation expectations or the increased inflation risks. But the question asks for the primary reason cited. The exact phrase from the text: "as they raised their expectations for inflation over the course of 2025 and 2026." So the primary reason is the raised inflation expectations. Answer: increased inflation expectations.

4. Joseph Gagnon's analysis on the neutral rate. The article states: "Joseph Gagnon, a former senior Fed staffer. He believes the level of interest rates that neither hastens nor holds back growth — dubbed the 'neutral' rate — has risen compared to its level before the pandemic, to around 3.5 percent. Most officials as of December forecast it around 3 percent in the longer run." So the pre-pandemic rate was lower than 3.5%. The question is the mathematical relationship. He established that the current neutral rate (3.5%) is higher than the pre-pandemic rate. The answer is "higher than" or "has risen compared to pre-pandemic". The exact wording from the text is "has risen compared to its level before the pandemic, to around 3.5 percent." So the relationship is that the current rate is higher than the pre-pandemic rate. The answer should be "higher than".

5. Who first raised concerns about Trump's demand for immediate cuts at Davos? The article says: "Speaking to attendees at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he said that as his economic policies drove down the price of oil, he would 'demand that interest rates drop immediately.'" Here, "he" refers to Trump. The question is about who raised concerns about his demand. Wait, the question is phrased as "which World Economic Forum attendee first raised concerns..." The attendee who is Trump made the demand, but the question is about someone raising concerns about that demand. The article doesn't mention anyone else at Davos raising concerns. The Fed chair Powell was at Davos? The article says Powell announced the new phase, but that was at the Fed gathering. The Davos mention is Trump speaking there. So no one else is mentioned as raising concerns about his demand. So answer N/A.

6. Karen Dynan's correlation between deportation rates and consumer price expectations. The article says: "Karen Dynan... said it would be 'dicey to apply the old conventional wisdom that you should look through supply shocks at this point' because of the high starting point for inflation this time around... If tariffs come on the high side and if deportations bite more than expected, you could very well imagine inflation going back up..." She links deportations (as a supply shock) to inflation, which affects price expectations. The question is about a correlation she identified between deportation rates and consumer price expectations. The article states that higher deportation rates (if they "bite more") could lead to inflation going up, which would affect price expectations. The answer would be "positive correlation" but the question is phrased as "correlation... identified". The article doesn't explicitly state a direct correlation, but the implication is that deportations could lead to higher inflation, which would affect expectations. However, the question asks for a specific correlation from her research at the Treasury Department. The article mentions her as Harvard professor and former Treasury economist, but the statement is in the current context. The text doesn't explicitly state a correlation, so answer N/A.

7. How did the recalibration phase alter the timing between September and November? The article says: "After delivering a shock-and-awe half-point cut in September -- prompted by concerns that the labor market was at risk of weakening too much -- the Fed steered through what it described as a 'recalibration' phase. It reduced interest rates by a more traditional quarter-point in November and December, reflecting the fact that inflation, while still high, had eased enough for them to feel comfortable lowering borrowing costs further." So the recalibration phase slowed down the cuts from a half-point in September to quarter-points in November and December. The timing was delayed or reduced in size. The answer is "reducing cut sizes from 0.5 to 0.25 percentage points".

8. Donald Kohn's threshold for March rate cut. The article states: "Donald Kohn, a former vice chair of the Fed, said officials will also probably need confirmation that the inflation risks they fear 'aren't crystallizing.' 'As long as the economy remains resilient, there's a case for waiting to see how these things play out and what the effects are,' he said." The threshold would be confirmation that inflation risks aren't crystallizing. The answer is "confirmation that inflation risks aren't crystallizing".

9. Economic indicators from the summer slump that convinced businesses to keep hiring. The article mentions: "Job growth has also stayed surprisingly strong in what economists said was a potential sign that businesses have regained steam after a summer slump." The indicators are not specified beyond job growth staying strong. Since the question asks for the specific indicators, but the article only says job growth was strong, the answer is N/A because the text doesn't name the indicators, just the outcome.

10. Mathematical model used for 0.75% rate hike during Trump's first term. The article says: "transcripts of Fed meetings from that period indicated little consternation about the impact on inflation, although the policies did cause enough concern about the hit to growth to lead the central bank to lower interest rates by 0.75 percentage points." It doesn't mention any specific model used. Answer N/A.

11. Energy policy action Powell referenced at Davos. The article states that Trump, at Davos, said his policies drove down oil prices and demanded rate cuts. The question is about Powell referencing an energy policy. The article doesn't mention Powell speaking at Davos about energy policies. Powell's comments were at the Fed gathering. So answer N/A.

12. Two volatile components Loretta Mester identified for exclusion before rate cuts. The article says: "core measure that strips out volatile food and fuel prices confirming that the underlying trend was slowing." Loretta Mester said there's no compelling reason to cut until seeing evidence inflation is moving down. The components are food and fuel. The question asks which two she identified. The answer is "food and fuel".

13. Consecutive months of accelerating PPI cited for December rate cut reversal. The article mentions the Consumer Price Index (CPI) third month of acceleration, but the question is about Producer Price Index (PPI). The text doesn't mention PPI. Answer N/A.

14. Country's tariffs linked by Dynan to the 0.75% rate hike. The article says during Trump's first term, tariffs caused the Fed to lower rates by 0.75%, not a hike. The question asks which country's tariffs caused a hike. Since the Fed lowered rates, not hiked, and the country's tariffs mentioned in the article for the first term aren't specified, answer N/A.

15. Neutral rate Joseph Gagnon testified to Congress about immigration impacts. The article says Gagnon believes the neutral rate is around 3.5%, but there's no mention of him testifying to Congress about this in relation to immigration. The question combines his neutral rate statement with a congressional testimony on immigration. The text doesn't state that he testified specifically about the neutral rate in 2025 due to immigration. So answer N/A.

16. Three deportation metrics cited in December minutes as upside risks. The article says: "the shift incorporated assumptions about... deport millions of immigrants. Others adjusted their forecasts based on the incoming data alone... 'almost all participants judged that upside risks to the inflation outlook had increased,' minutes from the December meeting said. The data... has not eliminated them completely... If tariffs come on the high side and if deportations bite more than expected..." The minutes mention deportations as a risk, but the question asks for three specific metrics. The article doesn't list three metrics, just mentions deportations in general. Answer N/A.

17. Exact date in January 2024 when bond yields surpassed 5% due to Colombian tariffs. The article mentions tariffs on Colombia but doesn't give a specific date when bond yields hit 5%. Answer N/A.

18. Number of Fed officials voting against November 2024 rate cut. The article states: "the decision to cut rates again in December was a close call. One Fed official voted against it..." So the December cut had one vote against. The question is about November. The article says in November they cut by a quarter-point after the September half-point. It doesn't mention opposition in November. Answer N/A.
