Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and don't infer beyond what's written.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions MusiCares raised $3.9 million for music professionals. The question asks about funds for people *outside* the industry. The article states that money raised during the ceremony will also go to organizations supporting the whole region. However, the exact amount pledged for non-music professionals isn't specified. So, the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The article lists previous album of the year winners as Harry Styles, Adele, Beck, and Swift. The question asks for another winner who might have benefited from the academy's diversity efforts. The article doesn't name others, so N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Ben Winston talks about reflecting on the wildfires. The question asks about another natural disaster. The article doesn't mention other disasters, so N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Quincy Jones is mentioned as the super-producer with 28 Grammys. The article doesn't say another was originally honored before wildfires, so N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Kendrick's "Not Like Us" led to Drake's defamation suit. The article says it's the centerpiece of the suit. The Grammy's theme might address the diss war, but the question is about the legal action's central theme. The answer is the defamation suit.

6. **Question 6**: The article says $3.9 million was raised, but doesn't mention a combined goal with FireAid. So, N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The article says "Cowboy Carter" has a blend of genres. It also mentions the academy's conservative voters. The high-concept mix might sway them, but the question asks for another element. The article doesn't specify, so N/A.

8. **Question 8**: FireAid is a separate concert raising funds, contradicting the Grammys as primary. The article says they're unaffiliated, so the answer is FireAid's independent fundraising.

9. **Question 9**: Billie Eilish and Finneas could surpass Quincy's 28 if they win. The article says they could take third, more than any songwriter. Quincy has 28, so they might surpass him in total? Wait, Quincy has 28, but Eilish and Finneas would have 3 if they win. So N/A, since 3 is less than 28. Wait, the question is about surpassing Quincy's total? The article says Quincy has 28, so unless they get more, it's N/A. Wait, the article says "more than any songwriter in Grammy history" with third. Quincy's total is 28, so they need to get to 29? The answer might be Billie Eilish because they're the ones mentioned.

10. **Question 10**: The original date was Feb 2, 2024. The article says the 67th is scheduled for Feb 2, so that's the answer.

11. **Question 11**: During 2021 and 2023, the Grammys moved to Las Vegas. The article mentions moving to Las Vegas in 2023, so the cities are Los Angeles (original) and Las Vegas. But the question asks for alternative locations considered, so Las Vegas is one. The other? The article doesn't mention others, so N/A. Wait, the question says "two cities" considered during 2021 and 2023. The article says "moved to Las Vegas the next year" (2021 was delayed, 2023 moved to Vegas). So the two cities would be the original LA and Vegas. But the question says "alternative locations", so Vegas and maybe another? The article doesn't mention others, so N/A.

12. **Question 12**: The article says MusiCares supports music professionals, but another org for non-professionals? It says funds go to MusiCares and "organizations that support relief for the whole region". The specific name isn't given, so N/A.

13. **Question 13**: The total raised by both isn't stated. MusiCares has $3.9M, FireAid's amount isn't mentioned. So N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Kendrick's "Not Like Us" led to Drake's lawsuit. The track is part of the nomination, so the answer is Kendrick Lamar's nomination is linked to the lawsuit.

15. **Question 15**: The Crypto.com Arena's constraints are due to NBA/NHL bookings. The architectural feature? The article says the venue's booking with NBA/NHL teams complicates rescheduling. The feature is the arena's use by other teams, so the answer is the shared arena with NBA and NHL teams.

16. **Question 16**: Harvey Mason Jr. pushed to continue after consulting officials. The answer is Harvey Mason Jr.

17. **Question 17**: The venue is Crypto.com Arena in LA. The contractual constraints there made rescheduling hard. The answer is Crypto.com Arena.

18. **Question 18**: Lucas Keller canceled his party, arguing it was wrong. The answer is Lucas Keller.

19. **Question 19**: FireAid is the separate concert. The answer is FireAid.
