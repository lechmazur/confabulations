Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict instructions.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions that the governor declared a state of emergency, but it doesn't specify which government agency is responsible for implementing the price controls. The law exists, but the agency isn't named. So, I'll have to say N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Samira Tapia analyzed over 400 listings and found about 100 had increases over 10%. The question asks how many remained unchanged. The article doesn't give exact numbers for unchanged properties, only that 100 exceeded the limit. Since total is 400+, we can't infer the exact number unchanged. N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Laura Kate Jones saw a $3,000 increase on the spot. The legal limit is 10% since the emergency. To find the max allowed, we need the original rent. But the article doesn't state the original amount, so we can't compute the exact dollar figure. N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Rachel Drew's research is mentioned, but the article doesn't state the percentage of displaced returning in the first year. It talks about linking desperation to price surges, not return rates. N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The Coalition for Economic Survival helped file complaints before, but the number resolved isn't mentioned. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The article says Trey White's agency is helping community members, but the exact number of homes represented isn't given. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The highest increase mentioned is 64% in Venice, a coastal area. So Venice is the answer.

8. **Question 8**: The article doesn't mention specific penalties for violations. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Staff numbers at Strategic Actions for a Just Economy aren't provided. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Laura Jones noticed 15-20% increases, but the median across all tracked properties isn't given. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The central agent is Laura Kate Jones, as she's the first example given with the 15-20% surge.

12. **Question 12**: Larry Gross from the Coalition for Economic Survival is the one recalling past issues. Yes.

13. **Question 13**: The 64% spike in Venice is highlighted compared to others. So 64%.

14. **Question 14**: Chelsea Kirk from Strategic Actions is cited here. Correct.

15. **Question 15**: Samira Tapia analyzed the 400+ listings and found 100 over the limit. So her name here.

16. **Question 16**: Rachel Bogardus Drew is the senior research director at Enterprise Community Partners who linked desperation to price surges. That's her.

17. **Question 17**: Governor Newsom enforced the rule via his declaration. The question says "enforced," but he declared it. The agency isn't named, but the law was his declaration. Maybe N/A? Wait, the question asks who enforced the rule. The article says the law was from the governor's declaration, but enforcement is on tenants to report. So maybe the answer is the governor? Or N/A because no specific agency? Hmm. The question might be a trick. The law was implemented by the governor's declaration, but the enforcing body isn't stated. So N/A.

Wait, the question says "which government leader enforced a rule". The governor declared the emergency, which enacted the law. But enforcement isn't attributed to him directly. So maybe N/A.

18. **Question 18**: The maximum allowed is 10%, clearly stated. So 10%.

19. **Question 19**: The home in Pacific Palisades turned to rubble (client of Laura Jones), and that area is mentioned in the context of the client's loss, but the article notes price increases in Beverly Hills, West LA, Venice, etc. Pacific Palisades itself isn't mentioned as a place with price increases, just where the client's home was destroyed. So Pacific Palisades is the answer here.
