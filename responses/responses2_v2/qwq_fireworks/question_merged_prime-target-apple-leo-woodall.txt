Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. I need to be careful to answer exactly based on the text and avoid any assumptions.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions an explosion in Baghdad unearths an ancient site, but it doesn't specify which civilization's mathematical secrets. The answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The text doesn't state how long Edward worked on the theorem before his professor noticed. N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The article refers to Edward's theorem involving prime numbers but doesn't name it. N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Taylah is an NSA agent, so the agency that recruited her would be the NSA itself. The text doesn't mention another agency, so N/A unless implied. Wait, the question says "before she became Edward's ally"—the article says she's a rebellious NSA agent, so maybe the NSA is the answer. But the question implies she was recruited by another agency first. Since the text doesn't mention that, N/A.

5. **Question 5**: There's no mention of Edward winning a mathematics award at Cambridge. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The article says after Cambridge, they're on the run, but doesn't name a specific European city. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Taylah's tragic backstory is described as vague in the text. No specific event, so N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The article states the NSA spies on mathematicians in case they find such a formula, but doesn't mention how many were eliminated before Edward. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The theorem's original purpose isn't stated beyond being about prime numbers. The article says the professor panicked because it could pick any digital lock, implying that's the dangerous application, but the original purpose isn't given. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: No mention of a colleague betraying Edward. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The explosion in Baghdad is described as a gas explosion. The explosive device would be the gas, but the question asks for the type. The article says "gas explosion," so maybe "gas" is the answer.

12. **Question 12**: The streaming guides mention Netflix, Max, Disney+, Amazon Prime, and Hulu. The question asks how many besides Hulu, so that's 4 (Netflix, Max, Disney+, Amazon). Wait, the text says "best offerings on Netflix, Max, Disney+, Amazon Prime and Hulu"—so excluding Hulu, four others. Answer: 4.

13. **Question 13**: The professor panicked at Cambridge, so the city is Cambridge. The question asks for the European city where this happened. Answer: Cambridge.

14. **Question 14**: Edward uses a notebook instead of a computer. The question mentions mirroring Tom Green's return to a classic format—Tom Green's part is separate, but the notebook is mentioned. Answer: notebook.

15. **Question 15**: The article mentions "directors using sex scenes to explore power dynamics" in "Anora," "Babygirl," and "Challengers." The director of "Challengers" isn't named. The question asks for the director's name, so N/A.

16. **Question 16**: Taylah's attire includes leather jackets and motorcycle boots, but the motorcycle brand isn't mentioned. N/A.

17. **Question 17**: The dangerous application is a formula to pick any digital lock. The weapon would be the formula itself. The question asks for the weapon developed from it. Since the formula is the weapon, answer: the formula to pick any digital lock.

18. **Question 18**: The article lists directors like RaMell Ross, A.V. Rockwell, etc., but doesn't name a specific film by Ross. N/A.

19. **Question 19**: Leo played "charming cads" in "The White Lotus" and "One Day." The question asks which role made him seem suitable for a shy mathematician. The article says he's not the first choice but has sheepish appeal. The role mentioned is "charming cads," so answer: charming cads.

20. **Question 20**: The ancient site unearthed in Baghdad isn't named. The article just says "ancient site." N/A.
