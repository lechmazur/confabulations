Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then cross-referencing the article to find the answers.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about a specific Nielsen rating metric that demonstrated the immediate audience reaction to Nikki Glaser's monologue regarding Trump's second term. I'll look for mentions of Nielsen and audience reaction metrics. The article says, "viewers dislike it when celebrities turn a trip to the stage into a political bully pulpit. Minute-by-minute viewership analysis indicates that 'vast swaths' of people turn off televisions when celebrities start to opine on politics." However, there's no specific metric like a percentage decrease mentioned here. The question is about a specific metric, but the article only states the general trend. So maybe the answer is N/A?

Wait, the question specifically mentions Nikki Glaser's monologue. The article says Nikki Glaser made a joke about Trump, but the Nielsen part is general. The article doesn't tie a specific metric to her monologue. So the answer would be N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Rachel Zegler faced backlash for her social media post. The question asks what punitive action the Golden Globes producers took against her. The article says she had to apologize, but it doesn't mention the Golden Globes producers taking action. Instead, it says publicists advised clients to be quiet, citing her as an example. The producers didn't take action; she was forced to apologize by the backlash. So answer N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The question is about how many more migrants beyond those with gang affiliations are the Trump admin preparing to house in the tent city. The article states they're holding 10 migrants with gang ties in Guantanamo and preparing a tent city for up to 30,000. The question is asking for the number beyond the 10. So 30,000 minus 10 is 29,990. But the article doesn't mention that subtraction; it just says 30,000 in the tent city. The 10 are in Guantanamo, so the tent city is separate? The question might be a bit ambiguous. The article says "holding 10 migrants... in Guantanamo" and "preparing a tent city to house as many as 30,000 migrants." The 30k is the total for the tent city, not subtracting the 10. So the answer is 30,000. But the question says "beyond those with suspected gang affiliations"—the 10 are the ones with gang ties. The tent city is for others? The article doesn't specify. The answer might be N/A, but maybe the question expects 30,000. Wait, the question is phrased as "how many more beyond the 10"—so 30,000 minus 10, but since they're in different facilities, maybe the answer is 30,000. Hmm, tricky. The article says the tent city is to house up to 30k migrants, but it's unclear if those include the 10 or not. Since it's a separate location, likely the 30k are in addition. So the answer would be 30,000. But the question says "beyond those with suspected gang affiliations"—so the 30k may not include the 10. So the answer is 30,000.

4. **Question 4**: The film besides "Emilia Perez" that was lauded for immigrant struggles and received similar awards. The article mentions "The Brutalist" as an epic about immigrant struggles with three Globes. So the answer is The Brutalist.

5. **Question 5**: The specific form of protest similar to Time's Up at the 82nd Globes. The article says in 2017, Meryl Streep spoke, and the next year (2018) was Time's Up with black dresses. The 82nd Globes is the current event, which the article refers to as the 2023 or the recent one. Wait, the article starts by saying the show was Hollywood's first megaphone since Trump's election to a second term. The article mentions the 2023 Globes had Zelensky. The current event (the one in the article) is the 82nd, which the article is discussing. The question is about the 82nd, so what did they do? The article says that at this year's show, there was barely a peep. The only political moment was Karla Sofia's speech. The question is asking what form of protest similar to Time's Up (which was in 2018) did attendees engage in. Since this year's show had little politics, maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "similar to the Time's Up movement"—but the article doesn't mention any such protest this time. The answer is N/A.

Wait, the article says "this time, there was barely a peep about it." So maybe no such protest. So answer N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Legal precedent from Trump's lawsuits against CBS and Register that producers cited. The article says the lawsuits lack legal merit but are effective at harassing the press. It doesn't mention that the producers cited any legal precedent from these cases. The article states that producers might have advised silence due to fear of backlash, but the question is about a legal precedent. Since there's no mention of a precedent being cited, answer N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Legislative action Karla Sofia anticipated by saying "raise your voice." The article quotes her saying "You can beat us up, but you never can take away our soul. 'Raise your voice.'" But it doesn't mention any specific legislative action she anticipated. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Alternative international aid organization after USAID closure. The article mentions Trump called for USAID closure but doesn't mention an alternative. Answer N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Percentage decrease in viewership when politics were discussed. The article says "minute-by-minute viewership analysis indicates that 'vast swaths' of people turn off televisions when celebrities start to opine on politics." But no percentage is given. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Film linked to trans rights despite being about immigrant struggles and corruption. The article mentions "Emilia Perez" as a Spanish-language musical about trans identity, and "The Brutalist" about immigrant struggles. "Wicked" is about corruption. The question is about a film linked to trans rights despite also being mentioned with other topics. Wait, the question says "linked in the article to strong trans rights advocacy despite also being mentioned alongside topics such as immigrant struggles and corruption." The article mentions "Emilia Perez" as about trans identity and won four Globes. The other films are The Brutalist (immigrant) and Wicked (corruption). So the answer is Emilia Perez.

11. **Question 11**: Celebrity who mixed humor with Ben Affleck's life and political hints in the monologue. The article says Nikki Glaser, in her monologue, teased the celebrities for not stopping Trump and then joked about Ben Affleck's sex life. So answer Nikki Glaser.

12. **Question 12**: Personality who used the stage for trans rights echoing earlier figures. The article mentions Karla Sofia Gascon (from Emilia Perez) spoke about trans rights. Earlier figures were Meryl Streep (2017) and Michelle Williams (2020). So the answer is Karla Sofia Gascon.

13. **Question 13**: Year when Globes became a rally with black attire for misconduct. The article mentions 2018 (next year after 2017) as the Time's Up year with black dresses. So the answer is 2018.

14. **Question 14**: Film honored with new best blockbuster award for confronting corruption. The article says "Wicked" got the new best blockbuster award, which is about prejudices and corruption. So answer Wicked.

15. **Question 15**: Country's leader linked to critical minerals and statehood by Trump. The article mentions Canada's leader, Justin Trudeau, discussing critical minerals and Trump's comments about making Canada a state. So answer Canada.

16. **Question 16**: Phenomenon Nielsen research revealed about viewers and politics. The article says viewers dislike when celebrities use the stage for politics, and minute-by-minute analysis shows people turn off. The phenomenon is that viewers tune out during political moments. Answer: viewers turn off televisions or similar. The exact wording from the article: "vast swaths turn off televisions when celebrities start to opine on politics."

17. **Question 17**: U.S. agency targeted for closure by Trump. The article states Trump directly called for closure of USAID. Answer USAID.

18. **Question 18**: Film addressing immigrant struggles. The Brutalist is described as an epic about immigrant struggles. Answer The Brutalist.

19. **Question 19**: Young celebrity indirectly referenced via backlash and advised reticence. The article mentions Rachel Zegler as a cautionary example. So answer Rachel Zegler.
