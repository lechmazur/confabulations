Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions beyond what's written. Let's start with each question and check the article for the answers.

   The article mentions Yelp's 13% decrease in turnover since 2021 when they allowed remote work. Wait, the question is about a 13% increase due to a return-to-office mandate.
