Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions Charlotte voiced characters in "Bluey" and "The Strange Chores," both Australian cartoons. The question asks which one she was in before NBC's "Camp." Since "Camp" is mentioned as a previous role, and the cartoons are listed after, the answer should be one of those two. The exact order isn't specified, but both are correct. Wait, the question specifies "before landing her breakthrough role as Poppy Li on NBC's 'Camp'?" Wait, no, actually, the article says "Camp" was one of her roles before Mythic Quest. The question is asking which cartoon she was in before "Camp." The article states she voiced on "Bluey" and "The Strange Chores" as well as "Camp." But "Camp" is an NBC show filmed in Australia. The cartoons are separate. The answer should be either Bluey or The Strange Chores. The question says "Australian cartoon series" so both are correct, but the article lists them together. Since it's a single answer, maybe both? But the question might expect one. Wait the article says "on the beloved Australian cartoons 'Bluey' and 'The Strange Chores.'" So both are correct, but the question asks for which one. Since it's a list, maybe either is acceptable, but the question might expect both? Wait, the user wants a direct answer. Since the question says "which Australian cartoon series," maybe the answer is both, but the instructions say if the question asks for two and the article only lists one, answer N/A. Wait, the question is singular. So maybe pick one. Alternatively, the answer is N/A because the article lists both but doesn't specify which one was before "Camp." Hmm. The article says "previously a classical pianist... began her TV career at 17 on an Australian kids' show (Camp). Previously a classical pianist, singer and orchestral clarinetist, she started acting in high school productions and began her TV career at 17 on an Australian kids' show." So "Camp" was her start, but later she did voice work on the cartoons. Wait no, the article says: "When not playing a tortured tech genius over the last few years, Nicdao has voiced characters on animated sitcoms like 'Solar Opposites' and 'Star Trek: Lower Decks' as well as on the beloved Australian cartoons 'Bluey' and 'The Strange Chores.'" So "Bluey" and "Strange Chores" are separate from "Camp." So the question is asking which cartoon she did before "Camp." But the article doesn't say that. She started with "Camp" at 17, so the cartoons were after that? Or maybe she did voice work earlier? The article says she started acting in high school productions, then began her TV career at 17 on "Camp." The voice work on the cartoons isn't dated, but since "Camp" is her first major role, the cartoons might be after. Therefore, the answer is N/A because the article doesn't specify which cartoon was before "Camp." Wait but the question is phrased as "before landing her breakthrough role as Poppy Li on NBC's 'Camp'?" Wait no, "Camp" is NBC, but it's an Australian show filmed there. The breakthrough role is Poppy Li on Mythic Quest. The question is which cartoon she did before "Camp." Since "Camp" was her first TV role, the cartoons would be after? Or maybe she did cartoons before "Camp"? The article isn't clear. Since the question can't be answered directly, answer N/A.

Wait, the question says "before landing her breakthrough role as Poppy Li on NBC's 'Camp'?" Wait, no, "Camp" is the NBC show she was a series regular on, which was before Mythic Quest. So "before Camp" would be earlier, but the cartoons are listed as separate. Since the article doesn't state which came first between her voice roles in cartoons and "Camp," the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The article says Charlotte directed an episode in Season 4, and Rob McElhenney mentored her in producing during Season 2. The question is how many episodes she directed in S4. The article says "a lot of the cast got the opportunity to direct an episode." She directed one. So the answer is 1.

3. **Question 3:** The budget for the film with her father during the 2023 strike. The article says "completely independent" and "two days with the resources that we have," but no budget figure. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** When did Poppy transition from hoodies to blouses? The article says this happened in Season 4. So during Season 4.

5. **Question 5:** Her classical music training's role in her character dev. The article doesn't mention that. She mentions her training but the question links it to the 4th season's dev. No info, so N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Years between last appearance on Australian TV and casting in Mythic Quest. The article says she was on "Camp" which was NBC, but filmed in Australia. When was that? The article doesn't say when she was cast in Mythic Quest. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Viewing audience size for the premiere. The article doesn't mention numbers. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Ingredients Poppy uses. The article says she's into farmers' markets but doesn't list ingredients. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Number of episodes for Star Trek before S4. No numbers given. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Duration of clarinet career before acting at 17. She started at 17, so duration before that? The article says she was a classical pianist, singer, and clarinetist before acting in high school, but doesn't give years. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Role similar to her father's in the short film. The father played stereotypical Asian roles. The question asks what role Charlotte had on "Camp" that inspired her move. The article says "One of the biggest roles that I ever had was a series regular on a show called 'Camp,' which was an NBC show that filmed in Australia," noting it inspired her move. But the role's similarity to her father's isn't stated. The father's roles were "restaurateur, gangster, doctor -- these very stereotypical Asian roles." The article doesn't say Charlotte's role on "Camp" was similar. So N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Seasons before Poppy explored her identity as a sexual being. The article says in S4 she starts exploring this. So before that, 3 seasons.

13. **Question 13:** Establishment where Poppy gets pizza. The article says she subsists on gas station Buffalo chicken pizza. So gas station.

14. **Question 14:** Musical instrument Poppy plays in anxiety. The article mentions Nicdao's clarinet training but doesn't say Poppy plays it. N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Other sitcom by McElhenney et al where she voices. The article mentions she voices on "Solar Opposites," which is a sitcom. The creators of Mythic Quest are McElhenney, Day, Ganz. The article says she voiced on "Solar Opposites," but is that created by them? The article doesn't say. So N/A unless "Solar Opposites" is by them. Wait, the article says "Solar Opposites" is an animated sitcom she voices. The question asks if it's created by McElhenney's team. Since the article doesn't link "Solar Opposites" to them, answer N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Artistic medium she explored during the strike. The short film with her father involved acting and directing. The question says "artistic medium... reflecting Poppy's shift... leading to collaborative project." The project was a short film, so film.

17. **Question 17:** Common theme between Poppy's growth and Tom Green's projects. The article mentions Tom Green's return with projects exploring complex power dynamics. Poppy's growth involves personal boundaries and power with Ian. So the theme is "complex power dynamics."

18. **Question 18:** Common element between wardrobe and title sequences. The article says Poppy's wardrobe shift (blouses) and title sequences are both part of exploring power dynamics. The question asks what element they share contributing to power dynamics. The article says title sequences use visual style to show epicness, but the question's context is power dynamics. Maybe the answer is "wardrobe" and "title sequences" both contribute to power dynamics, but the question asks for the common element. The article states "the title sequences have become awfully familiar" but the power dynamics are in the show's content. Maybe the element is "visual style" but the question links to power dynamics. Wait the question says "common element found in both Poppy's evolving wardrobe and the title sequences of many television series, contributes to the show's exploration of complex power dynamics." The wardrobe's change shows her growth, and title sequences use visual style to make shows appear epic, but the article says title sequences are about being epic, not power dynamics. The only link is the article mentions title sequences and Poppy's wardrobe in separate sections. Maybe the answer is "wardrobe and title sequences both use visual style to reflect power dynamics," but the question wants the element they share. Since the article doesn't explicitly link them, N/A. Alternatively, the article says title sequences are part of making TV appear epic, but the power dynamics are in the content. Maybe the answer is N/A.

Wait, the question is: "What common element, found in both Poppy's evolving wardrobe and the title sequences of many television series, contributes to the show's exploration of complex power dynamics?" The wardrobe's change (from hoodies to blouses) reflects her personal growth and power shift with Ian. The title sequences are mentioned as a visual style. The article says title sequences are used to make shows appear epic, but the power dynamics are explored through the content, not the title sequences. So maybe the common element is "visual style" but it's not directly linked. Since the article doesn't connect title sequences to power dynamics, the answer is N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Genre where her father found roles now being revolutionized by Black directors. The article says her father was in stereotypical Asian roles in TV, and the last decade saw more space for actors of color. The section mentions Black directors like RaMell Ross are chronicling Black life. The common genre is "TV" but more specifically, the genre related to her father's roles (stereotypical Asian roles) might be "drama" or "action," but the question links to Black directors' genre. The article says Black directors are doing "Black cinema's time revolution" in chronicling Black life. The common element is "drama" or "cinema" but the exact term is "Black cinema" as per the article's section title: "Black Cinema's Time Revolution." So the answer is "Black cinema."

20. **Question 20:** Streaming service with her voiced role, contrasting live-action. The article mentions she voices on "Star Trek: Lower Decks," which is on Paramount+ (formerly CBS All Access). The question lists services including Hulu, Disney+, etc. The article's streaming guide mentions Amazon Prime, so maybe "Star Trek: Lower Decks" is on Paramount+, but the options include "Max" (HBO Max?), Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Hulu. The article doesn't specify, but the question says "mentioned alongside Netflix and Max." The article's last part lists "Streaming Guides: If you are overwhelmed... best offerings on Netflix, Max, Disney+, Amazon Prime and Hulu..." So "Star Trek: Lower Decks" is on Amazon Prime? Or another? The article doesn't specify, so N/A. Alternatively, if "Star Trek: Lower Decks" is on Paramount+, which isn't listed here, then N/A. The article doesn't say, so answer N/A.
