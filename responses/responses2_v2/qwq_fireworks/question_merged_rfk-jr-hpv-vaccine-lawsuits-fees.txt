Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information provided in the article.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions that Conor Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s son, is a lawyer at Wisner Baum. The text also states that redirected payments could go to family members. So the answer should be his son, Conor.

2. **Question 2:** The article doesn't specify how many clients Senator Warren referred to as having adverse effects. She talked about potential conflicts but didn't give a number. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Public records show Kennedy earned $2.5 million from Wisner Baum since 2022, but the firm clarified that none of that was from vaccine cases. The time frame here is 2020-2022. Since the $2.5M is from 2022 onwards and not related to vaccines, the article doesn't mention vaccine-related earnings in that period. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The U.S. Office of Government Ethics usually approves nominees' agreements, but the article states they didn't respond to questions. The initial agreement was filed, but it's unclear if they formally approved it yet. The article doesn't explicitly say, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The plaintiff claims a blood circulation disorder. The article mentions "blood circulation disorder" specifically.

6. **Question 6:** Kennedy first mentioned redirecting fees during the second hearing on Thursday. The article says he disclosed it publicly there.

7. **Question 7:** The article doesn't mention Senator Murray calculating a specific amount, just her questioning about trust in him. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Kaine cited studies about Gardasil's effectiveness, but the article doesn't provide a specific percentage prevented. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The article mentions possibilities like a trust or LLC but doesn't name one. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The timeline for amending isn't given. The ethics office requires clearance for changes, but no date is provided. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The condition is a blood circulation disorder, not neurological. Wait, the article says "blood circulation disorder", which isn't neurological. The question asks for a neurological disorder, so maybe that's a trick. Since it's not stated as neurological, answer N/A.

12. **Question 12:** The $2.5M was from wildfire and Roundup cases, per Wisner Baum's statement. So the answer is $2.5 million.

13. **Question 13:** No specific name is given for the trust or LLC. So N/A.

14. **Question 14:** The Office of Government Ethics must approve changes, but the revised agreement's approval isn't mentioned. The article says they didn't respond, so maybe N/A.

15. **Question 15:** The article doesn't name a specific study Kaine cited. He mentioned studies, but no title given. N/A.

16. **Question 16:** The trial began "this month" in California, but the article doesn't specify the exact date. N/A.

17. **Question 17:** The financial disclosure mentions Merck, but no other companies are named. N/A.

18. **Question 18:** Murray talked about effectiveness but no specific number of cases prevented. N/A.

19. **Question 19:** The article doesn't mention a specific provision violated, just that he had to clear changes. N/A.

20. **Question 20:** The article doesn't state a percentage Kennedy alleged. N/A.
