Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and answer exactly what's asked. Let's start with the first question.

1. The question is asking for the name of the album released in November that contains "TV Off," which shares the same producer as Tupac's diss track. Wait, the article mentions "GNX" as the album from November, and "TV Off" is part of that. But the producer connection to Tupac's diss track? The article says "Not Like Us" was produced by Mustard. Tupac's "Hit 'Em Up" was produced by his group, but the article doesn't mention the producer's name. Hmm, maybe the question is a bit of a trick. The article says "GNX" is the album with "TV Off," so the answer is "GNX".

2. The question refers to a song that blends diss with a catchy beat, highlighting a shift to a bold image. The article says "Not Like Us" is the track that did that. So answer is "Not Like Us".

3. The track with Grammy wins and a cover showing Drake's Toronto home with markings. That's clearly "Not Like Us".

4. The record considered for modification due to legal issues at the Super Bowl. The article discusses whether Lamar will perform "Not Like Us" because of the lawsuit and other pressures. So "Not Like Us".

5. The song with over a billion Spotify plays and a playful refrain. The article states "Not Like Us" has one billion plays and the chorus "They not like us" is catchy. So "Not Like Us".

6. The track with harsh epithets and Drake's home image. Again, "Not Like Us".

7. The song that might be in a medley, contrasting with past anthems. The article mentions "GNX" tracks like "TV Off" share the pugnaciousness but could be medleys. Wait, the question says the song being reexamined. The article says "Not Like Us" might be part of a medley. So answer is "Not Like Us".

8. The hit that evolved from underground to mainstream with legal issues over artwork. That's "Not Like Us".

9. The record with sped-up strings, bouncy vibe, and bar mitzvah appeal. The article describes "Not Like Us" with those elements, so that's it.

10. The song causing a persona shift from silent protester to vocal hitmaker. "Not Like Us" is the track mentioned here.

11. The song with infectious chorus, club appeal, and performed at a West Coast event. "Not Like Us" was performed five times at the Pop Out concert. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me check each again carefully.

For question 1: The question mentions Tupac's diss track's producer. The article says "Not Like Us" was produced by Mustard. Tupac's "Hit 'Em Up" was produced by his group, but the article doesn't link Mustard to Tupac. Maybe the question is a trick, but the album with "TV Off" is "GNX". The part about the same producer as Tupac's diss track might be a red herring. Since the article doesn't mention Tupac's producer, but the answer is still "GNX" because that's the album mentioned with "TV Off". So proceed with that.

All others seem to point to "Not Like Us" except question 7 and 11, but 7 asks for the song that might be condensed in a medley. The article says "GNX" tracks like "TV Off" could be in medleys. Wait, but the question says "implicitly reexamined". The article mentions "Not Like Us" might be part of a medley. So the answer is still "Not Like Us".

Everything else checks out. So all answers are "Not Like Us" except question 1 ("GNX") and maybe others? Wait let me recheck.

Question 8: The track that evolved from underground to mainstream via battles and legal issues. The article says "Not Like Us" led to the lawsuit and is part of Lamar's shift. So yes.

Question 11: The article mentions "Not Like Us" was performed five times at the Pop Out concert. So correct.

Alright, I think all answers are there.
