Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one using only the given article. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then scanning the article for the exact information needed. I'll take it step by step.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks about the percentage tariff Trump threatened on chipmakers in Taiwan after meeting Jensen Huang, linked to Howard Lutnick. The article mentions Trump vowed up to 100% tariffs on chipmakers until they build factories in the US. The name Howard Lutnick is mentioned in the context of linking export controls to tariffs. So the answer is 100%.

2. **Question 2**: Senator Warren criticized Scott Bessent's actions at the CFPB. The question asks which deal Giovanni advised on that might be re-evaluated. The article says Giovanni advised on deals like Airbnb's IPO and Slack's sale to Salesforce. Since Bessent is affecting CFPB policies, maybe a deal related to financial regulations? But the article doesn't specify a direct link. The answer might be N/A because the article doesn't connect Giovanni's deals to Bessent's policies.

3. **Question 3**: Microsoft's spending on initiatives competing with TikTok. The article states Microsoft committed $80 billion to AI this year. Since AI could compete with TikTok's tech, the answer is $80 billion.

4. **Question 4**: The American energy product China targeted after reprieves. The article says China retaliated with tariffs on liquefied natural gas (LNG). So LNG is the answer.

5. **Question 5**: Michael Grimes' role affecting Musk's TikTok deal. The article mentions Grimes is joining Commerce Dept., but his role was as a banker. The question links to national security. However, the article doesn't say his role directly impacts TikTok's assessment. So N/A?

6. **Question 6**: Adam Candeub's action related to Twitter affecting TikTok. The article says he represented an anti-trans feminist in a suit against Twitter. Not directly related to TikTok acquisition. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: European leader who might strengthen ties with Xiaomi due to Google's investigation. The article mentions Macron as a European leader against Trump's tariffs. Since China is targeting Google, maybe Macron sees an opportunity. So Macron.

8. **Question 8**: Export restrictions China imposed on tech for AI. Gregory Allen mentioned tungsten and molybdenum used in electronics. These are critical exports impacting AI. So tungsten and molybdenum.

9. **Question 9**: Ted Sarandos' role in Rick Caruso's group affecting trade shifts. The article says Ted is part of the nonprofit for rebuilding. His role as co-CEO might not directly tie to trade, but the question is about his advisory role. The article doesn't specify his role's impact on trade, so maybe N/A?

10. **Question 10**: Deal amount Giovanni advised before leaving Goldman. The article mentions Slack's $30B sale to Salesforce. So $30 billion.

11. **Question 11**: Joint infrastructure project with Ted Sarandos and Mike Hopkins. The article only mentions their involvement in the rebuilding group, not a specific project. So N/A.

12. **Question 12**: European automaker Macron referenced. The article says Trump complained about EU auto trade deficits. Macron might reference a car maker like Renault or VW, but the text doesn't name one. So N/A.

13. **Question 13**: TikTok's revenue contribution to ByteDance in 2023. The article discusses a share-swap deal but doesn't give specific revenue percentages. So N/A.
