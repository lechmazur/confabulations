Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions beyond that. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks how Paul Tazewell's childhood experience in Akron, Ohio, influenced Madame Morrible's robe. The article mentions that Tazewell designed costumes for a high school production of "The Wiz" there. But the part about Madame Morrible's robe specifically says it had astrological runes. The article doesn't directly link his childhood experience to that design element. It only connects his experience to getting the gig for "Wicked." So the answer here should be N/A because the specific influence on the robe isn't stated.

2. Next, question 2 is about Count Orlok's attire reflecting the Freewheelin' era. Wait, the Freewheelin' era is mentioned in Arianne Phillips' work on the Bob Dylan biopic. Linda Muir worked on "Nosferatu," which is the vampire movie set in Transylvania. The article says Muir looked at the Esterhazy family's clothes from around 1590 for Count Orlok's cloak. The Freewheelin' era is from Dylan's time, so there's no connection here. So this must be N/A.

3. Question 3 asks about Lisy Christl's use of antique illustrations. The text says she used Roman Catholic Church inspiration and took liberties with reds and accessories. It mentions "antique German fashion illustrations" but that's for Linda Muir's work on "Nosferatu." Wait, the question is about Lisy Christl. The article says Christl's research included the Roman Catholic Church, but the specific antique illustrations aren't mentioned for her. So maybe N/A here too.

4. Question 4: Which designer with military specialization used astrological runes? The astrological runes are on Madame Morrible's robe in "Wicked," designed by Tazewell. But the military specialist mentioned is David Crossman, who worked on "Gladiator II." The article doesn't say Crossman used runes. The runes are from Tazewell's work, who isn't linked to military. So this might be N/A unless I'm missing something. Wait, Janty Yates has a win for Gladiator, and she's on Gladiator II. But the runes are in Wicked's Madame Morrible. So the answer would be N/A because the question links military specialist to runes, which isn't there.

5. Question 5: Paul Mescal's attire in Gladiator II designed by a previous Oscar winner (Yates) that mirrored decadent Gothic from another film. The Gothic wardrobe is from "Nosferatu" by Linda Muir. The leggy leather battle skirt went viral. The question asks what aspect mirrored that. The article says Yates and Crossman's work on the skirt, but the Gothic influence is from Muir's film. So maybe the decadent elements like luxurious materials? The answer might be the "leggy leather battle skirt" since that's the specific item mentioned. The question says "mirrored the decadent Gothic," but the skirt is more military. Hmm, maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "decadent Gothic wardrobe" refers to Muir's work. The Gladiator II's design might not directly mirror that, unless the extravagance is considered. But the answer would need to be specific. The question is tricky. Since the article mentions that the skirt went viral but doesn't link it to Gothic, maybe N/A.

6. Question 6: Arianne Phillips' work on Dylan inspired Yates' designs. The article says Phillips focused on Dylan's eras, while Yates worked on Gladiator II. There's no mention of cross-inspiration between their projects. So N/A.

7. Question 7: Besides Elphaba's, another costume from Wicked designed by Tazewell (who did The Wiz in high school) that was in marketing. The article mentions Galinda's pink bubble dress and Madame Morrible's robe. The marketing campaign probably used Galinda's dress since it's highlighted. The answer would be Galinda's pink bubble dress.

8. Question 8: Historical artifact Arianne Phillips consulted for 1965 mod silhouette. The article says she used newsreels and photos, breaking Dylan's timeline into three beats. The Freewheelin' era and 1965 mod. The specific artifact? The text doesn't mention a specific artifact, just newsreels and photos. So N/A.

9. Question 9: Nominee inspired by Catholic structures and longtime Scott collaborator. Lisy Christl's work was inspired by the Catholic Church. But the longtime Scott collaborator is Janty Yates and David Crossman. The question says "inspired by Roman Catholic Church structures" which is Lisy Christl. But she's not a Scott collaborator. The answer would be N/A? Wait, the article says Lisy Christl was inspired by the Church's structure, and Yates and Crossman are Scott's collaborators. So the question's answer is neither. Wait, the question asks which nominee (so among the designers listed) was inspired by Catholic structures and is a Scott collaborator. Lisy Christl is inspired by the Church but isn't a Scott collaborator. Yates and Crossman are Scott's collaborators but their work isn't about the Church. So N/A?

Wait, the article says Lisy Christl: "I can see the inspiration from the Roman Catholic Church all over the place" and she was working on Conclave. The question is asking which nominee (designer) was inspired by the Church's structures and was a longtime Scott collaborator. Since Christl is the one inspired by the Church, but not a Scott collaborator. The Scott collaborators are Yates and Crossman. So the answer is N/A. Unless I misread. Wait, the question says "which nominee... was also a longtime Ridley Scott collaborator?" So the person must be both inspired by Catholic structures and a Scott collaborator. Since no one matches both, it's N/A.

10. Question 10: Color of Galinda's bubble dress designed by someone inspired by Esterhazy family. Wait, the Esterhazy family is mentioned in Linda Muir's work for Nosferatu. The designer of Galinda's dress is Tazewell. The question links the designer's inspiration (Esterhazy) to the color of the dress. But Tazewell's inspiration was from his high school play, not Esterhazy. The Esterhazy is for Muir. So the color is pink, as stated in the article for Galinda's dress. The question's "designed by the person who drew inspiration from Esterhazy" is incorrect because Tazewell didn't. So the answer would be N/A because the designer in question isn't the one inspired by Esterhazy. The color is pink, but the premise is wrong, so N/A.

Wait, the question says "the designer who drew inspiration from the Esterhazy family paintings." The Esterhazy were referenced by Linda Muir for Count Orlok's cloak. So the designer here would be Muir, but Galinda's dress is designed by Tazewell. So the question is incorrect in its premise, so answer N/A.

11. Question 11: Janty Yates' total nominations including Gladiator II. The article says Yates has a third nomination (one win for Gladiator I). So with Gladiator II, that's third nomination. Wait, the article says "Janty Yates (third nomination; one win)". So total nominations are 3, with one win. So the answer is 3.

12. Question 12: Designer who altered religious garments' colors by intensifying red and adding emerald. The article mentions Lisy Christl in Conclave made reds richer and added luxurious accessories. Emerald isn't mentioned. So maybe just "intensifying red hues" is her. The question says "intensifying red and adding emerald accents." Since emerald isn't there, maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "rendering reds richer and making accessories like crosses and jewelry more luxurious." No emerald. So the answer would be N/A because emerald isn't mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to Christl's work. The article doesn't mention emerald, so since the question adds "emerald accents" which isn't in the text, answer N/A.

13. Question 13: Which film required studying 17th-century German aristocratic illustrations? Linda Muir for Nosferatu looked at 1590 Esterhazy family paintings, which would be late 16th century, close to 17th. The question says 17th-century German, so maybe it's a close enough timeframe. The article says "around 1590" which is 16th century, but the Esterhazy family from that time. The question asks for 17th-century German aristocratic, so perhaps N/A. Alternatively, if the illustrations are German, then "Nosferatu" is the film. Since 1590 is late 16th, but the question says 17th, maybe N/A. Alternatively, the article says "German fashion illustrations" for Muir's research? Wait, the text says Linda Muir "tracked down antique German fashion illustrations and consulted experts in Romanian history." So the German illustrations are part of her research. The time period for Orlok's attire is 1590, so the illustrations would be from that era. The question asks for 17th-century, so not exactly. So N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "Nosferatu" even if the time is off? The question says "17th-century German aristocratic fashion illustrations," but the article says 1590 (late 16th). So N/A.
