Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I don't use any outside knowledge and only the facts from the text. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **How many millions of dollars did the Trump Organization executive say were generated in fees from the initial NFT trading card sales before pivoting to the memecoin strategy?**
   - The article mentions that the Trump family sold digital trading cards in 2022, but there's no specific amount stated about the fees from those NFT sales. The $58 million figure is for the memecoin launch, not the NFTs. So this would be N/A.

2. **Which crypto executive who attended the Crypto Ball texted directly with Mike Johnson about the $Trump coin launch during Snoop Dogg's performance?**
   - The article says Fred Thiel, CEO of Mara Holdings, chatted with Mike Johnson and Johnson sent a text to Trump right in front of him. The question is about who texted with Johnson during Snoop's performance. The text was from Johnson to Trump, but the executive present was Thiel. Maybe he's the one, but the text was from Johnson to Trump. The question says "texted directly with Mike Johnson" so maybe Thiel was involved. But the article says Johnson sent the text to Trump in front of Thiel. So perhaps the answer is Fred Thiel, but the text was from Johnson to Trump. The question is about the executive who texted with Johnson. Hmm, maybe not. The article says "House Speaker Mike Johnson sent a text to President Trump right in front of him." So the "him" is Thiel. So Thiel was there when Johnson texted Trump. The question is asking which executive texted with Johnson during Snoop's performance. Since the text was from Johnson to Trump, maybe the answer is N/A because the executive didn't text with Johnson, but was present. So maybe N/A.

3. **What was the final selling price of Josh Bailey's $Trump holdings after he invested his initial $12,000 stake?**
   - The article says his stake "more than quintupled in value". Quintupled means 5x. So $12k *5 is $60,000. The answer would be $60,000.

4. **According to Melania Trump's social media announcement, what unique technological features distinguished her memecoin from the $Trump token?**
   - The article states that Melania's $Melania tokens were described as "digital collectibles" not an investment. The $Trump was treated as an investment. So the answer is that they were marketed as collectibles, not investments. But the question asks for technological features. The article doesn't mention any tech features, just the marketing. So N/A.

5. **How many regulatory agencies did President Trump specifically name in his executive order promoting the crypto industry?**
   - The article says he signed an executive order pledging to promote crypto but doesn't list the number of agencies mentioned. So N/A.

6. **Which former Biden administration official did David Sacks replace as the lead advisor on Trump's crypto policy team?**
   - The article mentions David Sacks was appointed by Trump, but doesn't mention who he replaced. So N/A.

7. **What was the total dollar amount of trades executed by the Ansem account before their final $2 million loss on $Trump tokens?**
   - The article mentions Ansem spent $9 million to buy $Trump before the drop, then sold at a $2M loss. But total trades before the loss? The question is about total trades executed before the loss. The article only mentions the $9M purchase leading to the loss. So N/A unless we consider the $9M as part of the trades, but the question is about total dollar amount of all trades. The article doesn't specify total, just the loss from that trade. So N/A.

8. **How many hours after the Crypto Ball did Eric Trump post his first social media message about the "hottest digital meme on earth"?**
   - The Crypto Ball was a few days before the inauguration, and the coin was announced on Jan 17. Eric's post is mentioned after, but the exact time isn't given. The article says "Eric Trump, in a social media post, hailed the new investment as 'the hottest digital meme on earth.'" But no time frame. So N/A.

9. **What specific regulatory framework did the S.E.C. chairman nominee propose for distinguishing between security tokens and collectible NFTs?**
   - The article mentions the SEC under Gensler took actions, but the nominee's proposal isn't detailed. The question is about the nominee's specific framework, which isn't mentioned. So N/A.

10. **Which song performed by Snoop Dogg at the Crypto Ball coincided with the social media announcement of the $Trump memecoin's launch?**
    - The article says "Trump wrote on Truth Social and X as Snoop Dogg took the stage. 'It's time to celebrate...'". The song isn't named. The example given earlier was "Don't Stop Believin'", but that's from the start of the party. The announcement happened as Snoop was on stage, but the specific song isn't mentioned. So N/A.

11. **What was the stated justification by Eric Trump for dismissing concerns about conflicts of interest between the Trump family's crypto ventures and regulatory appointments?**
    - Eric said, "The $Trump trading card and World Liberty Financial are two of the most successful projects in crypto history," dismissing the conflict. So the answer is that they are successful projects.

12. **Which regulatory agency's former chair did crypto traders ironically reference as preferable during the $Trump token's price collapse, despite their prior adversarial stance toward the industry?**
    - The article mentions traders said "missing Gary Gensler right now," who was SEC chair. So the answer is the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission).

13. **What specific legal precedent involving cartoon NFTs did critics cite as potentially applicable to the Trump family's memecoin offerings?**
    - The article mentions the Stoner Cats NFTs as a precedent where the SEC sued because they were marketed as investments. So the answer is the Stoner Cats NFTs case.

14. **Which congressional Democrat initiated a formal inquiry into the $Trump token's compliance with securities laws, according to the text?**
    - The text says Senator Elizabeth Warren and others wrote to regulators. So the answer is Elizabeth Warren.

15. **What was the total dollar amount of fees collected by the Trump family from $Trump token transactions during the first 24 hours after its launch?**
    - The article states "by one estimate, the launch of $Trump generated $58 million in fees for the Trump family in less than a day." So $58 million.

16. **Which cryptocurrency executive publicly criticized the Trump administration's handling of the memecoin launch while attending the Crypto Ball, despite being a vocal Trump supporter?**
    - The article mentions Nic Carter, who is a supporter, criticized it as a cash grab. So Nic Carter.

17. **What specific action by Melania Trump directly caused the $Trump token's price to drop 60% within a day of its peak valuation?**
    - Melania launched her own memecoin, which caused competition. The article says her announcement caused the price to plummet. So launching her own $Melania token.

18. **Which Trump Organization business partner previously marketed self-help courses and gym equipment before collaborating on the family's NFT and memecoin ventures?**
    - Bill Zanker is mentioned as having sold back rubs, gym equipment, and self-help courses. So Bill Zanker.
