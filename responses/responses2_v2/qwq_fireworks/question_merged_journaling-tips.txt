Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful and only use the information given. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks which journal-keeper recommends writing entries while watching the sunset to maximize creative potential. Scanning through the article, I don't see any mention of someone specifically suggesting watching the sunset. The closest is Albert Moya using hotel notebooks, but the sunset part isn't there. So probably N/A.

2. The second question is about the novelist who creates video montages and the percentage of entries with both written and visual elements. The article mentions Maggie Shipstead makes videos after trips, but there's no percentage given. So N/A.

3. The 44-year-old journalist uses a pen with the Day One app. The article says Aatish Taseer, 44, recommends the Day One app and uses color-coding. It also mentions he uses a pen, but the specific pen type? Wait, looking back: "Iyer gravitates toward fine-tipped Pilot Razor Point markers. Gevinson uses .38-millimeter Pilot G2 and Muji ballpoints. Moya loves a hotel pen." The 44-year-old is Taseer, but the pen isn't mentioned for him. So maybe N/A? Wait, the question is about the pen he uses with the app. Since the article doesn't specify his pen, answer N/A.

4. Psychological benefits from Justine Richelle's research during stress. The article says her research says journaling "can raise levels of optimism and life satisfaction". So that's the benefit, even if the question mentions "intense stress"â€”the article doesn't specify stress periods, but the answer is still the given benefit.

5. How many sheets of Southworth's paper does Iyer use per month? The article says he uses that paper but doesn't mention the number of sheets per month. So N/A.

6. Amy Krentzman's technique for childhood trauma. The article says she developed a method for people in recovery, suggesting listing good things and good wishes. But it doesn't mention childhood trauma specifically. So N/A.

7. Correlation between pens and emotional depth. The article says Krentzman suggests experimenting with pens for tactile enjoyment, but no direct correlation stated. So N/A.

8. Moya's morning journaling time before workout. The article says he writes before or after a morning workout but doesn't specify minutes. N/A.

9. Cambridge Imprint journal design for emotional processing. The article lists Cambridge Imprint as a journal Tavi likes, but no specific design mentioned for emotional challenges. N/A.

10. Hotel notebooks and memory retention. The article says Moya uses hotel notebooks because they remind him where he was, which helps fix memories. So the connection is that they improve memory retention by serving as reminders of location/time.

11. The 50-year journaler who notes background melodies. That's Pico Iyer, who logs details like a song playing to fix memories. So answer is Pico Iyer.

12. The writer using Southworth paper and logs travel in evenings. That's Iyer again, as described in the article. The 24-pound paper and logging in evenings when traveling.

13. The professional who writes "postcards" to himself and advises not to judge. Albert Moya mentions "postcards" to himself, and he's the one who says not to judge yourself. So Moya.

14. The person who describes journal as "psychic garbage" dump, uses collaging, etc., and says to restart if missed. That's Tavi Gevinson. The article says she does all those techniques and mentions restarting.

15. The combined advice: starting with location/time and changing time relationship. Albert Moya starts with location and time. Tavi says the journal can change your relationship to time. So combining both would be Moya, since he starts with location/time and the other part is from Tavi. Wait, the question says "which journal keeper" who fits both. Let me check. The starting with location and time is Moya's method. The changing time relationship is Tavi's quote. Since the question combines both, but they are from different people, maybe it's N/A. Wait, the question says "if one combines the guidance to begin every entry with location/time (from Moya) and the suggestion that a journal can change your time relationship (from Gevinson), which keeper fits this combined advice?" Since the two are from different people, the answer would be N/A. But maybe the question is looking for someone who does both? The article doesn't say anyone combines both, so N/A? Wait, let me check again. The question says "which journal keeper from the article fits this combined advice?" So the two pieces of advice come from different people. The answer would be N/A because no single person does both. But maybe the question is asking for the person who does the first part (Moya) since the second part is from Tavi. Since the question combines them, but the answer must be one person, so N/A. Alternatively, maybe the combined advice is from the two, but the question wants the person who does the first part. Wait, the question says "which journal keeper fits this combined advice?" which is a combination of two different people's advice. Therefore, no one, so N/A. Alternatively, perhaps the question is implying that the person who does the location/time is the one who also can change time relationship, but the article says Gevinson is the one who says the time relationship part. So Moya starts with location/time, but the time relationship part is from Gevinson. So they are separate, so N/A. Hmm.
