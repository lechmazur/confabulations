Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks which Broadway director previously worked with Ibraheem on the 2014 monologue. The article mentions that Oliver Butler directed the play and that he had success with "What the Constitution Means to Me" at New York Theater Workshop. Since the play began as a monologue in 2014 and he's directing now, maybe he was involved earlier? The article says "long predates the current war" and that Butler is directing now, but does it say he worked on the original monologue? Hmm, the article states "Directed by Oliver Butler... the play began as a 10-minute monologue that Ibraheem wrote in 2014." There's no mention of Butler being involved in the original monologue. So the answer might be N/A. Wait, but the article says "Butler, returning to the theater where he had such great success with 'What the Constitution Means to Me'". The theater is New York Theater Workshop. But does that mean he worked with Ibraheem on the original monologue? Not necessarily. The question is about who previously worked with her on the 2014 version. The text doesn't say. So answer is N/A.

2. Question 2: How many minutes does Mariam's mother spend practicing evacuation drills with her grandson before moving in permanently? The article says the mother moves in when the war begins, not because it's safer. It mentions Mariam practices with her son and mother, but there's no specific time mentioned for drills. So N/A.

3. Critical response to Mariam's husband's decision? The article says "an eventual cluster of details about her relationship with her husband... feels inorganic." But the question is about critical response. The article doesn't mention any critical response to his decision, just that the details feel inorganic. So N/A.

4. Which character introduces counting underwear as a survival strategy? The article says Mariam asks "How many pairs of underwear would we pack..." So Mariam is the one.

5. Psychological condition attributed to Mariam's planning. The article mentions her anxiety escalating but says she maintains a facade. It also says the boundary between awake/asleep blurs. Maybe the condition is anxiety or trauma? But the question asks what the playwright attributes it to. The text says "whether awake or asleep, has been trapped inside a nightmare all along." The playwright (Ibraheem) might be showing it as part of her coping mechanism or PTSD? The article doesn't name a condition, so N/A.

6. Lighting design symbolizing transition between dreams and reality. The article mentions lighting by Oona Curley but says the lights are kept up on the audience, which hindered immersion. No info on how it symbolizes the transition. N/A.

7. Psychological significance of the warning system through Nour's perspective. The article mentions Nour is a heavy sleeper and needs to be carried. The "knock on the roof" is a real technique, but the question is about the playwright's assigned cultural significance via Nour. The text doesn't elaborate, so N/A.

8. Previous Gaza-themed productions influencing Butler's choices. The article mentions he directed "What the Constitution Means to Me" at NYTW, but that's not Gaza-themed. No other mentions, so N/A.

9. Role of mother's cooking in normalcy. The article says the mother moves in and they go through practice runs, but nothing about cooking. N/A.

10. Seating arrangement mirroring Gaza buildings. The article says some audience seated onstage and lights up, but doesn't say it mirrors the layout. N/A.

11. The warning technique's name is given in the article as "a knock on the roof."

12. Director who did "Constitution" and now guides the play. That's Oliver Butler, as mentioned.

13. Character whose mental state wavers between dream and reality is Mariam.

14. The playwright and lead is Khawla Ibraheem.

15. The venue is New York Theater Workshop.

16. The son's name is Nour.

17. The family member moving in is her mother.

18. The audience comment was "I can't run at all."

19. The other Broadway performer mentioned is Idina Menzel, in "Redwood."

20. The long-running show's farewell is Blue Man Group.
