Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I don't look anywhere else, just the given text. Let's start with the first question.

1. **Volume of glass bottles in a shift**: The article says the Ghent facility processes 66,000 glass bottles per hour. A standard shift is 8 hours, so 66,000 * 8 = 528,000 bottles. But the question asks for milliliters. Wait, the article doesn't mention the size of each bottle. Hmm, since volume per bottle isn't given, I can't calculate total milliliters. So answer is N/A.

2. **Days of production impacted**: The affected codes are from "328 GE" to "338 GE". Assuming each code corresponds to a day's production (like 328 to 338 is 10 days?), but the article doesn't specify how codes relate to days. The production codes might not be sequential days. Without knowing the code's date mapping, can't calculate. So N/A.

3. **US equivalent to Dutch authority**: The Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority is a regulatory body. The FDA in the US oversees food safety. So FDA is the likely answer.

4. **Chemical to eliminate**: The chlorate is a byproduct of chlorine dioxide. So they need to stop using chlorine dioxide as a disinfectant.

5. **Other health issue**: The article mentions kidney problems and thyroid. The other issue would be kidney problems. But the question asks for another mentioned in a different context. Wait, the article's other parts mention D.E.I. Retreat and other stories but not health issues. So maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "mentioned in a different context within the article". The only health context here is the chlorate's effects. So maybe N/A.

6. **Other European country contacted**: The article says Germany, France, and Britain received limited quantities. The question asks which regulatory body was contacted. The answer is Britain's, but the country's name is UK or Britain? The article says "Britain's Food Standards Agency". So Britain is the country.

7. **Individual to comment on economic implications**: The article mentions John Yoon as the reporter. Another person mentioned is Anne Gravett (UK FSA), but she's a regulator. The other names are Claire Moses and Gregory Schmidt, but they contributed reporting. The question refers to someone in a different news story context. The article's last paragraphs mention a Start-Up's Claim of a Miracle, which involved Bill Gates? Wait, the "Bill Gates Isn't Like..." section. Maybe Bill Gates? But he's a philanthropist. Alternatively, the article mentions DeepSeek's Rise, a tech firm. Maybe someone from that? The article doesn't name an economic expert, so N/A.

8. **Technology for tracking recalls**: The article doesn't mention any specific technology, but maybe blockchain or AI? The article mentions DeepSeek (AI firm) in another context. So maybe "DeepSeek's AI" but that's a stretch. The question allows inference. Since the article mentions DeepSeek in a different context, perhaps that's the answer. Or maybe the article doesn't mention any tech, so N/A.

9. **Business with similar quality issues**: The article mentions a start-up treating cancer with unproven methods leading to deaths. So that's a biotech or pharmaceutical company. Alternatively, the bottling plant is a manufacturing facility. The question says "mentioned in a completely different context". The other context includes the Start-Up's Claim of a Miracle. So the Start-Up (the two US companies) would be the business. The article says "two U.S. companies teamed up to treat cancer... then patients started dying." So those companies faced quality/safety issues. So answer: "Start-Up" or "U.S. companies"?

10. **Job title of reporter from Seoul**: The article ends with "John Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news." His job title is "reporter".

11. **Chemical byproduct elevated**: The article says chlorate was found in high levels. The question is straightforward: chlorate.

12. **Facility where chlorate was detected**: The article states the high levels were detected at the Ghent facility.

13. **Production codes range**: The company said codes from "328 GE" to "338 GE".

14. **Corporation responsible for distribution**: The bottler is Coca-Cola Europacific Partners, which is part of Coca-Cola's system. The article mentions "Coca-Cola's bottler in Europe", so the corporation is The Coca-Cola Company, but the bottler's name is given as Coca-Cola Europacific Partners. The question asks which corporation is responsible for distribution oversight, so likely Coca-Cola Europacific Partners.

15. **Country advising to avoid products**: The Dutch authority issued a warning. The article says "The Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority issued a warning... urging consumers not to drink the products."

16. **Country's agency mentioning risk to children**: The Luxembourg Veterinary and Food Administration stated "a risk, especially for children, cannot be ruled out".

17. **Hourly can production**: The article says 120,000 cans per hour.

18. **Country on British Isles with limited shipment**: Britain (the UK) is on the British Isles. The article mentions Britain's regulators were contacted regarding limited shipments.

19. **Well-known brand not recalled**: The recalled brands include Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, etc. The article's list ends with "...Tropico in cans and glass bottles". A major brand like Diet Coke or Powerade might not be listed. The article's list doesn't mention those. Alternatively, maybe another major brand like Dasani? The article doesn't say, but the question asks which is notably absent. Since the list includes Coca-Cola, maybe a brand like Monster Energy? Not sure. The article's list includes "Minute Maid" which is juice, but maybe a soda like Tab? Not listed. Alternatively, perhaps "Nalu" is a lesser-known brand. Wait, the article's list includes "Royal Bliss" which might not be as well-known. The question says "well-known brand notably absent". Since the article lists Coca-Cola, perhaps "Pepsi" is absent but that's not part of Coca-Cola's products. Alternatively, maybe "Coca-Cola Zero" isn't listed, but the article says "Coca-Cola" generally. The answer might be N/A, but the question expects an answer. Wait, the article lists "Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Fuze Tea, Minute Maid, Nalu, Royal Bliss and Tropico". A major brand like Powerade isn't listed. So maybe "Powerade" is the answer. But the article doesn't mention it, so maybe N/A. Alternatively, "Mountain Dew"? Not listed. Hmm, maybe the question is a trick. Since the article says "the recalled products included..." followed by those brands, perhaps "Dasani" (a Coca-Cola bottled water) is not listed. But the article specifies soft drinks. Alternatively, maybe "Coca-Cola Cherry" isn't listed but that's a variant. The question might be looking for "Pepsi", but that's a competitor. Since the article doesn't mention it, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "among the beverage brands discussed in the recall notice"—so the list in the article includes those brands. The well-known brand not in the list could be "Minute Maid" is a juice, but maybe "Fanta" is there. Wait, the article says "Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta"—so those are all there. Maybe "Coca-Cola Zero" or "Diet Coke" isn't listed, but the article just says "Coca-Cola". Since the question is about a brand notably absent, but the article doesn't mention others, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe "Tropico" is a less-known brand, so the question might expect "N/A". Wait, the article says "the recalled products included... Tropico in cans and glass bottles". Maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, tricky. Alternatively, perhaps "Nalu" is a lesser-known brand, but the question asks for a well-known one. Let me check the list again. The article lists "Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Fuze Tea, Minute Maid, Nalu, Royal Bliss and Tropico". The most well-known besides the main ones are Minute Maid (orange juice) and maybe Tropico is a brand in those countries. So maybe "Dasani" (another Coca-Cola product) isn't there. Since the article doesn't mention it, perhaps the answer is N/A. But maybe the question expects "N/A" here.
