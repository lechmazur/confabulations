Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I'm only using the article provided and not any external knowledge. Let me start with question 1. The question is asking about the percentage of the WHO's budget allocated to staff salaries before the cuts, compared to Rhode Island's health spending. The article mentions that the WHO's budget for 2024-25 is about $6.8 billion, and Rhode Island's health department spent over $6 billion in 2024 alone. But the question is about the percentage of the WHO's budget that went to staff salaries before the cuts. The article mentions a hiring freeze and limited contract renegotiations, but I don't see any specific numbers about the percentage allocated to salaries. So maybe this is N/A? Wait, the question says "equivalent to Rhode Island's health department spending". The WHO's total budget is similar to Rhode Island's annual spending. But the actual percentage for salaries isn't given. So answer N/A.

Question 2: The specific reform proposed by the first Trump admin and later by Loyce Pace, adopted by the World Health Assembly. The article says the first Trump admin proposed amendments to the International Health Regulations because of transparency issues during Covid. Loyce Pace oversaw negotiations for the pandemic treaty. The adopted amendments were the ones the first Trump proposed. So the answer is the amendments to the International Health Regulations requiring countries to report outbreaks more transparently.

Question 3: If the ICD is replaced, what system would US use for generic drug names? The article states that WHO assigns generic names. The question is hypothetical, but the article doesn't mention an alternative. So maybe N/A? Or perhaps the FDA's system? The article doesn't say, so N/A.

Question 4: Financial mechanism managed by Anil Soni affected by drug resistance costs. Anil Soni is with the WHO Foundation, which handles partnerships and funding. If treatment costs rise due to resistance, the mechanism might be the funding for drug programs. The article says US businesses rely on WHO standards. The specific mechanism could be the "pandemic treaty funds" but not sure. Wait, the question is about the financial mechanism managed by Anil Soni. The article says "voluntary contributions" but the answer might be the WHO Foundation's funding. The article doesn't specify, so maybe N/A. Wait, the article states "U.S. won't be at the table to set the evidence and quality standards... directly lead to U.S. business." The mechanism might be the voluntary contributions? The article mentions that US voluntary contributions were $442 million vs China's $2.5 million. So maybe the voluntary contributions? But the question is about the mechanism managed by Soni. Since Soni is with the WHO Foundation, perhaps the answer is the WHO Foundation's funding. But the article says "voluntary contributions" are part of the budget. The question says "financial mechanism managed by Anil Soni". Since the WHO Foundation facilitates partnerships and funding, maybe the answer is the WHO Foundation's funding mechanisms. But the article doesn't explicitly state this. Hmm, maybe N/A.

Question 5: The business type mentioned by Anil Soni facing hurdles. The article says "pharmaceutical and health technology companies" would face issues because they rely on WHO guidelines. So the answer is pharmaceutical and health technology companies.

Question 6: Action by a small Pacific island to disrupt amendments. Frieden mentioned that any country can block via consensus. Italy's deputy proposed leaving. So similar action would be a small island using consensus to block, like "throwing a monkey wrench" by blocking consensus. The question asks what action similar to Italy's proposal (which was to leave) but for disrupting amendments. Maybe blocking consensus? But the question wants the specific action like Italy's proposal. Since Italy proposed leaving, the equivalent would be a small island proposing to leave or blocking the amendments. The answer is "throw a monkey wrench in and stop proceedings" but the question wants the specific action. The example given in Frieden's quote is that any country can block. So the action would be "blocking consensus" or "objecting to proceedings". The article says "any country can throw a monkey wrench in and stop proceedings", so the answer is "throw a monkey wrench in and stop proceedings".

Question 7: Data type for flu vaccine selection. The article says the WHO's flu surveillance network helps select the seasonal flu vaccine each year. So the answer is flu surveillance data.

Question 8: Actual percentage difference between US and China's assessed fees. The article says Trump claimed China pays 90% less, but actual difference was 31% (US $264M vs China $181M). The question asks for the actual percentage difference. The difference is 264 -181 = 83M. The percentage difference relative to US would be (83/264)*100 ≈31%. The question says "actual difference between the obligatory fees... a formula approved by member states" so the answer is 31%.

Question 9: Global health program by Doherty impacted by halted HIV drugs. Doherty directs programs on HIV and STIs. The program monitoring drug resistance would be the HIV drug resistance monitoring program.

Question 10: Legislative action to rejoin WHO. The article says membership was enshrined by a congressional joint resolution, so to rejoin would require the same: a congressional joint resolution.

Question 11: Disease's resistance linked to halted HIV meds. The article says halting HIV drugs could drive resistance to available medications, and the WHO monitors drug resistance for HIV, malaria, etc. The question is which disease's resistance is linked. The answer is HIV.

Question 12: China's contribution percentage. The article states China's total contribution (assessed + voluntary) is 74% less than US. The question asks what percentage China contributed. The US is 15% of WHO's budget. The actual assessed fees for China were $181M vs US's $264M. The total for China including voluntary is $181M + $2.5M = $183.5M. The total WHO budget is $6.8B (assessed) plus voluntary? Wait, the article says the 2024-25 budget is $6.8B, which is the assessed contributions. The voluntary contributions are separate. So China's total is assessed ($181M) plus voluntary ($2.5M) = $183.5M. The total WHO's budget including voluntary would be $6.8B + all voluntary contributions. But the question says "through both assessed and voluntary payments combined". The article says "China's total contribution is about 74% less than the US", which would mean China contributes 26% of what the US does? Wait, the article says "China's total contribution is about 74% less than the United States', not 90%." So if US is $264M + $442M = $706M, China is $181M + $2.5M = $183.5M. The difference is 706-183.5 = 522.5. 522.5/706 ≈74%, so China's total is 26% of the US's total. But the question is what percentage of the WHO's total budget did China contribute? The WHO's total budget is $6.8B (assessed) plus all voluntary contributions. The article doesn't give the total voluntary contributions. Since the question is about China's contribution (assessed + voluntary), but the total WHO budget isn't given including voluntary. The article says the 2024-25 budget is $6.8B (assessed). So China's assessed is ~2.6% (181/6800 ≈2.67%). Adding voluntary would be a bit more but not much. The question asks for the percentage China contributed through both, but the article doesn't give the total including voluntary. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says "China's total contribution is about 74% less than the United States'". Since the US is 15% of the assessed budget (the article says "the United States is the W.H.O.'s largest donor, accounting for nearly 15 percent of its planned budget." which is the assessed budget). So if US is 15%, then China's assessed is 15% * (1 - 0.31) ? Wait no. The assessed fees are based on a formula. The actual numbers: US assessed is $264M, China is $181M. Total assessed is $6.8B. So China's assessed is (181/6800)*100 ≈2.66%. Adding their voluntary $2.5M (0.037% of 6.8B), total is ~2.7%. But the question is what percentage of the total budget (including voluntary?) China contributed. Since the article doesn't provide the total including voluntary, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, the question might be asking the percentage difference between US and China's assessed fees, which is 31% less. But the question says "what percentage... represents the actual difference between the obligatory fees of the United States and China for the 2024-25 budget". The difference is 264-181=83M. The question asks for the percentage difference. The US's assessed is 15% of the total $6.8B. The difference between US and China's assessed fees is 31% (as calculated before). The answer is 31%.

Wait, the question is phrased as "what specific percentage, falsely claimed by Trump regarding China's contribution, represents the actual difference between the obligatory fees of the United States and China for the 2024-25 budget". The actual difference is 31%, as stated in the article. So the answer is 31%.

Question 13: Country's deputy PM proposed leaving after US withdrawal. The article says "Italy's deputy prime minister has proposed a law to leave the W.H.O." So answer Italy.

Question 14: Pandemic treaty negotiated by Biden admin that was finalized before withdrawal. The article says "a pandemic treaty that would allow countries to work together during an international crisis. The treaty had been stalled and may now collapse." So it was not finalized yet, but the question says "implies was finalized and implemented prior". Wait, the article says "the treaty had been stalled and may now collapse." So it wasn't finalized. So maybe N/A. Alternatively, the amendments to the International Health Regulations were adopted last year, which were proposed by first Trump. The question is about a treaty negotiated during Biden's time. The article says the treaty was stalled. So answer N/A.

Question 15: Diagnostic coding system linked to insurance for mental health. The article says WHO's International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is used for diagnostic codes by insurance. So the answer is International Classification of Diseases.

Question 16: Which former US official criticized WHO for favoring China over small islands? The article mentions Frieden said "the real problem is that tiny Pacific islands... have too much power." So Frieden criticized the idea that China has too much influence, instead pointing out that small islands can block. So the answer is Dr. Thomas Frieden.

Question 17: Numerical comparison for WHO's budget vs Rhode Island. The article says "WHO's total budget... $6.8 billion for 2024-25. For comparison, the health department of the tiny state of Rhode Island spent just over $6 billion in 2024 alone." So the comparison is $6.8B (WHO's biennial) vs $6B (Rhode Island's annual). The answer is "the W.H.O.'s budget of about $6.8 billion for two years compared to Rhode Island's $6 billion for one year."

Wait the question asks "what percentage of the WHO's budget, equivalent to Rhode Island's...", but the actual comparison is the total figures. The question is asking for the numerical comparison used, which is the $6.8B vs $6B. The answer is "6.8 billion dollars for two years vs 6 billion dollars for one year".

Question 18: Countries whose leaders endorsed Trump's decision as a model. The article mentions "Hungary and Argentina, whose leaders are ideologically similar, to follow suit." So the answer is Hungary and Argentina.

Question 19: Year first Trump proposed amendments. The article says "the first Trump administration that proposed the amendments because of frustration with the lack of transparency from certain countries during Covid-19". Since the pandemic was in 2020, the first Trump admin (2017-2021) would have proposed it before 2020. The article says the amendments were adopted last year (relative to when the article was written; assuming the article is from 2023, last year would be 2022). But the question is the year proposed. The answer is 2020? Or maybe 2017? The article says "the first Trump administration that proposed the amendments because of frustration during Covid-19". Since the pandemic started in 2020, the proposal would be during Trump's first term, so likely 2020. But the exact year isn't given. The article says "the first Trump administration" (which is 2017-2021) proposed it. The article also says "the amendments were adopted by the World Health Assembly last year". If the article is from 2023, then last year is 2022. The amendments were proposed during the first Trump admin, so maybe 2020. But the exact year isn't specified, so N/A? Or the question says "the first Trump administration", so the answer is during his first term, but the question asks for the year. Since the article doesn't specify the exact year, answer N/A.

Question 20: Surveillance network for flu vaccine. The article says the WHO's flu surveillance network helps select the seasonal flu vaccine. So the answer is the WHO's flu surveillance network.
