Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one based solely on the provided article. Let me read through each question carefully and find the answers from the text.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks about the legal precedent Justice Anar Rathod Patel cited when dismissing Baltimore's appeal. The article mentions that the New York case dismissal relied on a 2021 Second Circuit ruling. However, the question specifically refers to Baltimore's appeal. Wait, the article says Phil Goldberg pointed to a dismissed Baltimore suit as a weak case, and the judge in New York cited the Second Circuit's 2021 decision. The exact wording says the Second Circuit upheld a dismissal in 2021, which the oil companies cite. The New York dismissal mentioned that the allegations were "effectively repurposing" those dismissed in a previous suit, which was upheld by the Second Circuit. So the precedent would be the Second Circuit's 2021 decision. But the question is about Baltimore's appeal. Wait, the article states that Baltimore is appealing their case. The judge in New York dismissed a suit citing the Second Circuit's prior decision. However, the question is about the precedent cited by the New York judge when dismissing the NYC case, which the answer would be the Second Circuit's 2021 ruling. Wait the question says "Justice Anar Rathod Patel cited when dismissing Baltimore's appeal?" Wait no, the question is about the dismissal of the NYC suit, but the example mentions Baltimore's case being dismissed and then appealed. Wait, the exact text: "Justice Anar Rathod Patel dismissed a suit brought by the city, writing that it was 'effectively repurposing' allegations that had been dismissed in a previous suit. That previous dismissal was upheld in 2021 by a federal appellate court, the Second Circuit, in a ruling that is often cited by the oil companies and their allies." So the precedent Patel cited is the Second Circuit's 2021 ruling. So the answer is the Second Circuit's 2021 decision, but the question says "cited when dismissing Baltimore's appeal?" Wait, no. The judge in New York dismissed NYC's case, and the precedent was the Second Circuit's 2021 ruling which upheld a prior dismissal. The prior dismissal was in another case, maybe Baltimore's? The article says "the city of Baltimore is appealing." So the precedent for the NYC case dismissal is the Second Circuit's 2021 decision. So the answer is the Second Circuit's 2021 ruling. So the answer is the Second Circuit's 2021 decision. But the question says "cited when dismissing Baltimore's appeal?" Wait, the judge in NYC dismissed NYC's case, not Baltimore's. The question might be a bit confusing. Wait the question says "Justice Anar Rathod Patel cited when dismissing Baltimore's appeal?" But the article says the NYC case was dismissed by Patel, citing the Second Circuit's decision which upheld the prior dismissal (maybe of Baltimore's case). The exact wording: "the previous dismissal was upheld in 2021 by a federal appellate court, the Second Circuit, in a ruling that is often cited by the oil companies and their allies. The lawsuit against Vermont's climate superfund law, for example, relies heavily on the Second Circuit decision..." So the precedent is the Second Circuit's 2021 decision. The answer should be the Second Circuit's 2021 ruling, so the answer is "Second Circuit".

2. **Question 2:** Phil Goldberg argues the Clean Air Act says which federal agency should regulate emissions. The article states: "the main federal law on emissions, the Clean Air Act, stipulated that emissions should be regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, not courts." So the answer is the EPA.

3. **Question 3:** The amount in NY's law for 25 years. The article says New York requires companies to pay about $3 billion a year for 25 years. Vermont's approach is different, but the question says "reflecting the approach taken by Vermont?" Wait, the question says "reflecting the approach taken by Vermont?" Wait no: the question says "what specific amount, as cited in the New York law, are companies collectively required to pay annually for the next five decades, reflecting the approach taken by Vermont?" Wait, the approach taken by Vermont is different from NY. Wait, the question might have a mistake, but the article says NY's law is $3 billion annually. So answer is $3 billion.

4. **Question 4:** The federal Superfund originally targeted what kind of waste dump. The article says the Superfund program targets "specific sites -- say, an old factory or a waste dump -- could be identified..." So the answer is "waste dump".

5. **Question 5:** The state whose bill was reintroduced after failing last year, mentioned by Parenteau. The article says in California, a bill was introduced last year and didn't advance, but Siegel expects reintroduction. Parenteau mentions California's wildfires could lead to juries sympathetic in LA. The question says "mentioned by Patrick Parenteau" so the answer is California.

6. **Question 6:** The cooperative emergency-response system during Kamala Harris' visit. The article mentions "a whole cooperative emergency-response system whirred to life" in the context of LA wildfires, but the question says "during Kamala Harris' visit". The article says Harris visited Pacific Palisades, and the system is mentioned in the "Where Something Went Right" section. The exact name? The article doesn't give a name, just refers to it as "cooperative emergency-response system". Since the question asks for the name, and the text doesn't provide it, the answer is N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The court Baltimore appealed to. The article says "the city of Baltimore is appealing" but doesn't specify which court. The prior case was dismissed in a lower court, so they appealed to the appellate court. But the question is about the court they appealed to. The article only says "appealing" without specifying the court. Since the prior case was dismissed in a federal court (since the Second Circuit is a federal appellate court), maybe the appeal is to the same or another? But the text doesn't say. So answer N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Which state's judge dismissed a lawsuit amidst comparisons to West Coast wildfires? The article mentions a judge in New York State Supreme Court dismissed NYC's case. The comparison is to LA wildfires? The article says "the climate superfund laws are running on a parallel track to a raft of lawsuits... that have survived motions to dismiss. But on Tuesday in New York State Supreme Court, Justice Anar Rathod Patel dismissed a suit brought by the city..." and the LA wildfires are mentioned in the context of potential jury sympathy. The question refers to a judge in a state that committed to billions in penalties (NY has the $3B annual figure) dismissing a lawsuit. So the state is New York.

9. **Question 9:** The academic director who submitted proposals. The article says Justin S. Mankin, a geographer at Dartmouth College and director of its Climate Modeling and Impacts Group, submitted proposals for Vermont.

10. **Question 10:** The state with $3B annually over 25 years. That's New York.

11. **Question 11:** Vermont's timeline starts in 1995 (since their law assesses emissions from 1995-2024).

12. **Question 12:** The organization arguing penalties affect companies outside the state. The lawsuit by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and American Petroleum Institute said Vermont's law penalizes companies not based there, affecting others. The answer is the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute, but the question asks for the organization that argued this. The question says "which organization argued that these penalties would affect companies outside the state?" The lawsuit was filed by those two, so perhaps the answer is "U.S. Chamber of Commerce and American Petroleum Institute" but the question might want one of them. Wait the text says "the lawsuit called on the court to block Vermont's law, arguing..." so the organizations are the ones who filed the lawsuit. The answer is "U.S. Chamber of Commerce and American Petroleum Institute". But the question says "which organization", so maybe it's one of them, but the article lists both. The question might expect both as the answer. But the exact wording: "the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute. The suit called on the court to block Vermont's law, arguing..." So the answer is those two together. Since the question asks for "which organization", perhaps the answer is both, but maybe the question expects one. Alternatively, the article says "the lawsuit called on the court...", so the lawsuit was by those two. The question asks "which organization argued that these penalties would affect companies outside the state?" Since both are plaintiffs, the answer includes both. The question may accept both, but the format requires a single answer. Maybe the answer is the two together. Since the question says "organization", maybe it's expecting one, but the article mentions both. Hmm. The answer should be both, but perhaps the question allows it as a combined answer. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute. The question says "organization", so maybe it's the two together, but the question might have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, but the text says both. Since the article lists both, the answer must include both. So the answer is "U.S. Chamber of Commerce and American Petroleum Institute".

13. **Question 13:** The federal program inspiring the laws is the Superfund program.

14. **Question 14:** The director who warned taxpayers bear the burden is Kassie Siegel from the Center for Biological Diversity.

15. **Question 15:** The state with a stalled bill is California.

16. **Question 16:** The federal appellate court referenced is the Second Circuit.

17. **Question 17:** The city's jury anticipated to be sympathetic is Los Angeles, as Parenteau mentions "Los Angeles hearing a case like this".
