merged_cymbeline-beckett-briefs-f-murray-abraham-review.txt
Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the provided article. Let me start with the first question.

1. **Question 1:** Which character serves as Imogen's primary confidante and advisor? The article mentions Pisanio as her servant who secretly defies Posthumus. It says Pisanio is honorable and helps Imogen, so maybe Pisanio is the answer. Let me check again. Yes, "the honorable Pisanio secretly defies him." So the answer is Pisanio.

2. **Question 2:** How many minutes longer is "Cymbeline" compared to the original Globe version? The article states the running time is 2 hours 40 minutes, but there's no mention of the original Globe's duration. So this is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Symbolic significance of banana-peel slapstick in Thome's translation. The article mentions Krapp's slapstick in Beckett, not Cymbeline's translation. The critic says Beckett's directions include banana-peel slapstick, but Thome's translation's symbolism isn't linked here. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Transportation delay causing sequence change. The article says a cast member had transit woes, so transit (like subway) delay. Answer: transit.

5. **Question 5:** Spotlight color in urns scene. The urns scene is in "Play." The lighting is described as "precisely as Beckett demands" with a single mobile spot. The article doesn't mention color, so N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Years between Krapp's recording and listening. The article says "decades before," but exact number isn't given. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Device Brown-Fried uses for male menace with all-female cast. The article mentions the all-female cast satirizes macho pride and highlights male menace through their performances. Maybe cross-gender casting? The question asks for a traditional device. Since it's an all-female cast, perhaps "cross-gender casting" is the answer. The article says "all-female cast" and "satirizing macho pride," so the device is cross-gender casting.

8. **Question 8:** Monologue linking childhood trauma to relationships in "Not I." The monologue in "Not I" is by a woman who was "practically speechless" all her sad, unloved life. The answer is the monologue in "Not I" by the woman, but the question asks which character's monologue. The character isn't named, just the play. Since the question specifies a character's monologue, but the article doesn't name the character, maybe "the woman" or N/A. Wait, "Not I" has only a mouth, so the character is unnamed. The question asks for the character's name, so N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Historical monarch Amy Hill references via costume. The article doesn't mention any specific historical reference for Cymbeline's portrayal. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Banana peels Abraham interacts with. The article says Krapp's slapstick is like banana-peel, but it's a metaphor. There's no mention of actual banana peels in the play. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Gender's influence on Roman war subplot. The article says the Roman war part isn't cared about. The focus is on the all-female cast satirizing macho pride, so the Roman war is downplayed. The answer might be that the subplot is minimized or irrelevant, but the question asks how the gender influences it. The article says "I defy you to care about that, even here." So the gender focus makes the war subplot less significant. The answer is "minimized" or "irrelevant," but need exact wording. The question asks how the gender affects it, so "minimized" is the answer.

12. **Question 12:** Historical event linked to forgiveness theme. The article says the ending's forgiveness "lands right now: with a heavier meaning, for good or ill, because of our political moment." But no specific event is named. N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Technical element reused between "Krapp" and "Not I." The spotlight is mentioned in "Play," but maybe the monochrome elements? The article says in "Krapp's Last Tape," Abraham wears a monochrome outfit in a monochrome space. "Not I" might use similar lighting or design? The question is about a technical element reused. The article doesn't mention a reused element, so N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Connection between Cloten's lord and banana-peel slapstick. The article says the lord is "puckish" and part of Cloten's retinue. The slapstick is in Krapp's, but the question links the two. The article doesn't connect them, so N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Prop symbolizing Posthumus's betrayal. The article mentions the servant Pisanio's defiance, and Imogen's survival. The prop might be the letter or command to kill her. Alternatively, the reel-to-reel is compared to the tape player. The article says Posthumus commands Pisanio to murder Imogen, so maybe the letter or command is the prop. The answer could be "servant's command" but not exact. Alternatively, the article states "reel-to-reel tape player’s role in Krapp’s reflections on lost love" parallels Posthumus's betrayal. The prop in Cymbeline would be the "command to murder" represented by a letter or object. The article doesn't specify a prop, so N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Political figure critiqued through forgiveness theme. The article mentions "political moment" but doesn't name a figure or movement. N/A.

17. **Question 17:** Lighting deviation in "Play." The article says the lighting follows Beckett's directions precisely, so no deviation. Answer: none.

18. **Question 18:** Anachronistic tech in Cymbeline's war plot. The article mentions the war with Romans but no modern tech. N/A.
