Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided.

1. **Question 1**: How many photographs did Edward Steichen request from the Navy for the MoMA's collection? The article says Edward Steichen asked the Navy for a print. "A print" implies one. So answer is 1.

2. **Question 2**: The artistic movement associated with Tice's photos of places like White Castle. The text mentions his work was compared to Walker Evans's documentary photos and Edward Hopper's urban realism. The movement here is probably "documentary" or "urban realism," but the question asks for the movement. Wait, the exact phrase in the text is "his work, most of it in black and white, would be compared to Walker Evans's documentary photos and the urban realism of Edward Hopper's paintings". So the movement linked to Hopper's urban realism. But the question is about the movement critics associated his photos with. Since Hopper is mentioned as urban realism, maybe the answer is "urban realism". Alternatively, documentary? The question mentions "everyday subjects and detachment". Urban realism fits better. Let me check the text again. The text says "urban realism of Edward Hopper's paintings". So the answer is urban realism.

3. **Question 3**: The gallery co-founded by Tice where his photos were sold. The article states: "he helped establish. The Witkin Gallery in Manhattan, which he helped establish." So the name is Witkin Gallery.

4. **Question 4**: The object looming over the Mobil station in Cherry Hill compared to a spacecraft. The text says "a massive water tower looming in the background like an alien spaceship." So the object is a water tower.

5. **Question 5**: Year of the Woodman Gallery exhibition in Middletown. The article says: "an exhibition of Mr. Tice's work at the Woodman Gallery in Morristown, N.J., in 1981." Wait, the question says Middletown, but the text says Morristown. However, the user's instruction says to answer based solely on the article. The article mentions the Woodman Gallery was in Morristown, not Middletown. The question's premise is incorrect (since it says Middletown), so answer N/A? Wait, the question says "in Middletown" but the article says "Morristown". Since the question's premise is wrong, answer N/A. Wait, but the user says if the question contains an incorrect premise, answer N/A. The question states the gallery was in Middletown, but the text says Morristown. Therefore, since the question's premise is wrong, the answer is N/A. But wait, the article's correction note at the end says "An earlier version... the Woodman Gallery... was in Morristown, not Middletown." So the correct location is Morristown, but the question mentions Middletown. Since the question's location is wrong, the answer is N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Title of Tice's 1984 book inspired by a Newark neon-lit motel and disco named after a president. The text says: "Lincoln (1984), a homage... photographed statues of the 16th president and motels, cars... Lincoln Motel and Abe's Disco." So the title is "Lincoln".

7. **Question 7**: Profession of Tice's stepfather whose albums sparked his interest. The text says his stepfather was John Hahn, but the key line: "his father, William Tice... His albums ignited George's passion... His mother's remarried to John Hahn. Wait, the stepfather's albums? Wait the text says: "His father, William Tice, was an insurance underwriter. He was also an amateur photographer, and his albums ignited George's passion..." Wait, so the father (William Tice) was the one whose albums inspired him, not the stepfather. Wait, the text says: "His mother peddled... She later remarried. From age 6 to 16, George sold... His father, William Tice, was an insurance underwriter. His albums ignited..." Wait, the stepfather is John Hahn, but the father's albums were the inspiration. The question asks about the stepfather's profession. The article states that the stepfather's role: "to the chagrin of his stepfather, John Hahn, [when he turned the trailer into a darkroom]." But the albums belonged to his father, not the stepfather. The question is about the stepfather's profession. The article says "his stepfather, John Hahn" but doesn't mention his job. Wait, the text says "his mother's remarried to John Hahn" but doesn't state his job. Wait, the father was William Tice, an insurance underwriter. The stepfather is John Hahn, whose job isn't mentioned. Wait, the question is asking for the stepfather's profession. The text says: "his stepfather, John Hahn" but only mentions that he was upset about the darkroom. So the answer would be N/A. Wait, but the albums that sparked his interest were his father's, not stepfather's. The question says "whose albums initially sparked...", so the stepfather's albums? But the text says the father's albums. Therefore, the stepfather's profession isn't mentioned here. So the answer would be N/A. Wait, but the question might have a mistake. The text says "His father, William Tice, was an insurance underwriter, and his albums ignited George's passion for storytelling through photography." So the father's profession is insurance underwriter. The stepfather's profession isn't mentioned. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

Wait, the question says "stepfather's albums". Since the father's albums were the ones, the stepfather's isn't mentioned. So the stepfather's profession isn't stated, so the answer is N/A. But the question is about the stepfather's profession. Since it's not stated, answer N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Name of the aircraft carrier where Tice served. The article says he was on the USS Wasp when the explosion happened. The documentary is mentioned at the end: "he described his emphasis on the mundane... An earlier version... the Woodman Gallery... the carrier Wasp." So the name is Wasp.

9. **Question 9**: Type of camera Tice used for Passaic Falls. The article says he used a "bulky 8x10 view camera" traveling the state. So the answer is 8x10 view camera.

10. **Question 10**: Book about European region with a weather-related title. The text mentions "Stone Walls, Grey Skies: A Vision of Yorkshire" (1993), documenting a sojourn in England. The title includes "Grey Skies", which is weather-related. So the answer is "Stone Walls, Grey Skies: A Vision of Yorkshire".

11. **Question 11**: Two artists contrasted with Tice's style in the Rahway White Castle photo. The text says "his work... compared to Walker Evans's documentary photos and the urban realism of Edward Hopper's paintings." So the artists are Walker Evans and Edward Hopper.

12. **Question 12**: New Jersey city where Tice lived and the 1981 exhibition was. The article says he lived in Middletown and the Woodman Gallery was in Morristown. The question says the exhibition was in Middletown, but the text says Morristown. Since the question's premise is wrong (if the exhibition was in Middletown), but according to the text, the gallery was in Morristown. However, the question asks for the city where he lived (Middletown) and the exhibition's location. The question says "setting for both Tice's final residence and the 1981 Woodman Gallery exhibition". Since the exhibition was in Morristown, not Middletown, the answer is N/A because the two locations are different. Wait, but the question is asking for the city that served as both his residence and the exhibition's location. Since they are different cities, the answer is N/A. But the article says he lived in Middletown, and the exhibition was in Morristown, so no such city exists. Therefore, N/A.

13. **Question 13**: Unpublished manuscript he was revising. The text says he was working on revising his book "Lifework" (2022), a career retrospective. But the question asks about an unpublished manuscript. Wait, "Lifework" was published in 2022, but he wanted to revise it. The text says "he was still hoping to revise his book 'Lifework' (2022), a career retrospective." So the manuscript was "Lifework". But the question says "unpublished manuscript". Since the book was already published (as of 2022), but he wanted to revise it, maybe the answer is "Lifework". The question says "unpublished manuscript that he was revising shortly before his death". Since the book was published, but he wanted to revise it, perhaps the answer is "Lifework" even if it's published. The question might consider the revised version as an unpublished manuscript. The text says he wanted to "perfect it" and "critiquing it". So the answer is "Lifework".
