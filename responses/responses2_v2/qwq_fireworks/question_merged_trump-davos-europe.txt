Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly what's asked. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks how many Russian soldiers Zaki Laidi indicated were receiving combat pay bonuses exceeding 500,000 rubles per month. Scanning through the article, I remember there was a part where Zaki Laidi mentioned Russian forces' composition. The article states that 70% of Putin's forces are contract soldiers and only 7% are draftees. However, there's no mention of specific bonuses or amounts like 500,000 rubles. So the answer here should be N/A.

2. The second question is about the percentage reduction in Ukraine's armed forces that Putin demanded as a precondition for peace talks during his year-end address. The article mentions Putin's demands from the 2022 talks, which included Ukraine becoming neutral, limiting its armed forces, and legal changes. However, there's no specific percentage given for reduction. So again, N/A.

3. The third question asks for the timeline John Bolton provided regarding Trump's renegotiation of European trade agreements. The article quotes Bolton as saying working in Trump's White House was like a pinball machine, but there's no specific timeline mentioned for the renegotiation. So N/A here too.

4. The fourth question is about how many additional Ukrainian air defense systems Zelensky requested during his Davos presentation. The article mentions Zelensky visiting Davos and shifting his demands, but there's no specific number given for air defense systems. So N/A.

5. The fifth question asks which security guarantees Charles Kupchan proposed as an alternative to NATO membership. The article quotes Kupchan criticizing the current U.S. policy but doesn't mention specific alternatives. He talks about NATO membership being necessary for Zelensky but doesn't propose alternatives. So N/A.

6. The sixth question is about the force size Macron calculated for monitoring ceasefire lines. The article mentions Macron's skepticism about European troops but doesn't give a specific number. So N/A.

7. The seventh question asks for the additional funding Vedrine estimated Europe would need under Trump's plan. The article discusses Vedrine's asteroid metaphor and European defense spending but doesn't mention a specific figure. N/A.

8. The eighth question is who described the White House as a pinball machine. The article says John Bolton told USA Today that working there was "like living in a pinball machine." So the answer is John Bolton.

9. The ninth question asks which leader's opposition, linked to the Maidan uprising, undermines Ukraine's EU membership. The article states that Putin opposed the 2013 association agreement with the EU, which led to the Maidan uprising. So Putin's opposition is the answer.

10. The tenth question is about the CDU legislator emphasizing making Russia's war a failure. The article mentions Norbert Rottgen from CDU saying Europe must make the war a failure for Russia. So Rottgen is the answer.

11. The eleventh question is the new NATO secretary-general advocating 3-3.5% GDP spending. The article mentions Mark Rutte as the new NATO secretary-general pushing for that spending target. Wait, but Mark Rutte is actually the Prime Minister of the Netherlands. Wait, let me check again. The article says "Mark Rutte, the new secretary general of NATO"â€”so according to the text, it's Rutte. I'll go with that.

12. The twelfth question is the French analyst commenting on Russian forces. The article says Zaki Laidi is the French analyst who noted 70% contract soldiers. So Zaki Laidi is the answer.

13. The thirteenth question is the U.S. agency Trump wanted to close. The article mentions Trump called for closing USAID, the main provider of global aid. So USAID is correct.

14. The fourteenth question is which nation with a border with Russia was skeptical of European troops. The article says Poland expressed skepticism, along with others. So Poland.

15. The fifteenth question is the Ukrainian leader visiting Davos who shifted demands. Zelensky is mentioned as visiting Davos and shifting from 1991 borders to seeking security guarantees. So Zelensky.

16. The sixteenth question is the former Obama official criticizing the U.S. policy. The article cites Charles Kupchan, a former Obama official, saying the U.S. has a policy without a strategy. So Kupchan.
