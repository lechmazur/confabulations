Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by skimming through each question and then checking the article for the answers.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks about an Electronic Arts executive who initially opposed The Sims but later helped secure resources. The article mentions Luc Barthelet as an EA executive who brought in resources. The text says, "Luc Barthelet, who was then an Electronic Arts executive and brought in key resources for The Sims's development team." The initial opposition isn't explicitly stated, but the context is that some managers wanted to prevent release, but Luc supported it. So the answer is Luc Barthelet.

2. **Question 2:** Claire Curtin's recorded Simlish lines. The article says Claire Curtin helped invent Simlish and mentions she worked on the social system, but there's no number given. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Wright's insect game that inspired pheromones. The article states he had an insect simulator called SimAnt, released the same year as the firestorm. So SimAnt is the answer.

4. **Question 4:** Month of the Oakland-Berkeley firestorm in 1991. The article mentions the firestorm in 1991 but doesn't specify the month. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Percentage of players creating sites vs playing. The text says, "the people who were really invested... weren't even playing The Sims. They were maintaining websites..." but no percentage is given. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Number of bank robberies before the mafia godfather. The article mentions the Las Vegas homemaker as the godfather but doesn't mention how many robberies happened before. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Minimum credit score for debit cards. The realist mods included financial systems with debit cards and loans, but no specific credit score is mentioned. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Psychological theory for hierarchy of needs. The article says Wright applied psychology and mentions the hierarchy of needs (hunger, comfort, hygiene). The theory is Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, which is commonly associated with such a structure. The article doesn't name it explicitly, though. Wait, the text says, "applied psychology" and "hierarchy of needs". Since the question asks for the theory Wright cited, and the article doesn't name it, maybe it's N/A. Wait, the article says "hierarchy of needs" which is Maslow's. But does it say he cited it? The exact quote is: "I decided that game design is applied psychology." So maybe the answer is Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. But the article doesn't explicitly state that. Hmm. The question says "which psychological theory did Will Wright cite..." Since the article doesn't mention the name of the theory, just that he used a hierarchy of needs, perhaps the answer is N/A. Or maybe the article implies it's Maslow's. Wait, the text says "hierarchy of needs" which is directly from Maslow, so maybe the answer is "Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs." But the article might not explicitly state that. Let me check again. The article says: "Claire Curtin... developers refined its social system by imbuing the Sims with needs like hunger, comfort and hygiene." Then Wright says, "A long time ago, I decided that game design is applied psychology." The question asks which theory he cited. Since the article doesn't name the theory, even if it's implied, the answer should be N/A. Because the question requires that the answer is directly from the text. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Number of guinea pig bites needed for disease. The article says guinea pigs might bite and leave a deadly disease, but no number is given. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Subscription fee for custom content. The article mentions subscription platforms but no specific amount. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** How the fire influenced guinea pigs' disease mechanic. The article links the fire to ants surviving, which inspired distributed intelligence, but guinea pigs' disease is mentioned as an intentional chaotic element. The article doesn't directly connect the fire to guinea pigs' disease. The guinea pigs were part of the chaos Wright added. The fire's influence was on ants, not guinea pigs. So N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Executive who opposed but supported the social system. The question is similar to question 1. The article says Luc Barthelet brought resources. The initial opposition was from some managers, but the question asks which exec opposed but later helped. The article says "some managers wanted to prevent it from being released at all. But other leaders saw promise..." The exact executive isn't named as the one who opposed. The only named executive is Luc Barthelet who provided resources. So maybe the answer is N/A, because the question's premise might be incorrect. The article doesn't mention that Luc opposed it first. It just says he provided resources. So the answer is N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Lawn mowing and funeral services reflecting realists vs extremists. The realists focused on realistic systems (like financial, lawn mowing, funeral services), while extremists added violence. The article says "realists started with financial system... modifications included lawn mowing and funeral services. Extremists introduced madcap violence..." So the answer is that lawn mowing and funeral services exemplify the realists' focus on realistic systems, contrasting with extremists' violent modifications. The question asks how the introduction reflected the divide. The answer is that it shows the realists' practical focus versus extremists' extreme content. The exact wording from the article: "realists started with the creation of a financial system... later modifications included lawn mowing and funeral services. Extremists introduced madcap violence..." So the answer is "The realists focused on realistic systems while extremists added extreme violence."

14. **Question 14:** Biological phenomenon in ants that inspired object-based markers. The article says Wright observed ants after the firestorm using pheromones to communicate, leading to the idea of using objects as behavioral markers (like a hungry Sim going to the fridge). The phenomenon is the ants' use of pheromones to mark paths, which is the communication method. The answer is "pheromone communication" or "pheromones leaving markers". The article states: "Ants use pheromones to communicate... Wright wondered: Could human intelligence be distributed... Instead of pheromones, The Sims uses objects..." So the biological phenomenon is pheromone-based communication. The answer is "pheromone communication".

15. **Question 15:** How Proxi builds on pheromone-inspired systems. The article says Proxi uses AI to turn memories into characters. The original pheromone idea was about distributed intelligence via environmental markers. Proxi uses AI (technology) to create characters from memories, which is a different application but based on the idea of distributed intelligence. The article says "Proxi, Wright's current AI-driven project... transforming personal memories into lifelike characters using AI." The connection is that both involve distributed intelligence systems but in different forms. The article doesn't explicitly state how Proxi builds on the pheromone system, so maybe N/A. Wait, the article says Wright's idea from ants (distributed intelligence via pheromones) led to The Sims' object-based system. Proxi's use of AI to create characters from memories might not directly relate to pheromone-inspired communication. Since the article doesn't mention Proxi's connection to that, the answer is N/A.
