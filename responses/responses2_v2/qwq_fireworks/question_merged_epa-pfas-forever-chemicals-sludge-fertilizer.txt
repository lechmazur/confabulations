Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and answer strictly based on that.

1. The first question asks about the percentage of fertilized agricultural land that gets sewage sludge annually, considering permits for nearly a fifth of all U.S. land. The article says the EPA noted that sewage sludge is applied to less than 1% of the fertilized acreage yearly. The biosolids industry data aligns with that. So the answer should be "less than 1%". But the question mentions permits for nearly a fifth (about 20%), but the actual application is less than 1%. The question is asking for the percentage applied annually based on industry data, so the answer is "less than 1%".

2. The second question is about the EPA's recommended alternative fertilizer. The article states the EPA advised farmers to consider switching to an alternative fertilizer. The exact name isn't given, so the answer is "N/A" since they just say "alternative fertilizer" without specifying which one.

3. The third question asks for the specific cancer linked to PFAS that prompted 3M to inform the EPA in 2003. The article mentions PFAS are linked to various illnesses including increased cancer risk, but doesn't specify which cancer. So "N/A".

4. Fourth question: The provider sued by Texas ranchers. The article says they sued the provider, but the name isn't mentioned. So "N/A".

5. Fifth question: The FDA's methodology since 2019. The article says the FDA tested using methods questioned by experts, but doesn't name the methodology. So "N/A".

6. Sixth question: The specific non-cancer illness linked to PFAS. The article lists illnesses linked to PFAS including increased cancer risk but doesn't mention others. So "N/A".

7. Seventh question: The bill introduced in Texas in December. The article mentions a Texas lawmaker introduced a bill to limit PFAS levels, but doesn't name it. "N/A".

8. Eighth question: The compound regulated alongside heavy metals and pathogens. The article says the EPA regulates certain heavy metals and pathogens but not PFAS. The question is contrasting with the new focus on PFAS. The regulated compounds are heavy metals and pathogens. The specific compound isn't named here, so maybe "N/A". Wait, the question asks for a specific compound. The text says "the EPA currently regulates certain heavy metals and pathogens in sewage sludge used as fertilizer, but not PFAS." So the specific compound isn't mentioned, so "N/A".

9. Ninth question: The state that introduced a bill after Maine. The article says Texas introduced a bill, and Oklahoma introduced a moratorium bill. The question asks which state introduced a bill to limit levels (like Texas), so "Texas".

Wait, the article says: "In December, a Texas lawmaker introduced a bill that would place limits on levels of certain kinds of PFAS in sewage sludge applied to farmland. Oklahoma lawmakers have also introduced a bill that would place a moratorium on the use of sludge on farmland." So for question 9, the answer is Texas, since it's the one with the limit, mirroring Maine's ban. Wait, the question says "following the example of Maine's 2022 ban". Maine banned use, Texas wants to limit levels. So the answer is Texas for the bill with limits.

10. Tenth question: Year 3M first notified EPA. The article states "3M found as early as 2000 that the chemicals were turning up... In 2003, 3M told EPA." The question asks when they first notified, which was 2003.

11. Eleventh question: PFAS compound posing highest risk from cows. The EPA's assessment focused on PFOA and PFOS. The highest risk via milk from cows would be linked to those. The article says the assessment focused on those two, so the answer is PFOA and PFOS. But the question asks for the specific compound. Since the question says "which specific compound", perhaps it's one of them. The article mentions "the two most commonly detected types... PFOA and PFOS". Since the question is about the highest risk, maybe either is acceptable, but the answer should list both as per the article's focus. The question says "specific compound", but since both are mentioned as the focus, maybe the answer is "PFOA and PFOS".

Wait, the question says "specific compound", so perhaps it's one of them. But the article doesn't single out one. The answer might be "PFOA/PFOS" but the question might expect both. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "N/A" if the article doesn't specify which one. Wait, the article says the EPA's assessment focused on PFOA and PFOS, so the highest risk would be from those two. The question asks for the compound, but since it's two, maybe the answer is "PFOA and PFOS".

12. Twelfth question: Acres permitted for sludge use. The article states farmers have permits for nearly 70 million acres, so the answer is 70 million.

13. Thirteenth question: FDA conducted 1,300 tests. The FDA is mentioned as doing the tests, so the answer is "Food and Drug Administration" or FDA. The question asks for the agency's name, so "Food and Drug Administration".

14. Fourteenth question: Alternative disposal method endorsed. The article says using sludge reduces the need to incinerate or landfill, so the alternative is "N/A" since they're endorsing sludge over those methods. Wait, the question is asking for the alternative disposal method the EPA endorsed as preferable. The article says using sludge cuts down on incineration/landfills, so the EPA's endorsed method is using sludge as fertilizer. But the question is phrased as the alternative to incineration/landfills, which is the sludge itself. So the answer is "sewage sludge as fertilizer" but the question might want the method name. Alternatively, the question is a bit confusing. The answer is "N/A" if they don't name another method, but the article says using sludge is better than incineration/landfills, so the endorsed method is "sewage sludge application as fertilizer".

15. Fifteenth question: Two PFAS the FDA tested for. The article says FDA tested for the types it can test for, but the EPA focused on PFOA and PFOS. The question specifies the FDA's tests. The article says "the FDA does not set limits... but tested nearly 1,300 samples and said the vast majority were free of the types of PFAS the agency is able to test for." It doesn't name the specific two, but the EPA's focus is PFOA/PFOS. However, the question is about what the FDA explicitly mentioned. The article says the FDA tested for "the types of PFAS the agency is able to test for", but doesn't name them. So "N/A".

Wait, the article says "the two most commonly detected types... PFOA and PFOS" in the context of the EPA's assessment. The FDA's testing isn't specified to those. So answer is "N/A".

16. Sixteenth question: Legal mechanism used by Texas ranchers against EPA. The ranchers sued the EPA, so the answer is "lawsuit".

17. Seventeenth question: Industry group arguing manufacturers should pay. The article mentions the National Association of Clean Water Agencies, whose CEO Adam Krantz said manufacturers should bear the cost. So the group is "National Association of Clean Water Agencies".

18. Eighteenth question: Percentage of land fertilized annually based on 2018 data. The article says "less than 1 percent of the fertilized acreage of agricultural land a year", so the answer is "less than 1%".

Now, checking each question again:

1. <answer>less than 1%</answer>

2. The EPA's advice was to switch to alternative fertilizer, but the question asks for the specific name. Since it's not given, "N/A".

3. No specific cancer mentioned. "N/A"

4. Provider name not given. "N/A"

5. Methodology not specified. "N/A"

6. No specific non-cancer illness stated. "N/A"

7. The bill in Texas is unnamed. "N/A"

8. The regulated compounds are heavy metals and pathogens, but the question asks for a specific compound. Since they are categories, not a specific one, "N/A".

9. Texas.

10. 2003.

11. The EPA focused on PFOA and PFOS. Since the question asks for the specific compound (singular), maybe it's expecting both. But the question might accept both. The article says the assessment focused on those two, so the answer is "PFOA and PFOS".

12. 70 million acres.

13. FDA.

14. The alternative disposal method they endorsed is using sludge as fertilizer, so the answer is "sewage sludge as fertilizer" but the question is phrased as the method they endorse as better than incineration. The article says using sludge reduces incineration/landfill, so the method is "application as fertilizer".

15. N/A.

16. Lawsuit.

17. National Association of Clean Water Agencies.

18. less than 1%.

Wait, question 18 says "based on 2018 data". The article states "More than 2 million dry tons were used on 4.6 million acres of farmland in 2018, according to the biosolids industry. Farmers have obtained permits to use sewage sludge on nearly 70 million acres, or about a fifth of all U.S. agricultural land, the industry said." The question asks for the percentage of land currently fertilized annually (based on 2018 data). The 4.6 million acres is the actual application, but the question is about the percentage of the total fertilized land, which the article says "less than 1% of the fertilized acreage of agricultural land a year". So the answer is "less than 1%".
