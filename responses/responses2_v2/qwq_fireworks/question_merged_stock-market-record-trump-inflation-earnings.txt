Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and answer strictly based on that. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks about the Federal Reserve policy announcement in December that made investors more optimistic about inflation. The article mentions that the S&P 500 started rising after data showed inflation slowing in December. It also says the Fed might keep rates lower if inflation is under control. But the question specifies a Fed policy announcement. Wait, the text says "the release of new inflation data in recent weeks has eased those concerns," not a Fed announcement. So there's no mention of the Fed making a policy announcement in December. Therefore, the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The decline in oil prices after Trump's Davos statements. The article states that after his Davos speech, oil fell over 1% to $74.62. So the percentage drop is 1%. The question mentions "previous statements" but the article refers to this specific instance. So the answer is 1.

3. **Question 3:** Total market cap increase of tech companies due to lower yields. The article says Lauren Goodwin linked lower yields to equity market moves, but there's no specific number for tech companies' market cap. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Deutsche Bank's survey on Q1 2024 S&P earnings growth. The article mentions Deutsche Bank's ownership measure fell, but not their earnings predictions. The FactSet data is for Q4 2023. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Decrease in corporate borrowing costs after tariff timeline announcement. The article says lower yields (which affect borrowing costs) but doesn't specify the percentage decrease. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Percentage of Netflix subscribers from tariff-affected regions. The article mentions Netflix's subscriber growth but doesn't break it down by regions. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Correlation between Treasury yields and tech stocks. The article links lower yields to equity moves but doesn't specify tech stocks. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** GE's profit margins vs S&P average. GE beat profit expectations, but no comparison to the S&P average is given. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** S&P rise after Dimon's interview and Trump's G7 oil commitment. The article mentions Dimon's comments but not a specific rise after his interview. Also, Trump's oil statement was at Davos, not G7. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Fed action leading to Netflix growth. The article connects lower yields to equity markets, but Netflix's growth was due to their own subscriber numbers, not Fed action directly. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Implemented tariff on Canadian imports. The article says Trump pledged 25% on Canada/Mexico, but the question asks for the final implemented rate. The text doesn't say if it was enacted or the final rate. Wait, the article says "not until February" but doesn't mention if it was actually implemented. So N/A.

12. **Question 12:** New technology GE implemented. The article only mentions GE beat profit expectations but no specific tech. N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Investment surge after tariff postponement. The article says inflows into stock funds slowed, but no specific alternative investment mentioned. N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Month Trump proposed 60% tariff. The article says before taking office, he considered up to 60% on China. Assuming he took office in 2021? Wait, the article's context might be current events, but the exact month isn't given. So N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Clause in deportation program affecting S&P. The article mentions deportation as a policy that could push prices up, but no specific clause linked to S&P's high. N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Oil price before Trump's inauguration. The article doesn't mention the price before his inauguration. N/A.

17. **Question 17:** Q1 2024 earnings growth influenced by delayed Mexican tariffs. The article's FactSet data is for Q4 2023. No info on Q1 2024 projections. N/A.

18. **Question 18:** Fund outflow after Truth Social post. The article mentions investors react to Truth Social, but no specific fund type. N/A.

I need to make sure each answer is strictly based on the text. Many questions ask for specific numbers or details not present. Only question 2 has a clear answer.
