Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer strictly based on that. Let's go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which major dance companies Petronio's troupe acquired performance spaces from after pandemic venue closures. Scanning the article, there's mention of the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival as their final venue, but no info on acquiring spaces from other companies. So N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Asks about the number of celebrity fashion designers who collaborated on costume designs during peak touring years. The article lists collaborations with celebrities from art, music, and fashion like Cindy Sherman, Lou Reed, Rufus Wainwright, and Tara Subkoff/Imitation of Christ. But it doesn't specify how many were fashion designers. Tara Subkoff is associated with fashion (Imitation of Christ is her brand), but exact count isn't given. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Percentage of funding redirected to social justice after George Floyd's murder. The article states funding shifted but doesn't provide a percentage. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Foundation for Bloodlines project seed money in 2014. The article mentions the Petronio Residency Center was funded with the Doris Duke Foundation for a nature preserve, but Bloodlines isn't linked to that. No info on the initial seed. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Number of original 1984 dancers remaining in the final season. The article doesn't mention this. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Operating budget of the Residency Center's most successful year. No financial figures provided. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Who manages the digital archive after dissolution. The article says the company is creating it, hoping others license it. No mention of who takes over management. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Attendance figures at Joyce Theater's 25 seasons. The article mentions a 2010 review but no attendance numbers. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Choreographer with most performances under Bloodlines. The article lists Trisha Brown, Merce Cunningham, Steve Paxton, etc., but no info on which had most performances. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Revenue from final pre-pandemic tour. No revenue figures given. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Fashion designer with deconstructive style mistakenly attributed to Cindy Sherman. The article mentions Tara Subkoff/Imitation of Christ as a collaborator. If the question says Cindy Sherman was erroneously linked, maybe Tara is the correct one. But the question states the article erroneously attributes a project to Cindy Sherman which was actually by someone else. Wait, the article lists Cindy Sherman as a collaborator. The question is asking which designer known for deconstructive styles (like maybe someone else) was actually involved instead of Cindy. But the article doesn't mention any error here. So N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Acres converted to condos vs. nature preserve. The article says 77 acres were preserved, the rest (175 total minus 77 = 98) were sold, but it doesn't say condos. The sale was to pay debts, but no info on condos. So N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Judson Dance alumni who declined participation. The article mentions Steve Paxton as part of Bloodlines, but no one else mentioned as declining. N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Total grants reallocated to social justice. No specific amount. N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Pulitzer composer who denied involvement. No mention of any composer denying. N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Original dancers in farewell shows. No data. N/A.

17. **Question 17:** European city that canceled residency due to visas. Not mentioned. N/A.

18. **Question 18:** Percentage of Bloodlines fund for climate. The article doesn't mention climate themes. N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Former NYC Ballet dancer who criticized dissolution. No mention. N/A.

20. **Question 20:** Title of canceled Cunningham-inspired work. The article mentions reviving Cunningham's works, but no specific canceled piece named. N/A.

So all answers are N/A except maybe some? Wait let me check again.

Wait for question 4: The Bloodlines project started in 2014. The article says "Bloodlines (future), supported up-and-coming choreographers." But the Doris Duke Foundation is mentioned in relation to the nature preserve, not Bloodlines. So the answer is N/A.

Question 12: The article states that the 77-acre nature preserve with Doris Duke remains untouched, implying the rest (175-77=98) was sold. But the question asks how many were converted to condos, but the article says the property was sold to clear debt, but not for condos. So N/A.

All others seem N/A. So all 20 answers are N/A except maybe none. Let me confirm each again.

Yes, every question asks for specific data not present in the article. The article doesn't provide numbers for any of these. The only numbers mentioned are 1984 (founding), 40 years, 68 (Petronio's age), 2014 (memoir and Bloodlines), 2017 (Catskills), 175 acres (original property), 77 preserved, 500k fund, 25 seasons at Joyce, but none of these match the questions exactly. For example, the 500k is for the Bloodlines future fund, but question 18 asks about a percentage for climate change, which isn't there. So yes, all N/A.
