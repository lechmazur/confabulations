merged_silver-tsunami-meaning-boomers.txt
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the given article. 

1. The first question asks about the percentage of the US population that financial analysts believe contributes to the "unstoppable demographic disaster." The article mentions that the baby boomers are about a quarter of the population. Since the term "silver tsunami" is linked to their impact, the answer is 25% (one-quarter).

2. The second question is about the specific business benefiting from the demographic shift that the author first heard "silver tsunami" in relation to. The article says the author first saw it used by an investor predicting a housing market collapse. So the business is housing-related, specifically real estate or housing market.

3. If older people stay in their homes, what's another investment threatened besides long-term care? The article mentions that some thought the housing market would collapse because of downsizing. If they don't downsize, then real estate investments expecting downsizing might be threatened. So the answer is housing market investments.

4. The financial instrument for retirement planning mentioned. The article refers to public pensions being marketed to by investment products. So the answer is public pensions.

5. The global organization that shares the Institute's view on the term's negativity. The article states the Institute found it offensive, but the UN is mentioned as using it. Wait, the question asks which organization shares the Institute's negative view. Wait, no—the article says the Institute wanted the term eliminated, but the UN used it. So maybe the answer is none? Wait, the question says "global organization... shares the perspective of the Institute for Public Health at Washington University regarding the phrase's negative connotations?" But the article says the UN used the term despite the criticism. So perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says the Institute's advice wasn't heeded by the UN, so the UN doesn't share their view. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question is which organization shares the Institute's view (that the term is negative). The article doesn't mention another organization agreeing with the Institute. The UN, National Cancer Institute, etc., used the term despite the criticism. So maybe N/A? Hmm, need to check again.

Wait, the question says "global organization, according to the article, shares the perspective... negative connotations?" The article says the Institute called it "fatalistic and negative" and wanted it eliminated. But the UN used it. So no other organization is mentioned as agreeing. So answer N/A? Or maybe the UN is the opposite. So yes, N/A.

6. The governmental body besides the Census Bureau that adopted "silver tsunami" despite controversy. The article mentions the National Cancer Institute and government agencies in India and Malaysia. But the question asks for a US governmental body. The National Cancer Institute is part of the NIH, so maybe that's it. The question says "governmental body other than Census Bureau," so National Cancer Institute (part of the US government). So the answer is National Cancer Institute.

7. The economic indicator from "Shop Talk" linked to baby boomers, not housing or pharmaceuticals. The article lists issues like the fiscal deficit, prescription drugs, student loans, mortgage rates, public union rolls, promotions, corporate hegemony. The question wants one not related to housing or pharma. The fiscal deficit is mentioned. So answer is fiscal deficit.

8. The publicly traded entity besides pharmacies that benefits, per the bank. The article says a bank mentioned "acquisition opportunities" from the silver tsunami. The example given earlier was a pharmacy's IPO, but the bank's statement might refer to businesses bought due to retirements. The article mentions chains buying businesses from retiring owners. Publicly traded entities could be acquisition-focused companies. The article says "chains increasingly see opportunity in buying up businesses from independent proprietors retiring." So the answer is chains (but need a specific type). The question says "publicly traded entity besides pharmacies" so maybe the bank itself? Or acquisition-focused companies? The article says "The silver tsunami provides acquisition opportunities" from a bank's perspective. The bank might be referring to their own investment products. Alternatively, the answer could be "investment management products" but the question asks for the entity. Wait, the article says "banks" as in one bank put it. The specific entity type isn't named except "chains". Since chains are businesses, but the question asks for a publicly traded entity. Maybe the answer is "investment management firms" but the exact term from the article? The article mentions "investment management products to teetering public pensions". So the financial instrument is public pensions, but the entity might be banks or investment firms. Alternatively, the answer is "chains" as in retail chains. But the question says "publicly traded entity", so maybe the answer is "investment management products" but that's a product, not entity. Hmm, maybe the answer is "public pensions" but that's the target, not the entity. Wait, the bank's statement is "The silver tsunami provides acquisition opportunities." So the bank is suggesting that companies can acquire businesses from retiring owners. So the type of entity would be companies (like chains) that can acquire. The question specifies "publicly traded entity besides pharmacies" so maybe the answer is "investment management firms" but the article says "investment management products" are sold. The exact wording is "to sell investment management products to teetering public pensions and to explain why chains increasingly see opportunity..." So the chains are the businesses buying. The question asks for the publicly traded entity. The chains are businesses, which could be publicly traded. So the answer is "chains" (like retail chains). 

9. If the housing market collapses due to silver tsunami, the Census Bureau's 2035 prediction is that older adults outnumber under 18. So the dominant age group would be older adults (over 65?), so the answer is older adults.

10. Another international entity besides the UN in a tech-advanced country. The article mentions India and Malaysia. The question asks for a country known for tech. India is a major tech hub. So the answer is India's government agencies (but the question asks for an entity). The article says "government agencies as far away as India and Malaysia." So the specific entity would be, for example, the Indian government. But the question wants an international entity. Wait, the UN is an international org. The other ones are national agencies. The question says "international entity located in a country known for tech." India is a country, but the entity would be a government agency there. Since the question specifies an international entity, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the National Cancer Institute is US, but the question says besides the UN. The article doesn't mention another international org besides the UN. So perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says "government agencies as far away as India and Malaysia" which are national, not international. So the question might be a trick, but the answer is India (as a country, but the question says entity). Hmm, perhaps the answer is N/A because it's not an international organization but a national one. Alternatively, maybe the question allows the country's name. The question says "international entity located in a country known for tech advancements"—maybe India's agencies count as part of India, but it's not an international org. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question might be expecting Malaysia or India, but they are countries, not entities. Hmm. The article says "government agencies as far away as India and Malaysia" so the entities are the government agencies there. The question asks for an international entity (like UN), but those are national. So the answer might be N/A. Alternatively, maybe the National Cancer Institute is part of the US, but the question excludes the UN. Wait, the question says besides the UN, so the answer is India or Malaysia's government, but they are countries, not international entities. So the answer is N/A?

11. How did the Institute reconcile their criticism with the NCI's adoption? The article states the Institute's advice wasn't heeded, so there's no reconciliation mentioned. The question asks how they reconciled it, but the article doesn't say. So answer N/A.
