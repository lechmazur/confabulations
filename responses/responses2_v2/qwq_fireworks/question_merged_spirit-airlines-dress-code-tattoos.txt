Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not infer anything beyond that. Let's go through each question step by step.

1. **Question 1:** Which airline's contract of carriage specifically mentions tattoo visibility requirements for passengers wearing sheer clothing?

Looking at the article, Spirit Airlines updated their policies to include body art (tattoos) under the "inadequately clothed" or "offensive" categories. The article states: "Spirit says [...] including body art, is lewd, obscene or offensive in nature." So Spirit is the airline here. The mention of sheer apparel is part of their "inadequately clothed" definition, but the tattoos are included in the offensive category. So answer is Spirit Airlines.

2. **Question 2:** How many years did Bobby Laurie work as a flight attendant before becoming the sole host of "The Jet Set" travel program?

The article says Bobby Laurie is a former flight attendant and co-host of "The Jet Set." It doesn't mention how many years he worked before becoming a host. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** What percentage of U.S. airlines mentioned in the article explicitly prohibit passengers from wearing clothing with expletive-laden slogans?

The article mentions Spirit has barred passengers for clothes with expletive-laden slogans, but other airlines like Delta, American, Alaska have policies against "lewd, obscene, offensive" but no specifics on expletives. The exact percentage isn't given. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** According to Delta's passenger removal policies, what is the minimum number of passenger complaints required before action can be taken against offensive attire?

The article says Delta's policy mentions attire causing "unreasonable risk of offensive or annoyance," but doesn't specify a number of complaints. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Which Canadian airline's dress code policies are directly compared to Spirit Airlines' new regulations in the article?

The article compares Spirit's policies to other major U.S. airlines but doesn't mention a Canadian airline's policies. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** What temperature threshold does Spirit Airlines specify for determining whether a crop top is considered inappropriate?

The article doesn't mention any temperature, just that crop tops revealing torso could get you kicked off. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** During which month of 2024 did Spirit Airlines implement these updated clothing guidelines?

The article doesn't mention a specific month or year, just says "recently updated." So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** How many times must a flight attendant warn a passenger about dress code violations before initiating removal procedures?

The article mentions a decision requires consensus from multiple employees but no specific number of warnings. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** What monetary fine does Spirit Airlines impose on passengers who refuse to comply with the new dress code requirements?

The article doesn't mention any fines, just removal from the flight. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Which airline's policy specifically addresses the wearing of religious symbols in relation to their "offensive clothing" guidelines?

None of the policies mentioned in the article refer to religious symbols specifically. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Considering Bobby Laurie's perspective on subjective interpretations of offensiveness, what percentage of Spirit Airlines' decisions to remove passengers are based on complaints about sheer apparel?

The article states decisions require consensus but doesn't give a percentage. So N/A.

12. **Question 12:** If a passenger were to wear a crop top revealing their torso, combined with leggings printed with expletive-laden slogans, which airline [...] would first address the leggings issue before addressing the crop top?

Looking at each airline's policy order. Spirit's policy mentions "inadequately clothed" (crop top) first, then "lewd, obscene" (leggings). Other airlines like Delta mention "lewd, obscene" first. The question asks which airline would address leggings first. The article lists Delta's policy as "lewd, obscene or offensive" before "unreasonable risk of offense." But need to check each airline's policy order as presented. The article says Spirit's policy includes both "inadequately clothed" and "lewd, obscene or offensive in nature." The other airlines like Delta, American, Alaska have "lewd, obscene" first. So maybe Delta would address leggings first. But the question asks which airline's contract presents the leggings issue (expletive slogans) first in their policy. Since expletive slogans fall under "lewd, obscene," which is mentioned first in Delta's policy. So Delta. But need to check the exact wording. The article says for Spirit: "inadequately clothed" first. Delta's policy says "lewd, obscene or offensive" first. So the answer would be Delta. But the question is which airline's policy lists the leggings (expletive) issue before crop top (inadequate clothing). Since Delta's policy mentions "lewd, obscene" first, so they would address the leggings first. So answer is Delta.

13. **Question 13:** Given that Delta's contract mentions "unreasonable risk of offense," and assuming a linear increase in passenger complaints, how many additional complaints per flight would Spirit Airlines likely receive compared to Alaska Airlines if both adopted Delta's exact wording?

The article doesn't provide data on complaint numbers or rates. So N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Based on the article, which airline's policy most closely aligns with the legal definition of "indecently exposed" as it pertains to public nudity laws in Barbados, considering their emphasis on textured history?

The article mentions Barbados in the 52 Places section but doesn't link it to airline policies. So N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Taking into account the evolving nature of Quebec City, what type of attire, specifically prohibited by Spirit Airlines, would be most acceptable in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, given its thriving food scene and Cosmological Axis?

The article doesn't compare attire acceptability between locations. So N/A.

16. **Question 16:** If Spirit Airlines were to adopt a numerical scale [...] what number would be assigned to a tattoo deemed acceptable by American Airlines but unacceptable by United?

The article doesn't mention United's policies, only Spirit, Delta, American, Alaska. So N/A.

17. **Question 17:** Considering the travel show "The Jet Set" and its co-host's experience, what form of body art [...] would most likely result in removal from a Spirit flight?

The article says Spirit considers body art (tattoos) that's lewd, obscene, or offensive. So any such tattoo. But the question is asking for a specific type based on the co-host's experience. Since Bobby Laurie is a co-host, but the article doesn't specify types, so N/A unless the answer is "lewd tattoos" but the question requires a form. Maybe "expletive-laden tattoos" but the article doesn't mention that. So N/A.

18. **Question 18:** If a passenger on Alaska Airlines is wearing an outfit that creates an "unreasonable risk of annoyance," and this outfit includes a feature specifically mentioned as unacceptable in Spirit's policy, what element would be acceptable on a flight to Quebec City?

The article doesn't mention Quebec City's acceptability standards. So N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Assuming a direct correlation between dress code strictness and destinations served, which airline would most likely offer a direct flight to Yogyakarta?

The article doesn't link dress code strictness to destinations. So N/A.

20. **Question 20:** Based on contracts [...] which airline would most likely offer a complimentary rum punch as a gesture of goodwill, considering Barbados?

The article mentions Barbados in the 52 Places section but no airline policies relate to offering rum punch. So N/A.
