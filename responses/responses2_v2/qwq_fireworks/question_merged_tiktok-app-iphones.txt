Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided.

1. The question asks for another app besides TikTok mentioned in a Poshmark ad also on eBay. Looking at the article, there's a Poshmark ad that says "UNLOCKED WITH TIKTOK and CAPCUT". Then eBay has "iPhone 14 Pro UNLOCKED! W/ TikTok". The CapCut is mentioned with TikTok on Poshmark, so the answer is CapCut.

2. The spouse's profession is in the part about Allison Kucharczyk having more followers than her husband Isaac Rochell. The article says he's a professional athlete. It doesn't specify his sport, so maybe it's just "athlete". Wait, the question asks for the type of athlete. The article doesn't mention his specific sport, so maybe it's N/A? Wait, the question says "professional athlete's wife", so the spouse is the husband, an athlete. The article doesn't specify his sport, so the answer is N/A?

Wait, the article says "the husband, Isaac Rochell" but doesn't state his sport. So the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "what kind of professional athlete", so if it's not specified, answer N/A.

3. Freddy Tran Nager mentions Flappy Bird as an example of a game that's a gateway. The article says: "The Western world fell into chaos" when Flappy Bird was removed. Nager says TikTok is different because some apps like games work fine without company issues. So Flappy Bird is the example.

4. The article compares a $30k bid to a 2025 Toyota Prius. The question is what car is mentioned in the same context as the highest realistic bid. The Prius is mentioned, so the answer is Toyota Prius.

5. The Supreme Court backed a law that banned TikTok, prompting Trump to plan an executive order. The action was backing a law that effectively banned TikTok. The question asks what action by the Supreme Court caused Trump's order. The answer is "backing a law that effectively banned TikTok" but need to be exact. The article says "Supreme Court backed a law that effectively banned it", so the action is "backing a law that effectively banned TikTok".

Wait, but the question is phrased as "What action by the Supreme Court..." so the answer is "backed a law that effectively banned TikTok".

6. The author is a member of the 2024-25 Times Fellowship class. The question asks the name of the fellowship program. The answer is "Times Fellowship class".

7. The question asks besides spyware and viruses, what other risk Nager mentioned in the context of Brooke Eby's content. Wait, the article says Nager warned about spyware and viruses, but the question adds "in the context of Brooke Eby's content creation". Wait, the part about Brooke Eby is a separate paragraph. The risk mentioned by Nager is about privacy, but the question asks for another specific risk besides spyware and viruses. The article only mentions spyware and viruses as risks. Wait, the exact quote: "could include spyware and other viruses that could really endanger your privacy." So the other specific risk is endangering privacy. But the question says besides spyware and viruses, what other risk? The answer is "endangering privacy" but the question might want the exact term. Wait, the question says "other specific risk... mentioned by Freddy Tran Nager associated with buying a used phone that hasn't been wiped, in the context of Brooke Eby's content creation". Wait, the context of Brooke Eby is separate. The answer is still spyware and viruses are the risks mentioned. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The question might be a trick because the part about Brooke Eby is another example but the risk is still the same. Since the article only mentions spyware and viruses, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, no, the exact quote is "spyware and other viruses that could really endanger your privacy". So "endangering privacy" is the consequence, but the question asks for another risk besides spyware and viruses. Since the other is "viruses", but they are grouped together, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, "spyware and other viruses" are the risks, but the answer is that the other risk is "endangering privacy", but that's a consequence, not a risk. The question is about the risks (spyware/viruses) so maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, tricky. The question might be looking for "endangering privacy" but the instruction says to answer only what's directly stated. The article says spyware and viruses could endanger privacy, so the risks are spyware and viruses. The question asks besides those, so N/A. Wait, but maybe the answer is "endangering privacy" but the question says "specific risk mentioned by Nager", so the risks are spyware and viruses. The other part is the consequence. So the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question might be phrased as "other specific risk" besides spyware and viruses. Since the article doesn't mention another specific risk, answer N/A. Hmm.

Wait the question says "besides spyware and viruses, what other specific risk... mentioned by Freddy Tran Nager". The article says "spyware and other viruses that could really endanger your privacy". So the risks are spyware and viruses. The endangering privacy is the consequence, not another risk. So the answer is N/A.

8. The university associated with Freddy Tran Nager is the University of Southern California. The article says he's an associate director there.

9. The Queens resident (Piotr Gustab) listed his iPhone 15 Pro for $3k, which is three times the iPhone 16 Pro's cost. So the model is iPhone 15 Pro.

10. The monetary offer mentioned when comparing to refurbished is $2,000? Wait, the article says Gustab had an offer for $1,200, still more than almost every brand-new iPhone and nearly twice as much as a refurbished iPhone 15 Pro without TikTok. The question is about the monetary offer that exceeded the cost of most new models despite being lower than initial price. The $1,200 offer is mentioned. The answer is $1,200.

11. After the Supreme Court's backing on Saturday, users saw TikTok resume on the next day when Trump announced the executive order. The next day after Saturday is Sunday. The article says "The next day, the app started working again when President Trump said he was planning an executive order to pause enforcement of the law." So the answer is Sunday.

12. The alternative medium is web browsers. The article says "TikTok is still accessible on web browsers".

13. The sentiment implied by comparing to a Prius is that even ardent users wouldn't buy it for that price. The article says "Even users going through the most severe TikTok withdrawal would be hard-pressed to buy a used phone for the price of a 2025 Toyota Prius." So the sentiment is skepticism or reluctance. The question asks what sentiment is implied. The answer is "skepticism" or "unlikely to buy". The exact wording in the article says "would be hard-pressed", so the answer is "reluctance" or "unwillingness". The article says "Even... would be hard-pressed", so the implied sentiment is that they are not willing, so the answer is "unwillingness" or similar. The question asks for the most implied sentiment, so maybe "skepticism" but the direct answer would be "unwillingness".

14. The historical comparison is Flappy Bird. The article mentions it as an example when removed from app stores, phones with it were sold at high prices.

15. The listed sellers are an IT engineer from Queens, a car salesman from New London, and someone with a $30k bid (who is from Newport News). The question asks which one is not listed: the options are IT engineer Queens, car salesman New London, or gadget trader from Detroit. The article doesn't mention a gadget trader from Detroit, so that's the answer.

16. The Connecticut seller is Izell Malloy, a car salesman and Twitch streamer. The secondary role is Twitch streamer.

17. The market behavior where devices with TikTok are priced higher than new models is an example of "market speculation" or "artificial scarcity". The article says they're listed for eye-watering sums, so the behavior is "artificial scarcity" or "price gouging". The article mentions "market behavior" but the exact term might be "price gouging" or "speculative pricing". The article says "phones with TikTok already downloaded are being listed for eye-watering sums", so the discrepancy exemplifies "price gouging" or "artificial scarcity". The term "speculative pricing" might be the answer, but the article doesn't use that term. The question says "most clearly exemplify" so the answer could be "price gouging". Alternatively, "market speculation" or "supply and demand imbalance". The article says "market behavior" but the exact term from the text? The article says "market behavior" but the question is about the discrepancy, so "price gouging" is possible. Alternatively, "artificial scarcity" because the supply is limited. The article says "coveted by anyone who misses TikTok", so scarcity. The answer might be "artificial scarcity".

Wait, the article says "Phones with TikTok already downloaded are being listed for eye-watering sums" so the behavior is price gouging. The correct answer is "price gouging" or "artificial scarcity". Since the article doesn't use those terms, but the question says "most clearly exemplify", the answer is "price gouging".

But let me check the article again. The article says "Phones with TikTok already downloaded are being listed for eye-watering sums as the social media platform remains absent from app stores." The behavior is due to scarcity, so "artificial scarcity". Alternatively, "speculative market behavior".

Hmm. The question asks what market behavior this discrepancy exemplifies. The answer is "artificial scarcity" or "price gouging". Since the article doesn't specify, but the options are based on the text. The article says "listed for eye-watering sums" implying high prices due to scarcity. The best answer is "artificial scarcity".

Alternatively, the term "market speculation" might fit. But I'll go with "price gouging" as the most direct term from the context.
