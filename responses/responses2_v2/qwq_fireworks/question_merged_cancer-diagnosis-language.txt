Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by skimming through each question and then looking back at the article to find the answers.

Question 1: It asks about Sweden's percentage of patients with low-risk prostate cancer opting for aggressive treatment according to Dr. Ronald M. Epstein's views. Wait, the article says that more than 60% of US patients choose watch-and-wait, and in Sweden over 90% do. But the question is about those who opt for aggressive treatment. Since 90% choose watch-and-wait, aggressive would be 10%. The question mentions Epstein, but the data is from the article's general info, so the answer is 10%.

Question 2: Dr. Esserman's stance on renaming DCIS. The article mentions that dysplasia is used for cervical cells. The question asks what Dr. Howard Markel suggested. Wait, the article says that Dr. Esserman suggests terms like "abnormal cells, low-grade lesions, stage 0 cancer, precancer, a risk factor for cancer." Markel isn't mentioned suggesting a term; the example of dysplasia is given as a precedent. The question might be a trick here. Since the question says "what alternative diagnostic label... did Dr. Howard Markel suggest," but the article doesn't say he suggested anything. So N/A.

Question 3: The year the NY Med Journal article suggested keeping patients ignorant. The article says "Before 1977, most doctors wouldn't even tell patients... an 1898 article in the NY Medical Journal advised..." So the answer is 1898.

Question 4: How many women in Hwang's trial had higher rates after active monitoring? The article says "patients who were being actively monitored did not experience a higher rate of cancer than patients treated with surgery." So the answer is 0. But the question says "how many women, out of nearly 1,000..." The answer would be none, so 0.

Question 5: Dr. Arif Kamal's perspective on support, and what technique the 1898 article advocated. The article says the 1898 article advised keeping patients ignorant. The question asks for the technique, which would be "keeping patients ignorant of the nature and probable outcome."

Question 6: The second-leading cause of death in 1977 when doctors began informing patients. The article states "by 1970, cancer had become the second-leading cause..." So in 1977, it's still cancer. The question asks for the second-leading cause in 1977, so the answer is cancer. But wait, the question says "the year when doctors began consistently informing patients of their cancer diagnoses" – the article says "Before 1977, most doctors wouldn't tell..." implying that after 1977 they did. The second-leading cause in 1977 would still be cancer. So answer is cancer.

Question 7: If DCIS is renamed, which medical professional would implement it for breast conditions? The article mentions Dr. Esserman is a surgeon and oncologist at a Breast Care Center. So the answer is oncologists, specifically breast oncologists or surgeons? The article says "the solution is simple. Call the condition something else... to shift... from invasive surgery to active monitoring." The professionals responsible would be oncologists, so "oncologists" or "surgeons". The question says "specific type of medical professional" – maybe "surgeons" since Esserman is a surgeon.

Question 8: The screening tool advancement leading to DCIS diagnoses. The article says "as imaging tools emerge that can reveal cancer at earlier stages, doctors believe most cancers start as in situ cells." So the screening tools like imaging (MRI, mammography) are responsible, but the article doesn't name a specific one. The question asks for the specific tool. The article mentions "imaging tools" as the advancement. But the question says "what specific screening tool advancement... was directly responsible for the increased diagnosis of DCIS"? The article says imaging tools led to finding early stages, so the answer is imaging tools. But the question requires a specific term. The article says "imaging tools emerge that can reveal cancer growing at earlier stages" – so the answer is imaging technology or imaging tools. Since it's a specific term, maybe "imaging techniques" but the exact term used is "imaging tools". So answer: imaging tools.

Question 9: Hormone-blocking medication suggested by Esserman. The article mentions "active monitoring (sometimes with hormone-blocking medications)". So the answer is hormone-blocking medications. The question asks for a specific medication? The article doesn't name any, so N/A.

Question 10: Dr. Kamal's statement on support, and the element influencing patient processing. The article says Dr. Scherer found that the doctor's tone, pauses, etc., affect processing. The question asks for a specific element beyond the label. The article mentions "doctor's tone of voice, a gentle touch... pauses so the patient can digest the news" as part of communication influencing processing. The answer is "the doctor's tone of voice" or "pauses". The question says "specific element... similar to the impact of the term 'in situ'". The article says "the pauses left so the patient can digest the news" was part of communication. The exact element Dr. Scherer found significant might be the "doctor's tone" or "pauses". The question says "what specific element of a doctor's communication... most significantly influenced a patient's ability..." The article says the doctor's tone and pauses are part of the communication. The exact answer would be "the doctor's tone of voice" as mentioned first, but the question mentions "similar to the impact of 'in situ'", which is a term. Alternatively, the element might be the "doctor's tone of voice" or "gentle touch", but the question asks for the element beyond the label. The article says "the doctor's tone of voice, a gentle touch of the hand, the pauses left so the patient can digest the news. All of these details subtly impart how you should think..." So the answer could be "pauses" or "tone of voice". The question says "the element... most significantly influenced... similar to the impact of the term 'in situ'". The article doesn't explicitly state which element was most significant, but the question might be looking for "pauses" as the element that allows processing. Alternatively, maybe "doctor's tone of voice". The exact answer is unclear but the article mentions "the pauses left so the patient can digest the news" as part of the communication that affects processing. The answer is "pauses".

Question 11: The term for cervical cells as a precedent. The article says "abnormal cervical cells... are now referred to as dysplasia". So the answer is dysplasia.

Question 12: Who argued that urgency comes from awareness, not biology? The article says Dr. Esserman said "It's an emergency only because you know about it." So the answer is Dr. Laura J. Esserman.

Question 13: The decade when cancer became the dread disease. The article says "by 1970, it had earned the nickname 'the dread disease'". So the decade is the 1970s.

Question 14: Sweden's watch-and-wait percentage for prostate. The article states "In Sweden, more than 90 percent of patients choose this option." So the answer is over 90% or more than 90%. The question asks "what proportion" so "over 90%".

Question 15: The diagnosis defined as in situ but labeled cancer. The article says DCIS is "ductal carcinoma in situ" which is an oxymoron. So DCIS.

Question 16: Who voiced concerns about renaming being paternalistic? The article says Dr. Hwang "the bigger question may be not whether to rename... but how to reframe... It can also hinder research. ... Dr. Hwang said..." and also "Using a word like 'neoplasia'... suggests that patients need to be protected... It's a little disingenuous." So the answer is Dr. Shelley Hwang.

Question 17: The expert with misidentified affiliation. The article mentions Dr. Arif Kamal's affiliation was misstated as American Cancer Association instead of American Cancer Society. So the answer is Dr. Arif Kamal.

Question 18: The term compared to being hit by a truck. The article says "Patients compare hearing the term 'cancer' to 'getting hit by a truck'". So the term is "cancer".

Question 19: The 1898 NY Med Journal advisory statement. The article quotes "patients be kept in ignorance of the nature and probable outcome of the disease as long as possible".

Question 20: The term criticized for not reflecting biology. The article says "the word 'cancer' does not reflect biological reality". The term is "cancer" when applied to conditions like DCIS, lung, thyroid etc. The question asks for the term used for those conditions, which is "cancer".

Wait, let me check each again carefully.

For question 2: The question is asking what Dr. Howard Markel suggested. The article says "Others have already had the word excised from their names: Abnormal cervical cells, for example, are now referred to as dysplasia." But Markel isn't the one suggesting it. The question might be a trick, so answer N/A.

Question 4: The trial results said that active monitoring didn't have higher rates. So the number is 0, but the question says "how many women... experienced a higher rate". Since the answer is none, it's 0.

Question 9: The article says "active monitoring (sometimes with hormone-blocking medications)". No specific drug is named, so N/A.

Question 10: The element is "pauses" as per the article's example, so answer "pauses".
