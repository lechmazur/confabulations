Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by reading through each question and then cross-referencing with the article to find the answers.

1. **Question 1**: The aspect rejected by Gwendolyn and Kirjan in their trilogy. The article says Under the Radar rejects naturalism. "Dead as a Dodo" is part of their eco-trilogy. So the answer should be naturalism.

2. **Question 2**: Prop in both "SpaceBridge" and Schenkkan's play. The article mentions "old-fashioned suitcases" in "SpaceBridge". Schenkkan's play is "Old Cock". Wait, the question says Schenkkan's satirical play about Portuguese national identity, which is "Old Cock". The prop mentioned there is a feathery costume for the rooster, but the suitcases are in "SpaceBridge". Wait, maybe the question is asking for a prop common to both? The article says "SpaceBridge" uses old-fashioned suitcases. Does Schenkkan's play use the same prop? Let me check again. The article says "SpaceBridge" uses "old-fashioned suitcases". The other play by Schenkkan is "Old Cock" which is about a rooster, so maybe not suitcases. Hmm. Maybe I misread. Wait, the question says "symbolizing the journey of the young Russian refugees" and "also prominently featured in Robert Schenkkan's satirical play about Portuguese national identity". Since "Old Cock" is about a rooster and Portugal's emblem, perhaps the prop is the feathery costume? But the question says the prop in "SpaceBridge" is also in Schenkkan's play. Wait, the question might be tricking me. Let me recheck. The article says "SpaceBridge" uses old-fashioned suitcases. Schenkkan's "Old Cock" has a rooster costume. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, no. The question says "symbolizing the journey of refugees" (suitcases) and "also prominently featured in Schenkkan's play". Since the play's prop is the rooster costume, maybe there's no overlap. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me think again. The question might be looking for "old-fashioned suitcases" as the prop in both? But the Schenkkan play's prop isn't mentioned as suitcases. So maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe the question is asking for a prop that's in both. Since only "SpaceBridge" mentions suitcases, then maybe N/A. Hmm, this is tricky. I'll note that and come back.

3. **Question 3**: What aspect of human existence symbolized by the dodo, also in "Blind Runner". The dodo is extinct since 17th century. The article says "Dead as a Dodo" is about new beginnings and the evolution of natural and human worlds. "Blind Runner" has a political statement about asylum, but the article says the political part is only in the last minutes. The main themes might be about survival or extinction? The dodo's extinction could symbolize human impact on nature, which is also in "Blind Runner" through the Iranian woman's journey. Maybe "extinction" or "environmental destruction"? The article says "Dead as a Dodo" is part of an eco-trilogy, so the dodo symbolizes extinction due to human actions. "Blind Runner" touches on political asylum, so maybe the common aspect is human impact on the environment vs. political issues. Not sure. Wait, the question says "aspect of human existence... also touched upon in 'Blind Runner'". The article says "Blind Runner" has a blind runner trying to cross a tunnel, which might relate to survival or escape. Maybe "survival" or "migration"? Hmm. Alternatively, since "Dead as a Dodo" deals with extinction, and "Blind Runner" has a political asylum context, maybe "migration" or "displacement"? The article says the refugees in "SpaceBridge" are waiting on asylum, so maybe "displacement". But I need to see if "Blind Runner" explicitly mentions that. The article says "Blind Runner" is about a blind Iranian woman running through a tunnel between France and Britain, which could symbolize escape or migration. The dodo's extinction relates to environmental neglect. The question is about what the dodo symbolized before extinction, which is its existence, so maybe "existence" or "life". Not sure. Maybe the answer is "extinction" as the aspect, but "Blind Runner" might touch on survival, so perhaps "extinction" isn't directly there. Alternatively, the article says "Dead as a Dodo" is about new beginnings and the natural/human worlds, so maybe "new beginnings" but that's the theme, not the dodo's symbol. Maybe "environmental destruction" is the aspect, and "Blind Runner" has political asylum, so maybe N/A? Hmm, this is tough. Let me come back.

4. **Question 4**: How many minutes longer the live version of Egon Tichy compared to the version with Ellen Lauren? Wait, the question is a bit confusing. The article says the 2020 streamed version had Gelb interacting with multiple versions via video editing. The new iteration (the live version now) has the same setup but the show has grown from 35 minutes to almost an hour. The question asks compared to the version where Ellen Lauren played Samantha Smith. Wait, Ellen Lauren is in "SpaceBridge", not "Egon Tichy". So maybe there's a mix-up here. The question might be a trick. Since the Ellen Lauren part is in a different play, the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "compared to the version where Ellen Lauren played Samantha Smith". But Ellen Lauren is in "SpaceBridge", which is a different play. The Egon Tichy show's versions are the 2020 streamed one (35 min) and the new live version (60 min). The question is asking the difference between the live version now and the version with Ellen Lauren (which isn't part of Egon Tichy). So the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The question might be a distractor. Since the Ellen Lauren part is in "SpaceBridge", which is unrelated, the answer is N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Theatrical element used in both "Dead as a Dodo" and "Old Cock" for dictatorial regime. The article says "Dead as a Dodo" uses puppetry, projections, lighting, and audio. "Old Cock" has the rooster confronting Salazar via a video screen. The element used in "Old Cock" to represent Salazar is the video screen showing his image. So the answer might be "video screens" or "video projection". The question is about what element was used in both. "Dead as a Dodo" uses puppetry and video? The article says "Dead as a Dodo" has projections and video? Wait, the article says "projections (by Erato Tzavara), lighting (by Daphne Agosin) and audio (sound and original music by Thor Gunnar Thorvaldsson)". So projections, not video screens. "Old Cock" uses a video screen for Salazar. So maybe "video screens" or "projections" is the element. The question asks what element was used in both. Since "Dead as a Dodo" uses projections, and "Old Cock" uses video screens (which are a type of projection?), maybe the answer is "projections" or "video screens". The article specifies "video screen" in "Old Cock". So maybe the answer is "video screens". Alternatively, the element in "Dead as a Dodo" that's crucial is puppetry. The question says "theatrical element crucial to immersive experience of Dead as a Dodo" (puppetry, projections, etc.) and what Kruzhilina used in "Old Cock" to represent Salazar. Since "Old Cock" uses a video screen showing Salazar, the element is video screens. So the answer would be "video screens".

6. **Question 6**: Performance type used in both "SpaceBridge" and "Blind Runner". The article says "SpaceBridge" uses re-enactments, vaudevillian skits. "Blind Runner" has "stilted conversations between the runner's guide and his imprisoned wife during visits". So the imprisoned wife's interactions are static, staged interactions. The question asks what type of performance was used by both. The type in "SpaceBridge" is reenactments, and in "Blind Runner" it's static conversations. Maybe "static interactions" or "reenactments". The question says "used by Amir Reza Koohestani in his portrayal of the imprisoned wife". The article says "Blind Runner" uses "stilted conversations... during his weekly visits to her". So perhaps "re-enactments" or "static conversations". The answer might be "re-enactments", but "Blind Runner" uses conversations. Alternatively, the question is about "performance type", maybe "monologues" or "dialogues". Not sure. Alternatively, "re-enactments" in "SpaceBridge" and "conversations" in "Blind Runner". Since the question asks for a type used by both, maybe the answer is "re-enactments" if "Blind Runner" also has reenactments. But the article says "Blind Runner" has "stilted conversations... during his weekly visits", so that's a dialogue, not a reenactment. Hmm. Maybe the answer is "dialogues" but not sure. Alternatively, "vaudevillian skits" are in "SpaceBridge", but "Blind Runner" doesn't mention that. The question says "type... used by... Koohestani in portrayal of imprisoned wife". The article says "stilted conversations... during his weekly visits to her" – so that's a form of dialogue or staged conversation. Maybe "dialogues" is the answer. Alternatively, "static interactions" as per the article's description. Hmm. Let me see if there's another element. The article says "SpaceBridge" uses "re-enactments to vaudevillian skits", so reenactments are a performance type. "Blind Runner" has "conversations", which are a type of performance. Not sure. Maybe the answer is "re-enactments" but I'm not certain. Let me note and come back.

7. **Question 7**: Specific location central to "Blind Runner" and in "Animal R.I.O.T." The article says "Blind Runner" is about a tunnel between France and Britain. "Animal R.I.O.T." is part of Wakka Wakka's eco-trilogy. The article doesn't explicitly say where "Animal R.I.O.T." is set, but maybe "Animal R.I.O.T." also deals with environmental issues, so perhaps a natural location like a forest or ocean? The question asks for a location central to both. Since "Blind Runner" uses a tunnel, maybe "Animal R.I.O.T." had a similar setting. The article mentions "Dead as a Dodo" is part of the trilogy, which deals with environmental issues. "Animal R.I.O.T." might be set in an environment like a forest or animal habitat. The question says "also served as a metaphorical setting in Wakka Wakka's previous work". The tunnel in "Blind Runner" is a literal setting, but maybe "Animal R.I.O.T." used a similar metaphor, like a forest (as a habitat). But the article doesn't specify. Alternatively, the tunnel between France and Britain is a border, so maybe "Animal R.I.O.T." used a border metaphor? Not sure. The answer might be "a tunnel between France and Britain" but the other work's setting isn't mentioned. So N/A? Wait, the article says "Animal R.I.O.T." is part of the trilogy with "Dead as a Dodo", which is about environmental issues. Maybe the setting is a natural environment, but the question wants a specific location. Since the article doesn't mention the location of "Animal R.I.O.T.", maybe N/A. Hmm.

8. **Question 8**: Profession shared by Samantha Smith (played by Ellen Lauren) and the creator of Egon Tichy. Samantha Smith was an activist, real-life American peace activist. The creator of Egon Tichy is Jonathan Levin, the director. The question asks what profession they share. Ellen Lauren plays an activist, but her real profession is actress. The creators of Egon Tichy are director Levin, playwright Luxenberg, and performer Gelb. The question is about the profession shared between Samantha Smith's role (activist) and the creator of Egon Tichy. Maybe "director"? Because Levin is a director. But Samantha Smith was an activist, not a director. So the shared profession would be... Not sure. Alternatively, the question refers to the creator (Levin) and Samantha's actual role (activist), so no overlap. Alternatively, the question is about the character Samantha Smith (as an activist) and the creator's profession? Maybe not. Alternatively, the "creator of Egon Tichy" refers to the team, but their professions are director, playwright, performer. The answer might be "director" if Levin is the main creator. But the question says "shared by the character Samantha Smith and the creator". Since Samantha is an activist and the creator is a director, it's N/A. Hmm.

9. **Question 9**: Artistic medium used for multiple Gelb versions in Egon Tichy, also used by Jorge Andrade to represent Salazar. The article says Egon Tichy uses simultaneous video editing to mix live and prerecorded versions. In "Old Cock", Salazar is on a video screen, so the medium is video. So the answer is "video editing" or "video screens". The question asks what artistic medium was used by both. So "video editing" or "video projection".

10. **Question 10**: Object manipulated by protagonist in Dead as a Dodo, also in vaudevillian skits of SpaceBridge. The protagonist in "Dead as a Dodo" is looking for bones. So bones. The vaudevillian skits in "SpaceBridge" might use suitcases or other props. The question says the object was also a key element in the skits. If the skits used bones, but the article mentions "old-fashioned suitcases" as a prop. So maybe the answer is "bones", but the skits might use suitcases. So N/A. Alternatively, maybe "bones" isn't in the skits. The article doesn't mention bones in "SpaceBridge", so N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The production with the long-dead boy and dodo as the concluding chapter of the eco-trilogy. The article says "Dead as a Dodo" concludes Wakka Wakka's eco-minded trilogy, following "Animal R.I.O.T." and "The Immortal Jellyfish Girl". So the answer is "Dead as a Dodo".

12. **Question 12**: Which performance at NYTW's 4th St used simultaneous video editing? The article says "The 7th Voyage of Egon Tichy [Redux]" at NYTW uses this, as the 2020 version did and the new one still does. So that's the answer.

13. **Question 13**: Theatrical work at La MaMa with refugees and Samantha Smith. "SpaceBridge" is at La MaMa and features Samantha Smith (Ellen Lauren) and refugee stories. So the answer is "SpaceBridge".

14. **Question 14**: Production with a rooster in a feathery costume confronting Salazar via video. That's "Old Cock" by Schenkkan. The article says Andrade plays the rooster and Salazar via video screen. So "Old Cock".

15. **Question 15**: Play using German Expressionist lighting for a blind woman's journey. "Blind Runner" is described as having Eric Soyer's lighting in a minimalist set with the suggestive power of German Expressionist movies. So "Blind Runner".

16. **Question 16**: Japan Society's "Duke Bluebeard's Castle" as a contrast to other festival works. The article mentions "Duke Bluebeard's Castle" at Japan Society from Jan 15-18 as a glimpse into experimental Japanese theater contrasting with others. So the answer is "Duke Bluebeard's Castle".

17. **Question 17**: Opening with "Bone!" and "Death!" calls. The article says "Dead as a Dodo" starts with "Bone!" followed by "Death! Death! Death!". So that's the answer.

18. **Question 18**: Piece integrating old-fashioned suitcases and reenactments in a New York setting. That's "SpaceBridge", which uses suitcases and reenactments. The article says "SpaceBridge" is at La MaMa, uses suitcases, reenactments, and touches on political maneuverings. So "SpaceBridge".

19. **Question 19**: Which show's running time increased from 35 to nearly 60 minutes, diluting its gimmick. The article says "The 7th Voyage of Egon Tichy [Redux]" had a 35-minute version that grew to almost an hour. So that's the answer.

20. **Question 20**: Farewell event with Fred Armisen's drumming gig over 34 years. The article's closing section mentions "A Blue Man Group Farewell" which gave Fred Armisen a drumming gig over 34 years. So the answer is "The Blue Man Group".

Now, let me go back to the tricky ones:

Question 2: The prop in both "SpaceBridge" (suitcases) and Schenkkan's "Old Cock". The play "Old Cock" is about a rooster, so the prop is the feathery costume. The question asks for a prop symbolizing refugees' journey (suitcases) and also in Schenkkan's play. Since the plays are different, unless the suitcases are in both, but the article doesn't say Schenkkan uses suitcases. So answer is N/A? Wait, maybe the question is asking for a prop that's in both, but there isn't one. So N/A.

Question 3: The aspect symbolized by the dodo. The dodo's extinction relates to environmental issues. "Blind Runner" touches on political asylum. The common aspect might be "human impact on the environment" or "extinction", but "Blind Runner" is about political issues. The question says "also touched upon in 'Blind Runner'". Since "Blind Runner" has a political asylum context, maybe the aspect is "displacement" or "migration", but the article doesn't explicitly link it. Alternatively, the dodo's extinction symbolizes human-caused extinction, and "Blind Runner" has a blind runner's struggle, so maybe "survival". The article says "Dead as a Dodo" deals with new beginnings and evolution, so maybe "new beginnings" but that's the theme. Alternatively, the answer is "extinction" and "Blind Runner" doesn't touch that, so N/A. Hmm. The article says "Dead as a Dodo" is part of an eco-trilogy, so the dodo symbolizes extinction due to human actions. The question asks what aspect of human existence is symbolized by the dodo before extinction, so maybe "existence" or "life". But the question also says "also touched upon in 'Blind Runner'". Since "Blind Runner" is about a blind woman's journey, perhaps "survival" is the common aspect. Not sure. Maybe the answer is "extinction" since the question allows for "also touched upon", but if "Blind Runner" doesn't mention extinction, then N/A. The article says "Blind Runner" is about the runner's journey, so maybe the aspect is "migration" or "escape". Since the dodo's extinction relates to environmental neglect, and "Blind Runner" is about political asylum (migration), maybe "migration" is the aspect. But the question is about what the dodo symbolized before extinction. The dodo was extinct because of humans, so maybe "human-caused extinction" but that's the cause, not the aspect of human existence. Alternatively, the aspect is "human impact on nature", which is part of the eco-trilogy. "Blind Runner" has political issues, so maybe not. I'll go with N/A here since the article doesn't explicitly connect them.

Question 5: The theatrical element used in both. "Dead as a Dodo" uses projections, "Old Cock" uses video screens. Since video screens are a form of projection, maybe "projections" is the answer. The question asks what element was used by Kruzhilina in "Old Cock" to represent Salazar. The answer would be "video screen" or "video projection". Since the question is about what element was used in both, the common element is projections/video. So answer "video screens".

Question 6: The performance type. "SpaceBridge" uses reenactments, "Blind Runner" has conversations. The question asks for a type used by both. Maybe "dialogues" but not sure. Alternatively, "re-enactments" if "Blind Runner" has reenactments. The article says "Blind Runner" has "stilted conversations... during his weekly visits", which is dialogue, not reenactment. So maybe the answer is N/A, but the question says "type... used by Amir Reza Koohestani in portrayal of imprisoned wife". Since "Blind Runner" uses dialogue, maybe the answer is "dialogues" but I'm not sure. Alternatively, "static interactions" as per the article's description. The question might expect "re-enactments" but that's only in "SpaceBridge". Hmm. Maybe the answer is N/A.

Question 7: The location. The tunnel in "Blind Runner" and maybe "Animal R.I.O.T." used a similar setting. Since the article doesn't specify where "Animal R.I.O.T." is set, it's N/A.

Question 8: Profession. The creator of Egon Tichy is a director (Levin). Samantha's role is an activist. No shared profession. Answer N/A.

Question 10: The object is bones. Vaudevillian skits in "SpaceBridge" might not use bones. So N/A.
