Okay, I need to go through each question and check the article for the answers. Let me start with the first one.

1. The question asks how many homes in Boulder County were certified by Wildfire Partners in the previous year. The article mentions the Wildfire Partners program and certification, but there's no number given. It just says homeowners can get certified with a yard sign. So, N/A.

2. The article says Berkeley is implementing a five-foot fireproof perimeter. It doesn't mention any neighborhood's compliance rate. No data on highest compliance, so N/A.

3. San Diego requires tree canopies 10 feet away. The article doesn't state a percentage reduction in fire damage from that specific measure. No number here, so N/A.

4. The question compares insurance premium decreases between mesh and meltable vents. The text mentions mesh screens aren't always effective and some prefer meltable ones, but no info on premium differences. N/A.

5. The article names Abeer Sweis as an architect using rammed earth in Santa Monica, but no mention of a firm or the largest number. So, N/A.

6. Berkeley residents' cost savings before the 2023 law aren't mentioned. The article talks about upcoming regulations, but no past savings data. N/A.

7. The Black Saturday fires in Victoria had Bushfire Places of Last Resort, but the article doesn't say how many were used. N/A.

8. The article states that much LA infrastructure is from the 60s/70s, but no percentage of destroyed homes with that infrastructure. N/A.

9. Evacuation success via the private app vs. texts: the article mentions LA had erroneous texts and a private app was more reliable, but no numbers on how many used each. N/A.

10. Cost difference between underground lines and poles: the article says burying is expensive, covering with protective layers is less so, but no average cost difference figure. N/A.

11. The Boulder County program has yard signs and voters approved tax hikes. The article says Boulder County did both, so the answer is Boulder County.

12. Rancho Santa Fe prohibits parking on narrow roads always, unlike LA's wind-day rules. The article mentions this directly, so Rancho Santa Fe.
