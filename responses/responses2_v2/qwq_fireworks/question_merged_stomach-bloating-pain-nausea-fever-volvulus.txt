Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information given in the article. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **What was the name of the pediatrician who initially diagnosed the young woman with a sensitive stomach during her childhood?**  
   The article mentions that their pediatrician agreed but doesn't provide the pediatrician's name. So, answer N/A.

2. **How many times did the patient visit the emergency room for similar symptoms in the months leading up to her final hospitalization?**  
   The text says the mother suggested the ER once when the daughter sounded awful, but the patient didn't go. The final visit is the one described. So, maybe once before? Wait, the question is about visits before the final one. The article states "the mother noticed a change a few months earlier. A couple of times..." but the patient only went this time. The mother suggested ER once but the patient deferred. So maybe only once before? But the question is about visits. The patient didn't go before, so the answer is 0? Or the question is about how many times she visited before the final one. The article says she went to the ER this time, and previously she had declined. The answer is N/A because it's not specified how many times she actually went. The mother suggested once but she didn't go. So the answer is 0? Wait, the exact wording: "Once, her daughter sounded so awful over the phone that her mother became worried and suggested she go to the emergency room. But these pains never lasted long, her daughter assured her." So she didn't go. So the number of ER visits before the final is 0. But the question is about "similar symptoms". The answer might be N/A because it's not explicitly stated. The article doesn't say she visited the ER before, only that the mother suggested it once but she didn't. So answer N/A.

3. **Which medication did the emergency room doctor prescribe to address her severe abdominal distention before ordering the CT scan?**  
   The article says she took a laxative herself, but the ER doctor didn't prescribe it. The ER doctor ordered a CT scan. The answer is N/A.

4. **What was the patient's blood pressure reading when she arrived at the Southpark extension of Atrium Health Carolinas Medical Center?**  
   The article mentions her blood pressure was sky high, but no specific number is given. So N/A.

5. **During which swimming stroke did the patient most frequently experience ingestion of chlorinated water that contributed to her stomach issues?**  
   The article says she swallowed chlorinated water while sprinting the length of the pool, but doesn't mention a specific stroke. So N/A.

6. **What was the duration of the surgical procedure to remove the 18 inches of her lower intestines?**  
   The article doesn't mention the duration of the surgery. N/A.

7. **What was the name of the family member who drove the patient from her college to the Charlotte Douglas International Airport before her symptoms became severe?**  
   The patient flew on a plane, so she arrived at the airport herself. Her mother picked her up at the airport. The question is who drove her from college to the airport, but she was on a plane. So maybe she flew, so the driver isn't mentioned. The answer is N/A.

8. **What was the name of the surgeon who performed the final corrective operation to prevent future volvulus occurrences?**  
   The article doesn't mention the surgeons' names. N/A.

9. **At what altitude did the airplane cabin pressure begin to significantly affect her intestinal distention?**  
   The article mentions that reduced cabin pressure might have worsened bloating, but doesn't specify the altitude. N/A.

10. **What was the measured circumference of her abdomen when it reached its maximum distention during her hospital stay?**  
   No measurement given. N/A.

11. **What was the altitude-related factor during the flight that directly caused the initial twisting of the sigmoid colon?**  
   The article states that the flight's reduced cabin pressure might have worsened bloating, but the twisting was due to the volvulus, not directly caused by altitude. The cause of the initial twist isn't linked to altitude. The article says the flight's pressure worsened bloating, but the twisting was already present. So N/A.

12. **Which genetic disorder linked to increased intestinal mobility was ruled out as the cause of the patient's volvulus during surgery?**  
   The article mentions that in young people, volvulus can be linked to anatomical abnormalities like a long colon or lax arteries. However, during surgery, they found no anatomical abnormality. So perhaps a disorder like Hirschsprung's or others, but the article doesn't name a specific one ruled out. N/A.

13. **What was the name of the laxative the patient took that worsened her condition prior to arriving at the ER?**  
   The article says she took a laxative but doesn't name it. N/A.

14. **How many previous episodes of self-resolving volvulus did the surgeons confirm during her postoperative analysis?**  
   The article mentions that volvulus can resolve on its own, which explains her intermittent pain. The surgeons might have inferred previous episodes, but it's not stated how many. N/A.

15. **Which specific artery supplying the sigmoid colon showed compromised blood flow on the second CT scan?**  
   The article mentions the arteries providing blood supply were having trouble, but doesn't name the artery. N/A.

16. **What was the pediatrician’s earlier misdiagnosis that delayed identifying the anatomical cause of her lifelong gastrointestinal issues?**  
   The pediatrician diagnosed a sensitive stomach, which was the misdiagnosis. So answer: "sensitive stomach".

17. **Which postoperative complication directly led to the decision to perform the final resection of 18 inches of intestine instead of another detorsion procedure?**  
   After untwisting twice, the gut twisted again. The article says they removed part because it kept twisting. The complication was recurrent volvulus. Answer: "recurrent volvulus".

18. **What was the measured intra-abdominal pressure during the patient’s second ER visit that necessitated immediate surgery?**  
   No specific pressure given. N/A.

19. **What medication administered intravenously in the ER temporarily reduced her blood pressure before the CT scan?**  
   The article doesn't mention any IV meds for blood pressure. N/A.

20. **What specific type of congenital adhesions were discovered during the third surgery that explained the recurrent twisting?**  
   The article states no anatomical abnormality was found, so adhesions weren't the cause. Answer N/A.
