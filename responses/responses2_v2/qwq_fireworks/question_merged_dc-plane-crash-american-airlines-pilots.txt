Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and answer each exactly as specified.

1. **Total flight time from descent to impact**: The article says Flight 5342 began descending at 8:15 p.m. and the crash was around 8:48 p.m. So from 8:15 to 8:48 is 33 minutes. But the question is from descent until impact. The crash happened at 8:48, so 33 minutes. Wait, the NTSB says they began descending around 8:15, and the crash was at 8:48. So 33 minutes. But the article mentions that after agreeing to switch runways (around 8:43), then the crash was at 8:48. Wait, the exact timing: started descending at 8:15, then around 8:43 they agreed to switch runways, and the crash was at 8:48. The question is total flight time from descent start to impact. So 33 minutes. But the article says "around 8:15 p.m., they began descending... NTSB said over the weekend, citing black box data. That data also includes audio from the cockpit, and the NTSB said the times it provided were preliminary. Around 8:46 p.m., a radio transmission could be heard... At that point, the airplane would have been moments from landing..." The crash was at 8:48. So total time from 8:15 to 8:48 is 33 minutes. So answer is 33.

2. **Pilot at controls during final approach**: The pilots were Sam Lilley (first officer) and Capt. Jonathan Campos. The article mentions "one of the pilots would have been flying and guiding the aircraft toward the runway, while the other would have played a supporting role." But it doesn't specify who was flying. The question is about who was at the controls. Since the captain is usually in command, maybe Campos, but the article doesn't say. The text says "Capt. Jonathan Campos" as pilot in charge. So likely he was at the controls. But the article doesn't explicitly state. Hmm, but the question says "the CRJ700 during the final approach"â€”the article says "Capt. Jonathan Campos, had departed Wichita, Kan., on a small regional jet carrying 60 passengers and two other crew members." Since he was the pilot in charge, maybe he was flying. But the article doesn't explicitly say. Wait, the article says "one of the pilots would have been flying..." So maybe it's not specified. So answer N/A?

Wait, the article says "Capt. Jonathan Campos" as pilot in charge, so he might have been the one flying. But the text doesn't say for sure. Since it's not stated, maybe N/A.

Wait, the question is about who was at the controls. The article doesn't specify. So answer N/A.

3. **Seconds between "Traffic, traffic" and controller's instruction**: The article says "Seconds later, another transmission came through: Air traffic control was instructing the helicopter to pass behind the 'CRJ'..." So after the "Traffic, traffic" alert, which came right after the plane descended below 500 feet. The controller told the helicopter to pass behind after the traffic alert. The time between the alert and the instruction is "seconds". The question asks how many seconds. The article says "seconds later", but doesn't give a number. So answer N/A.

4. **Minimum visibility for Runway 33**: The article doesn't mention visibility requirements. It just says Runway 33 is shorter but suitable for regional jets. So N/A.

5. **Altitude of helicopter's first contact**: The article says the helicopter was informed of the plane's presence at about 1,200 feet. The radio transmission mentioned was when the plane was at 1,200 feet. So the helicopter's first contact with the controller about the plane was at that altitude. So answer 1,200 feet.

6. **Who acknowledged switching runways**: The pilots agreed to switch to Runway 33. The article says "the pilots in the American regional jet appeared to have acted as expected... Pilots can decline such a request, but after a brief discussion, Mr. Lilley and Mr. Campos agreed to the change." But who made the verbal acknowledgment? The article doesn't specify which pilot spoke. So N/A.

7. **Ground speed when below 500 feet**: The article doesn't mention ground speed. N/A.

8. **Previous incidents with military helicopters at Reagan**: The article doesn't mention past incidents. N/A.

9. **Helicopter's radio frequency**: The article says the helicopter was on a different frequency than the airplane. But which one? The controller was on both. The article doesn't specify the exact frequency. So N/A.

10. **Minutes before crash when Lilley did systems check**: The article doesn't mention when the last systems check was done. N/A.

11. **TCAS maneuver instructed**: The TCAS's most important feature (climb/descend commands) was suppressed at low altitudes. The system gave a "Traffic, traffic" alert but no instructions because the feature was off and the helicopter wasn't equipped with TCAS. So the answer is N/A because the system didn't instruct any maneuver. Wait, the question says "what maneuver did TCAS instruct Campos to perform immediately before the crash". Since the feature was suppressed, the answer would be "none" or N/A. Since the article says "the feature that instructs pilots on how to separate... would have been suppressed", so TCAS didn't give any instructions. So answer N/A.

12. **International destination after Wichita**: The article says Sam Lilley wanted to fly larger planes to international destinations, and had visited Japan, Ireland, Iceland. The CRJ700 was heading to Reagan National, not an international destination. The question asks what destination similar to those he visited was the plane headed for. But the flight was from Wichita to Washington (Reagan). So the answer is N/A because the flight wasn't international.

13. **Larger jet Campos hoped to pilot**: The article says Sam Lilley hoped to graduate to larger planes, but the question is about Captain Campos. Wait, the article says Sam Lilley was a first officer at PSA and wanted to fly larger planes. The question is about Captain Campos. The article doesn't mention Campos' goals, only Lilley's. So N/A.

14. **Instruction if helicopter had TCAS**: If the helicopter had TCAS, then the system would coordinate. Since they were on different frequencies, but if TCAS was active, the system would tell one to climb and the other to descend. The article says that feature is suppressed below a certain altitude, but if the helicopter had TCAS, maybe they would get instructions. The question asks what specific instruction would the helicopter pilots receive from ATC after the plane descended below 500. The article says the controller told the helicopter to pass behind. So even with TCAS, the controller's instruction would still be to pass behind. So the answer is "pass behind the CRJ".

15. **Altitude when controller informed helicopter**: The controller told the helicopter about the plane at 1,200 feet. So the plane was at 1,200 feet when that happened. The question says when the controller informed the helicopter of the plane's presence just south of the bridge, circling to the originally assigned runway (Runway 1). The plane was switching to Runway 33, but the info was given when the plane was at 1,200. So 1,200 feet.

16. **Alaskan airport compared to Reagan**: The article says "flying to there as challenging as flying in, say, Alaska". The professor compared it to an airport in Alaska known for challenging approaches. But the article doesn't name a specific airport. So N/A.

17. **Helicopter's response when asked if they had the plane in sight**: The article says the controller asked the helicopter pilots if they had the plane in sight. The pilots couldn't be heard by the airplane because on different frequencies. The article doesn't state their response. So N/A.

18. **Other crew members**: The flight had 60 passengers and two other crew members besides the pilots. The question asks their names. The article doesn't mention their names. So N/A.

19. **Landmark between White House and Capitol**: The article mentions avoiding White House, Capitol, National Mall, vice president's residence. The NTSB's preliminary findings aren't detailed, but the crash was near the Potomac. The National Mall is between White House and Capitol. So the answer is National Mall. But the question says "just before the collision, according to NTSB's preliminary findings". The article says the helicopter was south of the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge. The bridge is near the Potomac. The National Mall is a landmark between the two, so maybe that's it. The article says "the N.T.S.B. said over the weekend, citing black box data... the radio transmission... just south of the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge at about 1,200 feet". The specific landmark between WH and Capitol is the National Mall, so answer National Mall.

20. **System monitored by Campos**: The article says "one pilot is looking straight ahead, the other focusing inside... monitoring plane systems." Since Campos was the captain, maybe he was monitoring. The question is what specific system. The article doesn't mention which system. So N/A.

Now, let me go through each again carefully.

1. 33 minutes. The descent started at 8:15, crash at 8:48. 33 minutes. So 33.

3. N/A (seconds but no number).

4. N/A (no visibility info).

5. 1,200 feet.

6. N/A (no specific pilot's name given).

7. N/A.

8. N/A.

9. N/A (frequency not given).

10. N/A.

11. N/A (since TCAS didn't instruct anything).

12. N/A (flight wasn't international).

13. N/A (question is about Campos, article only mentions Lilley's goal).

14. "pass behind the CRJ".

15. 1,200 feet.

16. N/A (no specific airport named).
