Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks for the percentage of first-time home buyers in Milwaukee who used "stacking" to get at least $20k in assistance, according to Acts Housing's data mentioned by Ms. Kemp. The article mentions Ms. Kemp gave an example where a buyer got $19,500 through stacking, but there's no specific percentage stated about how many used it successfully. So the answer should be N/A.

2. The second question is about a veteran qualifying for both VA and USDA zero-down programs. The article says these programs allow zero down, but if they qualify for both, would they need to contribute more? The text doesn't mention any requirement for an additional down payment beyond what's stated. The standard first-time buyer average is 9%, but since both programs allow zero down, the answer might be N/A. Wait, the question is about what DPA One recommends. The tool helps find programs, but there's no info on recommending extra down payment. So N/A.

3. Chase's max grant is $7,500. The median home price is $400k. If a buyer in a majority-Latino area gets Chase's max plus a city program like Milwaukee's (which gave $19,500 total with city help), assuming they can "stack" Chase and the city's max. Let's see: Milwaukee's case had $19,500 total, but how much was from city? The example mentions federal, private, and city. If the city program's max is part of that, maybe the Chase $7,500 plus the city's portion. If the city program's max is, say, part of the $19,500, but we don't know exact figures. The question asks for the highest possible percentage. If they get Chase's $7,500 plus the city's max, say another $12,000 (as in the example?), total would be $19,500. That's 4.875% of $400k (since 19500/400000=0.04875). But the question says "highest possible percentage," so maybe if they can get more? The article doesn't specify maximums for the city program beyond the example. So the answer might be 4.875%, but since the example is $19,500, which is 4.875%, that's the figure. But the question says "Chase's assistance" alone? Wait, the question says "solely through Chase's assistance" but also qualifies if they also qualify for a city program. Wait, the question says "cover solely through Chase's assistance" but also "qualify for the maximum under a city program similar..." Hmm. Maybe the city's program is separate, so the Chase grant alone is $7,500. 7,500 /400,000 is 1.875%. But the question says "combined" with the city program? Wait the wording is a bit confusing. Let me re-read. "What is the highest possible percentage of a home's value that a first-time buyer... could cover solely through Chase's assistance, assuming they also qualify for the maximum amount under a city program..." Wait, "solely through Chase's assistance" but also "assuming they qualify for the city program". Maybe the Chase grant is separate, so the Chase part alone is 1.875%. But the question might be asking for the total including both, but the wording says "solely through Chase's assistance". Hmm, tricky. Since the question specifies "solely through Chase's assistance", then the answer would be 1.875%. But the example in Milwaukee had $19,500 from multiple sources, so maybe the city program's max plus Chase's max would be higher? Wait, Chase's max is $7,500. If the city program's max is like $12,000 (as part of the example's $19,500), but the question is about Chase's alone. I think the answer is 1.875% but the question might have a different angle. Alternatively, maybe the city program's max is separate. Since the question says "Chase's assistance, assuming they also qualify for a city program", but the Chase part is only their $7,500. So the answer is 1.875%. But the article says Chase offers up to $7,500, so that's 7500/400000=1.875. So answer is 1.875%.

4. The question asks how many more programs beyond the Urban Institute's 1,600 does DPA One include outside DC. The article states DPA One has info on ~800 programs in 50 states + DC. The Urban Institute found over 1,600. So DPA One has fewer, so the answer would be N/A because it's not more. The question says "how many more beyond those identified by Urban Institute"—so since DPA has fewer, the answer is N/A.

5. The question is about the typical value Acts Housing secures in Houston based on Ashley Moore's example and the Milwaukee case. The Milwaukee example had $19,500. But Ashley Moore works in Houston, and the question mentions extrapolating from Milwaukee. The article doesn't give Houston-specific numbers. So N/A.

6. The question projects the average down payment percentage if rates hit 8.04% (from 7.04%). The article says the 2024 average was 9% with rates at 7.04%. If rates go up further, maybe the down payment would be harder, but the article doesn't provide a linear relationship. Since there's no data on this, answer N/A.

7. Latoya's payment difference if she bought earlier when rates were lower. The article says rates this week rose to 7.04%, so before that might have been lower. But no previous rate is given. So N/A.

8. The question asks for the percentage of repeat buyers using gifts from non-immediate family. The NAR data says 8% of all buyers (and 21% of first-time) used gifts. The question specifies repeat buyers, which would be the remaining 80% of buyers (since 21% of first-time, which are a subset). But the article doesn't break down repeat vs first-time for the 8%. So N/A.

9. How many states beyond DC are not covered by DPA One's 800 programs. The tool covers 50 states and DC, so all states are included. The question asks how many states (excluding DC) are not covered. Since all 50 are covered, the answer is 0.

10. The cities named in Latoya's example are Milwaukee and the city program there. The article mentions her case in Milwaukee, so the two cities might be Milwaukee and another? Wait, the example says "a city program", so maybe Milwaukee is the only one. The question asks for two cities, but only Milwaukee is named. So N/A.

11. The Chase grant of $7,500 at 7.04% for a $400k home with 3% down. The loan amount would be 97% of 400k = $388k. Monthly payment: principal + interest. But the question is how many months the $7,500 would cover the mortgage payments. Let's compute monthly payment: 388,000 at 7.04% over 30 years. The monthly payment formula is P*(r(1+r)^n)/((1+r)^n -1). r is 7.04%/12 ≈0.00586667, n=360. Calculating this would take time, but perhaps approximate. Let's see, 388k at 7% would be roughly around $2,500/month. But exact value isn't in the article. Since the article doesn't provide the exact monthly payment, we can't calculate the months. So N/A.
