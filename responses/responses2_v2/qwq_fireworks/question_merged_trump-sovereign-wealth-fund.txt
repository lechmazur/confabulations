Okay, I need to tackle these questions based solely on the provided article. Let me go through each question one by one and see what the article says.

1. The first question asks which Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund Trump cited as a model for financing tech startups via the Vision Fund. The article mentions Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) investing $40 billion in SoftBank's Vision Fund, which then invested in startups like WeWork. Trump did say he wants to catch up to the PIF, so the answer should be Saudi Arabia's PIF.

2. The second question is about how much Lutnick calculated from equity stakes in vaccine companies. The article quotes Lutnick saying if the government bought vaccines, they should have equity or warrants. But there's no specific amount mentioned, so N/A.

3. The third question asks for the percentage of the $5.3 trillion assets immediately available. The Treasury has $5.3 trillion, with $922.2 billion in cash. The article doesn't say what percentage is transferable, so N/A.

4. The fourth question is about an Asian fund's strategy for domestic infrastructure. The article mentions Singapore using budget surpluses but doesn't link their strategy to Trump's domestic focus. The PIF is Middle Eastern, so maybe N/A.

5. The fifth question on natural resource revenue. The article says the U.S. lacks significant natural resource revenue. They mentioned tariffs but not as the primary like Middle Eastern funds. So N/A.

6. Tariff proceeds projected by Bessent? The article says Trump mentioned tariffs in September but the news conference didn't mention them. No specific number, so N/A.

7. Rate of return forecast? The article doesn't mention any return rate, so N/A.

8. Which agency manages operations? The executive order mentions Treasury and Commerce reporting, but no agency designated for day-to-day. So N/A.

9. Minimum investment threshold by Lutnick? The article doesn't specify a number, so N/A.

10. State pension funds partnering? The article doesn't mention any state funds agreeing, so N/A.

11. Natural resource revenue source? The article says the U.S. doesn't have significant natural resources like others. The primary funding isn't specified as any resource, so N/A.

12. Saudi PIF's amount Trump cited. The article states PIF has ~$925 billion. Trump said they're large and wants to catch them, so $925 billion.

13. Number of funds since 2010. The article says 40 since 2005. Since 2010 would be less, but the text doesn't specify, so N/A.

14. Private company example by Lutnick. He mentioned TikTok or private companies, but specifically named vaccine companies. The example given is vaccine companies, but the exact name isn't stated. So N/A.

15. DOD's missile stockpiles percentage. The article says $423B in inventory (DOD's), part of $5.3T. To find percentage: 423/5300 â‰ˆ 8%, but exact figure not given. So N/A.

16. Legislative body needed for redirecting funds. The article says fund requires an act of Congress, so Congress.

17. Deadline date. Bessent said 12 months, but no specific 2024 date given, so N/A.

18. Existing program's surplus as source. The article doesn't name a specific program's surplus, so N/A.

19. Migrant facilities repurposed? The article says migrants are held there but not that the facilities are for the fund. So N/A.

Alright, let's put these together.
