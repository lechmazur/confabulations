Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the provided article and answer exactly based on the text. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question is asking which Welsh folk songs Terfel performed during his holiday video recital. The article mentions he did a pandemic-era recital from a cathedral in Wales, but the specific songs aren't listed. It does say later he has a program of Beethoven's arrangements of Welsh folk songs, but that's a different context. So the answer here is N/A.

2. The second question asks how many performances Terfel did in the Lepage Ring before his vocal surgery. The article says his Met's Ring cycle was in 2010-12 and then he started reducing opera engagements. The vocal polyp surgery was in 2017. But the article doesn't mention the number of performances. So N/A.

3. Emma Thompson's role in Sweeney Todd. The article states he did a semi-staged Sweeney Todd "alongside Emma Thompson" with the NY Philharmonic. The role isn't specified, but the standard roles are Mrs. Lovett or the Judge. Since it's not mentioned, answer N/A.

4. The question about which act of Tosca the blocking change happened. The article mentions the knife scene and Tosca's hands, but doesn't specify the act. N/A.

5. The cathedral name where his pandemic recital was. The article only says "a cathedral in Wales" without naming it. N/A.

6. Number of times he performed Papageno at the Met. The article doesn't mention Papageno performances at the Met, only that he's interested in it now. So N/A.

7. Year he won Cardiff Singer. The article says 1989. That's clear.

8. Conductor for his Figaro debut. The article doesn't name the conductor here. N/A.

9. Recovery time after triple fracture. The article mentions a triple fracture kept him out of Hollander but doesn't say how long recovery took. N/A.

10. Number of Leporello performances between debut and final Ring. The article says he played Leporello but no numbers. N/A.

11. Years between Angelotti and Scarpia. He was in Angelotti in 1992, and Scarpia's final performances are now (article mentions 2023?), but the article doesn't say when he first did Scarpia. So N/A.

12. Vocal quality in the Ring cycle. Pappano says by 2010-12 (Ring time), his voice became more baritonal, focused, with "beef around that focus". So the answer is "more focused and baritonal" or similar.

13. Architectural feature of the Welsh cathedral. The recital was in a cathedral, but the article doesn't mention specific features. N/A.

14. Emma Thompson's role that mirrored his darker projects. The Sweeney Todd was semi-staged, so her role there, but the question is about after his shift. The article says after reducing opera, he did Sweeney with her, so maybe Mrs. Lovett? But the question is about her role mirroring his exploration. Since the article says "semi-staged 'Sweeney Todd' alongside Emma Thompson", her role is likely Mrs. Lovett, but since the article doesn't specify, maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "after his focus shifted away from traditional opera engagements", so the answer is Sweeney Todd's Mrs. Lovett? But since the article doesn't explicitly name it, maybe N/A. Hmm, tricky. The question says "what role did Emma Thompson take on that mirrored..." Since the article doesn't state her role, answer N/A.

15. The traditional music from his album. The article says he's doing a concert version of his album which is Scottish, Irish, and Welsh folk songs arranged by Beethoven. So the answer is "sea shanties" no, wait, the album is folk songs, but the concert version is of his most recent album which is sea shanties. Wait: "developing a concert version of his most recent album, a program of sea shanties." So the answer is "sea shanties".

16. The contrasting roles he found intriguing: Wozzeck (tortured) and Papageno (fun-loving). The composers are Berg and Mozart. The question is which composer's work had the greatest contrast. Since the two roles are from different composers, the answer is "Berg" and "Mozart" but the question asks which composer's work presented the contrast. Since they are different composers, the contrast is between them, but the question says "which composer's work" so maybe the answer is "Berg" and "Mozart" but the options are not given. Wait, the question says "which composer's work presented the greatest contrast in character portrayal". Since he's considering two roles by different composers, the answer would be both, but the question wants the composer whose work (i.e., one of them) is contrasting. Alternatively, the contrast is between the two roles from different composers, so the answer is "Berg's 'Wozzeck' and Mozart's 'Magic Flute'" but the question asks for the composer. The question probably expects the two composers, but since the options aren't given, maybe the answer is "Berg and Mozart", but the instructions say to answer directly. The article says "they could hardly be more different: the tortured title soldier in Berg's 'Wozzeck' and the fun-loving Papageno in Mozart's 'The Magic Flute'." So the composers are Berg and Mozart. The question is asking which composer's work presented the greatest contrast, so both. But the answer expects one? Maybe the question is about the two composers, so the answer would list both, but the question says "which composer's work", singular. Maybe the contrast is between the two composers, so the answer is "Berg and Mozart".

17. The physical action during rehearsal that caused humor. The article says Terfel knelt to retrieve the shawl and moaned about his knees. So the answer is "kneeling to retrieve Tosca's shawl".

18. Other Wagner production affected by injuries besides Hollander. The article mentions the 2010-12 Ring cycle, but he started reducing after that. The injury that kept him away from Met for 13 years included the 2017 Tosca (polyp) and 2020 Hollander (ankle). The other Wagner was the Ring? But the question asks which Wagner production was impacted by setbacks leading to his absence. The article says after the Ring, he started cutting back. The Hollander was one, but the other might be the Ring? Wait, the question is besides Hollander, which other Wagner production was affected. The article says he was set to return in 2017 Tosca but had to drop out, but that's Puccini. The other Wagner was the Hollander and maybe the Ring? But the injuries that caused absence were the polyp and the ankle. The Ring was before the injuries. So maybe the answer is N/A? Or perhaps the article mentions another? Let me check again. The article says "he was set to come back to the Met as Scarpia when its current 'Tosca' opened in 2017. But after arriving, he dropped out to have a polyp removed... In early 2020, he was supposed to star in the Met's first new staging in over three decades of Wagner's 'Der Fliegende Hollander,' but fell in Spain, broke his ankle..." So the other Wagner production was the Hollander, but the question asks besides that, so maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "other Wagnerian production was significantly impacted by Terfel's physical setbacks, leading to his extended absence from the Met". The extended absence of 13 years? The Met absence started in 2010? Wait, the article says he was away for 13 years before returning now. The polyp in 2017 and ankle in 2020. Maybe the Hollander is the only Wagner one. So the answer is N/A? Or maybe the Ring? No, the Ring was part of his active time. Hmm. The question might be referring to the Hollander as the Wagner one, but the question is besides that. So N/A.

19. Aspect of McVicar's Tosca production Terfel praised. The article says he was going through McVicar's production and mentioned that Scarpia can have a smile then a snarl. The praised aspect is the interplay between suavity and menace, so the answer is "the interplay between outward appearance and underlying menace".

20. Year of his NY Philharmonic Sweeney Todd. The article says the Sweeney Todd originated with the NY Philharmonic in 2014, then went to London. So the answer is 2014.
