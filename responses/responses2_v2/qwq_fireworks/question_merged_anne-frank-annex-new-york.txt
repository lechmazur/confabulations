Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge.

1. **Question 1**: The question is about the material used for the model of Peter van Pels' pet carrier. Scanning the article, I found a mention: "a model of the pet carrier is in the reconstructed spaces". The article doesn't specify the material, so the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The number of languages for Anne's diary editions. The article states "79 editions in different languages". So the answer is 79.

3. **Question 3**: The other New York institution hosting events. The text mentions the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) in the last paragraph under "A.I. Art at BAM". But wait, the question is about events related to Anne Frank. Looking again, the article says the Center for Jewish History is the main venue. The public programs are at the Center for Jewish History. The question might be a trick here. Wait, the question says besides the Center for Jewish History, which other New York institution? The article mentions "The Brooklyn Academy of Music debuted Techne..." but that's a different exhibit. The Anne Frank events like interviews are at the Center for Jewish History. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Wait, the question says "hosting events related to Anne Frank, such as interviews with authors like Ruth Franklin and Alice Hoffman". The article says the Center for Jewish History will host a film series and has the exhibition. The specific programs like Ruth Franklin's interview are at the Center. The other institutions mentioned in the last paragraph (MoMA, Hauser & Wirth) are separate. So the answer might be N/A, but the article says "the Center for Jewish History" is the main venue. The question asks for another institution besides it? Wait, the question says "other New York institution", but the article only mentions the Center for Jewish History as the venue. Maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "the Center for Jewish History will also host a film series". So the answer is the Center for Jewish History itself, but the question says "besides" that. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, the question might be referring to the Brooklyn Academy of Music, but that's for a different exhibit. So the correct answer is N/A because the only venue mentioned for Anne Frank events is the Center for Jewish History.

4. **Question 4**: The architectural feature separating the introductory rooms from the annex. The article mentions "the annex is behind a reproduction of the bookcase that covered its entry". So the answer is the bookcase.

5. **Question 5**: Percentage of millennials/Gen Z who could name Bergen-Belsen. The article states "almost half could not name a single concentration camp or Nazi-era Jewish ghetto". But the question asks specifically about Bergen-Belsen. Since the article doesn't mention the percentage for Bergen-Belsen specifically, the answer is N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The object in Auguste's room symbolizing hope. The article says Auguste hung a festive black dress, an original artifact never displayed before. The kindergarten photo animation includes the classmates. The festive dress might symbolize hope. The answer is the festive black dress.

7. **Question 7**: The 1955 play. The article mentions "the debates about the play from 1955, or the film of '59". The film of '59 is likely "The Diary of Anne Frank" (1959 film). The play from 1955 is also called "The Diary of Anne Frank" by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett. So the answer is "The Diary of Anne Frank".

8. **Question 8**: The city other than New York mentioned as a future venue. The article says "more venues will be announced in the spring" but doesn't name any other city. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Weekend ticket price for under 18. The article says "$16 tickets for weekday visits by those under 18". It doesn't mention weekend prices. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Digital technique for the classroom photo. The article says "animation" where the children turn into silhouettes. The technique is animation.

11. **Question 11**: Published item with multiple language editions. The diary itself has 79 editions. The question refers to a singular item, so the answer is the diary.

12. **Question 12**: Artifact never displayed before. Auguste's festive black dress is mentioned as an original artifact never before displayed. So that's the answer.

13. **Question 13**: Cartographic element on the glass floor. The article says the glass floor has a map of Europe with flags marking death camps. The element is the map of Europe.

14. **Question 14**: Credited for the design challenge. The article mentions Eric Goossens as the exhibition's designer working with Brink. So Eric Goossens.

15. **Question 15**: Commemorative day opening. The exhibit opens on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, Jan 27.

16. **Question 16**: Central narrative contrast. The contrast is innocence (smiling photo) vs loss (disappearing silhouettes). Answer is innocence and loss.

17. **Question 17**: Childhood image framing the storyline. The kindergarten photo of Anne is the start, so Anne Frank.

18. **Question 18**: Program referencing past debates. The public programs mention debates about the 1955 play and present-day controversies. The program is the public programs at the Center for Jewish History.

19. **Question 19**: Founder of the organization for online resources. Michael S. Glickman is the founder of jMUSE, which advises the show and plans online resources. So his name.
