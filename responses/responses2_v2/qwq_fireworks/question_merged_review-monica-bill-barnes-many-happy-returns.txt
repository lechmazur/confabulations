Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and don't assume anything beyond that.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions an audience memberâ€™s hat from Italy. Wait, the text says Saenz de Viteri borrowed a hat that was bought during a trip to Italy. But does it specify the city? Let me check again. The text says "the hat was purchased during a trip to Italy." No city is mentioned, so the answer should be N/A. 

2. **Question 2:** The three friends are Mykel Marai Nairne, Indah Mariana, and Flannery Gregg. The question asks which one has a solo with a yoga mat and Judy Garland. The article says in the duets, they balance yoga mats on their heads and lip-sync to "Islands in the Stream." Judy Garland's song isn't mentioned here. Wait, the Judy Garland is part of the soundtrack earlier. The yoga mats are in the duets with the three friends, but the solo isn't specified. Since it's a duet, maybe none have a solo. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The article mentions flowers are handed out, but no specific type is named. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The closing dance is to "(Nothing but) Flowers" by Talking Heads. That's the new wave band. So answer Talking Heads.

5. **Question 5:** The character sings a Billy Joel song a cappella. The question asks whose composition that is. Billy Joel's, so answer Billy Joel.

6. **Question 6:** The hat is a paper fedora from Italy. The article says "paper" and "Italy trip," so the headwear is a fedora. Answer fedora.

7. **Question 7:** The article mentions Maria Tallchief, the prima ballerina celebrated by NYCB. So answer Maria Tallchief.

8. **Question 8:** The mind/voice is Saenz de Viteri. So Robbie Saenz de Viteri.

9. **Question 9:** The article says "Movement, we learned earlier in the piece, may not be permanent, but its afterimage is lasting. And, just like the cost of admission for this show, dreaming, courtesy of Blondie, is free." The abstract concept implied here is "dreaming."

10. **Question 10:** The venue is like a school gym. The text says "space dressed up as if for a dance in a school gymnasium." So school gymnasium.

11. **Question 11:** The climax uses Blondie's "Dreaming." Blondie is the band. Wait, the question says "punk-inspired legacy" and "aspiration." The track at the end with the group dance is Blondie's "Dreaming." So answer Blondie.

12. **Question 12:** The three friends join Barnes. The text says "three friends from her past" and in the duets, "they're twins bound by movement." So during one of the choreographed sequences, how many join? The three friends, so 3. But the question says "how many friends join the central performer on stage during one of the choreographed sequences?" The answer is 3.

13. **Question 13:** The dance style mentioned is West Coast Swing, descended from Lindy Hop. The article says "West Coast Swing, a style that participants call addictive and innovative. Descended from the Lindy Hop." So answer West Coast Swing.
