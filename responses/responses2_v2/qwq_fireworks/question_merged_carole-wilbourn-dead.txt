Okay, let me start by going through each question one by one and checking the article for answers. 

Question 1: The first cat Carole adopted after reading an ad in a Queens newspaper placed by her future husband David Wilbourn. Wait, the article says she adopted her first cat, Oliver, through an ad in The Village Voice. But the question mentions the ad was placed by her future husband. The article states she married David Wilbourn later, but the ad was hers, not his. So maybe this is incorrect. Since the article doesn't say David placed the ad, the answer would be N/A.

Question 2: How many cats did she treat with Reiki? The article mentions she treated a cat with Reiki after it was run through a dryer, but doesn't give a number. So N/A.

Question 3: The breed of her cat that replaced the canary Petey. The article says her first cat was a part-Siamese named Oliver. So the answer is part-Siamese.

Question 4: The book with Sobriety's case. The article mentions "Cats on the Couch" includes case studies like Sobriety who got Valium. So the title is "Cats on the Couch".

Question 5: University she transferred to after Bayside HS. The article says SUNY Albany first, then NYU. So NYU.

Question 6: Cost of a Maui house-call. The article says house visits in Manhattan were $400, but Maui isn't specified. So N/A.

Question 7: Success percentage for new partners. The success rate overall is 75-80%, but the question specifies new partners. The article doesn't break down by cause, so N/A.

Question 8: First cats-only hospital, founded by a Playboy bunny and vet. The hospital is The Cat Practice, co-founded with Dr. Rowan. She was a Playboy bunny earlier. So The Cat Practice.

Question 9: Sister who confirmed her death. The article says sister Gail Mutrux confirmed it. So Gail Mutrux.

Question 10: Pharma treatment for jealousy. The article mentions Valium for Sobriety, but that was for self-harm. For jealousy, maybe another? The article says she prescribed Valium in some cases but doesn't specify for jealousy. So N/A.

Question 11: Book analyzing Snoopy's case. The article says Snoopy's case is in "Cats on the Couch", so that's the title.

Question 12: Hospital co-founded in 1973 with Reiki and music. That's The Cat Practice again.

Question 13: Degree in veterinary psychology. The article says she studied human psychology and got a business education degree. No veterinary psychology degree mentioned. So N/A.

Question 14: Energy therapy for appliance trauma. Reiki is mentioned for the dryer incident. So Reiki.

Question 15: Breed of dog she kept. The article says she had a Siamese named Orion 2, and no dog. She treated dogs occasionally but didn't own one. So N/A.

Question 16: Unpublished manuscript on slipcovers and deserts. The article doesn't mention any unpublished works. So N/A.

Question 17: Psychologist cited for narcissism in cats. The article quotes her comparing cats to narcissists but doesn't name a specific psychologist. So N/A.
