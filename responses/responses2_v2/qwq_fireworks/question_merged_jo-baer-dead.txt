Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. Let's go step by step.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which New York gallery hosted Jo Baer's breakthrough exhibition with her signature black-bordered white canvases and colored lines in 1962. The article mentions her first solo show was at Fischbach Gallery. The specific work mentioned in the Guggenheim show was "Horizontals Flanking, Large, Green Line," but the question is about the breakthrough exhibition in 1962. Wait, the article says her first solo show was at Fischbach, but the Guggenheim's "Systemic Painting" was in 1966. The question mentions 1962, which isn't in the text. The article says she moved to NYC in 1960 and had her first solo show at Fischbach. The Guggenheim show was 1966. Since the article doesn't mention a 1962 exhibition at any gallery, the answer might be N/A. Wait, the question says "breakthrough exhibition featuring her signature black-bordered white canvases with colored lines in 1962". Since the Guggenheim's 1966 show included that work, but the solo show was at Fischbach. The article says "she had her first solo show at Fischbach Gallery". The question's year is 1962, but the article doesn't specify the year of the Fischbach show. Since the article doesn't mention 1962 for any gallery, the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe the solo show was in 1960s. The article says she moved in 1960, so maybe Fischbach is the answer even if the year isn't 1962? The question specifies 1962, so since the article doesn't mention that year for any gallery, answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many months did Jo Baer study medical illustration under her mother? The article says her mother enrolled her in art school around age 11, making her draw crabs or lobsters for medical illustration. But it doesn't specify the duration in months. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Title of Jo Baer's essay critiquing Abstract Expressionism leading to debates with Donald Judd. The article mentions her 1983 letter in Art in America where she declared she's no longer an abstract artist. The essay mentioned is "Mach Bands," a scientific one on stripes. The question is about a critique essay leading to debates with Judd. The article says she sparred with Judd and Morris in Artforum over media merits. But the essay mentioned is "Mach Bands," which is scientific, not critiquing Abstract Expressionism. The 1983 letter is the critique, but it's a letter, not an essay. So the answer might be N/A.

4. **Question 4:** European museum that bought "Glass Slippers" after moving to Amsterdam. The article mentions "Glass Slippers" from 1960 but doesn't say which museum bought it. The Stedelijk in Amsterdam had a survey in 1999, but the purchase isn't specified here. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Irish art collective she collaborated with in the Norman castle. The article says she lived in a Norman castle in County Louth, Ireland, but doesn't mention an art collective. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Number of paintings destroyed in the 1960s before being reconstructed. The article says her 2020 show included reconstructions from photos of work she destroyed in the 1960s. But the exact number isn't given. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Psychological theory from New School studies influencing her work. The article says she studied psychology at the New School, but doesn't name a specific theory. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Critic who called her transition "the most significant artistic transformation of the 1970s". The article doesn't mention any critic's declaration like that. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Average price comparison at Fischbach vs. male contemporaries. The article doesn't provide pricing details. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Orchid species she cultivated. The article mentions she collected orchids but doesn't state the number. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Artist who debated sculptors and used a thin green line in a diptych. The article says Jo Baer sparred with Judd and Morris, and her work included the green line. So the answer is Jo Baer.

12. **Question 12:** Figure who left minimalism for figurative work inspired by cave paintings. The article clearly states Jo Baer did this. So Jo Baer.

13. **Question 13:** Artist with Guggenheim inclusion, Whitney '75, and Pace Gallery reconstructions. The article mentions her Guggenheim in 1966, Whitney in 1975, and Pace Gallery in 2019 with reconstructions. So Jo Baer.
