Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the given article. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked without assuming anything beyond the text.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions Merle performed in "Company" (1970), then "Sweeney Todd" (1979). Between those, "Sweeney Todd" is next. The question asks which musical she was in between those two where she played opposite Angela Lansbury. Wait, the article says Angela Lansbury was in "Sweeney Todd" as Mrs. Lovett. So the answer should be "Sweeney Todd".

2. **Question 2:** She started at Marymount Manhattan College for about a dozen years (12) and got her degree in 2004. But when did she start? The article says "To make up for not having gone to college... she studied... receiving her bachelor's degree in 2004." Since her role in "Into the Woods" was in 1987, the time between 1987 and 2004 is 17 years, but the article says she studied for about a dozen (12) years. So the answer is 12.

3. **Question 3:** The Drama Desk Award was for her role as the Beggar Woman in "Sweeney Todd". The question asks the musical number she performed. The article says the critic noted her "crude sexual advances" but doesn't mention a specific song. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Ethel Merman wanted her to stay in the role of June after she substituted. So the role is June in "Gypsy".

5. **Question 5:** The article mentions the club in Detroit but doesn't state the attendance count. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The article says she became the full-time June in 1960 and played it for more than a year. But how many performances? No specific number given. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Salary increase? The article doesn't mention any figures. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The article doesn't mention her audition song for Sondheim. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Running time of her performance as the Giant? The article doesn't specify. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Number of understudies she mentored? Not mentioned. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The role she took over after Ethel Merman's endorsement was June in "Gypsy", which she played for over a year. The question mentions a legendary leading lady (Merman) endorsing her. So the answer is June.

12. **Question 12:** She studied psychology. The answer is psychology.

13. **Question 13:** She played Madame Armfeldt in "A Little Night Music" at North Shore. The article mentions a correction about the song "Send in the Clowns" being sung by her daughter's character. So the role is Madame Armfeldt.

14. **Question 14:** She grew up in Bethlehem, PA, known for Bethlehem Steel. So Bethlehem.

15. **Question 15:** The musical she nearly joined was "Four Dolls on a Dime".

16. **Question 16:** The Drama Desk Award was for "Sweeney Todd".

17. **Question 17:** She dropped her surname Letowt after "Gypsy". So Letowt.

18. **Question 18:** The article says she dropped her surname after "Gypsy", but the reason isn't stated. Maybe her stage name Merle Louise? The question asks the family name she discarded. The answer is Letowt, but the reason might be her original family name. The question is about the name, not the reason. So answer Letowt.

19. **Question 19:** The touring production was "Gypsy" in Detroit where Merman sang. So "Gypsy".

20. **Question 20:** Later phase, after Sondheim works, she was in "Billy Elliot: The Musical" (2008). That's listed in her Broadway roles post-Sondheim. So "Billy Elliot: The Musical".
