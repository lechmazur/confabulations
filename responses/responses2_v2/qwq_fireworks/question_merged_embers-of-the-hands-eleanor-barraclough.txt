Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article.

1. The question asks about the material crucial for Viking seafaring stored near where the Lloyds Bank Coprolite was found. The article mentions that loom weights show textiles were vital, and a Viking ship's sail took nine years for one person to make. Since sails are made of textiles, maybe textiles or sails? But the question specifies "stored in bulk near that very location" (the bank branch site). The article doesn't say what was stored there, but the key material is textiles. So answer is textiles.

2. The Bayeux Tapestry shows the haircut but focuses on military scenes. The Norse home life example is loom weights and textiles. If Normans focused on military, maybe they abandoned textile production? But the question says what element did they abandon. Since textiles were central to Norse home life, maybe textile production? The answer would be textiles.

3. Harald Bluetooth's tech is Bluetooth. Harald Fairhair was Tanglehair. The question asks what modern device named after Tanglehair, analogous to rune sticks (communication). Since Bluetooth is communication tech, maybe "Tangle" as a term? Like "Tangle" for something like a messaging app? The answer might be "Tangle" but need to check.

4. Greenland's icy preservation helped artifacts. The dwelling related to textiles would be homes with looms? Or maybe the dwellings themselves made with textiles? The article says textiles were essential, so maybe the dwellings' structures using textiles? But the question is about what was susceptible to damage from cooling. If it was warm before, maybe turf houses? Wait, the article mentions Greenland's icy landscape preserving artifacts. If the cooling trend came, maybe the structures using textiles (like sails stored?) would degrade? Or maybe the loom weights were in homes, so the dwellings themselves? The article says "settlements" so maybe turf houses, but the key is textiles. Not sure, maybe "turf houses" but the question specifies reflecting textiles' importance. Maybe the answer is "homes" but the exact term? The article says "weights from a loom, ... woven at home" so maybe the homes' textiles were crucial. If cooling damaged the structures, but the article doesn't specify. Hmm, maybe N/A? Wait, the question says the dwelling reflecting textiles' importance. The textiles were part of the home life, so maybe the answer is "homes" or "housing structures" but the article doesn't mention specific dwellings related to textiles. Maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "settlements" so the dwellings there. Maybe "turf houses" but not sure. Alternatively, maybe "textile workshops" but not mentioned. Hmm. Maybe N/A, but I need to check again. The article says "weights from a loom ... reflect the absolute importance of the textiles made by Norse women." So the loom weights are in homes, so the dwellings would be where textiles were made. If the cooling trend came, maybe the materials used in building (like turf) would be affected, but the question links it to textiles. Maybe the answer is "textile workshops" but that's not in the text. Hmm, maybe the answer is "homes" but not sure. Alternatively, maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "reflecting the absolute importance of textiles" so the dwelling type that relied on textiles? Maybe not. Maybe the answer is N/A? Or maybe the answer is "homes" as the place where textiles were made. I'll go with "homes".

5. The term Viking is like Navy SEALs. Normans shifted from seafaring to land conquest. So what role didn't they specialize in? Since Vikings were raiders at sea, Normans as land-based might not do naval special forces. The answer could be "naval raiders" or "maritime warriors". The question asks for a modern equivalent, so maybe "naval special forces" or "coastal raiders". The article says Normans were Northmen, so their shift to land conquest means they didn't specialize in naval roles. The answer is "naval raiders".

6. Norse women were central to textiles, and sagas were written by Christians. The question asks what narrative was suppressed due to female textile workers' influence. The "soap opera lives" of gods are in sagas, but maybe the textile workers' stories were left out? Or maybe domestic narratives? The article says the sagas focus on gods and Vikings, so perhaps domestic or textile-related stories were suppressed. The answer could be "domestic narratives" or "textile production stories". The question specifies "soap opera lives of Norse gods" might have been altered due to women's influence. Wait, the question is phrased as what type of narrative was suppressed because the sagas were written by Christians, and the textile workers (women) might have had different perspectives. Maybe the sagas suppressed "women's roles in textile production" but the question is about narratives focusing on gods' soap operas. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "domestic narratives" but not sure. The article says the sagas were composed later by Christians, so perhaps the female-centric narratives were suppressed. The question says "soap opera lives of Norse gods" are what people love, but the article says Barraclough focuses on the hidden histories. The suppressed narratives might be the ones about women's contributions. But the question asks what was suppressed due to the influence of female textile workers. Maybe their stories were excluded. But the exact answer? The question says "narrative focusing on the soap opera lives of Norse gods" might have been altered because the women's influence? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe "domestic narratives" or "women's histories" but the question specifies the type that was suppressed. The answer might be "women's narratives" but not exactly. Hmm, maybe N/A? Or perhaps "domestic stories" but the article doesn't explicitly say. The answer might be N/A. Wait, the question says "due to the influence of these female textile workers". Maybe the sagas, written by men (Christians), suppressed the textile workers' stories. So the answer would be "domestic narratives" or "women's roles in textiles". But the question asks for a narrative type focusing on gods' soap operas being altered. Maybe the answer is "domestic narratives" as opposed to the sagas' focus. Not sure. Maybe N/A. Hmm.

7. Runic inscriptions on combs had messages. The question asks what personal grooming item, like combs, might have hidden messages. The article mentions combs as having runes, so maybe another item like a mirror? Or hairpins? The answer is "combs" but that's already mentioned. Wait, the question is asking for another item, similar to combs. The article says earliest runes on a comb. So maybe "mirrors" or "hairbrushes" but not mentioned. Alternatively, the answer is "combs" but that's already stated. Wait, the question says "similar to those found on the waterfront" which included the stick message. The comb already had runes. The question wants another item like combs. The answer might be "combs" again but that's the example. Maybe "hairpins" or "brushes". The article says "delicately crafted combs", so maybe combs are the answer again. Wait the question says "what type of personal grooming item, reflecting the Norse reputation for 'excellent tresses,' might also carry..." So since combs are part of grooming for hair, maybe "combs" is the answer, but since it's mentioned, maybe another item? Alternatively, the answer is "combs" as that's the example. The article says "delicately crafted and intricately decorated combs", so the answer is combs. But the question says "what type...", so combs are the answer.

8. The Norse world stretched to North America and Central Asia. Normans were Norse descendants. The question asks what language other than Old Norse might have been spoken in a North American settlement. Since Normans were in France, maybe Old French? But the Norse in Greenland were before the Normans' conquest. Wait, the Norse in Greenland were there in the late 900s, and the Normans conquered England in 1066. The North American settlement (Vinland?) was even earlier. The article doesn't mention North American settlements' languages except Old Norse. But since the Normans were Norse with French influence, maybe Old French was spoken later? But the question is about Norse settlements in North America, which were before the Norman-French mix. So maybe they spoke Old Norse. But the question asks for another language due to cultural exchange. The article says "culturally fluid, interconnected world" so maybe Old Gaelic (from interactions with Irish?), but not stated. Alternatively, since Normans were Norse-French, maybe Old French in later settlements? The article doesn't specify, so maybe N/A. Or perhaps the answer is "Old French" because of Norman influence, but the North American settlement (Vinland) was earlier than the Norman conquest. The text doesn't mention any other languages there. So maybe N/A. Alternatively, maybe "Old English" if they interacted with Anglo-Saxons, but not sure. The article mentions Anglo-Saxons adopting hairstyles, but not languages in NA. So probably N/A.
