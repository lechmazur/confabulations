Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by going through each question and see what the article says.

1. **Question 1:** How many subscribers did Netflix gain in Q3 2024 before implementing the price increases across their major markets?
   - The article mentions that in the final quarter (Q4) they added 19 million new subscribers. The price increases were mentioned as happening in the same period. Since Q3 is before Q4, the article doesn't specify Q3's numbers. So N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Which streaming platform outbid Netflix for the rights to stream "That Christmas" before Netflix acquired it?
   - The article doesn't mention any other platform outbidding them for "That Christmas". It just says it performed well on Netflix. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** What percentage of Netflix's total revenue came from their ad-supported tier during the record-breaking final quarter?
   - The article doesn't break down revenue by ad-supported tiers. Only mentions revenue increased by 16% and net income. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** How many minutes did the average Netflix viewer spend watching "Carry-On" during its first week of release?
   - The article states "Carry-On" was in the Top 10 but no viewing time per user. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** What was the primary reason cited by Greg Peters for the unexpected success of "It Ends With Us" on the platform?
   - Greg Peters said, "No single title drives our acquisition or engagement... It's really the whole service..." So the reason is the whole service's performance, not a single title. The answer is the whole service working.

6. **Question 6:** How much additional revenue did Netflix generate from the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight compared to their regular NFL programming?
   - The article mentions both had huge audiences but no specific revenue comparison. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Which major theater chain initially opposed Netflix's IMAX release strategy for "Narnia" before reaching an agreement?
   - The article says they partnered with IMAX, but doesn't mention opposition. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** What viewership milestone did Season 2 of "Squid Game" achieve in its first 24 hours of release?
   - The article says it will be one of the most-watched original seasons ever, but no specific 24-hour milestone. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** How many international markets will receive the price increase for premium memberships by the end of Q1 2025?
   - The price increases were mentioned in the US, Canada, Portugal, and Argentina. The question is about the number of markets for premium. The article lists four countries, so maybe 4? But the question says "international markets" excluding US? The article says "increased prices across most plans in the United States, Canada, Portugal and Argentina." So those four countries. But the question is about premium memberships specifically. The premium increased to $24.99. The countries listed are four. So the answer is 4? The question says "international markets", so excluding the US? Then Canada, Portugal, Argentina: 3? The article says "in the United States, Canada, Portugal and Argentina." So including the US, that's four. The question is about "international markets", so maybe 3. But the article doesn't clarify. Since the question asks for the number, and the countries listed are four, but US is domestic for Netflix's HQ? The article doesn't specify, so N/A.

10. **Question 10:** What was the total production budget allocated for Netflix's upcoming slate of original films including "Happy Gilmore 2" and "Frankenstein"?
    - No budget figures mentioned. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The article says they ended 2024 with 302 million subscribers, and added 19 million in Q4. The question asks for the subscriber addition that coincided with the strategies. The answer is 19 million.

12. **Question 12:** The question asks what content factor helped operating income exceed $10 billion. The article says programming in recent months that exceeded internal expectations (like Squid Game, Carry-On, Jake vs Tyson, NFL). So the answer is the programming that exceeded expectations.

13. **Question 13:** The CEO mentioned "release tactic" for publicity. The article says the IMAX release for "Narnia" and "Glass Onion" was a tactic to "prime the publicity pump". So the answer is the IMAX release.

14. **Question 14:** The company called full season sports acquisitions "extremely challenging" but part of longer-term plan? Wait, the article says "the company reiterated that it was 'not focusing on acquiring rights to larger season sports packages'". But the question says it's part of the longer-term plan? Wait, no. The article says "Though its recent entry into live programming has yielded some... the company reiterated that it was 'not focusing on acquiring rights to larger season sports packages'". So the answer is acquiring larger season sports packages.

15. **Question 15:** The US standard membership increased to $17.99 from $15.49. The question says which price change was symbolic. The article mentions the price increases, but the question asks which one was symbolic. Since the standard went up more, maybe that's the answer. The question says "what single price change... symbolic role in Netflix’s broader revenue strategy?" The standard membership's increase from $15.49 to $17.99 is $2.49. The answer is $2.49 increase? But the question asks for the price change. The exact change is $2.50? Wait, $17.99 - $15.49 is $2.50. So the answer is $2.50. Wait, the question says "what single price change for the U.S. standard membership is suggested to have played a symbolic role..." So the answer is the increase to $17.99, but the question is asking for the amount. The article says "the standard membership increased to $17.99 from $15.49". So the change is +$2.50. But the exact wording: "the standard membership increased to $17.99 from $15.49". The answer is $2.50? Or the new price? The question says "what price change", so the answer is $2.50.

16. **Question 16:** The film used as evidence that theatrical is a publicity tactic. The article mentions "Narnia" being released in IMAX theaters as a tactic, not a strategy shift. So the answer is "Narnia".

17. **Question 17:** Which country was paired with Canada and Argentina? The article lists "United States, Canada, Portugal and Argentina". So the third country is Portugal.

18. **Question 18:** The average monthly films watched is seven, which might lead someone to overestimate engagement. The question asks for the figure given. The answer is seven.

19. **Question 19:** Live programming event contributing to engagement. The article mentions the Jake Paul vs Tyson fight and NFL games. The question asks for the single event highlighted. The fight and NFL are both mentioned, but the question says "what single live programming event". The article says "both the 'Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson' fight and the N.F.L. games racked up huge audiences". Maybe the fight is the one highlighted? Or the NFL? The question says "highlighted as having contributed significantly"— the article says both. But the question asks for a single one. The article's exact wording: "the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight and the N.F.L. games racked up huge audiences". Since both are mentioned together, maybe N/A? Wait, the question is "what single live programming event was highlighted..." but the article mentions two. Since the question asks for a single, and the article groups them, perhaps N/A. Wait, but maybe the NFL on Christmas is mentioned again later. The article says "new films including... more N.F.L. on Christmas". So maybe the NFL games? Alternatively, the Jake Paul fight. The article says both contributed. The question might be expecting one, but since both are mentioned, perhaps N/A. Wait, the question says "what single live programming event was highlighted as having contributed significantly to subscriber engagement?" The article says both, so maybe the answer is N/A? Or perhaps the article's exact wording: "the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight and the N.F.L. games racked up huge audiences". So they are both mentioned as contributing. Since the question asks for a single, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the fight is considered the main one. Hmm. The article says both. Since the question requires a single, and the text groups them, I think the answer is N/A.

20. **Question 20:** 2025 priorities alongside ad revenue. The article says "Two of Netflix's official 2025 priorities are increasing ad revenue and developing more live programming". So the other is live programming.

Now, let me go through each again quickly to ensure accuracy.

1. N/A (no Q3 data)
2. N/A
3. N/A
4. N/A
5. "the whole service that's working"
6. N/A
7. N/A
8. N/A
9. The countries listed are four (US, Canada, Portugal, Argentina). The question is about "international markets", so excluding the US, that's 3. But the article doesn't specify, so maybe N/A. The article says "increased prices across most plans in the United States, Canada, Portugal and Argentina". The question asks how many international markets. If international excludes the US, then 3. But the question might count all four as markets. Since the question says "international markets", but the US is a country, so maybe the answer is 3? The article doesn't clarify, so safest is N/A.

Wait the question says "how many international markets will receive the price increase for premium memberships by the end of Q1 2025?" The price increases were already implemented in those four countries. The question is about how many international markets (so excluding the US?), so Canada, Portugal, Argentina: 3. But the article says "increased prices across most plans in the United States, Canada, Portugal and Argentina." So four countries total. The question is about the number for premium memberships. The premium was increased to $24.99. The countries listed include the US, so if the question counts all four as markets, then 4. But the term "international" usually means outside the home country (US). Since the question says "international markets", the answer would be 3. However, the article doesn't specify "international", just lists the countries. Since the user might expect the count as per the article's list, maybe 4? But the question specifies international, so likely 3. However, since the article doesn't clarify, perhaps N/A.

Hmm, tricky. I'll go with N/A for now.

10. N/A
11. 19 million (the question refers to the subscriber addition in the final quarter, which was 19 million)
12. "programming in recent months that exceeded internal expectations"
13. "IMAX release"
14. "acquiring rights to larger season sports packages"
15. The standard membership's increase was $2.50, so the price change is $2.50. But the question asks for the price change (the new price?), but the answer is the amount. The article says "increased to $17.99 from $15.49", so the change is $2.50. The question asks for the price change (the difference), so $2.50.
16. "Narnia"
17. Portugal
18. seven
19. N/A (since two events mentioned)
20. "developing more live programming"

Let me confirm each again quickly.

19. The question asks for a single live event. The article mentions both the fight and NFL games. Since they are both mentioned as contributing, and the question wants a single one, perhaps N/A.

20. The priorities are increasing ad revenue and developing more live programming. The other one besides ad revenue is live programming.

So final answers:

1. N/A
2. N/A
3. N/A
4. N/A
5. the whole service that's working
6. N/A
7. N/A
8. N/A
9. N/A
10. N/A
11. 19 million
12. programming in recent months that exceeded internal expectations
13. IMAX release
14. acquiring rights to larger season sports packages
15. $2.50
16. Narnia
17. Portugal
18. seven
19. N/A
20. developing more live programming
