Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to be careful and make sure I'm only using the information given.

1. The first question is about the year "Eat the Document" premiered. The article says it's the only world premiere this year, so the year should be the current year mentioned. The article starts by talking about this year's Prototype Festival, but the exact year isn't given. Wait, the article mentions "2022" in reference to "Black Lodge" being released as a film. But "Eat the Document" is a world premiere this year, which the article refers to as the current festival. Since the article's date isn't specified, but the premiere is mentioned as this year's festival, and the article is about the festival that ran through Sunday (current time when written), but without a specific year given in the text, maybe it's 2023? Wait, the article says "this year's Prototype Festival" and "2022" is mentioned for the film release. The question asks for the premiere year of the opera. The article states "the only world premiere this year was 'Eat the Document'..." So the answer is the current year of the festival, which the article refers to as "this year," but since the exact year isn't in the text, maybe it's N/A? Wait, but the question might not need the year. Wait, no, the question specifically asks for the year. Since the article doesn't state the current year (like 2023 or 2024), then the answer would be N/A. Wait, but the article mentions "2022" once for the film, but the premiere is this year's festival. Hmm, but since the article doesn't state the festival's year, perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "based solely on the facts in the text above". The text says "this year's festival" and the premiere was this year. Since the article doesn't state the actual year, but the question is about the opera's world premiere, which is this year's festival. Since the article doesn't give the actual year (like 2023 or 2024), then the answer must be N/A. Wait, but maybe the article mentions the year elsewhere? Let me check again. The first paragraph says "this year's Prototype" and "in 2022, 'Black Lodge' was released as a film". The premiere of "Eat the Document" is the only world premiere this year. Since the festival is current, but the article doesn't specify the year, the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe the question is a trick. Let me see the exact text: "The only world premiere this year was 'Eat the Document'..." So the answer is the year of the festival, which isn't given. Therefore, N/A.

2. The second question asks which opera, directed by Michael Joseph McQuilken, had a glam-rock band and explored themes like Arooj Aftab's cabaret. From the article, "Black Lodge" was directed by McQuilken and has Timur's band the Dime Museum (glam-rock). Arooj Aftab's performance is in Urdu with jazz and South Asian elements. The question is about an opera with similar themes? The article says Arooj's work is a cabaret, so the opera here is "Black Lodge". So answer: Black Lodge.

3. The third question is the Akutagawa story basis for the opera with a monk and medium, adapted by a composer known for rock guaguanco. The opera "In a Grove" is based on Akutagawa's story. The composer is Christopher Cerrone. The other part mentions the composer known for rock guaguanco is Sol Ruiz (Positive Vibration Nation is his). Wait, the question says "adapted by a composer known for..." So the opera's composer is Cerrone, but the question is looking for the title of the story, which is "In a Grove".

4. The fourth question: Dana Spiotta's novel that inspired the time-traveling Miami opera with Caribbean rhythms. The article says "Positive Vibration Nation" is a rock guaguanco opera about a future Miami time traveler. But the question says the opera is based on Spiotta's novel. Wait, "Eat the Document" is based on Spiotta's 2006 novel. The time-traveling Miami part is Sol Ruiz's "Positive Vibration Nation", which isn't based on the novel. Wait, the question is about the novel that inspired an opera with a time-traveler. The article says "Positive Vibration Nation" is the time-travel one, but the novel is Dana Spiotta's which is the basis for "Eat the Document". The question might have mixed elements. Let me check the text again. The novel by Dana Spiotta is the basis for "Eat the Document", which is about anti-Vietnam activists. The time-travel is in Ruiz's work. The question is asking for the novel that inspired an opera featuring a time-traveling citizen from future Miami. Since the novel's opera is "Eat the Document" (anti-Vietnam), then this might be a trick. But the question's details don't match. Wait, the question says the opera is the one with time travel and Caribbean rhythms. That's Sol Ruiz's "Positive Vibration Nation", but the novel isn't mentioned there. The Dana Spiotta novel is for "Eat the Document", so perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, the question is phrased as "inspired an opera featuring a character who travels through time from a future Miami...", but the novel is for "Eat the Document", which isn't about time travel. Therefore, the answer is N/A. But maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The article says "Positive Vibration Nation" is the time-travel one, but it's not based on the novel. The novel is for "Eat the Document". Therefore, the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "blending Caribbean rhythms with steampunk costumes"—that's Ruiz's opera. The novel is not related to that. So the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says the opera is based on the novel. Since the novel is for "Eat the Document", which isn't the time-travel one, the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong. Hmm.

5. The fifth question: the album by the artist who, like Black Lodge's composer, uses jazz and South Asian elements, and is a reluctant comedian. Arooj Aftab presented her Grammy-nominated "Night Reign" with Urdu and jazz/South Asian. The Black Lodge's composer is David T. Little, but the question refers to the artist who's a reluctant comedian (Aftab). So the answer is Night Reign.

6. The sixth question: composer who created a work like "Positive Vibration Nation" (intergenerational trauma, time-traveler). "Positive Vibration Nation" is by Sol Ruiz. The other work with similar themes? The article mentions "Telekinetik" by Khary Laurent, which deals with split consciousness of a Black man. But the question is about intergenerational trauma and healing. "Positive Vibration Nation" is about that. The composer would be Sol Ruiz. The question asks for the composer of another work with those themes? Wait, the question says "like Positive Vibration Nation" (so same themes) and "featuring a time-traveling citizen"—so the answer is Sol Ruiz. But the question is phrased as "the name of the composer who created a work that, like..., explored intergenerational trauma..." So Sol Ruiz.

7. The seventh question: opera with a movable pane of glass on a catwalk, written by the librettist who collaborated on a work about a Black man's split consciousness. The opera with the catwalk is "In a Grove" (the set has a narrow catwalk with movable glass). The librettist for that is Stephanie Fleischmann. The other work about split consciousness is "Telekinetik" by Khary Laurent. But the question asks for the opera that has the catwalk and the librettist who worked on the split-consciousness piece. Since the split-consciousness work is Telekinetik, whose librettist is not mentioned. Wait, the article says "Telekinetik" is by Khary Laurent (composer and librettist?), but the question is about the librettist for "In a Grove" (Stephanie) and whether she collaborated on Telekinetik? No, the article doesn't say. So maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the opera with the catwalk (In a Grove) and the librettist who also worked on Telekinetik? Since Telekinetik's librettist isn't named, the answer would be N/A. Hmm.

8. The eighth question: the object from Lynch's film (like Blue Velvet's ear) reimagined in "Black Lodge". The article says the festival had a tribute with the severed ear and crawling ants from Blue Velvet, appearing in "Black Lodge" as hallucinations. So the answer is a severed ear.

9. The ninth question: director's legacy undercurrent in dark hallucinations and gothic rock. The article starts by saying the festival has a Lynchian aesthetic for 12 years, with Lynch's death mentioned. So the answer is David Lynch.

10. Tenth question: voice in "Black Lodge" with golden falsetto to shriek. The article says Timur Bekbosunov's voice has those qualities. So Timur Bekbosunov.

11. Eleventh question: librettist for "Black Lodge" who used Burroughs and Lynch. The article says the libretto is by Anne Waldman, channeling Burroughs and Lynch. So Anne Waldman.

12. Twelfth question: locale transformed by wildfire in the opera with shifting perspectives. "In a Grove" is set in a 19th-century American forest devastated by wildfires. So the locale is a forest in 19th-century America.

13. Thirteenth question: opera with anarchist bookstore set and anti-Vietnam activists. "Eat the Document" is based on the novel about activists and has a single set of an anarchist bookstore. So the answer is Eat the Document.

14. Fourteenth question: composer facing amplification issues with pop/classical blend. The article about "Eat the Document" says Glover's music uses pop idioms, and the cast's pop vocals required amplification, causing issues with operatic singing. The composer is John Glover.

15. Fifteenth question: rock guaguanco opera with Caribbean rhythms and future Miami. "Positive Vibration Nation" by Sol Ruiz. The language is mostly Spanish. So the title is Positive Vibration Nation.

16. Sixteenth question: Pakistani American composer with Grammy-nominated album avoiding translations. Arooj Aftab presented "Night Reign" without translations. So her name.

17. Seventeenth question: hip-hop opera by Catapult Opera with Black man's conflict. "Telekinetik" by Khary Laurent. The answer is Telekinetik.
