Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked and avoid any assumptions beyond the text.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks which Federal Reserve official praised MicroStrategy's strategy during the Microsoft shareholder presentation. The article mentions Lee Reiners, a former Fed official, but he didn't praise it. Instead, Michael Saylor praised the effort, but he's not a Fed official. The text says the proposal was defeated. So no Fed official is mentioned here. Answer: N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Banzai's purchase amount after Nov 26. The article says they announced up to 10% of their $4.3M cash. But it doesn't say they spent the max immediately. So exact amount isn't stated. Answer: N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Rumble's stock surge percentage in the first week. The article states a 70% jump in the past month, not the first week. So time frame mismatch. Answer: N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Major investment bank recommending Bitcoin to Semler. The article says Eric Semler spoke with fund managers restricted from crypto, but no specific bank is named. Answer: N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Market cap of companies holding Bitcoin when Trump announced. The article mentions companies started buying as Trump promoted crypto, but total market cap isn't given. Answer: N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Microsoft's stock change after the vote. The article says the proposal was defeated, but no stock price change is mentioned. Answer: N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Interest rate trigger for Banzai. The article mentions inflation protection but no specific rate. Answer: N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Rumble board member who resigned. The article says Rumble's reps didn't comment, so no name given. Answer: N/A.

9. **Question 9:** MicroStrategy's holdings below $50k. The article states Bitcoin was ~$12k when they started and hit $100k, but percentage isn't specified. Answer: N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Investors moving from Reddit to MicroStrategy. The article says Reddit sold crypto but doesn't mention transfers to MicroStrategy. Answer: N/A.

11. **Question 11:** % of Microsoft shareholders voting yes after Reddit's divestment. The proposal got 0.5% in favor, but the question specifies after Reddit's move. Since the timing aligns (Microsoft vote mentioned after Reddit's sale), the answer is 0.5%. But the question says "influenced by Saylor's presentation" and "after Reddit had divested". The article says the proposal was opposed and got 0.5%. So answer is 0.5%.

Wait, but the question says "influenced by Michael Saylor's presentation" but the article states the proposal was defeated with 0.5% in favor. So the answer is 0.5%, but the question's phrasing is tricky. However, the exact number from the text is 0.5%, so answer is 0.5.

12. **Question 12:** Banzai's initial investment after restructuring. The company had $4.3M cash, allocated up to 10% per the Nov 26 announcement. So 10% of $4.3M is $430k. The question asks for the initial amount as per Joe Davy's proposal, which was up to 10%, so the exact number would be $430,000. But the question says "initial investment amount" – the proposal was up to 10%, so maybe $430k. The article says "up to 10% of the funds it held in its corporate treasury", so the answer is 10% of $4.3M, which is $430,000. So answer: 430.

13. **Question 13:** Regulatory change by Trump prompting Semler's shift. The article states Bitcoin surged in 2024 as Trump promised to ease regulation. Semler's company started investing then. So the answer is easing regulation. The question asks for the specific regulatory change, but the text only mentions "ease regulation" as the reason. So answer: easing regulation. But the question asks for the name of the change, but the article doesn't specify a name, so maybe N/A. Wait, the exact quote: "Bitcoin did not originate... soaring last year as Mr. Trump promised to ease regulation." So the specific regulatory change is "ease regulation" but there's no named policy. Since the question asks for the name, which isn't provided, answer N/A. Wait, the question says "specific regulatory change, promised by Trump" – the text says "ease regulation" but that's not a named policy. So N/A?

Hmm, maybe the answer is "ease regulation" as the specific change? But the question asks for the name, which isn't given. So probably N/A.

Wait, the question says "specific regulatory change, promised by Donald Trump" – the article says "soaring last year as Mr. Trump promised to ease regulation." So the regulatory change is "easing regulation". Since it's the exact phrase from the article, maybe that's acceptable. But the question wants the name of the regulatory change. Since it's not named, perhaps the answer is "N/A".

Alternatively, maybe the answer is "easing regulation" as the promised change. The question says "specific regulatory change", but the text doesn't name it. So N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Crypto company's investment caused Rumble's stock surge. The article says Rumble's stock rose 70% partly because of a major investment by Tether. So the answer is Tether.

15. **Question 15:** Company with similar stock increase as Semler. Semler's company rose over 80% in six months. The article mentions LM Funding's CEO Bruce Rodgers, but LM Funding's stock isn't mentioned. Wait, the article says Semler Scientific's stock rose over 80%, and the question asks for another company besides MicroStrategy. The article mentions Rumble's 70% surge, but that's not similar. Wait, the question says "due to its strategic shift towards accumulating Bitcoin, as stated by its CEO, Bruce Rodgers". Bruce Rodgers is from LM Funding, which holds over $14M in Bitcoin. The article states LM Funding shifted to mining Bitcoin, but their stock performance isn't mentioned. The question asks for a company besides MicroStrategy whose stock had a similar percentage increase. The only other one mentioned is Semler Scientific's 80% and Rumble's 70%. So maybe N/A?

Wait, the article says "Semler Scientific's share price has risen more than 80 percent over the past six months." The question asks for another company besides MicroStrategy (which had 2000% over four years, so not the same timeframe). The only other is LM Funding, but their stock isn't mentioned. So answer N/A.

Wait, the question says "due to its strategic shift towards accumulating Bitcoin, as stated by its CEO, Bruce Rodgers". The CEO of LM Funding is Bruce Rodgers. The article says LM Funding held over $14M in Bitcoin, but their stock performance isn't stated. The question asks for a company with similar percentage increase as Semler. Since LM Funding's stock isn't mentioned, answer N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Peak Bitcoin price when MicroStrategy started. The article says Bitcoin was around $12,000 when MicroStrategy began and hit $100k. The question asks for the peak price when they started, which would be $12k. But the question says "peak price of Bitcoin when MicroStrategy initially began". The starting price was ~$12k, so the peak then would be that. But the question's wording is confusing. The peak when they started is the starting point, so $12,000. The answer is 12 (in thousands). The question says "peak price... when MicroStrategy initially began its Bitcoin accumulation strategy". Since they started buying at $12k, that's the starting price, not the peak. The peak later was $100k. So the answer is N/A? Wait, the question is phrased as "peak price of Bitcoin when MicroStrategy initially began its strategy". The peak at the time they started was $12k. So answer is 12.

17. **Question 17:** Trade organization's name. The article mentions Naresh Agarwal from the Association of Corporate Treasurers. So the answer is Association of Corporate Treasurers.

18. **Question 18:** Shareholders' primary concern after reverse split. The article says Davy got calls from shareholders about "what the hell is going on over there? What are you thinking?" regarding Bitcoin. The reverse split and restructuring were mentioned before the announcement, but the concern about the split's impact on Bitcoin isn't specified. The question asks about the primary concern regarding the reverse split's impact on Bitcoin strategy. The text doesn't specify the concern was about that link, just that they were concerned about the Bitcoin plan. So answer N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Total investment by non-crypto companies. The article says "more than 70 publicly traded companies now invest in Bitcoin, including several that started buying as Trump promoted crypto last year. Many of those companies work directly in crypto, like Coinbase... the group is widening. ... other firms that have bought include... Tesla..." So excluding crypto companies, the total is not given. The article states "more than 70" but not the total amount. The question asks for the total amount in millions by non-crypto companies. Since the article doesn't provide this figure, answer N/A.

20. **Question 20:** Financial instrument Banzai considered. The article says Banzai considered using funds for acquisitions or buybacks, which are traditional uses. Naresh mentioned U.S. government bonds and money market funds. So the answer is U.S. government bonds (or money market funds). The question asks for the type, so the answer is U.S. government bonds.
