Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly as per the instructions.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks which coffee shop owner previously worked at Starbucks. The article mentions Suzanne Smith's son Andrew worked at Starbucks for two and a half years. But the owner here is Suzanne Smith, not Andrew. Wait, no, the owner is Suzanne, but she didn't work at Starbucks. Her son did. So maybe the answer is N/A because the owner didn't work there. Wait, the question is about the owner, so Suzanne didn't. Then maybe no one? Wait, check again. The article says "Her son Andrew taught Mr. Smith and her about coffee. He worked at Starbucks for two and a half years during college..." So the owner's son worked there, not the owner herself. So the answer would be N/A. But wait, maybe I missed someone else? Let me check others. Theresa Cashman? The article says she used a Minneapolis roastery, but not Starbucks. Rachel Nieves? No mention. So answer is N/A.

Wait, wait! Wait the question is about "coffee shop owner previously worked at Starbucks". The only mention of Starbucks is Suzanne's son, not the owner herself. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How much did Rachel Nieves invest in renovating her first coffee cart location before moving to the pool hall? The first location was inside a pool hall, so maybe the initial investment was the espresso machine and grinder. The article says they bought a Slayer espresso machine for $7,000 and got a grinder for free. Also, Nawrocki used skateboard parts for the countertop. The article says they "bought a used Slayer single-group espresso machine... $7,000 from Craigslist. The seller threw in a $2,300 grinder for free." So total spent here is $7,000. But the question is about renovating the first location. Since the cart was mobile and the pool hall was their first location, maybe the cost of the machine and grinder is part of that. So the answer would be $7,000 plus the grinder? Wait, the grinder was free. So $7,000. But maybe the article mentions other costs? The countertop was made from skateboards they repurposed, so that cost nothing. So total investment would be $7k. So answer is $7,000.

3. **Question 3:** Average daily revenue of Biscuits to Baskets during first six months after Keith Lee's visit. The article says before Keith Lee's visit, they were making $350-$420 daily. After, it was about $1,700 a day. But the question is about the first six months after. The article mentions that after the visit, their daily revenue went to $1,700 and stayed busy until July. The visit happened in April, so six months would take us to October. The article says "staying busy well into July." So maybe by July it started to decline? The article also mentions that after the garage was ordered to close, they bought a trailer. The exact six-month period's average isn't given. The article says after the visit, they made $1,700 a day, but doesn't specify if that continued for six months. Since the question asks for average during the first six months, but the text doesn't give exact figures beyond the increase, maybe it's N/A. Wait, the article says "the money had quadrupled, if not more." Before it was $350-420, so quadruple would be around $1400-1680. The $1,700 is mentioned. But the exact average over six months isn't stated. So answer is N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Which bank approved Theresa Cashman's loan after her marketing strategy? The article states she approached three banks, one lent her $350k with parents as co-signers. The name of the bank isn't mentioned. So answer N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Percentage of Out of the Box's first-year profits from specialty drinks. The article doesn't mention anything about the breakdown of sales. It mentions they had a recycled shipping container and saved costs, but no percentage given. Answer N/A.

6. **Question 6:** How many employees did Buddies hire during first year? The article says "they run the shop themselves" and don't take a salary. So maybe they didn't hire any employees. The answer would be 0? The question says "employees... to handle increasing demand". The article mentions they were doing pop-ups and moving locations but doesn't mention hiring staff. So 0.

7. **Question 7:** Initial chocolate-making equipment cost for Biscuits to Baskets. The article says Suzanne started selling chocolates from home in 2002, and her mom helped. But there's no mention of the cost of the equipment. Answer N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Months to break even for Rachel Nieves' first cart. The article states Buddies became profitable in its first year. But "break even" time isn't specified. The first year is 12 months, but the exact month isn't given. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Certification program Rachel Nieves completed. The article says she taught herself using Shared Roasting. No mention of a certification program. Answer N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Repurposed material from Colter Smith's previous job for signage. Colter Smith's previous profession? The article mentions he met Suzanne via Facebook's Hot or Not, but his job isn't stated. Wait, Suzanne's son used to work at Starbucks, but Colter's job isn't mentioned. The question says "Colter Smith's previous profession". The article doesn't mention Colter's job. So answer N/A.

Wait, the question says "repurposed material sourced from Colter Smith's previous profession". The article says Suzanne's son worked at Starbucks. Colter is her husband. The article doesn't say Colter's job. So answer N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Loan amount after donations for Smiths' renovation and trailer. The article says they took out loans for the rest, which they are still paying. The total costs were $8,400 (house) + $17,500 (trailer) = $25,900. They raised $7k via T-shirt drive and $3k from Keith Lee's donation, totaling $10k. So remaining is $25,900 - $10,000 = $15,900. But the article says "the family took out loans for the rest, which it is still paying." So the loan amount would be $15,900. But let me check numbers again. The article states converting part of the house cost ~$8,400 and the trailer ~$17,500. Total $25,900. They raised $7k + $3k (from Keith's donation) totaling $10k. So the remaining is $25,900 minus $10k = $15,900. The article says "the family took out loans for the rest," so the answer is $15,900. But the question asks for the specific dollar amount. The article might not give exact figures. Wait, the numbers are given as "nearly $14,000" for garage conversion, but the later costs are $8,400 and $17,500. Let me recount:

Original garage conversion cost was $14k (from 2018). Then, after Keith's visit, they bought a trailer costing ~$17,500 and converted part of the house back for $8,400. So total new costs after the visit would be $17,500 + $8,400 = $25,900. They raised $700 (T-shirt) + $3k (Keith's donation) + $7k (customer tips) = total $10,700. So the remaining would be $25,900 - $10,700 = $15,200. But the article says "the family took out loans for the rest, which it is still paying." The exact numbers are approximate, but the article mentions "$14,000" for garage, but that was earlier. The question is about the home renovation and trailer after Keith's visit. The $8,400 and $17,500 are specified. So $8,400 + $17,500 = $25,900. Donations: $700 (son's T-shirt) + $3,000 (Keith's donation) + $7,000 (tips) = total $10,700. Thus, remaining is $25,900 - $10,700 = $15,200. But the article says "around $7,000 was raised." Wait, the article says: "the son held a T-shirt drive... raising $700. Mr. Lee created a cash app account... totaling $3,000. Customers gave generous tips. Around $7,000 was raised." So total raised is $700 + $3k + $7k = $10,700. So the loan would be $25,900 - $10,700 = $15,200. But the question asks for the specific dollar amount. The article says "the family took out loans for the rest, which it is still paying." But the exact figure isn't given. The numbers are approximate. The article might not have the exact total, so maybe N/A. Wait, the $8,400 and $17,500 are exact figures, so total is $25,900. Subtract the raised funds ($10,700), so $15,200. Since the article gives those numbers, the answer is $15,200. But the question says "specific dollar amount". The article might not state it as a total. Let me check again. The article says: "Converting part of the house back to a business cost about $8,400. The trailer added about $17,500. To help with costs, Ms. Smith's son held a T-shirt drive... raising $700. Mr. Lee created a cash app account... totaling $3,000. Customers gave generous tips. Around $7,000 was raised. The family took out loans for the rest, which it is still paying." So total costs: $8,400 + $17,500 = $25,900. Total raised: $700 + $3,000 + $7,000 = $10,700. Thus, loans needed: $25,900 - $10,700 = $15,200. The question asks for the specific amount, so the answer would be $15,200. Since the numbers are given, this is calculable, so answer is $15,200.
