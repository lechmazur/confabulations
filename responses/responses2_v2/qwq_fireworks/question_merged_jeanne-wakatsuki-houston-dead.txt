Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly. Let's go through each question step by step.

1. **Question 1**: The award for the screenplay adaptation of "Beyond Manzanar: Views of Asian-American Womanhood". Wait, the article mentions the TV movie "Farewell to Manzanar" got an Emmy nomination and a Humanitas Prize. "Beyond Manzanar" is a collection of essays, so maybe the question is a trick? The screenplay in question is the one from "Farewell to Manzanar". The Humanitas Prize is mentioned here. So the answer is Humanitas Prize.

2. **Question 2**: Years between "Farewell to Manzanar" (1973) and the collaborative work about Vietnamese orphans, which is "Don't Cry, It's Only Thunder" (1984). 1984-1973 = 11 years. So 11.

3. **Question 3**: The journalism department head's discouragement. The article says she was discouraged while majoring in journalism for two years, then switched to sociology. The discouragement happened when she was majoring, so during her time at San Jose State College. She started there, and the article states she graduated in 1956. But the exact year of discouragement isn't given. Wait, the article says she "majored in journalism for two years" before switching. Since she graduated in 1956, assuming she started in, say, 1952 or 1953, but the exact year isn't specified. The question asks for the year when the head discouraged her. Since the text doesn't state the exact year, this would be N/A. Wait, but maybe the discouragement happened during her time there, but the article doesn't specify the year. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The essay title from 7th grade. The article mentions she wrote an essay for a contest about hunting for grunion. The title isn't given, but the topic is mentioned. Since the question asks for the title, which isn't provided, answer N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Historical novel by Nancy Drew's author. Nancy Drew's author is Carolyn Keene (a pseudonym). The article says Jeanne read Nancy Drew mysteries, but the question is about a historical novel. The article mentions James Fenimore Cooper's historical novels (e.g., "Last of the Mohicans"). So the answer would be James Fenimore Cooper's books, but the question asks for the title. Since the article doesn't specify a particular title, N/A? Wait, the question says "the title of the essay" but maybe I misread. Wait no, the question is about a historical novel written by the author of Nancy Drew. Since the author of Nancy Drew isn't the same as Cooper, so the answer would be N/A. Wait, the article says she read Nancy Drew and Cooper's historical novels. The question is asking for the title of a historical novel by Nancy Drew's author, but Nancy Drew's author didn't write historical novels. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The name of her first grandchild born at Manzanar. The article says "one of his daughters had given birth to his first grandchild at Manzanar". The name isn't provided. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The military prison in Bismarck, ND. The article states "Fort Lincoln". So answer is Fort Lincoln.

8. **Question 8**: The acres of Manzanar. The article says "5,000 acres". So 5000.

9. **Question 9**: Nephew's name who prompted her. The article mentions Gary Nishikawa. So Gary Nishikawa.

10. **Question 10**: Illness from dust winds. The article says she was sick from typhoid shots and then food spoilage. The dust storms are mentioned but not linked to an illness. The question says "contracted due to severe winds... dust". The text doesn't mention an illness caused by dust. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: How her father's appearance caused the family's reaction. The article says when he returned, he looked much older and gaunt, leading to tears. The answer is his drastically changed appearance (as described in the text). The question is phrased as "how did the recollection shape the reaction?" The answer would be that his changed appearance caused their emotional reaction. But the question asks how the recollection (of his appearance) shaped the reaction. The article directly states that seeing him made them cry. So the answer is "He had aged 10 years, gaunt, wilted, underweight, leaning on a cane" but the question wants the effect, so the answer is "it caused everyone to cry" but the question is phrased to need a direct quote or fact. The article says "I thought I should be laughing... started to cry. By this time everyone was crying." So the answer is that the family's reaction was crying because of his appearance. The question is asking how the recollection (of his appearance) shaped their reaction. The answer is that his changed appearance made them cry. But the exact wording from the text is "He had aged 10 years... nobody moved... waiting for some cue... I started to cry... everyone was crying." The answer should be the direct effect mentioned, which is their tears. But the question is phrased as how the changed appearance shaped the reaction. The answer is that the family's reaction was crying because of his appearance. But since the question is about how the recollection shaped the reaction, the answer is "it caused the family to cry" but the article states this directly. However, the question might need a specific phrase. The article says "I started to cry. By this time everyone was crying." So the answer is "everyone was crying" but the question is asking for the reason. Wait, the question is phrased as "how did the interneeâ€™s recollection of her father's... changed appearance shape the immediate silent and tearful reaction..." So the answer is that the changed appearance caused them to cry. The article says exactly that. So the answer is "His changed appearance caused the family to cry."

Wait, but the instructions say to use sentence fragments or words. The answer should be concise. The article's exact quote: "I started to cry. By this time everyone was crying." So the answer is "everyone cried".

12. **Question 12**: Family occurrence during father's absence. The article says "one of his daughters had given birth to his first grandchild at Manzanar, and two other daughters were pregnant." So the occurrence is the birth of his first grandchild and two others pregnant.

13. **Question 13**: Who urged her to share feelings. Her nephew Gary Nishikawa pressed her to talk about her feelings. So answer is Gary Nishikawa.

14. **Question 14**: Career path from the contest. She wrote about grunion hunting, leading to journalism. The career path encouraged was journalism. The answer is journalism.

15. **Question 15**: Activity that provided escape. Books. The article says "Books became my major form of recreation..."

16. **Question 16**: Title of the memoir basis for the TV movie. "Farewell to Manzanar".

17. **Question 17**: Event signaling departure from camp. The family left in October 1945, two months after Japan's surrender. The event is Japan's surrender to the Allies.

18. **Question 18**: Natural phenomenon with temperature and food issues. The article mentions severe winds causing dust storms. So the phenomenon is dust storms.

19. **Question 19**: Final novel with arranged marriage and Manzanar. The article mentions "The Legend of Fire Horse Woman" (2003) which includes an arranged marriage in 1902 and incarceration at Manzanar. So that's the title.

20. **Question 20**: Re-enactment in 2002. The article says they reenacted a roundup, boarding buses to a place with metal gates. The event's name isn't given, but the article mentions "re-enact a roundup of Japanese Americans" in Watsonville. The question asks for the event's name. The article doesn't name it specifically, just describes it. So answer N/A unless the name is "re-enactment of a roundup" but that's not a title. The article says "re-enact a roundup" but the event's name isn't provided. So N/A.

Wait, the article says "they reported to a government building, boarded old buses and were taken to an area where they were 'imprisoned' behind metal gates." The event isn't named, so answer N/A.

Now, let me check each answer again:

1. Humanitas Prize (from the movie adaptation)
2. 11 (1984-1973)
3. N/A (year not given)
4. N/A (title not given)
5. N/A (the author of Nancy Drew didn't write historical novels; Cooper's books are separate)
6. N/A (name not given)
7. Fort Lincoln
8. 5000
9. Gary Nishikawa
10. N/A (no illness from dust mentioned)
11. Everyone cried (or "it caused everyone to cry")
12. The birth of his first grandchild and two other daughters pregnant.
13. Gary Nishikawa
14. Journalism
15. Books
16. Farewell to Manzanar
17. Japan's surrender to the Allies
18. Dust storms
19. The Legend of Fire Horse Woman
20. N/A (no name given for the event)

Wait for question 11, the article says: "I thought I should be laughing... started to cry. By this time everyone was crying." So the answer is that the family's reaction was crying because of his appearance. The question asks "how did the recollection of her father's... changed appearance shape the immediate silent and tearful reaction?" So the answer is "it caused the family to cry" or "everyone cried". But the exact phrasing in the text is "I started to cry. By this time everyone was crying." So the answer is "everyone was crying".

But maybe the answer should be the reason, so "his changed appearance caused the family to cry". But the instructions say to use sentence fragments. The question is about how the changed appearance shaped the reaction, so the answer is that the family cried. The exact answer from the text is that "everyone was crying".

Question 12: The family occurrence during his absence was the birth of the first grandchild and two others pregnant. The answer should be "birth of his first grandchild and two other daughters pregnant" but the question says "family occurrence" so the answer is "one daughter gave birth to his first grandchild, two others were pregnant".

But the question asks for the event noted as affecting family dynamics when he returned. The answer is the birth and the pregnancies. The article says "one of his daughters had given birth to his first grandchild at Manzanar, and two other daughters were pregnant." So the answer is "the birth of his first grandchild and two other daughters pregnant".

But the question asks for "family occurrence during the father's nine-month absence". So the answer is the birth of his first grandchild and two other daughters being pregnant.

But the answer needs to be concise. Maybe just "the birth of his first grandchild".

Alternatively, the article says "one of his daughters had given birth to his first grandchild at Manzanar, and two other daughters were pregnant." So the answer is both, but the question might accept "birth of his first grandchild" as the main occurrence.

Alternatively, the answer is "one daughter gave birth to his first grandchild, two others were pregnant". But the question asks for the occurrence noted as affecting the family dynamics when he rejoined. The article says "family saw a changed, somewhat broken man... two other daughters were pregnant". The key point is that the first grandchild was born, so the answer is "the birth of his first grandchild".

Hmm, but the article mentions both, so perhaps the answer needs to include both. But maybe the question is looking for the fact that his first grandchild was born there. The question says "family occurrence during the father's nine-month absence... noted as having affected the family dynamics when he finally rejoined them?" So the occurrence is the birth and the pregnancies. The answer should be "the birth of his first grandchild and two other daughters pregnant".

But the answer format prefers concise. Since the question asks for the occurrence noted, the article states both, so the answer is "birth of his first grandchild and two other daughters pregnant".

But maybe the exact wording from the article: "one of his daughters had given birth to his first grandchild at Manzanar, and two other daughters were pregnant." So the answer is that occurrence, but the question asks for the name of the occurrence? No, it's asking for what the occurrence was. So the answer is the birth and the pregnancies.

But since the user wants a direct answer, perhaps "birth of his first grandchild".

Alternatively, the exact phrase from the text is "one of his daughters had given birth to his first grandchild at Manzanar, and two other daughters were pregnant." So the answer is "the birth of his first grandchild and two other daughters pregnant".

But the user wants sentence fragments. Let me see the exact wording of the question again: "Which family occurrence during the father's nine-month absence at Manzanar is noted as having affected the family dynamics when he finally rejoined them?"

The answer is the birth of the first grandchild and the two other daughters being pregnant. Since the question asks for the occurrence, the answer should include both. So I'll write that as the answer.
