Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the provided article and answer each question exactly based on the text. Let me start with the first question.

1. **Question 1**: The tech billionaire involved in defense and H-1B visas, influencing US-China policy because their company relies on Chinese manufacturing. The article mentions Elon Musk as co-head of the Department of Government Efficiency and his push for H-1B visas. Also, Tesla sells a lot in China. So Musk fits here.

2. **Question 2**: The $30B fund by a private equity firm and tech giant linked to nuclear fusion. The article says Microsoft and BlackRock launched a $30B fund. Sam Altman and Jeff Bezos back fusion, but the fund is Microsoft and BlackRock. So the answer is Microsoft and BlackRock's fund.

3. **Question 3**: Media company that might buy TikTok under Trump, previously had antitrust issues under Biden. The article says Trump might allow a media company to buy TikTok. Comcast is mentioned as spinning off cable, but the direct link is Trump's media company? Wait, the article says "Will Trump allow a major media company (or his own) to buy TikTok?" So maybe Trump's own company? But the question asks which media conglomerate's potential acquisition is linked to antitrust issues. The article mentions Comcast's move might inspire others, but the direct mention is about the company needing Biden's approval. So maybe no specific name, but the answer might be "N/A" but wait the article says "Will Paramount..." etc. Not sure. Wait, the question is about the media conglomerate linked to prior antitrust challenges under Biden. The article says media deals blocked under Biden might be approved under Trump. The example given is Comcast spinning off cable. But the question is about a company wanting to buy TikTok. The article says "Will Trump allow a major media company (or his own) to buy TikTok?" So the company isn't named, so answer N/A? Hmm. Wait the question says "directly linked to its prior antitrust challenges under Biden". The article says "Deals that were effectively considered a no-go under Biden's aggressive antitrust enforcers may finally be given a green light under a Trump administration." So maybe the company is not named, but the article doesn't specify which one, so answer N/A? Wait the question says "media conglomerate’s potential acquisition of TikTok under Trump’s approval is directly linked to its prior antitrust challenges under the Biden administration?" The article says "Will Trump allow a major media company (or his own) to buy TikTok?" So the company isn't named here, so maybe N/A? Or perhaps the answer is "N/A" because the article doesn't name a specific media company that had prior antitrust issues. Wait, maybe the answer is "N/A".

Wait, let me check again. The question is asking which media conglomerate's potential acquisition of TikTok is linked to prior antitrust issues under Biden. The article only mentions the possibility of Trump allowing a major media company to buy TikTok, but doesn't name the company. So the answer must be N/A. Hmm, but maybe the question is a trick? Let me see other parts. The article mentions "Will Trump allow a major media company (or his own) to buy TikTok?" So maybe "his own" refers to Trump's own media company? But the question says "media conglomerate", so maybe "N/A".

Hmm, maybe I missed something. Let me go on and come back.

4. **Question 4**: Defense start-up valued at $14B after funding, testing AI in Ukraine and preparing to rebuild. The article mentions Anduril Industries, backed by Peter Thiel, raised $1.5B to $14B valuation. It's testing in Ukraine. So Anduril Industries.

5. **Question 5**: Company's return-to-office mandate caused 30% reduction in hybrid work. The article says Amazon required five days, but the question says caused a 30% reduction. The article says "about 30 million workers in hybrid or fully remote arrangements" but the answer is Amazon's mandate. The question says "directly cited as the catalyst for a 30% reduction". The article states "Amazon's return-to-office mandate caused waves and there are signs that office attendance across industries is ticking up." The exact 30% figure isn't mentioned, so maybe N/A. Wait the question says "directly cited as the catalyst for a 30% reduction in hybrid work arrangements across the tech industry by the end of 2024?" The article says "about 30 million workers in hybrid or fully remote arrangements" but doesn't mention a 30% reduction. So maybe N/A? Wait the article says "Will other big tech companies follow Amazon's lead in 2025? Along with office attendance..." but the exact 30% is not there. So answer N/A? Hmm, but the question might be referring to Amazon's action causing that. Maybe the article states it caused a 30% reduction. Let me check again. The article says "there are signs that office attendance across industries is ticking up. But remote work remains prevalent, with about 30 million workers in hybrid or fully remote arrangements." No mention of a 30% reduction. So answer N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Inflation Reduction Act provision prompting Big Oil to lobby Trump. The article says "Big Oil executives to lobby Trump hard to preserve the law. A wild-card: inflation. Will Trump's policies reignite it, spooking both the Fed..." The provision is the tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act. So the answer is the tax credits provision.

7. **Question 7**: European AI defense firm backed by Peter Thiel. The article mentions Anduril Industries as backed by Peter Thiel (co-founder of Palantir). But Anduril is a California-based defense start-up. Wait the question says "European A.I. defense firm". The other one mentioned is Helsing, a German start-up (Europe) using AI for battlefield data. Helsing is backed by? The article says "Anduril... backed by Peter Thiel. Helsing is one of Europe's best-funded companies." So the answer is Helsing?

Wait the question says "backed by Peter Thiel", but Helsing isn't mentioned as backed by Thiel. The article says Anduril is backed by Thiel. So maybe the question has a mistake? Wait the question says "European A.I. defense firm, backed by Peter Thiel". But Peter Thiel is American. The article says Anduril is California-based. So the European one is Helsing, but not backed by Thiel. The article says Helsing is a German start-up using AI for battlefield data, but not linked to Thiel. The question might have a mix-up. Wait the question says "backed by Peter Thiel, became one of the continent's most valuable start-ups by processing live battlefield data through partnerships with U.S.-based Palantir?" The article says Anduril is backed by Thiel. But Anduril is in California, not Europe. The European one is Helsing. Maybe the answer is N/A? Or perhaps the question is wrong. Alternatively, the article says "Palantir was a star performer. Its market cap... joined the S&P 500. Others are profiting... Anduril Industries, a California-based defense start-up backed by Peter Thiel... Helsing, a German start-up..." So the European one is Helsing, not backed by Thiel. The question says "backed by Peter Thiel" but the European one isn't. Therefore, answer N/A? Or maybe the question is referring to Palantir? No, Palantir is data analytics, not a defense firm. Hmm, tricky. Maybe the answer is Anduril but it's not European. So N/A. Wait the question says "European A.I. defense firm backed by Peter Thiel" – since none is mentioned, answer N/A.

Wait the article says "Anduril Industries, a California-based defense start-up backed by Peter Thiel..." So not European. The other one is Helsing, but not backed by Thiel. So answer N/A.

8. **Question 8**: E-commerce surpassing Temu as most downloaded app by moving to Malaysia. The article says Temu was most downloaded in 2024. The question asks which one surpassed Temu by moving to Malaysia. The article says "other businesses such as Temu set up operations in the U.S. to appear less Chinese... Temu was the most downloaded free app in 2024." So no one surpassed Temu. The answer is N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Regulatory agency targeting Google and Meta for suppressing conservatives, plus crypto deregulation. The article mentions Andrew Ferguson at FTC, Gail Slater at DOJ, and Brendan Carr at FCC. The one criticizing Google and Meta for silencing conservatives is Andrew Ferguson at FTC. The question says "regulatory agency’s incoming leadership under Trump... explicitly targeting Google and Meta for allegedly suppressing conservative voices, while simultaneously advocating for crypto deregulation?" The article says "many of Trump's picks have accused companies like Google and Meta of silencing conservative voices. What will Elon Musk do... push for further deregulation and more openness when it comes to A.I. and crypto." So the FTC's Andrew Ferguson is the one. So the answer is the Federal Trade Commission (F.T.C.)?

10. **Question 10**: Defense contractor in S&P 500 due to supplying AI drones to Ukraine, part of SoftBank's $20B fund. The article mentions Palantir joined S&P 500 in September 2024. Palantir is the data analytics company. The question says "U.S. defense contractor’s inclusion in the S&P 500... tied to supplying AI drones to Ukraine, part of SoftBank's $20B initiative." The article says "Palantir... joined the S&P 500 in September. Others are profiting... Anduril... Helsing... If Trump does manage to end the war, it's plausible that Western defense companies will find opportunities helping to build Ukraine's military... Smaller, A.I.-powered companies are already testing their equipment in real time in a war where drones... Palantir is a data analytics company. The question mentions SoftBank's $20B fund. The article says "SoftBank has reportedly talked to Apollo... creating a $20 billion A.I. investment fund". So the company included in S&P 500 is Palantir. But the question says "defense contractor", Palantir is a defense tech company? The article says Palantir is a data analytics company supplying to defense. So the answer is Palantir.

11. **Question 11**: Company that raised office requirement from 3 to 5 days, linked to Musk defending H-1B. The article says Amazon required five days from three. Musk is mentioned as defending H-1B. So the company is Amazon.

12. **Question 12**: Industry benefiting from pro-deal environment due to Trump's support. The article says "energy sector seems probable given Trump's support. Bank deals could also take off... Deals may also pop up to address cybersecurity concerns..." The question asks which industry is identified as benefiting. The first mentioned is energy, so energy sector.

13. **Question 13**: Data analytics firm with 5x market cap jump and S&P inclusion in 2024 election year. The article says Palantir's market cap jumped fivefold to $180B in 2024, joined S&P 500 in September. So Palantir.

14. **Question 14**: U.S. agency Trump called to close before staff suspensions. The article says "Trump directly called for the closure of the U.S. Agency for International Development... just hours before most of its staff were expected to be suspended..." So USAID.

15. **Question 15**: Company sued a union over pro-Palestinian posts. The article says Starbucks sued a union after pro-Palestinian social media posts. The union sued back.

16. **Question 16**: Company challenging activist shareholders against D.E.I. The article mentions Costco challenged a proposal to end D.E.I. efforts.

17. **Question 17**: Federal commission's incoming leader criticizing Google/Meta for stifling conservatives. The FTC's Andrew Ferguson. The question specifies which commission: Federal Trade Commission (F.T.C.)?

18. **Question 18**: E-commerce firm restructuring to appear less Chinese. The article says Temu set up in the U.S. to appear less Chinese. So Temu.

19. **Question 19**: Japanese investor in talks with Apollo for $20B AI fund. The article says SoftBank's CEO Masa Son is hunting for deals and talked to Apollo. So SoftBank.

20. **Question 20**: Media mogul adjusting holdings after family trust issue. The article mentions Rupert Murdoch's failed attempt to change his family trust, considering selling Fox or buying out children. So Rupert Murdoch.

Now let's go back to tricky ones:

Question 3: The answer might be N/A, but let me check again. The question is about a media conglomerate whose potential TikTok acquisition is linked to prior antitrust challenges under Biden. The article says "Will Trump allow a major media company (or his own) to buy TikTok?" It doesn't name the company, so N/A.

Question 5: The article says Amazon's mandate caused a 30% reduction? The exact figure isn't there, so N/A.

Question 7: The European one is Helsing but not backed by Thiel. The question says "backed by Peter Thiel", so N/A.
