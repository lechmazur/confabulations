Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the strict instructions.

1. **Question 1**: Which Norwegian producer previously worked with FKA twigs on her album "Magdalene" before joining the "Eusexua" project?  
The article mentions Stargate (who worked with Rihanna, etc.) as part of the collaborators on "Perfect Stranger." Since Stargate is Norwegian, that's the answer. But wait, the question is about someone who worked on "Magdalene" first. The text says Koreless has been a collaborator since "Magdalene," but Stargate is new here. Wait, the article says "Koreless, Price and the prolific, long-running Norwegian production team Stargate." So Stargate is Norwegian and part of "Perfect Stranger." But was Stargate on "Magdalene"? The article doesn't say that. The question is asking for a producer who was on "Magdalene" before joining "Eusexua." The text says Koreless has been a collaborator since "Magdalene," but Stargate isn't mentioned in that context. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "previously worked on Magdalene before joining Eusexua project." The only Norwegian mentioned is Stargate, but there's no info that they worked on Magdalene. So maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The article says "Koreless, a frequent collaborator since her 2019 album, 'Magdalene.'" Stargate is listed as part of the collaborators on "Perfect Stranger," but their prior work with Madonna and others doesn't indicate prior work with FKA twigs. So the answer here is N/A.

Wait, the question might be a trick. The article says Stargate is part of the collaborators on "Perfect Stranger" for "Eusexua." But does it say they worked on "Magdalene" before? No. So the answer is N/A. 

2. **Question 2**: How many opera training years did FKA twigs complete before developing her signature soprano style?  
The article mentions "opera studies" but doesn't specify the number of years. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: What dance style did FKA twigs master immediately after learning krumping, according to the chronological progression mentioned in the article?  
The article lists "krumping, pole dancing, vogueing and the sword skills of Chinese wushu." The order here is krumping first, then pole dancing, then vogueing. So after krumping comes pole dancing. So answer is pole dancing.

4. **Question 4**: In which track does FKA twigs directly address the meaning of "Eusexua" through her lyrics?  
The article says she described "Eusexua" on social media and in "the song" she coos "Words cannot describe..." but the track mentioned here is "Perfect Stranger." Wait, the line "Words cannot describe, baby, this feeling deep inside" is from "Perfect Stranger." Since "Eusexua" is the album title, maybe that's the track? Wait, the article says "the song" (referring to "Perfect Stranger") has that line. But the term "Eusexua" itself is mentioned in the song? The article says she coined the word and described it on social media. The lyrics mention the feeling but not the word itself. The question is about directly addressing the meaning via lyrics. The article doesn't say she uses the word in the song. So maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the track "Eusexua" might be the title track. The first track mentioned is "Eusexua," the album's first sound. The article starts with "the first sound on 'Eusexua,' the new album by FKA twigs..." So the title track is "Eusexua," and in that track, she might address it. The article says "In the song, she coos, 'Words cannot describe...'" which could be from "Eusexua" the track. So the answer is "Eusexua".

5. **Question 5**: What musical instrument provides the primary accompaniment throughout "Keep It, Hold It" besides the piano strings mentioned in the text?  
The text says "amid the resonances of plucked and strummed piano strings," so the primary is piano strings. The question asks for another instrument besides that. The article doesn't mention another instrument here, so N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Which Madonna hit song producer brought their signature sound to the track "Perfect Stranger"?  
The collaborators on "Perfect Stranger" include Stargate, who worked with Madonna. The article says Stargate has worked with Madonna, so the answer is Stargate.

7. **Question 7**: What color scheme dominates the album's visual aesthetic as described in the fashion references?  
The article doesn't mention color schemes in fashion references, so N/A.

8. **Question 8**: During which verse of "Drums of Death" does FKA twigs incorporate the vogueing elements she learned?  
The article mentions vogueing as one of her dance styles but doesn't specify which verse of "Drums of Death" has it. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: What percentage of songs on "Eusexua" maintain the dirge-like tempos characteristic of her earlier work?  
The article says the first half has upbeat songs, and the second half is quieter. It mentions "dirge-like tempos" were part of her earlier work. But no percentage is given. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Which British music academy awarded FKA twigs her classical vocal training mentioned in relation to her soprano abilities?  
The article mentions "opera studies" but doesn't name an academy. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: In the opening moments of the album, FKA twigs uses an understated sound that both signals a racing pulse and nods to her experimental past; which core musical element does this sound introduce to bridge her art-pop origins with a more rhythm-driven vibe?  
The first sound is described as a "brisk, muffled thud, like the heartbeat behind a racing pulse." The core element here is a beat. The article says it's a signal that she's using a "propulsive, danceable beat." So the answer is beat.

12. **Question 12**: Reflecting on her diverse background in physical performance, which combat-associated discipline mentioned in the article illustrates her training beyond traditional dance that she brings to her stage presence?  
The article mentions "the sword skills of Chinese wushu" as part of her training. Wushu includes combat elements, so the answer is Chinese wushu.

13. **Question 13**: FKA twigs has coined a term that fuses a feeling of intense pleasure with a hint of risk; what is the single-word term she uses to describe this state that she also calls the pinnacle of human experience?  
The term is "Eusexua," which she coined as merging euphoria and sexuality.

14. **Question 14**: Within one song the production transitions from sparse instrumentation to a rhythmic burst after an emotional inquiry; what reassurance does FKA twigs offer that coincides with the onset of a club-ready beat?  
The article says in "Perfect Stranger," after "Do you feel alone?" and "You're not alone," the beat comes in. The reassurance is "You're not alone."

15. **Question 15**: Identifying a long-term collaborator from her previous album and the current one, which British electronic musician, noted for continuing work on her upbeat tracks, is referenced in the article?  
Koreless is mentioned as a frequent collaborator since "Magdalene" (2019) and works on "Eusexua," including upbeat tracks. So the answer is Koreless.

16. **Question 16**: Among the track titles mentioned, which one might someone mistakenly interpret as denoting a literal location while it actually encapsulates an internal state of vulnerability on the album?  
The track "Room of Fools" is described as dealing with internal states: "We're open wounds / just bleeding out the pressure." "Room" could be mistaken as a place but represents an internal state. The answer is Room of Fools.

17. **Question 17**: Drawing on the auditory imagery described early in the article, what sound quality is characterized as a brisk, muffled thud that metaphorically stands in for an essential heartbeat?  
The first sound on the album is described as a "brisk, muffled thud," so the answer is brisk, muffled thud.

18. **Question 18**: Considering the guest producers aligned with iconic pop figures mentioned in the text, which producer known for recent collaborations with Madonna is credited on the track celebrating an enigmatic romantic liaison?  
The track celebrating an anonymous hookup is "Perfect Stranger," which includes Stargate (who worked with Madonna). So Stargate.

19. **Question 19**: Looking at the dynamic shift within one particular song, which track features a moment when isolated vocals give way to a pulsating beat that redefines its emotional landscape?  
The article describes "Perfect Stranger" where isolated vocals transition to a beat after "You're not alone." The track is "Perfect Stranger."

20. **Question 20**: Examining the interplay of classical influences and modern pop in her music, which distinctive feature of FKA twigsâ€™ vocal delivery, shaped by her operatic studies, is highlighted as part of her artistic identity?  
The article mentions her "high, clear soprano" from opera studies. So the answer is high, clear soprano.
