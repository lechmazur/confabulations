merged_mastercard-26-million-pay-discrimination.txt
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer strictly based on that. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks about the percentage of the Goldman Sachs settlement that Mastercard paid. The article mentions that Goldman paid $215 million in 2023, and Mastercard's settlement is $26 million. But the question is about the percentage of Goldman's amount that Mastercard paid. Wait, the question is phrased as "percentage of that settlement amount" – meaning Goldman's $215M. So 26 divided by 215 is roughly 12%. But the article doesn't state this percentage explicitly. Since the question requires a direct answer from the text, and the article doesn't mention the percentage, it's N/A.

2. The second question is about the specific psychological assessment tool recommended by Cara Greene. The article says Mastercard agreed to hire a psychologist to assess bias, but there's no mention of the tool or method used. So N/A.

3. The third question refers to a new title from the D.E.I. Retreat article. The article mentions companies scaling back D.E.I. programs, but there's no info on Mastercard giving a new title to an executive. So N/A.

4. The fourth question asks about Mastercard employees' protests similar to Silicon Valley workers. The article talks about Silicon Valley workers' protests but doesn't mention Mastercard employees doing anything similar. So N/A.

5. The fifth question is about when the audits end. The audits are annual for three years starting after the court filing (which was on Tuesday when the agreement was filed). Assuming they began immediately, three years from the filing. But the article doesn't specify the exact year, only that the settlement was filed in 2024 (since Danielle Kaye is a 2024 David Carr Fellow). So if the filing is in 2024, the audits would end in 2027. But the article doesn't state the exact year of the filing, just "Tuesday" without a date. So can't determine the exact year. Therefore N/A.

Wait, the article says "an agreement filed in court on Tuesday" but doesn't give a year. Since the byline mentions Danielle Kaye as a 2024 Fellow, maybe the article is from 2024. So if the audits start in 2024, they'd end in 2027. But the question says "assuming they began immediately after the court filing". The answer would be 3 years after the filing. But since the exact year isn't given, maybe the answer is "three years after 2024", but the question asks for the year, so without knowing the filing's exact year, it's N/A. Hmm, tricky. The article might not specify the current year beyond the fellowship, so maybe the answer is N/A.

6. The sixth question connects Bill Gates' analysis to Mastercard's decision. The article mentions Bill Gates' article but doesn't link his actions to Mastercard's settlement. So N/A.

7. The seventh question asks about the hedge fund behind DeepSeek's AI used to identify pay gaps. The article says DeepSeek was the brainchild of a hedge fund but doesn't name the fund. So N/A.

8. The eighth question is about an unproven blood filter Mastercard considered. The article mentions a blood filter in the Start-Up's Claim section but doesn't link it to Mastercard. So N/A.

9. The ninth question asks the job title most misassigned to women and people of color. The complaint says they were assigned to lower job levels than their experience, but the specific title isn't mentioned. So N/A.

10. The tenth question is about how many employees were affected by job level misassignments. The article states "roughly 7,500 employees" were affected by the pay gaps from job level issues. So 7,500.

11. The eleventh question asks the monetary amount. The article clearly states $26 million. So 26,000,000 or $26 million.

12. The twelfth question is the number of years for audits. The article says "annual pay equity audits for three years". So three.

13. The thirteenth question asks the company's name as the second-largest. The text says Mastercard is the second-largest payment processing company. So Mastercard.

14. The fourteenth question is the law firm partner. The article mentions Cara Greene from Outten & Golden. So Cara Greene.

15. The fifteenth question asks which company had a larger settlement. Goldman Sachs paid $215M, Google $118M, Mastercard $26M. So Goldman Sachs.

16. The sixteenth question: underpayment started in 2016. The complaint was filed on Tuesday (assuming the article is current, maybe 2024). The years from 2016 to 2024 would be 8 years, but the exact current year isn't specified. The article says "starting in 2016", but doesn't say when the complaint was filed. The settlement is recent, but without the exact year, can't compute the full years. The article doesn't state the current year beyond 2024 fellowship, so maybe up to 2024? 8 years. But the question says "how many full years of alleged underpayment does the claim cover?" The claim covers from 2016 to the present at the time of filing. If the filing is in 2024, that's 8 years. But since the article doesn't explicitly state the current year, maybe it's N/A. Wait, the question says "assuming they began immediately after the court filing" – no, the underpayment began in 2016. The claim covers from 2016 onward. The duration is up to the filing date. The article doesn't say when the filing was, but the byline mentions 2024. So if the filing is in 2024, it's 8 years. But the question says "how many full years of alleged underpayment does the claim cover?" Since the article states the underpayment started in 2016 and the complaint was filed on Tuesday, but without the exact year, maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, but the article says "starting in 2016" and the settlement resolves claims from that time. The exact end isn't given, but the question is about the duration up to the filing. Since the article doesn't specify the filing's year, except that the fellow is 2024, perhaps it's safe to assume the year is 2024, making it 8 years. But maybe the question is expecting just the starting point. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick because it's from 2016 to when? The claim covers the period since 2016, but the exact number of years isn't stated. So N/A.

Wait, the question says "how many full years of alleged underpayment does the claim cover?" The claim is from 2016 onward until the filing. Since the filing was on Tuesday when the agreement was filed, but the article doesn't give the current year beyond the fellowship, perhaps the answer is N/A because we don't know the exact end year. So N/A.

17. The seventeenth question asks the additional service besides audits. The article says they hired a psychologist to assess bias. So the answer is "hire a psychologist" or "psychological assessment". But the question is phrased as "professional service", so "hiring a psychologist to assess bias" or more precisely, "assess bias in its workplace". The exact answer is "hire a psychologist to assess bias in its workplace".

Wait, the question asks for the "professional service", so the answer is "hiring a psychologist to assess bias in its workplace". But the answer needs to be concise. The article says "hire a psychologist to assess bias in its workplace". So the service is hiring a psychologist for bias assessment. So the answer is "hiring a psychologist".

18. The eighteenth question refers to the tech leader with political alignment contrasting employees' protests. The article mentions Mark Zuckerberg and other tech titans aligning with Trump while employees protested. So the answer is Mark Zuckerberg.

19. The nineteenth question asks Mastercard's global size ranking. The article says "world's second-largest payment processing company". So second.
