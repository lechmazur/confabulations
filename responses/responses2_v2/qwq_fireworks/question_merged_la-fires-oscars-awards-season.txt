Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me read through each question carefully and check the article for the answers.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which major Hollywood studio donated their 2024 marketing budget to wildfire relief after Jean Smart's post. The article mentions Jean Smart suggesting that networks not televise awards and donate revenue, but it doesn't name any specific studio that did so. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** It asks how many crew members were impacted by the production downturn according to local union stats. The article says crew members were affected but doesn't provide a specific number or reference to union statistics. N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The total advertising revenue from 2023 awards shows that Jean Smart suggested donating isn't mentioned. The article only states that profits from ad revenue would be lost if shows were canceled. No specific figure given. N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The question is about another former Oscar winner joining Jean Smart in calling for cancellation. The article only mentions Jean Smart's suggestion, no others. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Box office losses for smaller films due to Critics Choice postponement? The article says some smaller films rely on awards spotlight, but no specific revenue loss is stated. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Percentage of Pacific Palisades residents Kamala Harris met with. The article mentions she met with local officials, but no percentage of residents. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** First insurance company to implement the new policy. The article mentions the insurance regulator's desire but doesn't name a company. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Financial impact on florists and wait staff from 1938 Oscars postponement. The article doesn't discuss historical financial impacts. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Number of emergency protocols implemented from other cities. The article says L.A. could borrow ideas but doesn't specify how many were used. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Total duration of all past Oscars postponements before 2021. The article lists 1938 (1 week), 1968 (2 days), 1981 (1 day). Adding those: 7 + 2 + 1 = 10 days. So answer is 10 days.

11. **Question 11:** Percentage of ad revenue Jean Smart proposed for Kamala Harris's initiatives. The article says donate revenue to fire victims and firefighters, not specifying a percentage or linking to Harris's discussion. N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Hours after scheduled time the 2021 Oscars started due to MLK legacy? The 2021 delay was due to pandemic, not MLK, and the 1981 delay was for Reagan's shooting. The question is mixing events. N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Another awards show postponed in 1938 besides Critics Choice. The 1938 Oscars were postponed due to flooding. The Critics Choice wasn't mentioned in 1938. The article says the Oscars were postponed in 1938, so the answer is the Academy Awards (Oscars).

14. **Question 14:** Directors Guild's nomination announcement method, mirroring SAG's approach. The SAG didn't televise, while the Directors Guild used a news release as usual. So answer is news release.

15. **Question 15:** What action the Academy might take if the insurance policy is adopted, similar to 1968 delay. 1968 had a delay due to MLK's assassination. The article doesn't link insurance policy to Academy actions. N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Month Kamala Harris met officials about the emergency system. The article says her tour was during her first visit since the fires and one of few post-office appearances. No specific month given beyond "last month" in the text's context, but the article's date isn't clear. The article's own date is by Kyle Buchanan, but thefires are ongoing. Since the article mentions the fires continue, and Harris's visit was recent, but without a specific month, N/A.

17. **Question 17:** Group impacted like wait staff affected by Oscar nomination delays. The article mentions ancillary workers like wait staff and florists affected by postponements. The delay of Oscar nominations might affect these groups indirectly, but the question specifies the announcement postponement. The answer is florists (since they are mentioned alongside wait staff in the same sentence about being affected by cancellation).

18. **Question 18:** Action similar to SAG's approach (not televising nominations) considered by networks. Jean Smart proposed not televising and donating revenue. The SAG didn't televise their nominations. So the answer is not televising the awards.

19. **Question 19:** If postponed like 2021 (moved to April from Feb), what May date? The 2021 Oscars were moved from Feb to April. If similar, but the article doesn't say May. N/A unless inferred, but no info. N/A.

20. **Question 20:** Natural disaster besides fires causing postponement affecting same workers. The 1938 flooding caused the Oscars delay, affecting crew and ancillary workers. So the answer is flooding.
