Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article. 

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about the narrative device Griffin's D&D campaign represents in the context of America's shift from Carter to Reagan. The article mentions that Griffynweld resembles his city and environs. Since the shift is about societal change, maybe the campaign is an escape or a parallel. The answer might be "escape" or "mythical realm as a parallel," but I need to check the text. The article says "escape into an elaborate Dungeons & Dragons campaign, mapping a mythical Griffynweld that resembles his city and its environs." So the device is a metaphor for his escape, perhaps representing the contrast between his imaginary world and the real-world changes. The question specifies "narrative device," so maybe "mapping a mythical realm" or "imaginary realms of the child." Wait, the article states "the lines between juveniles and adults blurring and being crossed." The D&D campaign is his escape, so the device could be "a parallel to his real-world struggles" or "mythical realm as counterpoint." The article also mentions "the imaginary realms of the child" in the title's connotations. The answer is likely "the imaginary realms of the child."

2. **Question 2**: The apartment fire's trauma and Griffynweld's connection. The text says Griffin feels responsible for the fire, and Griffynweld is his escape. The critic implies that his escape into Griffynweld is a response to that trauma. So the answer would be that the trauma leads him to create the mythical realm as an escape. The exact wording might be "Griffin's escape into Griffynweld is a direct response to the unresolved trauma of the fire," but the question is how the critic implies the interlock. The article says "escapes into an elaborate...campaign...mapping a mythical Griffynweld that resembles his city and its environs." The trauma's memory is part of why he creates it. The answer is probably "Griffin's escape into Griffynweld directly reflects his need to process the unresolved trauma of the fire."

3. **Question 3**: The incident involving physical harm as a metaphor. The article mentions a severed pinkie during a domestic dispute, and a letter opener through a palm. These are darkly slapstick moments. The question asks which incident symbolizes the overlap between adolescent vulnerability and adult recklessness. The severed pinkie might be the answer, as it's part of a family dispute (adults) affecting Griffin. The article says "part of someone's pinkie gets severed by a door jamb, bounces into a koi pond and is quickly devoured by a carp." This could be a metaphor for destructive adult behavior affecting kids. The answer is the severed pinkie incident.

4. **Question 4**: Marketing tagline from a financial institution. The article lists taglines like "1010 WINS, American Express, Calgon." American Express is a financial institution. So the answer is "American Express."

5. **Question 5**: Tension between family financial instability and Griffin's acting career via commercials. The text says Griffin's wages go toward his private school tuition, which his family might not afford otherwise. So the answer is that his commercials fund his school, showing the family's reliance on his work despite instability. The answer is "Griffin's commercial earnings fund his private school tuition, directly supporting the family's financial needs."

6. **Question 6**: Unnerving event at a family friend’s celebration. The psychologist's 40th wedding anniversary party is where Naomi Shah takes an interest in Griffin, leading to predatory behavior. The event is her 40th anniversary party, and the incident is her inappropriate interest. The answer is "Naomi Shah's carnal interest in Griffin at the psychologist's 40th anniversary party."

7. **Question 7**: Character at the psychologist’s party exemplifying boundary crossing. The same as question 6, so the answer is "Naomi Shah."

8. **Question 8**: Superhero role as counterpoint to real struggles. Griffin plays Peter Proton in "The Nuclear Family" TV show. His real struggles include family issues and predators. The answer is "Peter Proton."

9. **Question 9**: Literary scandal allusion via predatory woman. The article mentions "Lolita" in the list of influences (Holden Caulfield, Lolita, Willy Loman, Garp). Griffin's encounter with Naomi (older woman) parallels Humbert Humbert's situation in Lolita. So the answer is "Lolita."

10. **Question 10**: Character with TV performance and family discord mirroring societal transitions. Griffin is the protagonist dealing with both his acting career and family issues, set against the Carter-Reagan shift. The answer is "Griffin Hurt."
