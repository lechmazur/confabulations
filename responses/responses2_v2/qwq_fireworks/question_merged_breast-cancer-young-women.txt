Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article provided. I need to make sure I don't use any outside knowledge and stick strictly to the text. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks about the percentage of estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancers in women who had their first pregnancy after 30, according to Dr. Toriola's study. The article mentions that Dr. Toriola found the increase in breast cancer under 50 is driven largely by estrogen-fueled cancers like the type Donovan had. However, there's no specific percentage given for those who had their first pregnancy after 30. So this might be N/A.

2. The second question is about how many months after her diagnosis Donovan ran the marathon. The article says she was diagnosed nearly three years ago and ran the marathon in 2024. If her diagnosis was in 2021 (since it's "nearly three years" before 2024), then the marathon was about 36 months later. Wait, but the exact timing isn't given. The article says "it has been nearly three years since Ms. Donovan was first diagnosed" and she ran the marathon in 2024. Assuming the diagnosis was in late 2021, then the marathon in 2024 would be around 2.5-3 years, but the question asks for months. Since the exact months aren't specified, maybe this is N/A.

3. The third question asks for the annual percentage increase in breast cancer rates among regular drinkers vs non-drinkers. The article states that alcohol use increases risk, but doesn't provide specific percentages for comparison between drinkers and non-drinkers. So N/A.

4. Dr. Rozenblit mentions BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations are more common in younger women with triple-negative cancer. The question asks for the primary driver. The article says genetic predispositions account for a fraction, but doesn't state it's the primary. So maybe N/A, or is it BRCA? Wait, the question says "primary driver of triple-negative"â€”the article says they're more likely to have BRCA mutations, but the primary driver might be the mutation itself. But the answer is BRCA1 or BRCA2. But the exact term? The question asks for the genetic mutation's name. The article says "BRCA1 or BRCA2". So maybe "BRCA1/BRCA2".

5. Dr. Colditz's research linked childhood height growth rate to breast cancer onset. The article says "height and growth rate are associated with increased breast cancer risk, signaling the impact of childhood nutrition." But does it mention age of onset? The question is about correlation with age of onset. The article says growth rate is associated with increased risk, but not specifically the age of onset. So maybe N/A.

6. Survival rate comparison between under 40 and over 50 when controlling for stage. The article states younger women have lower survival rates on average but doesn't give specific percentages. So N/A.

7. Alcohol consumption threshold during adolescence. The article says "alcohol use, especially in adolescence and early adulthood, also clearly increases breast cancer risk" but doesn't mention a specific threshold like number of drinks. So N/A.

8. Decrease in average age of first menstruation between 1960 and 2020. The article says "the average age at which a girl gets her first period has dropped over the last 60 years". From 1960 to 2020 is 60 years. But the exact number of months isn't given. The question asks for how many months it decreased. Since the article doesn't provide numbers, N/A.

9. Percentage of cases attributed to delayed pregnancy vs genetic in Dana-Farber study. The article mentions delayed pregnancy reduces protection but doesn't give percentages. The Dana-Farber study is by Partridge, but the question refers to a study there. The article says genetic predispositions account for a fraction, but no specific percentages. So N/A.

10. Risk increase per year delaying first pregnancy beyond 25. The article mentions delaying pregnancy reduces protection but doesn't give a yearly risk increase percentage. So N/A.

11. The hormone compared to fertilizer is estrogen. The article says "estrogen helps drive cell growth... fertilizer".

12. Upper age limit for young-onset is under 40. The article says clinicians define it as diagnosed before 40.

13. Reproductive practice that reduces risk is breastfeeding, mentioned as protective when done before 30. The practice is breastfeeding, which is diminished if delayed.

14. The service using AI with mammograms is mentioned at the end: "having their mammograms read... by an AI model".

15. Other early-onset cancers increasing: colorectal, gastric, kidney, liver. The question asks for one, so any of those. The first one mentioned is colorectal.

16. Early life nutrition factor linked to height and growth rate: childhood nutrition.

17. Subtype fueled by estrogen and rising is estrogen receptor-positive, as per Dr. Toriola's study.

18. Environmental exposure causing DNA damage and estrogen: alcohol.

19. Screening change by USPSTF: starting at 40 instead of 50.

20. Individual's narrative is Siobhan Donovan's.

Now, let me check each answer against the text again to ensure accuracy.

1. N/A - No percentage given for first pregnancy after 30 and ER+ cases.
2. N/A - Exact months not specified, only "nearly three years".
3. N/A - No annual % increase for drinkers vs non.
4. BRCA1/BRCA2 - The article says they are more likely to have these genes, but the primary driver is the mutation. The question asks for the mutation's name. So answer is BRCA1 or BRCA2, but the question says "primary driver", so maybe the answer is BRCA1/BRCA2.
5. N/A - The article links growth rate to increased risk, not age of onset.
6. N/A - No specific percentage points.
7. N/A - No threshold like 1 drink/day.
8. N/A - No specific months decrease.
9. N/A - No percentages given.
10. N/A - No yearly increase figure.
11. Estrogen.
12. 40.
13. Breastfeeding.
14. AI model/ machine analysis.
15. Colorectal (or any of the listed, but first is colorectal).
16. Childhood nutrition.
17. Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+).
18. Alcohol.
19. Lowered age to 40.
20. Siobhan Donovan.
