Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to be careful to only use the information given and avoid any external knowledge. Let me go through each question step by step.

1. The first question asks about the percentage increase in hourly wage secured by the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) in a contract that recognized displacement from new tech. The article mentions the ILWU agreed to a contract over a decade ago that recognized tech displacing jobs, but the 62% raise is part of the current negotiations between the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) and the employers. The ILWU isn't the same as ILA here, so maybe this is a trick. Wait, the question mentions the "contract mentioned in the article" that recognized displacement. The article says the ILWU's contract did that. But the 62% raise is for the ILA's current deal. The question might be mixing up the two unions. Since the question specifically asks about the ILWU's contract, which the article says secured a deal with $63 from $39. Wait, the article states "the union secured a deal that would increase wages to $63 an hour, from $39, by the end of a new six-year contract." But that's the ILA's deal. The ILWU's contract is a different one. The question is confusing because it refers to the ILWU, but the 62% raise is for the ILA. Since the question specifically asks about the ILWU's contract, which the article mentions in the context of a model for compromise, but the exact percentage isn't given for their contract. The article says the ILWU's deal from over a decade ago had guarantees, but the 62% is separate. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "the contract mentioned in the article, which recognized the displacement caused by new technologies?" The ILWU's contract did that, but the percentage isn't given here. The article only mentions the ILWU's deal in terms of their agreement with tech displacement, but the 62% is for the ILA's current negotiations. Therefore, the answer might be N/A because the percentage isn't specified for the ILWU's contract. Alternatively, maybe the 62% is the answer, but that's for the ILA. Hmm, tricky. I think it's N/A because the question is about the ILWU's contract, which isn't linked to the 62% figure here.

2. Dennis Monts is concerned about a strike's impact. The question asks about a surcharge amount announced by ocean carriers for West Coast ports due to Red Sea attacks. The article mentions that shipping costs rose over 60% due to Red Sea attacks forcing longer routes, and carriers will add surcharges if ports close. But the exact surcharge amount isn't stated. The question specifies "as a direct result of the Red Sea shipping attacks" and asks for the amount, which isn't provided. So N/A.

3. The question connects the contract allowing semi-automation with mutual agreement to how many student clubs West Point ended. The article mentions DEI: West Point leaders ended a dozen clubs to comply with Trump's D.E.I. ban. The question is asking how many clubs ended, mirroring the compromise model. The answer is a dozen, which is 12. But the compromise model was about the ILWU's deal, not directly related to DEI. But the question is asking for the number of clubs, which is 12. So answer is 12.

4. The primary reason Trudeau gave for Trump wanting to annex Canada is Canada's critical minerals. The article states that Trudeau said Canada's wealth of critical minerals is behind Trump's comments. So the answer is critical minerals.

5. The Republicans called for Taft-Hartley Act use. The question asks the name of the agency Trump said Vivek Ramaswamy would co-head. The article says Trump said Ramaswamy would co-head an agency advising on slimming the government. The exact name isn't given, so N/A.

6. The percentage of longshoremen at Port of NY/NJ making $100k-$200k in 2020 is nearly 60%, per the article. So 60%.

7. The tent city's capacity for migrants is up to 30,000. The article mentions preparing a tent city for 30,000 migrants. So 30,000.

8. Legal actions without merit: the lawsuits against CBS and Des Moines Register. The article says Trump's cases against those media lack legal merit per experts. So the answer is CBS News and The Des Moines Register. Wait, the question asks for the specific legal action's name. The question says "what specific legal action", but the answer would be the lawsuits against those two. However, the question might want the name of the legal actions, but the article just refers to lawsuits. Since the question asks for the name of the legal action, but the article doesn't name them, maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "what specific legal action did First Amendment experts believe lacked merit...", so the answer is the lawsuits against CBS News and The Des Moines Register. The exact answer would be the lawsuits against those two entities. But the question might want the names of the lawsuits, which aren't given. Alternatively, the answer is "Trump's lawsuits against CBS News and The Des Moines Register". But the question is phrased as "what specific legal action", so maybe the answer is those two entities' lawsuits. Since the article says "Trump's cases against CBS News and The Des Moines Register", the answer is those two, but the question might want the exact names. But since the question is asking for the legal action's name, perhaps the answer is the lawsuits against those two, but the exact name isn't provided beyond that. Maybe the answer is "suits against CBS News and The Des Moines Register", but since the question is looking for the specific legal action's name, perhaps it's N/A. Wait, the question might just want the names of the legal actions as per the article. The article says "Trump's cases against CBS News and The Des Moines Register lack legal merit", so the answer would be those cases. But the question asks for the legal action's name, which isn't a specific case name. Hmm, maybe the answer is the lawsuits against those two, so the answer is "lawsuits against CBS News and The Des Moines Register". But maybe the question expects "N/A" because the article doesn't name them beyond that. Alternatively, the answer is those two entities. The question says "what specific legal action", so perhaps the answer is the lawsuits against those two, which is the exact wording from the article. So answer is "lawsuits against CBS News and The Des Moines Register".

Wait, the question says "what specific legal action did First Amendment experts believe lacked merit...", so the answer is the lawsuits Trump filed against those two media entities. Since the question asks for the name of the legal action, but the article refers to them as "cases", so perhaps the answer is those cases. The exact answer would be "the lawsuits against CBS News and The Des Moines Register".

9. The primary target of Trump's closure call was USAID. The article says Trump called for closure of USAID. So USAID.

10. The 10 migrants in Guantanamo are suspected of gang affiliations. The article states they have suspected gang affiliations. So gang affiliations.

11. The union leader who criticized semi-automation is Dennis A. Daggett, as stated in the article.

12. The political figure who talked about automation mastery is Trump, as he said on Truth Social.

13. The deadline is Jan. 15, per the article.

14. The Virginia port mentioned is the Port of Virginia.

15. The new hourly wage is $63, as per the article's mention of the deal increasing to $63 from $39.

16. The maritime employers' group is the United States Maritime Alliance.

17. The academic is Ram Ganeshan at William & Mary.

18. The union model is the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU).

19. The shipping cost increase is over 60%.

20. The association is the Retail Industry Leaders Association.

Let me go through each again to confirm:

1. The question asks about the ILWU's contract. The article says the ILWU's deal from over a decade ago recognized tech displacement, but the percentage increase mentioned for their contract isn't given here. The 62% is for the current ILA negotiations. So answer N/A.

2. No specific surcharge amount mentioned, so N/A.

3. West Point ended a dozen clubs, so 12.

4. Critical minerals.

5. The agency's name isn't given. The article says "agency that will advise his administration on slimming down the government" but doesn't name it. So N/A.

6. 60%.

7. 30,000.

8. The lawsuits against CBS and the Register. The question asks for the specific legal action, which is those lawsuits. So the answer is "lawsuits against CBS News and The Des Moines Register".

9. USAID.

10. Gang affiliations.

11. Dennis A. Daggett.

12. Trump.

13. Jan. 15.

14. Port of Virginia.

15. $63.

16. United States Maritime Alliance.

17. Ram Ganeshan.

18. ILWU.

19. Over 60% (so 60% or "over 60%", but the exact wording says "over 60 percent", so 60% is acceptable).

20. Retail Industry Leaders Association.

I think that's all. Now format the answers properly.
