Okay, I need to answer all 20 questions based strictly on the provided article. Let me go through each question one by one and check the article for the answers.

1. **Question 1:** The first indie film that Molly Parker mentioned as "the most fun I've ever had" is "Kissed." The article says she starred in it in 1996. But the question asks which director discovered her. The article doesn't mention the director's name, only the film title. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The article states her thyroid cancer treatment disturbed her endocrine system and recovery took years. But it doesn't specify how many years. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The article says she trained in ballet in her childhood but doesn't mention a theater company in Vancouver. She took acting classes but no specific company's name. N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Timothy Olyphant's comment was about her performance in "Deadwood." The article says she was on "Deadwood" for three seasons starting in 2004. The question is about during which season he noted her ability. The article doesn't specify a season number. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The Canada gallery fundingâ€”she used her first movie paychecks but the article doesn't state a percentage. Answer N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Amy has retrograde amnesia. Parker had thyroid cancer, not amnesia. The article says she identified with Amy's crisis and survival choice, but the condition isn't mirrored. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The Hallmark movie title isn't mentioned. The article just says she made one for money. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The article doesn't mention how many episodes of the Italian series she watched. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Parker was accepted into a biology program before moving to Vancouver. So the subject was biology. Answer: Biology.

10. **Question 10:** No mention of an acting coach convincing her. She moved on her own. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The Italian series inspired "Doc," but the article doesn't say how many episodes she filmed of it. N/A.

13. **Question 13:** The Canada gallery is in Chinatown, NYC, but the question says Canadian city. Wait, the article says she helped fund the gallery in NYC, which is not a Canadian city. The funding came from her early films like "Kissed," but the gallery is in NYC. So answer N/A because the city is New York, not Canadian.

14. **Question 14:** The Hallmark movie's title isn't given. The article just mentions she did one for money. N/A.
