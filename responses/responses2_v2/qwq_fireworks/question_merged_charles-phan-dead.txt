Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to be careful and only use the information given, no external knowledge.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks which Vietnamese dish Charles Phan's mother taught him during the refugee camp that became his restaurant's signature. The article mentions "bo luc lac" (shaking beef) as the dish he transformed. Wait, but the refugee camp part? Let me check again. The article says he cooked for the family after fleeing, but specifically, the shaking beef is his signature. The refugee camp part isn't tied to a specific dish here. Hmm, maybe the question is a trick? Wait, the article says "In Vietnam, the dish is often made with tough cuts... Mr. Phan recast the dish..." So the answer is "bo luc lac".

2. **Question 2:** Michelin stars before moving to Ferry Building. The article doesn't mention Michelin stars at all. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** French culinary school. The article states he was self-taught and didn't mention any school in France. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Presidential administration as cultural ambassador. The article doesn't mention this role, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Annual revenue of Valencia Street's first year. The article says by 2014 it was $16.5M, but first year's revenue isn't given. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Technique from grandmother for shaking beef. The article says the technique involves shaking the pan, but it doesn't mention learning it from his grandmother. The article says the name refers to the pan motion. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** First cookbook about modernizing Da Lat street food. The article mentions two cookbooks but doesn't name the first one. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Seats in Ferry Building location when opened. The article says 8,000 sq ft but not seat count. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Scholarship program name. Not mentioned, so N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Mentor chef in early career. The article mentions Pichet Ong as a friend but not a mentor. No other chef is mentioned as mentor. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Family member who told him to take charge. The article says his mom told him on the ship. So answer: "his mother".

12. **Question 12:** University for architecture. The article says UC Berkeley. Correct.

13. **Question 13:** Dish transformed with medium-rare beef and watercress. The article says "bo luc lac" (shaking beef) was the highlight with those ingredients. So answer: "bo luc lac".

14. **Question 14:** Year Valencia Street opened. The article states 1995. Correct.

15. **Question 15:** Who called it a game changer? The article quotes Rob Lam from Lily saying that. So answer: "Rob Lam".

16. **Question 16:** Leisure activity leading to hospitalization. The article says cardiac arrest during tennis. So "tennis".

17. **Question 17:** Alternative meal after Thanksgiving failed. The article says they ate curry and rice. Correct.

18. **Question 18:** Travel show with Anthony Bourdain. The article mentions "Parts Unknown". Correct.

19. **Question 19:** TV competition. The article says "Iron Chef". Correct.

20. **Question 20:** Food writer who praised his storytelling. The article says Joan Nathan. Correct.

Now, let me make sure each answer is directly from the text and no assumptions. For example, question 1's answer is "bo luc lac" as the article states it's the dish he transformed. The refugee camp part isn't tied to the dish's origin from his mother there, but the question says "during their time in the refugee camp"â€”the article mentions cooking at home after fleeing, but not specifically that dish. Wait, the article says "In Vietnam, the dish is often made with tough cuts... Mr. Phan recast the dish..." So maybe the dish's origin is from Vietnam, but the question says taught in refugee camp. Since the article doesn't explicitly state that the mother taught him that dish in the camp, maybe this is N/A? Wait, the question says "during their time in the refugee camp that later became his restaurant's signature offering". The article says "his mother's dishes" but specifically mentions the shaking beef as his signature. But does it say he learned it in the camp? The article says "he cooked for the family while his parents worked". It might not specify that the dish was from the camp. Hmm, tricky. The question might be a trick. Let me check again:

The article says: "In Vietnam, the dish is often made with tough cuts... Mr. Phan recast the dish with medium-rare cubes..." So the dish itself is Vietnamese, but the question is whether he learned it from his mother during the refugee camp. The article says "the food he grew up on", so maybe the dish was from his upbringing, not the camp. Since the question specifies "during their time in the refugee camp", which might not be the case. Therefore, the answer might be N/A. Wait, but the article says "the food he grew up on in running an acclaimed..." so the shaking beef is part of that. The question might be incorrect, but according to the article, the dish is from his upbringing, not specifically the camp. Therefore, maybe the answer is N/A. But the first sentence of the article says "married local ingredients with the food he grew up on". The shaking beef is part of that. The question asks which dish his mother taught him during the refugee camp. The article says he cooked for the family, but the specific dish's origin isn't tied to the camp. So perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says: "the food he grew up on" so maybe the dish was from his childhood in Vietnam, not the camp. So the answer would be N/A for question 1? I'm confused now. Let me recheck the exact text.

The article states: "the food he grew up on" in the context of the restaurant. The shaking beef is a dish from Vietnam, which he transformed. The question is about a dish his mother taught him during the refugee camp. The article mentions that in the refugee camp, after fleeing, the family was in a camp for 1.5 years. The article says "At home, he cooked for the family while his parents each worked two jobs." So he cooked, but it doesn't specify that the shaking beef was a dish from that time. The question might be a trick, but the only dish mentioned as his signature is shaking beef. Since the question says "taught him during their time in the refugee camp", and the article doesn't state that, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe the "food he grew up on" includes dishes from before the refugee camp. The question is asking if the dish was taught during the camp. Since the article doesn't say that, it's N/A. So I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me adjust that. So question 1 answer is N/A.

Wait, but the article says: "he realized that making his mother's dishes with local ingredients..." So maybe the dish in question is his mother's dish. The shaking beef is part of his mother's dishes? The article says "the food he grew up on". The question specifies "taught him during their time in the refugee camp". Since the mother was with him in the camp, maybe she taught him then. But the article says "his mother's dishes" in general. The article does not explicitly state that the specific dish (bo luc lac) was taught in the camp. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. The question is tricky. Since the article doesn't explicitly state that the dish was taught during the refugee camp, the correct answer would be N/A. I need to be strict. So revising my answers:

1. N/A

2. N/A

3. N/A

4. N/A

5. N/A

6. N/A (the technique is the shaking pan, but not learned from grandmother)

7. N/A

8. N/A

9. N/A

10. N/A

11. his mother

12. University of California, Berkeley

13. bo luc lac

14. 1995

15. Rob Lam

16. tennis

17. curry and rice

18. Parts Unknown

19. Iron Chef

20. Joan Nathan

Wait, the question 6 asks about a traditional technique learned from grandmother. The article says "the name refers to the way a cook must keep a hot pan in constant motion to sear the meat." It doesn't mention learning from grandmother. So N/A.

Okay, I think that's all. Let me go through each question again with this in mind.
