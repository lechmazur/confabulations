Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Which Rolling Stones album featured Marianne Faithfull's first recording of "Sister Morphine" before the legal battle over songwriting credits?**  
   The article mentions that "Sister Morphine" appears on the Rolling Stones' 1971 album "Sticky Fingers." The legal battle came later, so the answer should be "Sticky Fingers."

2. **During which decade did Warren Ellis first begin collaborating with Faithfull on her poetry-focused recordings?**  
   The article says that "She Walks in Beauty" (her final album) was produced by Warren Ellis. Since the interview was in 2021 and the album was her final one, the collaboration likely started in the 2010s or 2020s. But the article mentions Ellis as a "friend and collaborator" from her later years. The article doesn’t specify the exact start date, but "She Walks in Beauty" is from 2021, so the decade is 2020s? Wait, but the question is about when he first started. Hmm. The article also mentions Ellis contributed to "Give My Love to London" in 2014. So that's 2010s. So the answer would be 2010s.

3. **What was the name of the hospital where Faithfull wrote "Sister Morphine" after observing a patient receiving pain medication?**  
   The article states she wrote it before her heroin addiction as a character study, but doesn't mention a specific hospital. Answer is N/A.

4. **How many Dylan covers did Faithfull record throughout her career according to her discography mentioned in the article?**  
   The article lists "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue," "Visions of Johanna," "I'll Keep It With Mine," "It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry," and a 2018 re-recording of "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue." Wait, the exact count: the article says "not her only great Dylan cover -- see also: 'Visions of Johanna,' 'I'll Keep It With Mine,' 'It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry,' as well as her 2018 rerecording of this same song." So the main Dylan covers listed are four, plus the re-recording of "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" (which is the same song). But the question is about how many Dylan covers she recorded in total. The article says "this reimagining of a Bob Dylan classic, recorded in 1971, is an early example. It's also not her only great Dylan cover -- see also: [four others]." So total is at least 5. But the exact number? Let me count again. The initial list includes "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" (the 1971 one), then "Visions of Johanna," "I'll Keep It With Mine," "It Takes a Lot to Laugh...", and then the 2018 re-recording of the same song (the first one). But the question is about how many Dylan covers she recorded. The re-recording of the same song counts as one song but two recordings. The article says "she made multiple appearances on my Amplifier playlist of women covering Dylan songs." The exact number mentioned in the article's list is four additional besides the first one, so total five. So the answer is 5.

5. **What was the name of the producer responsible for transforming Faithfull's voice from its girlish tone to the distinctive croak heard on "Broken English"?**  
   The article says "Broken English" was produced by someone? Wait, the article says "Faithfull's 1979 album 'Broken English' is her masterpiece... it's also one of the great comeback records... Years of addiction, a stint of homelessness and a bout of laryngitis had transformed Faithfull's once girlish voice into a defiant survivor's croak that perfectly suited her bleak material, not to mention the concurrent rise of punk." So the transformation was due to her own experiences, not a producer. The article doesn't mention a specific producer for that transformation. The question is about the producer who was responsible. The article doesn't name a producer here. So N/A? Wait, maybe the album "Broken English" had a producer? The article doesn't mention who produced it. The only producer mentioned is Barry Reynolds for "A Child's Adventure." So answer is N/A.

6. **What was the duration of Faithfull's coma during her battle with Covid-19 before recording "She Walks in Beauty"?**  
   The article states she was in a coma from a nasty bout of Covid but doesn't specify the duration. So N/A.

7. **Who played the lead guitar solo on the 2014 recording of "Give My Love to London"?**  
   The article mentions Steve Earle plays guitar on the track, along with Mick Jones of The Clash. It doesn't specify who played the lead solo. So N/A.

8. **What was the settlement amount Faithfull received in 1994 for her unacknowledged contribution to "Sister Morphine"?**  
   The article mentions a legal battle where she was not credited on "Sticky Fingers" and only acknowledged in 1994, but no amount is given. So N/A.

9. **Which film director commissioned Angelo Badalamenti to work with Faithfull on "A Secret Life"?**  
   The article mentions Angelo Badalamenti as David Lynch's favorite composer, so it was David Lynch who commissioned him. The question is about the director who commissioned him. The answer is David Lynch.

10. **What was the chart position of Faithfull's final recording of "As Tears Go By" in 2018?**  
    The article says her debut single was a British Top 10 hit. The 2018 version is mentioned as a rerecording but doesn't state its chart position. So N/A.

11. **Which album released after Marianne Faithfull's coma features her reciting Romantic poetry with compositions by a frequent collaborator mentioned in both her 2021 interview and her later work?**  
    The article says "She Walks in Beauty" was her final album, produced by Warren Ellis, and she was recovering from Covid when she recorded it. So the answer is "She Walks in Beauty."

12. **What song co-written with a member of The Clash appears on an album that also includes contributions from Warren Ellis, as noted in the discussion of her 2014 release?**  
    The track "Give My Love to London" from the 2014 album was co-written with Steve Earle and features Mick Jones (Clash member) on guitar, and Warren Ellis contributed to that album. So the song is "Give My Love to London."

13. **Which track from "Broken English" directly references a film that shares its thematic focus on female rebellion, as implied by its association with a 1991 movie?**  
    The article mentions "The Ballad of Lucy Jordan" was in the 1991 movie "Thelma & Louise," which is about female rebellion. So the track is "The Ballad of Lucy Jordan."

14. **What 1971 Rolling Stones song did Faithfull later claim in her memoir had inadvertently foreshadowed her struggles, despite initially being written as a character study?**  
    The song is "Sister Morphine," as stated in the article. She wrote it before her addiction, but it became a precursor to her struggles.

15. **Which album marked Faithfull's transition to cabaret-style interpretations and was released immediately after she overcame an addiction mentioned in the context of her 1987 work?**  
    The article says "Strange Weather" (1987) was her first album after kicking heroin addiction, and it marked her reinvention as a cabaret singer. So "Strange Weather."

16. **What Shel Silverstein-penned song did Faithfull reinterpret in a way that became synonymous with a cinematic portrayal of suburban disillusionment, as noted in the playlist's sixth track?**  
    The sixth track is "The Ballad of Lucy Jordan," which was in "Thelma & Louise." Shel Silverstein wrote it. So the answer is "The Ballad of Lucy Jordan."

17. **Which Dylan cover by Faithfull was rerecorded twice, with one version highlighted in a separate Amplifier playlist focused on women's interpretations of his work?**  
    The article mentions she re-recorded "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" in 2018, and that version is part of the playlist. The original was in 1971. So that song was recorded twice. The question asks which one was rerecorded twice (so original plus two more? Or two times total?) The article says "she made multiple appearances... including her 2018 rerecording of this same song." So the song is "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue."

18. **What legal dispute involving songwriting credits is directly tied to a track Faithfull wrote but was not initially acknowledged for on a Rolling Stones album?**  
    The track is "Sister Morphine" on "Sticky Fingers," where she wasn't credited until 1994 after a legal battle.

19. **Which collaborator produced both "She Walks in Beauty" and the album featuring "Times Square," based on descriptions of her work in the 1980s and 2020s?**  
    "She Walks in Beauty" was produced by Warren Ellis. The article mentions "Times Square" is from 1983's "A Child's Adventure," produced by Barry Reynolds. Wait, but the question says "based on descriptions of her work in the 1980s and 2020s." The collaborator must be Warren Ellis? Because Ellis worked with her on later albums. The article says Warren Ellis was a close collaborator in her later years. "Times Square" was produced by Barry Reynolds, so unless Ellis also produced that... no. Wait, the article says "Times Square" is from 1983, produced by Barry Reynolds. So unless the question is wrong? The question might be a trick. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Warren Ellis if "Times Square" was on an album he produced? But the article says Barry Reynolds produced "A Child's Adventure." So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "based on descriptions of her work in the 1980s and 2020s." "She Walks in Beauty" is 2021 (2020s), produced by Ellis. "Times Square" is 1983 (1980s), produced by Reynolds. So no common producer. Therefore N/A.

20. **What Grammy-winning artist is quoted verbatim in the article's closing remarks about the 2024 ceremony, alongside references to Beyoncé's Album of the Year win?**  
    The closing mentions "the Grammy winner Chappell Roan" with the quote. So the artist is Chappell Roan.
