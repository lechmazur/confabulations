Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks which former U.S. president Panamanian President Mulino quoted during the wreath-laying ceremony. Scanning the article, I see that during the ceremony, President Mulino said, "The canal is and will continue to be Panamanian," but there's no mention of him quoting a former U.S. president. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The article mentions China's investments in Panama through the Belt and Road Initiative, including a canal bridge, but doesn't specify the amount between 2017 and Trump's recent statements. Since there's no figure given, answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The 1964 protests involved students planting the flag, but the article doesn't name the student organization. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The article states that ports at the canal's ends are operated by companies from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the U.S. The European country's company isn't mentioned here. The answer is N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The Panama Canal Authority mentions they made investments, but there's no percentage given for global trade. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The article mentions CK Hutchison Holdings is owned by a Hong Kong billionaire family but doesn't name the individual. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The article says U.S. officials are concerned about China's influence via ports, but doesn't specify military equipment monitored. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Ramon Martinez talks about scaling back agreements with China but doesn't mention other Latin American countries as examples. Answer N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Carlos Bonilla Caco mentions his brother died in the 1964 protests, but the total death toll isn't stated. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Varela broke ties with Taiwan and aligned with Beijing, but specific concessions aren't listed. The article mentions business agreements, but not exact terms. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: John Feeley says Trump met with President Varela (Juan Carlos Varela) in 2017. So that's one president besides Mulino. Answer is 1.

12. **Question 12**: The program China used was the Belt and Road Initiative. The article mentions this when talking about the canal bridge. So answer is Belt and Road Initiative.

13. **Question 13**: Giulia de Sanctis is president of the Panamanian Association of Business Executives. Directly stated.

14. **Question 14**: The article mentions Kenya and Sri Lanka as examples of Chinese investments, but in Latin America, only Panama is discussed. So N/A.

15. **Question 15**: The annual cost was about $1 million, as per John Feeley. The article states this.

16. **Question 16**: Jacqueline Williams is a nonprofit educator. The article says she's a nonprofit educator visiting from NYC.

17. **Question 17**: The U.S. built the canal for military purposes, according to the Panama Canal Authority. That's stated.

18. **Question 18**: Ramon Martinez halted a free-trade agreement with China under negotiation. Directly mentioned.

19. **Question 19**: The company is CK Hutchison Holdings. The article mentions this name multiple times.

20. **Question 20**: The Atlantic entrance ports are operated by companies from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the U.S. So the other country is the U.S. But the question asks for a country other than Panama, so the answer is the United States.

Wait, let me check again for each:

1. Mulino didn't quote a former U.S. president, so N/A.

2. No figures given, N/A.

3. No org name, N/A.

4. The European country's company isn't mentioned; the Atlantic ports are run by Hong Kong, Taiwan, and US companies. The question asks for a European competitor. Since the article only lists HK, Taiwan, and US, no European country is mentioned. So N/A.

5. No percentage given, N/A.

6. The owner is a Hong Kong billionaire family, but no name. N/A.

7. The article doesn't specify equipment monitored, N/A.

8. No other countries mentioned, N/A.

9. Death toll not stated, N/A.

10. The article says "several business agreements" but no specific concessions, so N/A.

11. Varela is one president besides Mulino, so 1.

12. Belt and Road Initiative is correct.

13. Panamanian Association of Business Executives.

14. The article mentions Latin America but examples like Kenya and Sri Lanka are outside. The question asks for Latin American countries, so N/A.

15. $1 million annually.

16. Nonprofit educator.

17. Military purposes.

18. Free-trade agreement.

19. CK Hutchison Holdings.

20. The Atlantic ports are operated by companies from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the U.S. The question asks for another country besides Panama, so the answer is the United States (since one of the ports is operated by a US company).
