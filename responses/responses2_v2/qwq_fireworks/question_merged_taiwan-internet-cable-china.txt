Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let's start with the first question.

1. **Total monetary value of damage caused by the Chinese vessel**: The article doesn't mention any specific monetary value. It talks about damage to the cable but no numbers, so I'll have to put N/A here.

2. **Japanese telecommunications company that detected the damage**: The article says Chunghwa Telecom, which is Taiwan's main provider, received the notification. It doesn't mention a Japanese company. So N/A again.

3. **Number of crew members interviewed before rough seas stopped them**: The article states the crew were seven Chinese nationals, but it doesn't say how many were interviewed. It mentions the waves were too large to board, so maybe they didn't interview any. The answer might be N/A since there's no info on successful interviews.

4. **Distance in nautical miles between damage and interception**: The article says the vessel was intercepted near Keelung where the cable makes landfall, but no specific distance is given. So N/A.

5. **Average speed during 9-hour period**: The article doesn't provide speed data. Even if there was AIS data, without numbers, it's N/A.

6. **Senior Taiwanese defense official's name**: The article mentions Yisuo Tzeng from the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, but he's a researcher, not a government official. The Coast Guard Administration made statements, but no specific official's name. So N/A.

7. **Number of previous cable breaks linked to Chinese vessels**: The article says there were about 30 breaks between 2017-2023 but doesn't specify how many were conclusively linked to China. So N/A.

8. **Percentage of internet traffic through the damaged cable**: The article doesn't provide percentages for any cables. N/A.

9. **When Jie Yang Trading Ltd registered under Tanzanian flag**: The article says the vessel was registered under Cameroon and Tanzania, but the registration date isn't mentioned. The ownership change was in April 2024, but that's about ownership, not registration date. So N/A.

10. **Number of satellites launched**: The article mentions Taiwan is pursuing a backup with satellites but doesn't state how many have been launched. So N/A.

11. **True vessel name from AIS discrepancies**: The analysis suggests "Xing Shun 39" is real, "Shun Xing 39" fake. The answer should be Xing Shun 39.

12. **Company that assumed control in April 2024**: The article says Jie Yang Trading Ltd took over Xing Shun 39 in April 2024. So that's the answer.

13. **Country besides Cameroon mentioned for flag of convenience**: The Coast Guard said the ship had flags of Cameroon and Tanzania. So Tanzania is the other country, casting doubt.

14. **Name of the trans-Pacific cable**: The article mentions the Trans-Pacific Express Cable, so that's the answer.

15. **Backup network avoiding SpaceX**: The article says Taiwan is building low-Earth orbit satellites without Elon Musk/SpaceX. The answer is the low-Earth orbit satellite network.

16. **Effect of China's provocations on defense readiness**: The researcher Tzeng says it has a desensitizing effect over time, risking being caught off guard. The answer is "desensitizing effect".

17. **Local time the broadcast ceased**: The article states Shun Xing 39 stopped at 4:51 p.m. local time.

18. **Incident in northern European sea**: The Baltic Sea cables were severed in November, leading to scrutiny of a Chinese ship. The answer is the severed cables under the Baltic Sea.

19. **Tactic with false identity as psychological warfare**: The article mentions using fake AIS names like Shun Xing 39. The tactic is using fake names/identities.

20. **Month and year ownership assumed**: April 2024 as per the article.
