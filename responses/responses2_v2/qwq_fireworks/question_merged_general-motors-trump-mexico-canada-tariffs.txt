Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I don't look anywhere else except the text given.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions GM might shift production to U.S. plants but doesn't specify states beyond Michigan. The answer is N/A because it just says "U.S. pickup truck plants" without naming states besides Michigan, which is already mentioned in the byline.

2. **Question 2:** The joint venture restructuring in China caused a $4B noncash expense. The question asks how this contributed to market share. The text says "almost all profit came from North America" but doesn't link the restructuring to market share gain. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The article states GM produces some Silverados and electric vans in Canada but doesn't give a percentage of EV sales from there. No data, so N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The executive mentioned is Paul Jacobson talking about plans, but no one specifically outlined battery relocation. The answer is N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The article doesn't mention projected revenue from redirecting vehicles. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** No specific cost per vehicle is given. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Paul Jacobson mentioned working on supply chain, logistics, and assembly plants but didn't announce specific modifications before Feb 1. The text says theyâ€™re preparing, but no specifics. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The bonus was for 46,000 UAW members in U.S. plants, not Mexican. The question asks about Mexican workers affected, which isn't mentioned. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The projected profits for 2025 don't break down by segments. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The article mentions conversations with Congress and White House but doesn't name Republican leaders. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The bonus is up to $14,500 each for 46,000 members. Total would be 14,500 * 46,000, but the question asks for the total bonus pool. The article states the per-person amount and number, so calculation possible. But the question says "total bonus pool amount" which can be computed. Wait, the article says "up to $14,500 each to 46,000 members". So total would be up to (14,500 *46,000). But does the article explicitly state the total? It says "bonus of up to $14,500 each" so the total isn't directly given. The question is about the total amount distributed. Since it's "up to" but not the exact figure, maybe N/A? Or maybe the total is implied? Hmm, tricky. The question says "total bonus pool amount distributed", but the article only gives per person and count. Since they can vary per person, maybe exact total isn't stated. So N/A?

12. **Question 12:** The Canadian-produced vehicles mentioned are Silverados and electric vans. The question asks which EV models in Canada are at risk. The text says "electric delivery vans" but no specific models. So N/A.

13. **Question 13:** The stock closed down 9% due to tariff concerns and China restructuring. The question attributes the decline specifically to China costs. But the article says "mainly on concerns about tariffs". So the 9% drop is mainly tariffs, not the China restructuring. So the answer would be N/A because the decline is mainly from tariffs, not the China costs. 

14. **Question 14:** The article doesn't name specific foreign markets. N/A.

15. **Question 15:** The tariff start date is Feb 1, 2025? Wait, the article says "starting Saturday, Feb. 1." Wait, the article's date isn't given, but the tariff was planned for Feb 1. The question asks for the exact date in February 2025? The text says "Feb. 1" but doesn't specify the year. The article mentions 2024 in some parts. Wait, the article's context: "produced nearly 900,000 vehicles in Mexico in 2024". The tariff was planned for Feb 1 (year not specified, but since it's in the article's present, maybe 2025? The question says "in February 2025". The article says "starting Saturday, Feb. 1." Assuming that's 2025? The question's exact date would be February 1, so answer is Feb 1. But the question says "exact date in February 2025", so the answer is February 1.

16. **Question 16:** The analyst mentioned is Jeff Windau from Edward Jones, who said concerns about tariffs and demand. The question asks who incorrectly attributed profit decline to demand for ICE vehicles instead of tariffs. The article says Jeff Windau's note mentioned tariffs affecting demand. The profit decline was due to restructuring China (the $4B expense), not tariffs. The analyst's comment was about tariffs affecting demand, but the profit decline was from China. So Jeff Windau didn't attribute the profit decline to demand for ICE vehicles; the article's profit decline (Q4 loss) was due to China. So maybe the answer is Jeff Windau? Let me check: The article says "G.M. reported a $6 billion profit, down from $10.1 billion in 2023. Almost all profit came from North America." The $3B Q4 loss was from the China noncash expense. The analyst's note says "Trade policies could be detrimental for demand and thus pressure profits." The analyst is talking about tariffs affecting demand, but the profit decline (from 10.1 to 6) might be due to other factors. The question states that the analyst incorrectly blamed the 2024 profit decline on weakening demand for ICE instead of tariffs. The article says the 2024 profit was $6B vs $10.1B. The drop might be due to the China restructuring. Jeff Windau's comment is about tariffs affecting demand, but the analyst's note is a research note, maybe he's talking about future impact. The question's phrasing is tricky. The answer might be Jeff Windau, since he linked tariffs to demand, but the profit decline in 2024 was due to China. So the analyst incorrectly attributed the 2024 profit decline to demand (from tariffs) instead of the China restructuring. So the answer is Jeff Windau. 

17. **Question 17:** Revenue rose 11% in the quarter, but the question is for full-year 2024 excluding China losses. The article says "revenue in the quarter rose 11 percent" but the full-year revenue isn't specified. The question says "excluding losses from its Chinese operations". The 11% is for the quarter. Since the full-year revenue isn't given, N/A.

18. **Question 18:** The article mentions expanding U.S. plants but doesn't specify a state. The byline says Neal is based in Michigan, but that's not the answer. The text says "U.S. pickup truck plants" but no state. So N/A.

19. **Question 19:** The article says they fell short of 200k EVs in North America, but doesn't mention Mexico's target. N/A.

20. **Question 20:** Paul Jacobson talked about EV production and tax breaks, but the question asks which legislative measure he credited. The article mentions "Biden-era tax breaks" but no specific law name. So N/A.
