Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions beyond that. Let me go through each question and see what the article says.

1. **Question 1:** Which New Mexico state legislator was initially appointed as special prosecutor before stepping down due to constitutional concerns?  
The article mentions Andrea Reeb as the special prosecutor who stepped down because she was serving as a lawmaker and prosecutor, which violated the state constitution. So the answer should be Andrea Reeb.

2. **Question 2:** How many months after the shooting was the law passed that prosecutors incorrectly used to charge Baldwin with a mandatory minimum sentence?  
The article states that the law wasn't passed until months after the shooting. The shooting was in October 2021, and the law was mentioned as being passed after. But the exact months aren't given. Wait, the article says "a law that was not passed until months after the fatal shooting." Since the shooting was in 2021, but the exact months aren't specified. The answer might be "N/A" because the number of months isn't stated. Hmm, but maybe the law was passed in the same year? Not sure. The article doesn't specify, so N/A.

3. **Question 3:** What was the name of the judge who ruled on Baldwin's initial criminal trial in Santa Fe District Court?  
The judge is named Mary Marlowe Sommer. That's clear.

4. **Question 4:** According to forensic evidence presented at trial, what type of ammunition was loaded into the revolver before the fatal shooting?  
The article says the gun discharged a live bullet. So live ammunition. The answer is "live ammunition".

5. **Question 5:** What was the duration of the mandatory minimum prison sentence that prosecutors initially claimed Baldwin would face if convicted?  
The DA's team said five years minimum initially. So five years.

6. **Question 6:** Which law enforcement agency discovered the tranche of ammunition in March that led to the case being thrown out?  
The article mentions "a tranche of ammunition delivered to local law enforcement in March" but doesn't name the agency. It mentions Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office as part of the defendants. Since the initial investigation was by them, maybe they found it. But the article says "delivered to local law enforcement" which could be the same as the sheriff's office. But it's not explicitly stated. So maybe N/A? Wait, the text says "Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office, which handled the initial investigation into the shooting" so perhaps that's the agency. But the exact discovery isn't clear. Hmm, the article says the evidence was withheld, but which agency found it? The text says "a tranche of ammunition delivered to local law enforcement in March" but doesn't specify which agency. So maybe N/A. Wait, the answer might be Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office because they did the initial investigation. But the article doesn't explicitly say they found it. The judge dismissed the case because evidence was withheld, but the agency that discovered it isn't mentioned. So probably N/A.

7. **Question 7:** What was the date when prosecutors became aware of Baldwin's intention to file a civil lawsuit?  
The article says "In October 2023 the prosecution team became aware..." So October 2023.

8. **Question 8:** How many defendants were named in Baldwin's civil lawsuit against New Mexico officials?  
The defendants listed include Carmack-Altwies, Reeb, Morrissey, officials in Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office, and the Board of County Commissioners. The exact number isn't given. The article mentions "Mary Carmack-Altwies, Ms. Reeb and Ms. Morrissey are all named as defendants, as are officials in the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office, and the Board of County Commissioners." So at least 3 prosecutors plus others. But the exact count isn't stated. Since the question asks for the number, and it's not specified, the answer is N/A.

9. **Question 9:** What was the professional title of Andrea Reeb at the time she sent the email about the case helping her campaign?  
She was a special prosecutor at the time. The email was part of her role in the case. The title would be "special prosecutor".

10. **Question 10:** When did the New Mexico Attorney General's office decline to support the prosecution's appeal of the dismissed charges?  
The article says "the New Mexico attorney general's office, which oversees criminal appeals, declined to back the effort" and that Morrissey withdrew the appeal last month (from when the article was written, but the article was published in October 2023, so "last month" would be September 2023? But the exact date isn't given. The article says "last month" but without a specific date, so maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "She withdrew the appeal last month after the New Mexico attorney general's office... declined to back the effort." So the decline happened before the withdrawal, but the exact date isn't provided. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** What legal precedent did Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer cite when ruling on the admissibility of the tranche of ammunition delivered to law enforcement, ultimately impacting the potential for retrial?  
The article doesn't mention any specific legal precedent by name. The judge dismissed the case because evidence was withheld. So N/A.

12. **Question 12:** How many years after the "Rust" shooting did the New Mexico legislature pass the law under which Mary Carmack-Altwies initially charged Baldwin?  
The shooting was in 2021, and the law was passed "months after the fatal shooting." Since months are less than a year, the answer would be 0 years. But the question asks for years after. Since it's months, the answer is 0. Wait, the question is tricky. If the law was passed in 2022, then it's 1 year after, but if within the same year, 0. The article says "months after the fatal shooting", so same year (2021), so 0 years. But the article says the law was "not passed until months after the fatal shooting." So the answer is 0 years.

13. **Question 13:** What specific type of old-fashioned revolver, mentioned by Joel Souza as being involved in the incident, was Baldwin practicing with when the fatal shooting occurred?  
The article mentions "antique-style revolver" but doesn't specify the exact model or type. So N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Besides legal expenses, what other form of compensation, similar to that sought by Halyna Hutchins' relatives, is Baldwin seeking in his lawsuit against the Board of County Commissioners?  
The lawsuit seeks "monetary damages stemming from 'legal expenses, loss of income, severe emotional distress, mental anguish and embarrassment.'" So severe emotional distress is one. The question asks for another form similar to Hutchins' relatives. The relatives would be seeking damages for death, but the question asks what Baldwin is seeking besides legal expenses. The answer is "severe emotional distress" or "mental anguish". The question specifies "similar to that sought by Halyna Hutchins' relatives"â€”they might seek wrongful death damages, but Baldwin is seeking emotional distress. The question asks what else besides legal expenses, so "severe emotional distress".

15. **Question 15:** What was the title of the NBC News report that detailed the special prosecutors' alleged discussions about the case, according to Luke Nikas?  
The article says NBC News reported "the special prosecutors have had discussions in which they said they hope the trial will 'humble' Baldwin," but the report's title isn't mentioned. So N/A.

16. **Question 16:** In what month of 2022 did Andrea Reeb suggest that assisting with the Baldwin case might benefit her campaign for State Legislature?  
The email from Reeb is mentioned but the exact month isn't given. The article doesn't specify the month, so N/A.

17. **Question 17:** What was the monetary value of the severe emotional distress damages that Baldwin is claiming, as outlined in the lawsuit filed in the First Judicial District Court?  
The article doesn't mention a specific monetary figure, so N/A.

18. **Question 18:** What was the deciding factor that led the New Mexico attorney general's office to support Kari T. Morrissey's initial appeal of the judge's dismissal?  
The article says the AG's office declined to back the appeal. It doesn't mention a deciding factor for supporting it, so N/A.

19. **Question 19:** What was the name of the forensic expert cited by Kari T. Morrissey who provided evidence contradicting Baldwin's claim about not pulling the trigger?  
No name is given for the forensic expert, so N/A.

20. **Question 20:** According to SAG-AFTRA, what safety protocol, specifically related to the handling of dummy rounds, did Baldwin allegedly fail to follow on the set of "Rust"?  
SAG-AFTRA said firearms professionals, not actors, are responsible for checking guns. So Baldwin didn't check the dummy rounds himself. The protocol would be that actors shouldn't be responsible, so the failure is that he didn't check, but the protocol is that it's the professionals' job. The answer is "checking to ensure dummy rounds were loaded" was the responsibility of the firearms professionals, so Baldwin didn't follow the protocol by not doing that. Wait, the question asks what protocol Baldwin failed to follow. The protocol is that firearms professionals are responsible, so Baldwin shouldn't have to check. Therefore, the answer might be "checking the gun before handling" or "failing to confirm dummy rounds were used". The article says Morrissey argued Baldwin should have checked. SAG-AFTRA says it's the professionals' job. So the protocol Baldwin failed is "checking the gun before pointing it at people" as per Morrissey's argument, but according to SAG-AFTRA, he wasn't supposed to. The question is asking what SAG-AFTRA says the protocol was. The protocol is that firearms professionals are responsible, so Baldwin didn't fail that. But the question is phrased as "what safety protocol... did Baldwin allegedly fail to follow?" According to SAG-AFTRA, he didn't need to, so the answer is N/A? Wait, the question is about what SAG-AFTRA states the protocol was, which would be that actors aren't responsible. But the question is asking what protocol Baldwin failed to follow, and SAG-AFTRA says he didn't need to. So the answer would be N/A because SAG-AFTRA says he didn't have that duty. But the article says "SAG-AFTRA, the union which represents actors, disputed that, saying that firearms professionals, not actors, are responsible for checking guns on sets." So the protocol is that actors aren't responsible, so Baldwin didn't fail that. The question asks what protocol did Baldwin fail to follow, according to SAG-AFTRA's view, which says he wasn't supposed to. Therefore, the answer is N/A because SAG-AFTRA doesn't say he failed any protocol, they say it's not his job. So the answer is N/A.
