Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not assume anything beyond that.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions that Salt Typhoon targeted "at least nine U.S. telecommunications firms." So the answer is nine.

2. **Question 2:** The Commerce Department noted that Chinese companies like DJI had pushed updates to disable drones in conflict zones. The article specifically mentions DJI and Autel Robotics in the defense bill context. That's two companies.

3. **Question 3:** The article doesn't mention a specific percentage reduction in risks from the restrictions. Raimondo talked about it being an essential step but no exact figure.

4. **Question 4:** The notice says drones could gather info on critical infrastructure like building layouts, but doesn't specify which sectors. The examples given are bridges, construction, etc., but not exact sectors named as targeted by DJI.

5. **Question 5:** The article says the Commerce Department considered measures like design requirements or cybersecurity software as potential mitigations.

6. **Question 6:** The text states China added 28 U.S. companies to their list, but doesn't say how many were there before. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The article only mentions Russia's intent to invest, not past market value. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The article doesn't mention specific agencies having compromised operations due to updates. It just mentions that companies did updates, but not which agencies were affected.

9. **Question 9:** The deadline for comments was March 4, but the question is about implementing measures, which isn't specified. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The article lists possible risks like collision damage but doesn't cite specific incidents. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The Treasury Department was hacked by Chinese intelligence, not the Commerce Department's analysis. So N/A.

12. **Question 12:** The article states Russia has a small portion, but doesn't give a percentage. So N/A.

13. **Question 13:** The defense bill mentions DJI and Autel Robotics. So DJI is one of them.

14. **Question 14:** The article says "at least nine U.S. telecommunications firms," so nine.

15. **Question 15:** The article says Russia's investment could create vulnerabilities, but doesn't specify which infrastructure. Raimondo's statement is about supply chain, not a specific vulnerability.

16. **Question 16:** The Trump administration called for closing USAID. So USAID.

17. **Question 17:** The article says 10 migrants in Guantanamo. The tent city is for 30,000 but the question is about those already held, which is 10.

18. **Question 18:** The uses listed include farming, inspecting pipelines, bridges, etc. The excluded use might be hobbyists, as the question asks for critical infrastructure. The answer would be "hobbyists" but the question is phrased as "explicitly excluded," so check the text. The article says "beyond the use by hobbyists," so hobbyists are excluded from critical uses.

19. **Question 19:** The September announcement's deadline isn't given. The question is about when restrictions were finalized, but the article doesn't specify a deadline after September.

20. **Question 20:** Trudeau mentioned Canada's critical minerals as a reason behind Trump's comments about making it a state. So Canada's minerals, but the question asks which U.S. state. Wait, the article says Trump wanted to make Canada a U.S. state, so the answer is Canada isn't a U.S. state, but the question is phrased as "U.S. state's critical mineral resources." That's a trick. Since Canada isn't a U.S. state, the answer would be N/A. Wait, the article says Trudeau accused Trump of targeting Canada's resources through annexation talk. The question asks which U.S. state, but Canada isn't a U.S. state. So the answer is N/A because the article doesn't mention a U.S. state here.
