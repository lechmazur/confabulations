Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not assume anything else. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks which university's band, nicknamed "Human Jukebox," is referenced as having a pre-anthem performance in New Orleans and revived early traditions involving mapping national symbols. The article mentions Southern University's "Human Jukebox" performing before the national anthem this year. Also, in the first Super Bowl, Grambling and Arizona's bands mapped the U.S. So the answer should be Southern University.

2. The next question refers to a collaboration with a predominantly white institution (University of Arizona) and indirectly mentions Grambling's civil rights participation. The answer here is Grambling (now Grambling State University).

3. The third question mentions early morning rehearsals during a holiday and a president giving cash. The article talks about Colston and Grambling's president Jones giving cash. Colston later worked for the NFL's Washington Commanders. So the answer is Freddie Colston.

4. The decade when controversies about invitations as "empty gestures" emerged. The text says when Grambling was invited in 1967, during the civil rights movement. So the 1960s.

5. The pop icon who started the celebrity era with silence and pyrotechnics. The article says Michael Jackson in 1993 had a show with pyrotechnics, leading to A-listers. So Michael Jackson.

6. The HBCU band that did a tribute after MLK's assassination: Florida A&M's band director created the set. The formation was an eagle and "U.S.A." letters. So Florida A&M.

7. The chant "Pick up your feet..." is from Southern University's Kenny Ricard in 1978. So Southern University.

8. The modern artist with uncertain band plans is Kendrick Lamar, mentioned as headlining the halftime show.

9. The stadium called "the city's living room" is the Superdome in New Orleans. The article mentions the Caesars Superdome hosting the game.

10. The moment with last-minute rehearsals for a pop icon (Prince) and elevated platforms. The answer is Prince's 2007 performance with Florida A&M. The question asks for the ceremonial moment, so "Prince's Super Bowl performance in 2007" but the question might just want the artist, which is Prince. Wait, the question says "ceremonial moment linked to a celebrated pop icon signals this transformation". The article mentions Florida A&M supporting Prince in 2007 with last-minute rehearsal. The answer should be Prince.
