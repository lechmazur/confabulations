Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful and only use the information given.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions the rock is "school-bus-size," but doesn't give a specific diameter in meters. Since the exact number isn't there, it's N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The text says samples were collected by Apollo crews and a Soviet robot lander. The question asks for the Soviet cosmonaut, but the article mentions a "robot lander," not a human. So no name given, so N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The closest approach distance isn't specified in the article. The horseshoe trajectory is mentioned, but no kilometers given. N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The impact's velocity isn't stated. The article only says it was from an impact within the last tens of thousands of years. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The study on 469219 Kamo`oalewa's silicate composition was mentioned in a 2021 study, but the article doesn't name the university. However, Dr. Reddy is from the University of Arizona and reviewed the study. Wait, but the question is about the team that first identified it. The article says "a 2021 study identified... Kamo`oalewa as possibly lunar in origin." The university isn't specified here. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The orbital period around the Sun isn't mentioned. The article talks about its trajectory relative to Earth, but not its solar orbit period. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The team's other findings during August 2024 aren't discussed. The article mentions a forthcoming paper by another team (Marcos) about 2022 NX1, but Dr. Kareta's team's count isn't stated. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The mass isn't provided in the text. They mention size (school-bus) but not mass. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The article says a study linked Kamo`oalewa to Giordano Bruno crater, but 2024 PT5's origin crater isn't named. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The wavelength of infrared light used isn't specified. The article just mentions "infrared telescope" and "light patterns," but no specific wavelength. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The discovery instrument was ATLAS, which detected it on Aug 7, leading to further studies. The answer is ATLAS.

12. **Question 12:** China is developing Tianwen-2 for Kamo`oalewa. So China.

13. **Question 13:** Dr. Reddy is the professor who reviewed the study and commented on the evidence. The article says he was a doctoral adviser to two authors. So Vishnu Reddy.

14. **Question 14:** The comparison was with silicate-rich lunar grains. The mineralogical characteristic is "silicate-rich."

15. **Question 15:** The upcoming paper mentions 2022 NX1 as another possible lunar ejecta. The third object alongside 2024 PT5 and Kamo`oalewa would be 2022 NX1.

16. **Question 16:** The term used is "horseshoe trajectory" and "barely moving with respect to Earth." The exact term for the minimal motion might be "horseshoe trajectory," but the question asks for the term describing minimal motion. The article says "barely moving," but the exact term used in the text is "horseshoe trajectory." Wait, the question is about the term for the minimal motion. The article says "minimal motion relative to Earth" but the term used in the text is "horseshoe trajectory." Alternatively, maybe "quasi-satellite"? Wait, the article says "horseshoe trajectory" and "mini-moon" but the term for the motion is "horseshoe trajectory." The question's phrasing says "term describing an orbital behavior... characterized by minimal motion..." The answer is "horseshoe trajectory."

17. **Question 17:** The Lowell Discovery Telescope in Arizona contributed to follow-up observations. So Lowell Observatory.

18. **Question 18:** Blue Origin, owned by Jeff Bezos, sent its first rocket into orbit. So Blue Origin.

19. **Question 19:** The FAA investigated the SpaceX test flight debris and suspended launches. So FAA.

20. **Question 20:** The impact occurred "within the past tens of thousand years." The timespan is "tens of thousands of years."
