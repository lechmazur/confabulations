Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information given in the article and answer exactly what's asked. Let me start by going through each question and cross-referencing with the article text.

1. **Question 1:** The Guardian interview mentions Samantha Harvey comparing a natural phenomenon to the characters' emotional shift. The article says she talks about looking at Earth from space and feeling peace. The exact quote is: "When I zoom out, I can feel something that more resembles peace." Wait, the question asks for a natural phenomenon she compared it to. Hmm, maybe the phenomenon is Earth itself? Wait, the question says "compared to the emotional perspective shift". Wait, the article says "When I'm down here on Earth... but when I zoom out, I can feel peace..." So maybe the comparison is to looking at Earth from space? Or is there a specific phenomenon mentioned? Let me check again. The Guardian interview excerpt says: "When I'm down here on Earth, I find it difficult to be consoled by the things that we're doing to the Earth and to one another. But when I zoom out, I can feel something that more resembles peace. I can look at it almost without judgment, just look at its beauty," Harvey said. The natural phenomenon here is Earth's beauty when viewed from orbit. Wait, the question is asking what natural phenomenon she compared the emotional shift to. But maybe the answer is "Earth's beauty" or "Earth" itself? Let me see if the article states a specific phenomenon like "the cosmos" or "space." The article says "zoom out" to look at Earth's beauty. The question is asking for the natural phenomenon she compared the emotional shift to. Maybe the answer is "Earth" or "the planet." The article says "looking back on the planet from orbit and reflect..." So perhaps the natural phenomenon is Earth. The question might be looking for Earth as the answer here. 

2. **Question 2:** The Booker Prize-winning novel highlighted is "Orbital" by Samantha Harvey. The first paragraph mentions that the Book Club will read "Orbital," a Booker Prize-winning novel. The article also states that "Orbital" won the Booker Prize last year. So the answer is "Orbital."

3. **Question 3:** The altitude given alongside the orbit of 16 times a day is 250 miles. The article says: "orbiting the planet 16 times every 24 hours. ... six people working on a space station above Earth ... reflect on life's difficulties while floating 250 miles above their home." So the altitude is 250 miles.

4. **Question 4:** The novel described as restoring Earth's magic is "Orbital." The review quote says: "The book is ravishingly beautiful. ... The novel's refreshing view of Earth restores some of life's original magic." Since the article is about "Orbital," that's the book.

5. **Question 5:** The author in the Guardian interview is Samantha Harvey. The article's Guardian interview is attributed to her, so the answer is her name.

6. **Question 6:** The novelist in "Back to the Courtroom" section is Scott Turow. The section starts with "The novelist Scott Turow is 75. Rusty Sabich, the now-retired prosecutor he introduced in 'Presumed Innocent,' is 77 -- and taking on a new case in 'Presumed Guilty.'" So the answer is Scott Turow.

7. **Question 7:** The Nobel Prize-winning author in "Mining Her Country's Nightmares" is Han Kang. The segment says: "Han Kang has probed at the seams of South Korea's historic wounds. The Nobel laureate's latest novel, 'We Do Not Part,' delves into why atrocities must be remembered."

8. **Question 8:** The writer after the African publishing section is Nnedi Okorafor. The next section after "A 'Renaissance' in African Publishing" is "A Turn to Reality: Nnedi Okorafor, an award-winning science fiction and fantasy writer, explores a traumatic event in her most autobiographical novel yet."

9. **Question 9:** The podcast discussion is on February 28. The article states: "We'll be chatting about the book on the Book Review podcast that airs on Feb. 28."

10. **Question 10:** The compound descriptor from the review is "lyricism and acuity." The Booker judges' citation says: "With her language of lyricism and acuity Harvey makes our world strange and new for us." The compound descriptor is "lyricism and acuity."

11. **Question 11:** The theme distinguishing it from adventure stories is "meditation on what it means to be human." The article says: "It's a quiet meditation on what it means to be human, prompted by a series of personal reckonings each character faces..."

Wait, let me check each again to ensure accuracy.

1. The first question: The natural phenomenon compared to the emotional shift. The article says Harvey's quote is about looking at Earth's beauty from space leading to peace. The question is asking what natural phenomenon she compared the emotional shift to. The comparison is between the emotional perspective (feeling peace) and the act of zooming out to view Earth. The natural phenomenon here is Earth itself, perhaps. The question might be looking for Earth's beauty, but the exact wording in the interview is about looking at Earth's beauty. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "the cosmos" but the article says "look at its beauty" where "it" refers to Earth. So the natural phenomenon is Earth. But the question says "compared to the emotional perspective shift." Wait, maybe the question is phrased as a simile? The article says "zoom out" to see Earth's beauty, which caused an emotional shift. The natural phenomenon is Earth's beauty. But the question might be looking for "Earth" as the phenomenon. Let me check the exact quote again. The interview says: "I can look at it almost without judgment, just look at its beauty," where "it" refers to Earth. So the natural phenomenon is Earth. So the answer is Earth. But the question says "compared to the emotional perspective shift"â€”maybe the question is asking what she compared the shift to, like "the planet" or "Earth's beauty." The exact wording in the question is "which natural phenomenon does Samantha Harvey compare to the emotional perspective shift..." So the answer is Earth, since that's what she's looking at that caused the shift. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "the planet" as per the article's wording. The article says "look back on the planet from orbit." So maybe "the planet" is the natural phenomenon. But the article's exact quote from the interview is about Earth, so Earth is the answer here. I think that's correct.

2. "Orbital" is correct.

3. 250 miles.

4. "Orbital" again, since that's the book being discussed.

5. Samantha Harvey.

6. Scott Turow.

7. Han Kang.

8. Nnedi Okorafor.

9. February 28.

10. "lyricism and acuity."

11. "meditation on what it means to be human" or the phrase from the article: "quiet meditation on what it means to be human." The question asks for the overarching theme that distinguishes it from adventure stories. The article says "It's a quiet meditation on what it means to be human, prompted by a series of personal reckonings..." So the answer is the meditation on being human.

I think all answers are covered. Let me check each question again to ensure no mistakes.

Question 1: The natural phenomenon compared to the emotional shift. The article says that when Harvey looks at Earth from space (zooms out), she feels peace. So the natural phenomenon is Earth. The answer should be Earth.

Yes. That's the only natural phenomenon mentioned in that context. The question is about what she compared the emotional shift to, but the comparison is implied through viewing Earth. So the answer is Earth.
