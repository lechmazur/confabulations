Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the given article and answer exactly what's asked.

1. The first question asks about an Italian artist whose work with gold-leaf miniatures in the mid-15th century is highlighted as an early reflective tool. The article mentions Bonifacio Bembo's cards as the earliest known tarot cards with gold-leaf. So the answer is Bonifacio Bembo.

2. The second question refers to a deck with a psychedelic style by someone discovered in the Magic Circle archives. The text mentions Austin Osman Spare's deck with psychedelic visuals found there. So Austin Osman Spare is the answer.

3. The third question is about a deck that transforms the Ace of Swords into a digital portal with terms like 'infowar'. The article talks about Suzanne Treister's "Hexen 2.0" deck where Ace of Swords is a dark portal with those motifs. So Suzanne Treister.

4. The fourth question asks the century when tarot began its mysticism link. The article states that in 1781, Antoine Court de Gebelin started the occult association. 1781 is late 18th century, so the answer is 18th.

5. The fifth question is about the Italian writer with a 1973 novel using tarot for storytelling. The article mentions Italo Calvino's "The Castle of Crossed Destinies". So Italo Calvino.

6. The sixth question asks the French clergyman who promoted Egyptian symbolism in tarot. The article clearly states Antoine Court de Gebelin. Need to check if the name is spelled correctly, but the correction in the article says his name is correct here, so that's the answer.

7. The seventh question is about an interactive tarot for a town's development. The article mentions Katie Anderson's "Barrow Tarot" for Barrow's development. So Katie Anderson.

8. The eighth question refers to the Baroque artist with images like a street artist and Cupid. The first paragraph mentions Giuseppe Maria Mitelli as the Baroque artist who painted those images. So Giuseppe Maria Mitelli.

9. The ninth question connects to Aby Warburg's 1909 collection. The article says Warburg started collecting tarot decks in 1909 as part of his project on ancient myths. So Aby Warburg.

10. The tenth question is about the European city that standardized the deck via printing. The text says Marseilles used efficient printing to standardize the 78-card deck. So Marseilles.

Wait, let me double-check each to ensure accuracy.

1. Yes, Bembo is mentioned with gold-leaf mid-15th century. Correct.

2. Austin Osman Spare's deck found in Magic Circle. Yes.

3. Suzanne Treister's Hexen 2.0 with those terms. Correct.

4. 1781 is 18th century. Yes.

5. Italo Calvino's 1973 novel. Correct.

6. Antoine Court de Gebelin. The article had a correction about his name, so that's right.

8. Giuseppe Maria Mitelli. First paragraph. Yes.

9. Aby Warburg started in 1909. Correct.
