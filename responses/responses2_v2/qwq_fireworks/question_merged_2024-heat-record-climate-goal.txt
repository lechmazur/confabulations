Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. Let me start by going through each question carefully and see what the article says.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about the temperature increase in Fahrenheit that triggered mandatory emissions reduction protocols in 2024 according to the World Meteorological Organization's combined estimates. The article mentions that the WMO's combined estimates concluded 1.55 degrees Celsius. Converting that to Fahrenheit, since 1.5C is 2.7F, so 1.55C would be a bit more. But the question specifies Fahrenheit. Let me check the exact numbers. The article states: "the World Meteorological Organization concluded that warming was 1.55 degrees [Celsius]." The question is about Fahrenheit. The previous sentence says "1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit." So 1.55C is slightly above that. But the question asks for the temperature that triggered mandatory protocols. The article doesn't mention any specific Fahrenheit threshold triggering protocols, only that the 1.5C was crossed. Since the question asks for Fahrenheit, maybe it's 2.7F, but the exact value for 1.55C would be 2.79F (since 0.05C is 0.09F). But the article might not state the Fahrenheit equivalent for 1.55C. Wait, the question says "triggered mandatory emissions reduction protocols in 2024" â€“ the article doesn't mention any protocols being triggered by this temperature, so maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "the first year in which global temperatures averaged more than 1.5 degrees Celsius...". The question is about the Fahrenheit equivalent of the threshold (1.5C is 2.7F). Since the question says "triggered mandatory...", but the article doesn't mention any protocols triggered by this, so maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the temperature itself is the trigger, so 2.7F is the threshold (since 1.5C is 2.7F). Wait, the question says "temperature increase in degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels that triggered mandatory..." but the article doesn't state that crossing 1.5C/Fahrenheit triggered any mandatory protocols. So the answer might be N/A. Hmm, tricky. Let me note that.

2. **Question 2**: The Pacific island nation's minister proposing a new framework for negative carbon emissions at the Azerbaijan summit. The article mentions Samoa's minister, Cedric Schuster, saying they should "rise to the occasion with new, highly ambitious policies". But the question is about a "new framework for achieving negative carbon emissions through technological intervention". The article says he called for new policies but doesn't specify "negative emissions" or a framework. So maybe N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Number of consecutive days the heat waves in Bangladesh/India were above 104F. The article says "weekslong, 104-degree-Fahrenheit spring heat waves". "Weekslong" could be weeks, but the exact number isn't given. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The Nature study's required annual percentage reduction starting in 2024 for 1.6C. The article says "To achieve it, nations would need to start slashing emissions at a pace that would strain political, social and economic feasibility." But the exact percentage isn't stated. The Nature study concluded the best hope is around 1.6C, but doesn't specify the annual reduction. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: European country's renewable developer partnering with Carnegie Mellon. The article mentions Orsted of Denmark and Equinor of Norway in the Green Energy Ambitions section. It says they "tap the brakes on offshore wind development". But there's no mention of partnering with Carnegie Mellon. The professor mentioned is Costa Samaras at Carnegie Mellon, but no partnership with a European company is stated. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Dr. Buontempo's threshold for coral reefs becoming unrecoverable. The article quotes him saying "We are facing a very new climate... not prepared for". The coral reefs are mentioned in the context of 1.5 vs 2C. The article states "Scientists... concluded that restricting warming to 1.5 instead of 2 would spare... coral reefs". But Dr. Buontempo didn't specify a temperature for coral reefs. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: U.S. clean energy investment in 2024 when emissions peaked. The article says "despite hundreds of billions of dollars invested in clean-energy technologies, carbon dioxide emissions hit a record in 2024". But the exact amount isn't given. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Dr. Victor's mathematical model. The article says David Victor is a professor at UCSD and mentions his opinion on the gap between reality and the 1.5C trajectory, but doesn't mention a specific model he developed. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Monitoring agency correlating ocean temps with Gulf hurricanes. The article mentions "the effects of the bathtub-warm ocean waters that supercharged hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico" but doesn't attribute this to a specific agency's data. The Copernicus service is mentioned, but not specifically for this correlation. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: China and India's replacement target. The article states they never backed the 1.5C goal but doesn't mention an alternative they proposed. So N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Percentage decrease in emissions projected for the year when NYT published an article about green dog poop bags. The article mentions the dog poop bags in the "Ask NYT Climate" section, which is part of the article's end notes. The question refers to the year of the NYT article, but the article's own context doesn't state when it was published. The article's content is about 2024, but the question's NYT article is part of the given text. The article's own date isn't provided, but the questions are based on the article's content. Since the article mentions "Ask NYT Climate: Are those green dog..." it's part of the article's content. The question asks for the projected percentage decrease in emissions for the year when that article was published. Since the article's content includes the 2024 data, maybe the NYT article is part of the same timeframe, but the article doesn't mention any specific percentage for that year related to emissions. The Nature study's conclusion is about 1.6C, but not the annual reduction needed starting in 2015. The question is about the trajectory from 2015 Paris Agreement. The article says "starting in 2015... would have required steeper cuts". But the exact percentage isn't given. So N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Extreme weather event linked to 2024's temperature increase that forced school closures in Denmark's base country (Denmark). The article says "bathtub-warm ocean waters that supercharged hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and cyclones in the Philippines". Orsted is based in Denmark, so the country is Denmark. The extreme weather causing closures there? The article mentions wildfires in LA, heat waves in Bangladesh/India, hurricanes in Gulf, cyclones in Philippines. Denmark isn't mentioned. Maybe hurricanes affecting Denmark? Not clear. The article doesn't link Denmark to a specific event here. So N/A.

13. **Question 13**: Most crucial renewable energy source other than wind/solar if the U.S. had adhered to Paris under a hypothetical second term. The article mentions electricity use rising again, and wind/solar not keeping pace. The professor from Carnegie Mellon might suggest another source. The article mentions "coal units supply roughly 16% of the U.S. grid" but that's fossil. The question is about a renewable other than wind/solar. Maybe geothermal or hydro? The article doesn't specify. Since the article says wind and solar weren't keeping pace, maybe another source like nuclear? But the article doesn't mention nuclear. So N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Funding mechanism choked off for projects in developing countries that were economically beneficial, related to a country that didn't back the 1.5C goal. The article says "Rich countries... began choking off funding... for fossil-fuel projects... China and India never backed the goal". So the funding choked off was for fossil-fuel projects. The answer is "fossil-fuel projects".

15. **Question 15**: Specific bodily substance used as an example by the professor at the university where the former White House staffer works. The article mentions Dr. Samaras at Carnegie Mellon, who compared the goals to cholesterol guidelines. The substance is cholesterol.

16. **Question 16**: Year prior to Paris when gradual cuts could limit warming to the level of the heat waves (which were at 1.5C?). The article says "starting in 2005 could have made gradual cuts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees". The heat waves in Bangladesh/India reflect the 1.5C average. So the answer is 2005.

17. **Question 17**: Agreement the president-elect (Trump) vowed to withdraw from, criticized for creating tension due to impact on a nation using coal (since China and India didn't back 1.5C, and coal is 16% of US grid). The agreement is the Paris Agreement.

18. **Question 18**: If UN official had proposed a higher limit, what increment above 1.5? The article says "each tiny increment... increases the risks". The professor (Samaras) says moving to 1.75 would give false assurance. So the proposed increment would be 0.25 (to 1.75), but the question asks for the specific increment above 1.5 that would be proposed. The answer is 0.25 degrees, but the question might expect "1.6" or "1.75". The article says "the absolute best... around 1.6", so maybe 1.6. But the question is about a hypothetical higher limit than 1.5, so if UN official had accepted a higher, like 1.6, then the answer is 0.1 (1.6-1.5=0.1). Wait the question says "specific increment of warming, above the level that spared tens of millions...". The level that spared is 1.5, so the increment would be, say, 0.1 (to 1.6). The Nature study says best hope is 1.6, so maybe 0.1. But the question's phrasing might want "0.1 degrees Celsius".

19. **Question 19**: Type of discourse anticipated when discussing realistic goals, characterized by blame. Dr. Victor mentions it could be "toxic, with a bunch of political finger pointing".

20. **Question 20**: Location with supercharged hurricanes due to burning coal (since coal is the fuel source for 16% of US grid via coal units). The article mentions "bathtub-warm ocean waters that supercharged hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico". The fuel source is coal, so the location is the Gulf of Mexico.
