Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks how many distinct choreographic sections Justin Peck originally envisioned for his 24th ballet before settling on the elemental structure. The article mentions that "Mystic Familiar" is his 25th ballet and is divided into five sections named after elements. However, there's no information about the original number of sections he considered for his 24th ballet. The article doesn't discuss prior ballets' structures beyond "The Times Are Racing." So this is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The second question is about an instrument Deacon used beyond those in the "Earth" section to connect to his album. The "Earth" section uses piano four-hands and marimbas. The article mentions Deacon's score is based on "Become a Mountain," and in the album, the song has a 1980s arcade game-like sound. However, the article doesn't specify additional instruments beyond those listed. The only other mention is his singing, but the question asks for an instrument beyond the Earth section's. Since the text doesn't mention others, this might be N/A. Wait, the music in the Fire section has a Philip Glass-like pulse with orchestra. Maybe the electronic elements? The article says his voice is electronically altered. But the question is about an instrument. The text doesn't name specific instruments beyond piano, marimbas, and orchestra. So maybe N/A.

3. **Question 3:** If Balanchine explored Weimar expressionism more, which Ailey classic might he reinterpret? The article mentions Ronald K. Brown's "Grace" as a classic for Alvin Ailey. The question connects Balanchine's Weimar theme to Ailey's work. Since the text doesn't link them, this is N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The visual element from Ore-Giron's contribution that contradicted the flowing "Air" movements. The backdrop is symmetrical rays in triangles. The dancers in Air have cloud-like, drifting movements. The triangular groupings might be rigid, contrasting the fluidity. So the answer is the triangular groupings.

5. **Question 5:** Year Peck used Deacon's music with a different designer. "The Times Are Racing" in 2017 used Deacon and Humberto Leon. "Mystic Familiar" also uses Leon. The question asks for a ballet with Deacon but a different designer. The article doesn't mention another designer, so N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Element representing internal struggle besides fire for Tiler Peck's solo. The ballet's sections are elements: Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Ether. Since Fire is used, maybe Water or Earth. The self-compassion theme is in "Become a Mountain," which is in the Fire section. The article says "Mystic Familiar" has sections like Water. The Water section's duet might mirror internal struggle. But the question asks for an element, so Water?

7. **Question 7:** Choreography in "Water" mirroring pseudo-Glass sound. The Water section has a rolling duet with overlapping movements. The pseudo-Glass music has repetitive pulses. The rolling pattern could mirror the repetitive music. So the rolling pattern is mentioned, but the question asks for another aspect. The text says "interesting idea dries up" but doesn't specify another element. Maybe the repetition? The answer might be the rolling pattern, but the question says "beyond the rolling pattern," so maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "they overlap in a rolling pattern as they advance downstage. That interesting idea dries up," but the question asks for another aspect. Since there's no other mentioned, N/A?

Wait, maybe the movement's repetition? The pseudo-Glass has harmonic progression and pulse. The Water section's rolling might be the only aspect. So perhaps N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Aspect of "Variations..." that suggests tribute to Maria Tallchief's centennial. The article mentions Maria Tallchief's centennial celebration but doesn't link it to that ballet. The ballet is Balanchine's, and she was his muse, but the article doesn't state that the performance was part of her tribute. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Lighting design aspect contradicting "Ether" finale. The Ether section is a standard finale with hopping, palms up. The lighting by Brandon Stirling Baker is part of the team from "The Times Are Racing." The article says the Ether section tries to repeat music to rapture but the curtain falls with hopping. If the lighting was too bright or static, but the text doesn't mention specifics. The article says the Ether section's music loops, but lighting contradiction? Maybe the lighting didn't build up sufficiently? Since no details, N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Footwear for a fifth element transition from Fire, reflecting a previous Peck ballet. "The Times Are Racing" had sneakers. The Fire section uses "elevated street wear," so maybe sneakers again. The answer would be sneakers.
