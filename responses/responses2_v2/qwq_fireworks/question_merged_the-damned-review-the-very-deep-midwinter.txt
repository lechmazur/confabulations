Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly based on the text and avoid any assumptions beyond what's written. Let me start from the first question.

1. How many sailing ships did the outpost crew witness sinking, nose-first, into the icy water, prompting Eva's moral dilemma?

The article says "a large sailing ship that is sinking, nose-first, into the icy water." So that's one ship. Answer is 1.

2. What type of creature, similar to the Draugurs mentioned by Helga, did the fishermen believe they were being haunted by after witnessing the shipwreck?

The article states Helga is convinced they're being haunted by Draugurs, which are the revenge-seeking zombies from folklore. The question is about creatures similar to Draugurs that the fishermen thought they were haunted by. Wait, but the text says Helga mentions Draugurs, while others prefer to pacify God. So the fishermen might have different beliefs. The question says "similar to the Draugurs mentioned by Helga"—maybe the answer is Draugurs themselves? Wait, the question is phrased as "similar to the Draugurs", but the article says the fishermen are some "scorning old wives' tales, prefer to pacify God". So perhaps the fishermen didn't believe in Draugurs but in divine protection. Wait, the question is asking what the fishermen believed they were being haunted by, which would be the same as the Draugurs? Or maybe the answer is Draugurs, since that's the creature Helga mentions. Wait, the question says "similar to the Draugurs mentioned by Helga"—but the actual creature is Draugurs. Maybe the answer is Draugurs. Let me check again. The article says "Helga, the older woman ... convinced they're being haunted by Draugurs, sort of revenge-seeking zombies whispered about in folklore." The fishermen who scorn her tales prefer God. So the fishermen didn't believe in Draugurs but in God's protection. So the answer to question 2 is Draugurs, but the question says "similar to the Draugurs"—maybe that's a trick. Wait the question says "similar to the Draugurs mentioned by Helga"—so the actual creatures they saw were the Draugurs. The answer would be Draugurs. So answer is Draugurs.

3. What pagan ritual did Helga suggest to ward off the melted and smudged Edward Gorey-like figures that appeared after the shipwreck?

The article says Helga "pleaded with them to perform pagan rituals and create charms to keep the Draugurs away." The pagan ritual isn't named. The question asks for the specific ritual, but the text doesn't name it. So answer N/A.

4. What was the name of the fishing outpost's owner who perished before the brutal winter, leaving Eva in charge?

The article says "Eva and her husband owned a fishing outpost... her husband has died, and Eva... running it alone." The husband's name isn't given. So answer N/A.

5. Besides the eels, what other sea creature did the fishermen resort to eating due to the dwindling provisions, a situation exacerbated by the shipwreck?

The article mentions "they've taken to eating the bait." The bait isn't specified as another sea creature. The eels are mentioned in a different context (with the corpse's intestines). So the bait could be another type, but the text doesn't name it. So answer N/A.

6. What specific type of injury did Daniel sustain while attempting to perform the pagan rituals suggested by Helga to appease the Draugurs?

The article doesn't mention Daniel getting injured in any rituals. It just says he's a friend. So N/A.

7. What color were the craggy peaks surrounding the fishing outpost, a detail contributing to the feeling of being in another dimension?

The first paragraph says "snow so white it's almost blue, craggy peaks, frigid black water." The peaks' color isn't directly stated, but the snow is white/blue. Maybe the peaks are just described as craggy without color. So N/A.

8. What was the name of the sailing ship that sank, nose-first, into the icy water, a sight witnessed by Eva and the fishermen?

The article doesn't mention the ship's name. Answer N/A.

9. What object did the fishermen create, at Helga's urging, to protect themselves from the revenge-seeking zombies of Icelandic folklore?

The article says Helga wanted them to perform pagan rituals and "create charms." So the object is charms. Answer: charms.

10. In what month of the year did the brutal winter begin, forcing the outpost crew to resort to eating bait and witnessing the tragic shipwreck?

The article doesn't specify the month. Answer N/A.

11. Which Icelandic mythical creature not mentioned in the film does Helga incorrectly associate with the haunting, despite the article's reference to Draugurs as the actual folklore element?

The question is a bit tricky. The article says Helga refers to Draugurs, which are the correct folklore creatures. The question asks for a creature she incorrectly associated, implying she mentioned another. But the text doesn't mention any other creature she brought up. So N/A.

12. What was the exact cause of Eva's husband's death prior to the events of the film, given that the outpost's dangerous operations are emphasized?

The article says Eva's husband died but doesn't state how. Answer N/A.

13. Which historical event does the sinking ship in the film metaphorically parallel, according to the critic's analysis of the moral dilemma's universality?

The article's critic analysis doesn't mention a specific historical event. Answer N/A.

14. What specific type of bait do the fishermen resort to eating during the harsh winter, given the article's mention of eels tangled in a corpse's intestines?

The article says they eat the bait, but the bait's type isn't specified. The eels are mentioned as part of a corpse's scene, not the bait. So N/A.

15. Which character directly quotes the line "this is a godless place" to justify their decision regarding the shipwrecked sailors?

The article states "someone notes, 'this is a godless place'". The character isn't named. Answer N/A.

16. How many days pass between the initial sighting of the sinking ship and the first supernatural occurrence at the outpost?

No timeline given. Answer N/A.

17. Which real-world 19th-century Icelandic fishing disaster inspired the film's setting, as implied by the critic's description of the outpost's historical authenticity?

The article doesn't mention a specific disaster. Answer N/A.

18. What specific pagan ritual does Helga perform to ward off the Draugurs, given her insistence on using traditional charms?

The text says she urged rituals and charms but doesn't name the ritual. Answer N/A.

19. Which actor in the film previously collaborated with director Thordur Palsson on a project mentioned in the article's biographical notes?

The director's bio says he wrote the story for Jamie Hannigan's screenplay. So Jamie Hannigan might be the collaborator, but the question asks for an actor. The article mentions Odessa Young (Eva) and Joe Cole (Daniel), but no prior collaboration with Palsson. Answer N/A.

20. What precise geographical coordinate does the critic use to describe the outpost's location, emphasizing its remoteness in relation to Reykjavík?

The article doesn't provide coordinates. Answer N/A.
