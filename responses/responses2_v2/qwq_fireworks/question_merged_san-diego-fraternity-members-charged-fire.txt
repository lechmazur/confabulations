merged_san-diego-fraternity-members-charged-fire.txt
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions beyond what's written. Let me start with question 1.

1. The first question asks for the total blood alcohol content of the fraternity members involved. Scanning through the article, I don't see any mention of specific BAC levels. The text says they were drinking alcohol but doesn't provide numerical values. So the answer is N/A.

2. Next, how many previous incidents of hazing with fire were reported at this chapter? The article mentions the fraternity was on probation but doesn't specify prior incidents involving fire. So N/A again.

3. Which hospital treated Lars Larsen? The article states he was hospitalized but doesn't name the hospital. So N/A.

4. The dean who issued the probation order? The article says the fraternity was on probation and the dean's office put them on suspension, but there's no name of the dean who originally put them on probation. So N/A.

5. Number of witnesses who testified? The article doesn't mention how many witnesses provided testimony. N/A.

6. Temperature of the flames? No data on that in the text. N/A.

7. Social media platforms where evidence was deleted? The article mentions social media but doesn't specify which ones. N/A.

8. Time of the fire during the party? The date is given (Feb 17), but the time isn't mentioned. N/A.

9. Total attendees at the party? The article doesn't state the number of attendees. N/A.

10. Duration of the original probation? It just says they were on probation, not how long it was supposed to last. N/A.

11. Number of fraternities under interim suspension? The article says at least half a dozen were on probation, but only Phi Kappa Psi is mentioned as suspended. So maybe 1? Wait, the question is about interim suspension due to violating probation terms. The article states Phi Kappa Psi was put on interim suspension, but others might be under probation but not necessarily suspended. The question specifies "currently under interim suspension as a result of violating probation terms related to student safety incidents." The text only mentions Phi Kappa Psi's suspension, so the answer is 1. But wait, the article says "at least half a dozen fraternities at San Diego State University have been put on probation in the last two years," but the question is about interim suspension. Since only Phi Kappa Psi is mentioned as suspended, the answer is 1.

Wait, but the question is about "currently under interim suspension as a result of violating probation terms related to student safety incidents?" Phi Kappa Psi was put on interim suspension, but others might have been as well? The article doesn't say others are under suspension, only that half a dozen were on probation. So the answer is 1.

12. The policy they violated by hosting the party while on probation. The article says they were required to "demonstrate exemplary compliance with university policies" while on probation. Hosting a party likely violates a policy against hosting events while on probation. The exact policy name isn't given, so maybe the answer is "exemplary compliance with university policies," but the question asks for the specific policy. Since the article doesn't name it, maybe N/A. Wait, the text says "the fraternity was required to 'demonstrate exemplary compliance with university policies,' according to the college's guidelines." So the policy they violated is the one about not hosting parties while on probation? The specific policy might be the probation terms requiring compliance, but the exact name isn't provided. So N/A.

Wait, the question asks for the name of the university policy. Since the article doesn't specify the exact policy name beyond "exemplary compliance," maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm.

13. Which member had prior violations of the social host ordinance? The article doesn't mention any prior violations for any of them before 2024. So N/A.

14. Medical complication prolonging treatment? The article mentions third-degree burns but no complications. N/A.

15. Federal test scores provided by which organization? The article mentions federal test scores but doesn't name the organization. N/A.

16. Number of recruitment events hosted in six months? The article doesn't provide that number. N/A.

17. Blood alcohol content for Christopher Serrano? Not mentioned. N/A.

18. Specific provision of the social host ordinance violated by Lucas Cowling for destroying evidence? The social host ordinance is about hosting alcohol, but the question is about destroying evidence. The article says they violated the social host ordinance along with other charges. The specific provision about destroying evidence might be under a different law, not the social host ordinance. Since the question ties it to the social host ordinance, maybe N/A because the ordinance is about hosting, not evidence destruction.

19. Previous incident involving Caden Cooper that led to probation? The article says the fraternity was on probation but doesn't mention Cooper's prior actions causing it. N/A.

20. Which university official oversaw the investigation? The article says the university would begin its own administrative investigation but doesn't name the official. N/A.

Wait, let me double-check each point again quickly.

1. BAC total? No numbers. N/A.

2. Previous fire hazing incidents? No info. N/A.

3. Hospital name? No. N/A.

4. Dean's name? No. N/A.

5. Witness count? No. N/A.

6. Flame temperature? No. N/A.

7. Social media platforms? Just "social media" in general. N/A.

8. Time of fire? No. N/A.

9. Attendance? No. N/A.

10. Probation duration? Not stated. N/A.

11. Number of frats under interim suspension? Only Phi Kappa Psi is mentioned as suspended, so 1. Wait the question is "currently under interim suspension as a result of violating probation terms related to student safety incidents?" The article says "the Phi Kappa Psi chapter on interim suspension, which remains in effect, college officials confirmed on Tuesday." So that's one. The answer is 1.

12. The policy they violated by hosting the party while on probation was the requirement to demonstrate exemplary compliance with university policies. Since the question asks for the name of the policy, but the article only refers to "university policies" in general, so the answer is N/A because the exact policy isn't named.

13. Prior social host violations? No info. N/A.

14. Medical complication? No. N/A.

15. Federal test scores organization? No. N/A.

16. Recruitment events count? No. N/A.

17. Serrano's BAC? No. N/A.

18. Specific provision of the social host ordinance for destroying evidence? The article mentions "violating the social host ordinance" but doesn't link that to evidence destruction. The evidence destruction is part of conspiracy or lying, maybe under a different charge. So N/A.

19. Cooper's prior incident? No. N/A.

20. Investigating official's name? No. N/A.

Okay, I think that's all. Let me make sure I didn't miss any details.
