Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the given article and answer strictly based on that. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks how much the wealth fund committed to the commercial arm after the individual (Trump) hosted Monahan. The article mentions a $1.5 billion investment from the wealth fund in the term sheet. Since Trump hosted Monahan, this should be the answer.

2. The PGA of America took a punitive measure similar to the EPA's action. The EPA's Office of Environmental Justice had employees on administrative leave. The PGA of America pulled their championship from a Trump course after Jan 6. The question specifies a measure like the EPA's, so administrative leave? Wait, no. The PGA's action was pulling the tournament. But the question says "punitive measure similar to... administrative leave". Hmm, maybe not exactly. The article says the PGA of America pulled the tournament, so that's the punitive measure. The answer is pulling the men's championship.

3. The meeting's joint statement was from Monahan, Scott, and Woods. But Woods didn't attend. The statement was by the three, but Woods didn't participate. The question says "expressed gratitude... in their joint communication". The answer is 3 individuals, since the joint statement was from all three, even if Woods wasn't there.

4. The reason Tim Finchem gave for ending the PGA Tour's relationship with Trump's company. The article says it was a sponsorship issue, not political. So the reason was "fundamentally a sponsorship issue".

5. Rory McIlroy mentioned Venice as a location for secret talks. The question asks for the European city where they negotiated, which was Venice. So the answer is Venice.

6. The U.S. Open modified entry for LIV players. The question asks what fraction of the four majors. The answer is 1/4, since the U.S. Open is one of four.

7. The other golf organization involved in a settlement with Trump is the PGA of America, mentioned in the text.

8. The facility similar to the migrant tent city. The article mentions secret talks in San Francisco and Venice. The question asks what facility they used, but maybe "commercial arm"? Wait, the question says "facility similar to the tent city". The talks were in regular meetings, so maybe not a facility. Alternatively, the term sheet? Hmm, maybe "secret talks" but the question is about the facility. The answer might be "N/A", but the article says "secret talks that stretched from San Francisco to Venice", so maybe "Venice" but that's a city, not a facility. Alternatively, maybe "conference calls"? Not sure. Wait, the question says "utilize for their confidential discussions", so maybe "secret talks" but the answer isn't clear. Wait, the question might be referring to the term sheet, but the answer might be "N/A". Alternatively, the secret talks were in person, so maybe the location isn't a facility. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question is analogous to the tent city. The tent city is a facility for migrants. The talks were in cities, so maybe not a facility. So answer N/A?

Wait the question says "facility similar to the one being prepared by U.S. Forces for migrants". The migrants are in a tent city, so the PGA and LIV used a "tent"? No. Maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe "secret talks" but not a facility. Hmm. Let me check the text again. The talks were secret, stretching from San Francisco to Venice. The answer might be N/A because there's no mention of a facility like a tent city. So I'll put N/A.

9. The governmental entity scrutinizing the venture is the Justice Department, as mentioned in the article.

10. The form of communication used in the EPA case was a telephone meeting. During the Oval Office meeting, they used a telephone to include al-Rumayyan. So the answer is "telephone".

11. The U.S. Open's organizer modified entry on the same day Woods couldn't attend. The article says the U.S. Open's organizer announced the pathway on Wednesday, and Woods didn't attend because of his mother's death, which was also on Thursday? Wait the timing is a bit confusing. Let me check. The White House meeting was on Tuesday. The joint statement was on Thursday. The U.S. Open's announcement was on Wednesday. The Woods cancellation was because his mother died, which was the same day? The article says Woods was scheduled to attend but didn't due to his mother's death. The U.S. Open's announcement was on the same day as the meeting? The article says "On Wednesday, the U.S. Open's organizer announced..." and the meeting was on Tuesday. So the answer is the U.S. Open itself, so the tournament is the answer.

12. The board member who was at both the White House meeting and the 2017 outing. The article mentions Adam Scott as part of the meeting and he's a board member. Rory McIlroy was mentioned as a former board member who played with Trump in 2017. Wait the question says "participated in both the White House meeting and the 2017 Trump golf outing... won a major at Augusta (Masters)". Adam Scott won the Masters in 2013. So he's the one. The answer is Adam Scott.
