Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks which famous British author Pen contacted before reaching out to Lord Lennox about her father's past. The article says Pen contacts an old friend of her father's, Lord Elliot Lennox. It doesn't mention any other author she contacted first. Wait, the article states she writes directly to Lord Lennox. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, let me check again. The article says, "she contacts an old friend of his, the famous novelist Lord Elliot Lennox." So the answer here would be Lord Elliot Lennox. But the question specifies a British author before contacting him. Wait, the question is phrased as "before reaching out to Lord Lennox"â€”but according to the text, she contacts Lord Lennox directly. There's no mention of another author. So maybe N/A?

Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check the text again. The article says, "she contacts an old friend of his, the famous novelist Lord Elliot Lennox." So the only person she contacts is Lord Lennox. The question asks which author she contacted before that, but there's no mention of another. So the answer should be N/A. But maybe the question is a trick? Hmm.

Moving on to question 2: How many members of the Lennox family does Pen encounter during her first dinner? The article mentions a "zany cast of Lennoxes pops out of wood-paneled rooms." But it doesn't specify the number. So N/A.

Question 3: Medical condition Alice develops... The article says Alice has an affair with a married tutor, and Pen's relationships are pushed to limits, but no medical condition is mentioned. So N/A.

Question 4: In which London bookshop does Pen confront her father? The article doesn't mention a specific London bookshop. The story is set in Edinburgh and Scotland. So N/A.

Question 5: Classical music piece during intimate moment. The text doesn't mention any specific music. N/A.

Question 6: Family heirloom given by Lady Lennox. The article doesn't mention this. N/A.

Question 7: Tragic event during hunting trip. The article mentions a "disastrous hunting trip" but doesn't specify the event. Maybe Pen getting hurt? But the text doesn't say. So N/A.

Question 8: Scottish poet Sasha quotes. The article mentions "Macbeth" among references, but not a specific poet. N/A.

Question 9: Revelation about mother's past in the study. The article says Pen's discovery about the family tie isn't a twist. But what exactly? The text says she's looking into her parents' split linked to Lennox. The article says "what Pen discovers about her family's tie to the Lennoxes is no stunning twist," but the exact revelation isn't specified. So N/A.

Question 10: Symbolic meaning of octopus. The title is "The Life Cycle of the Common Octopus," and the article mentions "the symbolic meaning of the octopus in relation to Pen's father's hidden past." Wait, the article says "what a changed Pen might do with her own legacy. 'The only way is to make peace with yourself,' she realizes at last. Amid the tweed... Knight has crafted... about inheritance, emerging sexuality and what it truly means to come into one's own." The octopus might symbolize adaptability or something, but the article doesn't explicitly state the symbolic meaning. So N/A?

Wait, the question is about the symbolic meaning related to her father's past. The article says "the true heart of the novel is Pen's jolt into adulthood... what Pen discovers about her family's tie to the Lennoxes is no stunning twist, and it manifests without much melodrama." But the exact symbolic meaning of the octopus isn't given. So N/A.

Question 11: Institution Pen attends. The article says she's a first-year student at the University of Edinburgh with her childhood friend Alice. So the answer is University of Edinburgh.

Question 12: Page count. The article ends with "371 pp." So 371.

Question 13: Who does Pen reach out to for insight? Lord Elliot Lennox, as mentioned earlier. So answer is Lord Elliot Lennox.

Question 14: Personal resolution. The article says she vows "to free herself from the useless burden of other people's expectations." So that's the answer.

Question 15: Shakespearean tragedy mentioned. The article lists "Macbeth" as one of the references. So Macbeth.

Question 16: How is the revelation characterized? The article says "it manifests without much melodrama. Instead of staggering from the reveal..." So "without much melodrama."

Question 17: Alice's first name is given as Alice. The question asks for the first name of her friend, which is Alice.

Question 18: The castle is described as "Saltburn-esque". The text says "invites Pen to his Saltburn-esque castle." So Saltburn-esque.

Question 19: The lever's material detail. The reviewer mentions "bronze-handled" as an example of superfluous detail. So bronze-handled.

Question 20: Debut author celebrated. The article says Emma Knight's debut novel. So Emma Knight.
