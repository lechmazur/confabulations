Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and answer each question strictly based on the information there. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks about Hofesh Shechter's theatrical style in Robert Icke's adaptation. Wait, the article says that Hofesh Shechter shared the directorial credit with Matthew Warchus on the Old Vic's production. But the question is about Icke's adaptation at Wyndham's Theatre. Wait, the article mentions that Icke's adaptation was at Wyndham's, and Shechter wasn't involved in that. The Old Vic's production had Shechter and Warchus. The question seems to mix up the directors. Since the question is about Shechter's contribution to Icke's show, but the text says Shechter was in the Old Vic's version, not Icke's. So the answer should be N/A because Shechter wasn't part of Icke's production. 

2. The second question is about a prop in Icke's set by Hildegard Bechtler that ironically underscores Oedipus's boast. The article mentions a large digital clock ticking an ominous countdown. Oedipus boasts that nobody slips anything past him, but the clock's countdown might symbolize the inevitable truth he can't see. So the prop is the digital clock.

3. The third question asks how many times Brie Larson sang "yes" in Elektra. The article says she sang "no" whenever she had to say it. The word "yes" isn't mentioned here, so the answer is N/A.

4. The fourth question is about the color of the fur coats. The text says Clytemnestra and Aegisthus wore opulent fur coats, contrasting with Elektra's punk attire. But the color isn't specified. The article mentions "opulent fur coats" but no color, so N/A.

5. The fifth question asks the type of precipitation in the Old Vic's Oedipus after the truth is revealed. The article says "a glorious drizzle" comes after the truth, so drizzle. The second part about Mark Strong's character's emotional state: the article describes his "statuesque aspect and plaintive bearing" but doesn't directly link the drizzle to his state. However, since the question connects the two, maybe it's just the drizzle as the answer.

6. The sixth question is about the brand of pizza boxes in Icke's set. The article mentions pizza boxes in the campaign room but doesn't name the brand. So N/A.

7. The seventh question asks the object above the revolving stage in Elektra that doused performers with spray paint. The article says a gun on a tripod was used for spray paint, and a blimp hung above. So the answer is the gun on a tripod. Wait, the question mentions an object mirroring the blimp in Oklahoma. The article says "a blimp hangs above the revolving stage" and "a gun on a tripod douses..." So the object is the gun, but the question is asking what was used to douse, so the answer is "a gun on a tripod". 

8. The eighth question asks which other "Marvels" actor joined Larson in Elektra. The article mentions Stockard Channing as Clytemnestra and Greg Hicks as Aegisthus. The director is Daniel Fish, but he's not from "The Marvels". The article says Brie Larson is in "The Marvels", so maybe another cast member? The text only lists Stockard Channing and others like Patrick Vaill (Orestes) but Patrick isn't mentioned as being in "The Marvels". So maybe N/A because there's no mention of another "Marvels" actor in the cast besides Larson.

9. The ninth question is about the brand of handheld mic Larson used. The article says she used a handheld mic but doesn't mention the brand. So N/A.

10. The tenth question asks the final election score on the digital clock. The article mentions the digital clock's countdown but doesn't give the final score. So N/A.

11. The eleventh question asks a symbolic object in both Shechter's choreography and Fish's Elektra. The article mentions a blimp in Elektra and in Oklahoma (Fish's previous work), but Shechter's Oedipus has a solar orb and drought. Maybe the chorus's movements? Or the digital clock? Wait, the article says in Elektra there's a blimp and a gun. The other production's Shechter's has a solar orb and drought. The question is about an object in both. Not sure. Maybe the chorus? But the question specifies symbolic object. Hmm. The article doesn't mention a common object between the two, so N/A.

12. The twelfth question is about how Doey Luthi's costumes contrast with Rae Smith's set. Elektra's costumes are punky vs. others in fur. The Old Vic's set is post-apocalyptic. The article says Doey Luthi's designs contrast Elektra's punk look with the others' fur coats. Rae Smith's set for Old Vic is a drought-stricken Thebes with featureless landscape. The psychological state: Elektra's costume reflects her defiance, while the set's austerity reflects Oedipus's doomed situation. So the answer might be "punk attire vs. opulent fur coats" but the question is about contrasting psychological states. The article says Elektra's costume shows defiance, others' fur shows ostracism. The Old Vic's set's featureless landscape reflects the societal suffering. So the contrast is Elektra's defiance (punk) vs. the Old Vic's post-apocalyptic setting showing Oedipus's isolation. The question is about costume vs set design. The answer might be "punk attire reflecting defiance vs. post-apocalyptic set showing societal collapse" but the exact wording from the article is needed. The article says "Clytemnestra and Aegisthus appear in opulent fur coats" contrasting with Elektra's punk. Rae Smith's set for Old Vic is "featureless, vaguely postapocalyptic". So the contrast is Elektra's costume (punk) vs Old Vic's set (post-apocalyptic). The psychological states: Elektra's defiance (punk) and Oedipus's environment's harshness. So the answer would be "punk attire reflecting Elektra's defiance vs. post-apocalyptic set reflecting societal suffering". But the question asks how the costume design contrasts with the set design in reflecting psychological states. So maybe "Elektra's punky attire contrasts with the Old Vic's post-apocalyptic set, reflecting defiance vs. desolation." But the answer needs to be concise. The article says "Elektra's punky get-up, the other members of the household appear in opulent fur coats." So the contrast is between her clothes and others' fur. The Old Vic's set is postapocalyptic, which relates to Oedipus's psychological state. The question is about the psychological states each reflects. So Elektra's costume shows her defiance, the set's post-apocalyptic nature shows Oedipus's doomed situation. The answer might be "punk attire reflecting defiance vs post-apocalyptic setting showing societal collapse." But the exact terms from the article are needed. The answer should be "punk attire contrasting with opulent fur coats" but the question is about the set design. Wait, the question says "costume design by Doey Luthi in Elektra" vs "Rae Smith's set design for Old Vic's Oedipus". So the contrast is Elektra's costumes (punk vs fur) versus the Old Vic's set's post-apocalyptic. The psychological states: Elektra's defiance vs Thebes' drought's suffering. The answer is "Elektra's punk attire (defiance) vs Old Vic's post-apocalyptic set (despair)". The article says "the story is set in a featureless, vaguely postapocalyptic landscape" (Old Vic's set) which reflects the societal plight, while Elektra's costume shows her defiance. So the answer is "punk attire reflecting Elektra's defiance vs post-apocalyptic set reflecting societal suffering". But the question asks how the costume design contrasts with the set design in reflecting psychological states. The answer should be "punk attire (defiance) vs post-apocalyptic landscape (desperation)". But the exact wording? The article says "Elektra's punky get-up... opulent fur coats". The set is "drought-stricken Thebes... postapocalyptic landscape". So the answer is "punk attire contrasting with opulent fur coats" but the question is about the set design. Wait, maybe the answer is "Doey Luthi's punk attire for Elektra vs. Rae Smith's postapocalyptic set for Oedipus, reflecting defiance vs. societal collapse". But the question wants the contrast in reflecting psychological states. Since the question is a bit ambiguous, but the article doesn't explicitly state the psychological contrast, maybe N/A? Wait no, the article says Elektra's costume shows her defiance, and the Old Vic's set is post-apocalyptic. So the answer is "punk attire (defiance) vs. post-apocalyptic setting (despair)". The exact answer is probably "punk attire vs post-apocalyptic set" but the question wants the psychological aspect. The answer might be "Elektra's defiant punk look vs Thebes' desolate landscape reflecting societal suffering".

13. The thirteenth question links Jocasta's unconscious knowledge in Icke's version to the chorus's transformation. The article mentions Lesley Manville's Jocasta has "unconscious knowledge of the terrible truth". The Old Vic's chorus transforms from convulsive movements to graceful after the truth is revealed. The connection is that both involve awareness of the truth leading to change. So the answer is "awareness of the tragic truth leading to catharsis".

14. The fourteenth question is about Sigourney Weaver's London performance and critiques of Malek and Larson. The article says that Malek and Larson's performances were criticized for not excelling in theater acting, and mentions Sigourney Weaver's recent London "Tempest" as part of the trend where producers use stars but the performances are lacking. The thematic link is that all three (Weaver, Malek, Larson) are screen stars struggling in theater, leading to critiques about theater vs screen acting. So the answer is "all involve screen stars struggling in theater, highlighting the critique that theater and screen acting differ".
