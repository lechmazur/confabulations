Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I'll go through each question carefully and check the article for the answers.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks which Broadway musical Tony Roberts starred in alongside Betty White before moving to London for "Promises, Promises". The article mentions he was in "Promises, Promises" in London with Betty Buckley, not Betty White. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The article says: "There was London, where he starred with Betty Buckley in the musical 'Promises, Promises' (1969)." Betty Buckley, not Betty White. The article doesn't mention Betty White. So maybe the answer is N/A? Or perhaps another musical? Let me see. The article says he was in "Don't Drink the Water" with Woody Allen, but that's a play. Wait, "How Now, Dow Jones" is mentioned as a musical he was in. But the question specifies a musical with Betty White. Since Betty White isn't mentioned in the article, this would be N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Years between father noticing his fascination with radio (age 4) and his breakthrough in "Don't Drink the Water". The article says he was born in 1939. His father noticed him at 4 (1943). "Don't Drink the Water" was his first collaboration with Allen, which the article says was in 1966. So from 1943 to 1966 is 23 years? Wait, but his birth year is 1939, so 1966 minus 1943 (since 1939 +4 is 1943). 1966-1943=23. The answer would be 23 years.

3. **Question 3:** The character name in the original stage "Annie Hall". The article says in "Annie Hall" (1977), he played Rob, the friend of Alvy Singer. The original stage production of "Annie Hall" was the movie's basis, but the article mentions the stage version of "Play It Again, Sam" where he played a businessman. Wait, "Annie Hall" was a movie, but the article says the first movie with Allen was "Play It Again, Sam" which started on Broadway. The question is about the original stage production of "Annie Hall", but the article doesn't mention a stage version of "Annie Hall" before the film. The film was based on the stage play "Play It Again, Sam". So maybe the question has an incorrect premise. The answer would be N/A because "Annie Hall" wasn't originally a stage play; the first was "Play It Again, Sam". So the character in the stage "Annie Hall" doesn't exist here. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The method acting teacher who recommended Northwestern. The article says: "The college was recommended to him by a Fire Island summer neighbor of the family's who, back in the city, had taught acting: Lee Strasberg." Lee Strasberg was a method acting teacher (famous for Method acting). So answer is Lee Strasberg.

5. **Question 5:** Medical condition from "The Tale of the Allergist's Wife". The article mentions in 2009, during "The Royal Family", he had a minor seizure. But "The Tale of the Allergist's Wife" was in 2000. The article doesn't mention any medical issues related to that role. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Who replaced him in "Play It Again, Sam" when he left. The article says he was in the Broadway version, but when he left the original run? Wait, the article says "He had already been nominated for a Tony the year before, for best actor in a musical, for his performance in 'How Now, Dow Jones.' That was an improvement over what another Times critic, Walter Kerr, had said of an earlier Roberts performance in 'Don't Drink the Water' (1966), a comedy about an ambassador's son with serious behavior problems. It was Mr. Roberts's first collaboration with Mr. Allen, who wrote it." The question is about who replaced him in the original Broadway run of "Play It Again, Sam". The article says the show ran for over a year, but doesn't mention replacements. Since the question is about when he left the original Broadway run, but the article doesn't say who took over, so N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The sitcom Rob's character was in during "Annie Hall". The article says in "Annie Hall", Rob (Roberts' character) was adding a laugh track to his sitcom. The name isn't mentioned. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Number of twin daughters from sperm donation. The article states in "Hannah and Her Sisters", the character donated sperm resulting in "fair-haired twin boys". So the answer is 0 daughters, but the question asks for daughters. Since the article specifies boys, the answer is 0. But the question might be a trick. Alternatively, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The article says "fair-haired twin boys", so the answer is 0 daughters. So 0? But the question asks for daughters, so the answer is 0, but since it's twin boys, the answer would be N/A because the question is about daughters. Wait, the question is "how many twin daughters", so since it's boys, the answer is 0. But maybe the question expects N/A because it's not specified as daughters. Hmm, the article says "twin boys", so the correct answer would be 0. But maybe the question is expecting N/A because it's about daughters. The article says "twin boys", so the answer is 0, but since the question specifies daughters, perhaps it's N/A. Wait, the question is "how many twin daughters", so since there were twin boys, the answer is 0. But the question might consider that the answer isn't specified for daughters, so N/A? Wait, the question is exact. The article states twin boys, so the answer to the question about daughters is 0. So answer is 0.

9. **Question 9:** Box office revenue of first film with Woody Allen. The first film was "Play It Again, Sam". The article doesn't mention box office numbers, so N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Critic who praised Roberts in "The Royal Family" before retirement. The article says his last Broadway was in 2009 in "The Royal Family", and Ben Brantley of The Times had praised him in other plays. The article doesn't mention a critic retiring, so perhaps the question is wrong. The article states Ben Brantley reviewed "The Tale of the Allergist's Wife" in 2000, but for "The Royal Family", the article mentions his seizure but not a critic's praise. So no info on which critic praised him for that, so N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Role he took over from Ron Rifkin in Neil Simon's play. The article says he replaced Ron Rifkin as Herr Schultz in "Cabaret" (2003). Neil Simon didn't write "Cabaret", but the question mentions Neil Simon comedy. Wait, "Cabaret" is by John Kander and Fred Ebb, book by Joe Masteroff. So maybe the question is wrong. Alternatively, the question refers to replacing Robert Redford in "Barefoot in the Park" (replaced Redford), and then replacing Ron Rifkin in "Cabaret" (which is not a Neil Simon play). The question says "mirroring his earlier replacement of Robert Redford", so the answer is Herr Schultz in "Cabaret". But since the question mentions Neil Simon, perhaps it's a trick. The article says he replaced Rifkin in "Cabaret" (not Neil Simon's work), so maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "Neil Simon comedy", so since "Cabaret" isn't by Simon, perhaps the correct answer is "Herr Schultz in Cabaret" but since the play isn't Simon's, the question's premise is wrong, so N/A? Or maybe the question is wrong but the answer is still Herr Schultz. Hmm. The article states he replaced Ron Rifkin as Herr Schultz in a revival of "Cabaret" (2003). The question asks for the role in a Neil Simon comedy. Since "Cabaret" isn't by Simon, the answer would be N/A. Alternatively, maybe another play? The article also mentions replacing Robert Klein in "They're Playing Our Song" (1979), which was a Neil Simon musical. But that was replacing Robert Klein, not Rifkin. So the answer is N/A because the role with Rifkin was in a non-Simon play.

12. **Question 12:** Play where he had the "aggressively untamed terrier face" description. The article says in "How Now, Dow Jones", Clive Barnes (the critic) described him as having that face. The question asks which play had that description. The answer is "How Now, Dow Jones".

13. **Question 13:** Charles Busch play where he played a retired doctor. The article mentions "The Tale of the Allergist's Wife" (2000) by Charles Busch, where he was the annoyingly noble husband. The question asks for the play's title. So the answer is "The Tale of the Allergist's Wife".

14. **Question 14:** Final screen role character's name, previously played by Jerry Lacy. The article says in "Play It Again, Sam" (the film), Jerry Lacy played the spirit of Humphrey Bogart. His final role was Max Kellerman in a TV version of "Dirty Dancing". The question says "previously portrayed by Jerry Lacy in the original film". Since Jerry Lacy was in "Play It Again, Sam", but Max Kellerman isn't mentioned as being played by Lacy. The question might be confused. The answer is Max Kellerman, but since the original film's role by Lacy was Bogart's spirit, which isn't related to Max. So perhaps N/A? Wait, the question says "previously portrayed by Jerry Lacy in the original film" â€” but the original film of "Dirty Dancing" didn't have Max Kellerman; the TV version did. So maybe the question is wrong, so N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Profession in "Doubles" mirroring "Play It Again, Sam". In "Play It Again, Sam" he was a businessman who bought Polaroid stock. In "Doubles", he was a stockbroker accused of insider trading. So the profession is stockbroker. The answer is stockbroker.

16. **Question 16:** Award for "How Now, Dow Jones". The article says he was nominated for a Tony for best actor in a musical for "How Now, Dow Jones". He didn't win, just nominated. The question asks what award he received. Since he was nominated but didn't win, the answer is N/A (since he didn't receive the award, just nominated). Wait, the question says "received", so N/A.

17. **Question 17:** Play with Woody Allen's first collaboration, role later in 1992. The first collaboration was "Don't Drink the Water" (1966). The 1992 production mentioned is "The Seagull" where he played Dr. Dorn. But was that a collaboration with Allen? The article says "The Seagull" (1992) was a Chekhov play. The question asks for the play where he first collaborated with Allen, which was "Don't Drink the Water". The answer is "Don't Drink the Water".

18. **Question 18:** Disney film debut, similar to Pelham role. His first film was "The Million Dollar Duck" (1971) with Dean Jones. The Pelham role was deputy mayor dealing with hijackers. The question says similar role, but "Duck" is a comedy. Maybe the crisis situation? Not sure, but the answer is "The Million Dollar Duck".

19. **Question 19:** 1986 revival character similar to "Absurd Person Singular". In 1986 revival of "Arsenic and Old Lace", he played a theater critic. In "Absurd Person Singular" (1974) he was an architect. The question asks for a role that mirrored the architect's portrayal. The answer might be theater critic. The question asks for the play's title? Wait, the question says "what was the name of the character..." Wait, the question says: "What was the name of the character Roberts played in a 1986 revival of a classic play..." The article states in 1986 revival of "Arsenic and Old Lace", he was a theater critic. The character's name isn't given, so maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "he was a theater critic in a 1986 revival of 'Arsenic and Old Lace'". The character's name isn't mentioned, so the answer is N/A. Alternatively, if the question is about the role's title, like "theater critic", but the name isn't provided, so N/A.

20. **Question 20:** Musical with Mia Farrow in London. The article mentions "Promises, Promises" in London with Betty Buckley, not Mia Farrow. The only mention of Mia Farrow is in "Hannah and Her Sisters" as the wife of Allen. The question is about a musical in London with Mia Farrow. Since the article doesn't mention that, the answer is N/A.
