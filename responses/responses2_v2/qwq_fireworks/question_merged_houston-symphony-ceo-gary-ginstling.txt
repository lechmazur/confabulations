Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. The first question asks which former Houston Symphony executive recommended Gary Ginstling after observing his work with Dudamel. The article mentions Barbara J. Burger as the board president, and she spoke with New York colleagues. But there's no mention of her specifically observing him with Dudamel. The text says the committee spoke with colleagues in New York, but no specific person is named as the recommender. So answer N/A.

2. The second question is about how many musicians were added to reach 90. The article states the Houston Symphony has 90 musicians now, but doesn't mention previous numbers or additions after the renovation. So N/A.

3. Question 3 asks for the percentage increase in attendance during Valcuha's first year. The article mentions attendance was 69% in 2022 (last year from 2019's 72%), but no info on Valcuha's first year specifically. N/A.

4. The fourth question is during which phase of Jones Hall renovation Barbara left Chevron. The article says Burger was a former Chevron exec but doesn't link her transition to a specific phase. N/A.

5. Primary reason for friction between Ginstling and NY Phil staff. The article says friction with musicians, staff, board, and Dudamel, but doesn't cite a specific primary reason. N/A.

6. Donor contributions increase after Jones Hall improvements. The article says donations rose to $22M from $13M in 2019, but it's not clear if this was after the acoustic improvements phase. The renovation phases are mentioned, but the timing isn't specified. The most ambitious phase was completed last year (when the article was written, but the year isn't given). Since the $22M is compared to 2019, maybe the increase is from then, but the question asks after the announcement. Since the article doesn't specify the timing of the announcement vs. the phase completion, maybe N/A.

7. Specific improvements that led to target attendance. The article says attendance was below pre-pandemic but expected to return. The improvements included acoustics and lighting, but no specific ones linked to achieving targets. N/A.

8. Role of Matias Tarnopolsky in Ginstling's move. The article says Tarnopolsky succeeded Ginstling in NY, but nothing about facilitating the move to Houston. N/A.

9. Attendance metrics for projected return. The article says they expected 2023 to reach pre-pandemic levels, but doesn't specify which metrics. N/A.

10. Financial milestone Houston surpassed before endowment increase mirroring NY under Tarnopolsky. The endowment went from $76M to $100M. The NY Phil's situation isn't detailed. No info on comparable milestones. N/A.

11. Initiative Ginstling championed in NY like Valcuha's approach. Valcuha's approach isn't detailed, so can't compare. N/A.

12. Year subscriptions declined like 2019 attendance. The article says subscriptions declined sharply but doesn't give a year. N/A.

13. Operational similarity between Cleveland and National Symphony that caused issues. The article lists those orchestras as part of his experience but doesn't mention similarities causing problems. N/A.

14. Musicians added after the most ambitious phase. The orchestra has 90 musicians now, but no info on changes post-renovation phase. N/A.

15. Year subscriptions dropped like 2019 attendance. The article says subscriptions declined but doesn't specify the year. N/A.

16. Fred Armisen's Blue Man Group role as a model. The Blue Man Group section is separate, no mention of Ginstling citing it. N/A.

17. Performance type common to Fallon and Janowski's debuts. Fallon's Broadway debut and Janowski's conducting debutâ€”maybe live performances? But the question asks for a specific type mentioned. The article doesn't link these to Ginstling's plans. N/A.

18. Chevron exec involved with a Broadway show about mothers. Barbara Burger is the Chevron exec, and the last part mentions a play about mothers. But the article says "Moms on Broadway" is a section title, not a specific show she was involved in. No connection stated. N/A.

Most answers are N/A because the article doesn't provide specific details required by the questions.
