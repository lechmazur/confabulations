Okay, let me go through each question one by one and check the article for the answers. 

1. The first question asks how many pounds of clothing donations State Line Resource Station received from Hurricane Helene victims before their policy. The article mentions they had to deal with "five or six semis of used clothes" but doesn't specify the weight. Since the exact pounds aren't given, I'll put N/A.

2. The second question is about which major retailer partnered with Goodwill for the voucher system. The text says Goodwill partnered with the Red Cross, not a retailer. So the answer is N/A.

3. The third question asks for the percentage of textiles in Goodwill's 5.8 billion pounds. The article states a "significant portion" were textiles but doesn't give a percentage. So N/A again.

4. For the number of storage facilities filled, the article mentions they filled storage units to the ceiling but doesn't specify how many. So N/A.

5. The total monetary value of vouchers isn't provided. The article says up to two $25 vouchers per person, but total value isn't mentioned. N/A.

6. The study on garment purchases was by McKinsey, as stated in the article. So that's McKinsey & Company.

7. The number of households receiving electric blankets isn't given. The article only mentions the need but not the actual number distributed. N/A.

8. The average per household donation isn't in the text. N/A.

9. Kamala Harris's visit was her first since the wildfires last month, but the month isn't specified. The article mentions January as a donation month, but her visit isn't tied to a specific month. N/A.

10. The number of volunteers reassigned isn't stated. The article says they had to redirect volunteers but doesn't specify how many. N/A.

11. The question about winter gear: Valentine Reilly mentioned needing electric blankets and propane heaters, which were needed but maybe not the excessively donated items. Wait, the article says they received a lot of clothes, but the needed items were the heaters and blankets. The excess was clothes, so maybe the answer is N/A because the question asks for what was both needed and over-donated. Since clothes were over-donated but the needed items weren't clothes, perhaps there's no overlap. So N/A.

12. The last question links Kamala Harris's tour to insurance reforms. The article mentions her tour and then talks about insurance reforms in a separate section, but no direct link is stated. So N/A.
