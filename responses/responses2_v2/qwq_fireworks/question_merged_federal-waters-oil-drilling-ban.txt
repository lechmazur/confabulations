Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one using only the given article. 

1. **Question 1**: Which Native American tribe specifically led negotiations with the Department of Interior regarding the protection of drinking water sources in the Black Hills National Forest?  
Looking at the article, the Black Hills section mentions tribes and environmental groups, but the specific tribe leading negotiations isn't named. The Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians are mentioned for Chuckwalla, but not for Black Hills. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2**: How many acre-feet of water did Trump's moratorium protect in the stretch of coastal waters from North Carolina to Florida?  
The article mentions Trump's 10-year moratorium in that region but doesn't specify acre-feet of water. The 1.2 million acre-feet is for the Sattitla monument. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: What was Judge Sharon Gleason's legal rationale for determining that Congressional action would be required to overturn the drilling ban?  
The article states she ruled that Obama's ban couldn't be undone without Congress because Section 12(a) doesn't allow revocation. So the rationale is the law's provision lacking revocation language.

4. **Question 4**: Which Republican coastal state governor worked with Ben Jealous to advocate for offshore drilling restrictions in their state?  
The article says Republican lawmakers in coastal states might support Biden's order, but no specific governor or collaboration with Ben Jealous is mentioned. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: How did the Ruby Mountains proposal timeline align with the implementation schedule for the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provisions?  
The Ruby Mountains are under the Interior's 20-year ban, but the article doesn't link its timeline to OCSLA. The OCSLA is about offshore drilling, while Ruby Mountains are federal lands. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: What role did the record-breaking temperatures of the previous year play in the Department of Interior's decision-making process for the Sattila National Monument designation?  
The article mentions the hottest year in history as part of Biden's climate legacy but doesn't tie it directly to Sattila's designation. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Which environmental impact studies were cited by the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians in their proposal for the Chuckwalla National Monument?  
The tribe cited endangered species and cultural significance, but no specific studies named. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: What economic analysis did Karoline Leavitt reference when discussing the impact of drilling restrictions on working families?  
Leavitt's statement mentions bringing down costs but doesn't cite a specific analysis. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: How many canyons in the Atlantic Ocean were included in the Obama-era drilling ban that Trump attempted to revoke?  
The article says "dozens of canyons in the Atlantic" were part of Obama's ban. So answer "dozens".

10. **Question 10**: What is the total acreage protected by the two new national monuments in California, combining Chuckwalla and the Joshua Tree area?  
Chuckwalla is over 600k acres plus 17k near Joshua Tree. Total is 617,000. But the question includes "the area along Joshua Tree" as part of Chuckwalla? The article says Chuckwalla includes 17k acres along Joshua Tree. So total 617,000.

11. **Question 11**: Which federal law did Trump try to use to revoke Obamaâ€™s Arctic ban, leading to the 2019 ruling needing Congress?  
Section 12(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The article says Obama used 12(a), and Trump tried to revoke it, leading to the court saying Congress needed to act. So the law is Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.

12. **Question 12**: In which state did the Interior ban mining to protect Pactola Reservoir-Rapid Creek Watershed?  
The Black Hills are in South Dakota. The article says South Dakota.

13. **Question 13**: What's the name of the monument protecting snowmelt reservoirs discharging over 1.2 million acre-feet?  
The Sattitla (probably Sattila) National Monument is described with that figure. So Sattitla.

14. **Question 14**: Which Biden ban conflicts with Trump's 10-year moratorium using same law?  
The article says Biden's ban includes the same North Carolina to Florida area where Trump had a 10-year moratorium. So Biden's ban on that area conflicts.

15. **Question 15**: What economic argument did Joseph Gordon mention for bipartisan support?  
He said coastal states' economies depend on healthy coasts, which could appeal to Republicans. The article says he mentioned "economic activity that depend on a healthy coast" as a possible bipartisan point.

16. **Question 16**: Which agency's spokesperson misspelled the name?  
The correction says the American Petroleum Institute's Dustin Meyer was misspelled as Myer. So the spokesperson is from API.

17. **Question 17**: Which tribe led Chuckwalla efforts?  
Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians, as stated in the article.
