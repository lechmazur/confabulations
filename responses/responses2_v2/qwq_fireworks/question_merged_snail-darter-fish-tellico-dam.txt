Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks what action Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. took regarding the Endangered Species Act exemption that directly impacted USAID. The article mentions Baker was frustrated with the snail darter and called it a bane. It also says President Carter signed a bill exempting the Tellico Dam from the ESA. But the question connects Baker's action to USAID's closure. The article states Trump called for USAID closure, but there's no link between Baker and USAID. So answer is N/A.

2. The question is about the TVA's legal strategy similar to Trump's lawsuits against media. The article says Duncan Sr. called the fish a "worthless minnow." The legal strategy used against CBS and Register were lawsuits. The TVA's counter to Etnier's claims might be the Supreme Court case, but the question specifies a similar strategy to the lawsuits. The article says TVA built the dam after Carter's bill, but no mention of lawsuits like Trump's. So N/A.

3. Dr. Near suggested a facility like the migrant tent city. The article says Near's methods lead to new species discoveries. The question asks for a specific type of facility. The article mentions a tent city for migrants, but Near's suggestion isn't mentioned. So N/A.

4. The debate between lumpers/splitters and Carter's action mirroring Trump's D.E.I. ban on clubs. The article says Carter signed the exemption for the dam. Trump's D.E.I. ban ended West Point clubs. The exemption was a legislative action, while Trump's was a policy. No direct link, so N/A.

5. USAID closure's influence on Near's research. The article says Trump called for USAID closure, but no connection to the snail darter reclassification. So N/A.

6. Federal legislation during Carter's presidency cited for relocating Cherokee sites. The Supreme Court case was about ESA, but the Tellico Dam's construction threat to Cherokee sites. The ESA was used to block the dam, but the relocation might be under the National Environmental Policy Act? The article doesn't mention specific legislation for relocation, so N/A.

7. Ava's DNA analysis and Guantanamo migrant decision. The article says Ava worked on the fish's DNA, and Trump's admin used Gitmo for migrants. No link between her work and the migrant decision. N/A.

8. Duncan's criticism leading to West Point clubs' termination. The article mentions Duncan's criticism but the D.E.I. ban was Trump's action, no connection to Duncan's comments. N/A.

9. Endangered species with genetic markers like Al Qaeda detainees. The article mentions migrants in Gitmo, but the snail darter is reclassified. No species linked to Al Qaeda patterns. N/A.

10. Year TVA started construction after Supreme Court ruling. The article says the dam began in 1967, and after the Supreme Court, Carter signed the exemption in 1979. The dam started operating in 1979. The question is when they began construction after the ruling. But construction started earlier, so maybe the exemption allowed completion. The article says the dam began operating in 1979, so maybe they finished in that year. The question is about when they began constructing after the ruling, but construction had already started. So N/A.

11. Trudeau's warnings and Near's "conservation species concept." The article says Trudeau linked Canada's minerals to Trump's state comments. Near's concept was about using species for conservation. No direct relation between Trudeau's warning and Near's assertion. N/A.

12. Federal agency's 2015 discovery prompting migrant plans. The article says Jeffrey Simmons (TVA biologist) found the fish in 2015. The Trump admin planned tent cities. No mention of the discovery leading to migrant plans. N/A.

13. Plater's legal strategy informing West Point's D.E.I. policies. Plater argued for the fish in court. The D.E.I. ban ended clubs, but no link to Plater's strategy. N/A.

14. Genetic marker from 2022 study used for delisting and USAID suspension. The article mentions a 2022 study by Near's team leading to new species discoveries. The delisting happened in 2020. USAID's closure was Trump's action, no mention of genetic markers linking them. N/A.
