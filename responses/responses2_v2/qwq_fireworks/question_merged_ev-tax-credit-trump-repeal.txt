Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and answer exactly what's asked. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks about the percentage of critical materials sourced in 2023 for the Volkswagen ID.4 lease. Looking at the article, it mentions that in 2024, 50% was required, and that increased to 60% this year. Wait, the article says "this year" but the current year isn't specified. However, the question is about 2023. Since the 2024 requirement was 50%, maybe 2023 was lower? Wait, the article says "In 2024, 50 percent... That number increased to 60 percent this year." "This year" would be the current year when the article was written. But the question is about 2023. The article doesn't mention 2023's percentage. Hmm, so maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says "the tax credit was part of the Inflation Reduction Act 2022. To qualify..." but the percentages are mentioned as 2024 had 50%, then increased to 60% this year. Since the question is about 2023, the article doesn't specify what it was before 2024. So I think the answer is N/A because the article doesn't state the 2023 percentage.

Wait, but maybe the 50% started in 2024, so before that, like 2023, maybe it was lower? But the article doesn't say. Since the question is about 2023 and the article only mentions 2024 and "this year" (assuming current year is 2025?), but the exact 2023 value isn't given. So answer N/A for question 1.

2. The second question is about the maximum sedan price after William Ford's conversation. The tax credit rules state that sedans must be under $55k. The conversation with Ford doesn't change that, so the answer is $55,000.

3. The third question is about individual income for a used electric car tax credit. The main tax credit for new cars has income limits, but the used car credit is separate. The article says the used credit is up to $4k and open to all models under $25k. The income limit for the used credit isn't mentioned. The main credit's individual limit is $150k, but the used credit's requirements? The article doesn't specify income limits for the used credit. So answer N/A.

4. Fourth question: minimum monthly lease for Mustang Mach E in Brighton. The article says a Ford dealer there advertised $126/month with a $3,500 down. So the answer is $126.

5. Fifth question: average interest rate on car loans. The article mentions Toyota offers 0% financing on 72-month loans when the average is over 6%. So the average is over 6%, so answer 6%.

6. Sixth question: how many 2025 models qualify for full credit. The article states "At least 15 vehicles from the 2025 model year qualify for the full $7,500 credit." So answer 15.

7. Seventh question: percentage increase in EV sales from 2023. The article says sales are up 7.3% from 2023. So 7.3%.

8. Eighth question: down payment for the Mustang Mach E lease. The ad mentions $3,500 down. So answer $3,500.

9. Ninth question: max price for a used EV to get the tax credit. The used credit is for models up to $25k. So answer $25,000.

10. Tenth question: how many Tesla models qualify. The article says "Four Tesla models qualify now." So answer 4.

Wait, let me check each again.

1. The first question's answer: The article says "In 2024, 50 percent of the value... That number increased to 60 percent this year." Since the question is about 2023, which is before 2024, the article doesn't mention what the percentage was in 2023. So N/A.

2. The max sedan price is $55k, correct.

3. The used car tax credit's income limit isn't mentioned. The main credit's individual limit is $150k, but the question is about used. Since the used tax credit is a separate one, and the article doesn't mention income for that, so N/A.

4. $126, correct.

5. The average is over 6%, so the answer is 6%.

6. 15, yes.

7. 7.3%, yes.

8. $3,500 down, correct.

9. $25k, correct.

10. Four Tesla models, correct.

All set. Now I need to format the answers properly in the required tags.
