Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each exactly as per the instructions.

1. **Total wage increase over three years?** The article says the company offered a "nearly 20% increase in wages". It doesn't specify over three years, but the question mentions a three-year period. Since the article doesn't state the timeframe, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "over the three-year contract period", but the article only mentions "nearly 20%", not the duration. Hmm, maybe the 20% is the total over three years? The article doesn't specify, so maybe N/A. Wait, actually, the company's statement says "a good faith agreement with nearly a 20% increase in wages". The contract period isn't mentioned here, so the three-year part isn't in the text. So answer is N/A?

2. **How many performances of "Grief Camp" were completed before the strike?** The article says the strike forced cancellation of Sunday performances. The plays began previews last week. It doesn't say how many were done before the strike. So N/A.

3. **Which Broadway producer backed "Spring Awakening" before transfer?** The article mentions that "Spring Awakening" went to Broadway after Atlantic, but doesn't name the producer. So N/A.

4. **% of budget for stagehand salaries in 2023?** The article gives the total budget as $15M but no breakdown. So N/A.

5. **When did negotiations begin after Feb vote?** The article says the crew voted to join in Feb, but when negotiations started isn't specified. N/A.

6. **How many unfair labor complaints?** The union filed "unfair labor practice complaints" but the number isn't stated. So N/A.

7. **Average attendance rate before strike?** No data on attendance rates. N/A.

8. **Which show has the longest run after transfer?** The article lists three musicals that won Tony Awards but doesn't mention run length. N/A.

9. **Minimum wage rate demanded?** The article doesn't state specific wage figures, only mentions "demands could force closure". N/A.

10. **Number of stagehands who voted?** The article says the crew voted to join, but the number isn't given. N/A.

11. **Projected revenue increase?** The company's stance is pro-union, but the article doesn't mention projected revenue percentages. N/A.

12. **Matthew Loeb's role in Actors' Equity?** The article says Loeb is IATSE's president, not in Actors' Equity. So N/A.

13. **Third venue's name?** The article mentions two venues in Chelsea. No third venue named. N/A.

14. **Fourth play affected?** The article only mentions two plays. N/A.

15. **Deficit amount in 2023?** The article says they had a $15M budget and ran deficits, but exact deficit figure isn't given. N/A.

16. **Counter-proposal on working hours?** The article doesn't mention specific counter-proposals about hours. N/A.

17. **Date in February for union vote?** The article says "last February", but exact date isn't provided. N/A.

18. **Other show reviewed by Paulson with labor theme?** The article mentions Paulson wrote about Blue Man Group, Idina Menzel, Jimmy Fallon, etc., but none about labor disputes. N/A.

19. **Founder's name who negotiated?** The founder is mentioned as part of the company's history, but the name isn't given. N/A.

20. **Estimated weeks before closure?** The company warned about possible closure due to financials but didn't give weeks. N/A.

Okay, that's all. Most answers are N/A because the article doesn't provide those specific details.
