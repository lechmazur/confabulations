Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions beyond what's written.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks about the percentage increase in foreign ownership of British government bonds after Rachel Reeves announced the £70 billion spending. The article mentions that a third of UK bonds are owned by foreigners, but there's no specific data on an increase after the announcement. So I'll have to say N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The second question is about the yield spread between 10-year and 30-year gilts widening in the week before Starmer's statement. The article states the yields reached certain highs but doesn't mention the spread change over a specific week. No data here, so N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The third question asks which European central bank governor Hugh Gimber cited. The article quotes Gimber comparing the current situation to 2022 but doesn't mention any specific governor. Answer: N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The fourth question is about the tax increases proposed by Reeves. The article says half of the £70 billion is from taxes and borrowing. The total tax part would be £35 billion annually. But the question asks for the total value. Since it's over five years, maybe multiply by 5? Wait, the question says "proposed to offset the increased borrowing costs from rising gilt yields". The article says the £70 billion is annual over five years, with half from taxes. So total tax over five years would be 35B *5=175B. But the question is about the tax increases proposed to offset the borrowing costs. However, the article doesn't specify the exact amount, just the split. The answer might be N/A because it's not explicitly stated as a total value. Wait, the question says "total value of tax increases proposed" so maybe 35 billion per year, but the question might need the total over five years. But the article says "a 70-billion-pound annual increase...half...by higher taxes". So per year, taxes are 35B. So the total over five years would be 175B. But the question says "proposed by Rachel Reeves to offset the increased borrowing costs from rising gilt yields". The article says the tax part is part of the plan. So maybe the answer is £35 billion annually, but the question is asking for total value. Hmm, maybe the question is ambiguous. The article says "half of which is paid for by higher taxes", so the total tax is 35 billion per year. Since the question is about the tax increases, the answer would be £35 billion (annually), but the question might want the total over five years. The question isn't clear. Since the article states "a 70-billion-pound annual increase...half...taxes", the tax portion per year is 35 billion. The question asks for the total value of tax increases proposed, which would be 35 billion annually. But the question might be expecting the annual amount, so maybe 35 billion. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A because the question is about the tax increases to offset the increased borrowing costs from rising yields. Since the article says the fiscal rules' buffer is wiped out by the yield rise, but the tax part was already part of the original plan, not specifically to offset the new costs. Therefore, the tax increases were part of the original funding, not the response to the yield rise. Hence, the answer would be N/A. Hmm, tricky. Let me check the article again. The article says "the 70 billion...half...taxes and the other half through borrowing." The tax part is part of the original plan, not a response to rising yields. The question is about tax increases to offset the increased borrowing costs from the yield surge. Since the tax part was already planned, maybe the answer is N/A because the question is about offsetting the new costs from yields, not the original funding. Therefore, I'll go with N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The fifth question asks how many times the Bank of England intervened between Truss's fall and Labour's budget. The article mentions that during Truss's time, the BoE had to intervene, but after her resignation (Truss fell), the article doesn't mention any further interventions by the BoE until now. The Labour's budget was in October, but the article doesn't state any interventions between Truss's fall and the budget. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The sixth question is about the growth rate target set by the OBR. The article says if yields stay high until March, the OBR's forecasts might force Reeves to adjust. But the article doesn't state a specific growth rate target. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Benjamin Caswell identified an economic indicator. The article says Caswell mentions the need for policies to calm markets without abandoning strategy. He says the policies are new and need time, but the question is about the primary driver of foreign investors' concerns. The article states investors are reacting to growth and inflation mix. So the primary indicator would be inflation. The answer is inflation.

8. **Question 8:** The debt-to-GDP ratio in Labour's fiscal rules. The article mentions "strict fiscal rules that would bring debt levels down" but doesn't specify the numerical target. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Number of cabinet members supporting modifying fiscal rules. The article doesn't mention any cabinet members' positions on this. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Quarterly GDP growth needed to offset borrowing costs. The article doesn't state a specific growth rate. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The political figure whose 2022 policies caused Truss's resignation. The article says Truss's tax cuts and borrowing caused the crisis, leading to her ousting. So the answer is Liz Truss herself. Wait, the question says "which British political figure's fiscal policies in 2022 directly caused the resignation of Prime Minister Liz Truss". Wait, that's a bit confusing. Truss's own policies caused her own resignation. So the answer is Liz Truss.

12. **Question 12:** Percentage of UK bonds held by domestic institutions. The article says a third are foreign, so domestic would be 66.6%, but it's not stated exactly. The article says "about a third...foreign investors", so the domestic is two-thirds. But the question asks for the percentage held by domestic institutional investors. The article doesn't specify domestic vs. domestic institutional. It just says foreign. So N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Consecutive months of labor data weakening delaying Fed cuts. The article mentions "successive strong labor market reports" which reduced expectations for Fed cuts. The question is about weakening conditions, but the article says strong reports. So the answer is N/A because it's the opposite.

14. **Question 14:** Tax category increased by Reeves. The article says "half...by higher taxes" but doesn't specify which taxes. N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Inflation rate in the month before the article. The article says data expected on Wednesday would show inflation at 2.6%, which is above the 2% target. So the answer is 2.6%.

16. **Question 16:** Geopolitical event linked to global bond yield surge. The article mentions the U.S. presidential election (Trump's election) leading to higher yields. So the answer is the U.S. presidential election.

17. **Question 17:** Cumulative borrowing over five years. The annual increase is £70B, with half from borrowing. So borrowing per year is £35B. Over five years, 35*5=175B. The question asks for the total cumulative amount, so 175 billion pounds.

18. **Question 18:** Agency head enforcing fiscal rules. The Office for Budget Responsibility is mentioned as the watchdog. The head isn't named. The article mentions "the Office for Budget Responsibility...independent watchdog...publishes forecasts in March". The head isn't named, so N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Debt-to-GDP target. The article says "strict fiscal rules that would bring debt levels down" but no numerical target. N/A.

20. **Question 20:** Year with previous highest 30-year gilt yield. The article states 30-year yields were highest since 1998. So the answer is 1998.
