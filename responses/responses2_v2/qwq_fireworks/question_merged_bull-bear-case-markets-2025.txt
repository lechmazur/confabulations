Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the strict instructions. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks for the name of Trump's deputy chief of staff known for his stance on immigration, in the context of the Chinese hack. I remember reading towards the end about an immigration split where Stephen Miller is mentioned as a hard-liner overseeing immigration crackdowns during Trump's first term and now his deputy chief of staff. The article states: "Trump has chosen Stephen Miller, the hard-liner who oversaw an immigration crackdown during his first administration, as his deputy chief of staff this time." So the answer should be Stephen Miller.

2. **Question 2:** The economist warning about a one-time tariff's effect on PCE. The text mentions David Mericle of Goldman Sachs: "David Mericle, a Goldman Sachs economist, wrote in a research note this week." The exact quote says a tariff boost would raise core PCE by a third of a percentage point. So David Mericle is the answer.

3. **Question 3:** The environmental alliance Bank of America exited. The article says they left the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, along with others like Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. The exact line: "Bank of America and Citigroup quit a major financial alliance for climate change. The departures from the Net-Zero Banking Alliance..." So the answer is Net-Zero Banking Alliance.

4. **Question 4:** FactSet's S&P 500 benchmark for 2025. The article states, "the benchmark index climbing to just below 6,700 by the end of 2025, according to FactSet." So the numerical benchmark is 6,700.

5. **Question 5:** Number of venture capital firms investing last year. The text says: "the number of venture capital firms investing in U.S. start-ups fell last year to 6,175, down 25 percent from 2021." So the answer is 6,175.

6. **Question 6:** The body that revised rate cuts from four to two. The article mentions the Fed: "the Fed last month lowered its 2025 forecast for rate cuts to two, from the four it had forecast in September." So the answer is the Federal Reserve (Fed).

7. **Question 7:** The Nomura economist talking about disparities due to policy. The text says David Seif: "David Seif, chief economist for developed markets at Nomura... 'I would expect there to be real dispersion between different economies...'". So David Seif is the answer.

8. **Question 8:** Nippon Steel's bid value for U.S. Steel. The article states: "$15 billion acquisition of the company." So the answer is $15 billion.

Wait, let me double-check each to ensure accuracy. For question 1, the deputy chief of staff is indeed Stephen Miller. The Chinese hack part is just the context but the question is about the name, which is there. All others seem to match. The numbers and names are correctly extracted. Okay, I think that's all.
