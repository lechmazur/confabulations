Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article. Let me start by going through each question and see what the text says.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks which Italian politician's arrest during Tangentopoli inspired Schutte's "United Enemies". The article mentions Tangentopoli as a nationwide bribery scandal leading to many politicians being indicted, but it doesn't name a specific politician. So the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The number of "Glass Heads" versions before steel pedestals. The article says the "Glass Heads" are plopped on steel pedestals, but there's no mention of earlier versions or counts. N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Enrollment capacity of the stage design program. The text doesn't provide numbers about the program's capacity. N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Month in 1982 when "Man in Mud" was completed. The article states it was from 1982 but not the month. N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Material for "Warriors" before wood and beer caps. The article says "Warriors" wear beer-bottle caps instead of Prussian helmets, but doesn't mention prior materials. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Gallery in Rome for FIMO politicians. The article says Schutte was in Rome during Tangentopoli and made the sculptures there, but no specific gallery is named. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Oven temperature for FIMO clay. The text mentions kitchen oven but no temperature. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Square meters of "vacation home". The article says it was built at full scale but no size given. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Wax color for first human figure. The article mentions wax failed to stand but doesn't specify color. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Opening night visitors at MoMA. No attendance numbers provided. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Material besides FIMO for the Rome sculptures. The article says "brightly colored FIMO modeling clay... around little wooden dowels". So the other material is wood. Answer: wooden dowels.

12. **Question 12**: Number of "Man in Mud" versions in the year he took stage design. The article says "first 'Man in Mud' in 1982" and he took the stage design program then. Since he made the first version that year, the count is 1. Answer: 1.

13. **Question 13**: Other work with beer caps. The "Warriors" are mentioned, but the question asks for another. The article doesn't mention another work using beer caps. N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Art movement seen as American imperialism. The text says Minimalism and Conceptualism felt like American cultural imperialism. Answer: Minimalism and Conceptualism.

15. **Question 15**: Headgear contrasting Warriors. They wear beer caps instead of Prussian spiked helmets. Answer: Prussian spiked helmet.

16. **Question 16**: Samuel Beckett play referenced. The article mentions "Happy Days" with Winnie buried. Answer: Happy Days.

17. **Question 17**: Full-scale structure like "vacation home". The article mentions "Model for a Museum" and "vacation home for terrorists" as full-scale. The question asks which he actually built. The "vacation home" is the one built. Wait, the article says "he actually built at full scale" refers to the vacation home. The question asks for another similar structure. The "Model for a Museum" is a model. The answer should be the vacation home itself, but the question is about another similar structure. Wait, the article says "a Farnsworth House-like 'vacation home for terrorists' â€” the last of which he actually built at full scale." So the vacation home is the structure built. The question asks "what architectural structure... did he actually construct", so the answer is the "vacation home for terrorists". But the question phrasing says "similar to Schutte's 'vacation home for terrorists', did he actually construct?" So maybe the answer is the "vacation home for terrorists" itself. But the question is phrased as "similar to", so perhaps the Farnsworth House? But the article says it's "Farnsworth House-like", so the actual built one is the vacation home. The answer is "vacation home for terrorists".

Wait, the question says "what architectural structure, similar to Schutte's 'vacation home for terrorists', did he actually construct?" But the vacation home is the one he built. Maybe the question is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the "Model for a Museum" is another, but the article says he built the vacation home at full scale, so the answer is "vacation home for terrorists".

18. **Question 18**: Color of gestural paintings. The article says "red and orange". Answer: red and orange.

19. **Question 19**: Position Paulina Pobocha accepted. The article states she became chair of modern and contemporary art at the Art Institute of Chicago. Answer: chair of modern and contemporary art.

20. **Question 20**: Specific scandal inspiring "United Enemies". The article says Tangentopoli, the Italian bribery scandal. Answer: Tangentopoli.
