Okay, let me start by going through each question one by one and check the article for the answers.

1. The first question asks for the temperature reading at Palmer Station when Meredith watched the game. The article mentions Palmer Station's temperatures are below freezing even in summer, but there's no specific temperature given for that exact time. So N/A.

2. The second question is about how many zooplankton samples Meredith collected. The article says she studied zooplankton but doesn't mention the number of samples. N/A again.

3. The third question is who suggested moving to the birder hut because of penguin smells. The text says Robbins mentioned the rumor about the penguin poop, but it doesn't say he was the one who suggested moving. So maybe N/A?

Wait, the article states: "Darren's rumor is that we used to be in the big building with an office, but everybody got really sick of smelling penguin poop," Robbins said. So it's Darren's rumor, but who actually moved them? The article doesn't name the person who suggested moving, so N/A.

4. The Chilean internet provider before Starlink. The article says "Palmer base now uses the Starlink satellite system for high-speed internet access. In mid-December the satellites began pinging from the United States rather than Chile..." So the previous provider was Chile-based, but the name isn't given. So N/A.

5. Ken Halanych raised an Auburn flag in 2004. The question is how many flags he raised over eight visits. The article only mentions one instance in 2004. So answer is 1? Or maybe more? The text says "he persuaded the station manager at Palmer Station to let him raise an Auburn flag on the ship." Only one mention, so 1.

6. The brand of iPad Meredith used. The article says she used an iPad but doesn't specify the brand. Wait, iPad is the brand. So the answer is iPad. But the question is about the brand, so Apple? Wait, no, the question says "brand of iPad"—but iPad is Apple's product. Wait, maybe the question is a trick. The article just says "iPad" so the brand is Apple? Or maybe the question is wrong. The article doesn't mention the brand, so N/A? Wait, the article says "iPad" so the brand is Apple. Hmm, but the question is phrased as "brand of iPad"—maybe the answer is iPad, but that's the model. Wait, perhaps the article doesn't specify the model or brand beyond "iPad", so the answer would be N/A? Because the brand is Apple, but the question is about the iPad's brand, which is Apple. Wait, but the question is asking for the brand of the iPad she used, which is Apple. But the article just says "iPad" so maybe the answer is "iPad" but that's the model. Hmm, tricky. The question might be expecting N/A since the article doesn't specify the brand beyond the device type. Or perhaps the answer is Apple. But since the article doesn't mention the brand beyond the device name, I'll go with N/A.

Wait, the question says "brand of iPad"—iPad is a brand under Apple. But the question is phrased as if expecting a specific brand name beyond Apple. Since the article doesn't mention any specific model or brand other than iPad, the answer would be N/A. Because the question is about the brand of the iPad, but iPad itself is the product line from Apple. Since the article doesn't specify beyond "iPad", the answer is N/A.

7. The Bills player who started the table diving tradition. The article says Ricky Robbins referenced "diving through tables" as a popular activity, but doesn't name the player. So N/A.

8. The wave height in Drake Passage when departing. The article mentions 40-foot waves in the Drake Passage but not specifically when they left. The text says "the Drake Passage, can have 40-foot waves." But when they departed, it's unclear if that was the actual height then. The question is about the wave height during their departure. The article says "the Drake Passage can have 40-foot waves" but doesn't state the actual height at that time. So N/A.

9. Number of penguin colonies counted before the Broncos loss. The article says they were counting penguin colonies when the Broncos lost, but no number is given. N/A.

10. Maximum internet bandwidth per person under 2018 guidelines. The 2018 manual cautioned against large downloads, but didn't specify bandwidth numbers. So N/A.
