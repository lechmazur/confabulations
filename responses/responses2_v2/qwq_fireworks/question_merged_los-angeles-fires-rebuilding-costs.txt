Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let's go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks which government agency Tricia Wachtendorf indicated was best equipped to handle immediate financial needs compared to long-term costs. Looking at the article, Tricia is mentioned as part of the Disaster Research Center. She talks about three phases of costs: preparation, immediate needs, and long-term recovery. The article states that FEMA is mentioned later when the Amiranis applied for aid. But the question is about which agency handles immediate vs long-term. The article says "they have applied for aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)..." but doesn't explicitly compare FEMA to others in terms of immediate vs long-term. Wait, the question might be a bit tricky. The user might be thinking that FEMA is the government agency involved here. Since Tricia's buckets include FEMA's role indirectly? Wait, the question says "indicated was best equipped" but the article doesn't explicitly compare agencies. The only mention is that FEMA is applied to, but the answer might be N/A because there's no direct statement from her about FEMA's role in immediate vs long-term. Hmm, but maybe the answer is FEMA? Wait the question says Tricia indicated. Let me check again. The article says "the family has fire insurance under the California FAIR plan... but they are concerned that the provider is not financially equipped to handle the losses... They have already applied for aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency..." So Tricia's comments were about the three cost phases, but she didn't mention FEMA. The question is asking which agency she indicated as better for immediate vs long-term. Since she didn't mention any agency specifically, the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2**: How many generations of Marcell Scott's family lived in Altadena before the fire? The article says "Mr. Scott's family has lived in the area for generations, with family spread across 'Dena'". The exact number isn't given, so "generations" is plural but not specified. So answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Total insurance payout for lost rental income. The article says they have fire insurance under CA FAIR plan, but the concern is the provider might not handle losses. They filed a claim for damages to the house, but the question is about rental income loss. The article doesn't mention the payout amount, so N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Nonprofit WalkGood LA partnered with which organization for gift cards? The article says they ran a distribution center themselves, no mention of a partner. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Estimated timeline for infrastructure restoration. The article quotes Lui Elliot saying "probably won't have power for a long time" but no specific timeline from officials. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Property value decrease in Malibu. The article doesn't provide data on property values, so N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Percentage at Westwood shelter with housing in first week. No data given on percentages, so N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Mental health services recommended by Disaster Research Center. The article mentions personal costs like mental health but doesn't specify services recommended. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Value of fruit harvest from Lavasani's trees. The article lists types of trees but no monetary value, so N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Volunteer hours by Kamala Harris. The article mentions her tour but not volunteer hours, so N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Musical instrument of Lui's father. The article says his father was a musician with a record collection but doesn't specify the instrument, so N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Generations of Scott's family in Altadena. Same as question 2, which was N/A. Wait, the question here is phrased as "how many generations... considering he mentioned their roots as a Black community..." The article says "family has lived in the area for generations" but no number, so still N/A.

13. **Question 13**: Which VP announced federal aid? The article mentions Kamala Harris toured the damage but doesn't say she announced a new aid package. It says it was her first visit since leaving office, so she's not VP anymore. The answer would be N/A because the article doesn't mention her announcing aid.

14. **Question 14**: Specific insurance coverage excluded under CA FAIR plan. The article says they have fire insurance but are concerned the provider can't handle losses. It doesn't mention exclusions, so N/A.

15. **Question 15**: Days fires burned before containment. The article says "the past week" but doesn't specify containment dates. So N/A.

16. **Question 16**: Percentage of Altadena's population part of historic Black community. The article mentions their fears about losing history but no percentage, so N/A.

17. **Question 17**: Nonprofit partnered with FEMA at Westwood shelter. The shelter is run by the county, and WalkGood LA is mentioned separately. No FEMA partnership stated, so N/A.

18. **Question 18**: Exact date FAIR plan claim denied. The article doesn't mention the denial date, only that they filed a claim. So N/A.
