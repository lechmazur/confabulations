Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by reading through the questions again and then check the article for each answer.

1. **Which South Korean president first acknowledged the United States' role in the Jeju uprising through a formal diplomatic channel?**  
The article mentions that South Korea's presidents Roh Moo-hyun in 2003 and Moon Jae-in in 2018 issued apologies. However, it doesn't specify if they addressed the U.S. role in a formal diplomatic channel. The question is about the U.S. complicity being acknowledged, but the text says the U.S. hasn't issued an apology. So the answer might be N/A because the question asks which president did this, but the article doesn't say any president acknowledged the U.S.'s role specifically in a formal diplomatic way. Wait, the article says "not by the United States, which was then occupying..." So the South Korean presidents apologized, but the question is about their acknowledgment of U.S. role. The article doesn't mention that detail. So N/A.

2. **How many birds were found dead in Inseon's compound when Kyungha arrived during the snowstorm?**  
The article mentions Inseon's pet bird that might starve, but there's no mention of dead birds found. So N/A.

3. **What medical condition did Inseon's mother develop as a direct result of witnessing the massacres?**  
The article says Inseon's mother was a survivor but doesn't mention a specific medical condition. N/A.

4. **Which literary award did "We Do Not Part" receive before being translated into English?**  
The article says it won the 2016 Booker Prize for "The Vegetarian," but "We Do Not Part" isn't mentioned as having an award before translation. N/A.

5. **What was the name of the American military commander who oversaw operations during the Jeju uprising according to Han Kang's narrative?**  
No name is provided here. N/A.

6. **In which year did Inseon abandon her filmmaking career to become a carpenter?**  
The article states she became a carpenter after being a filmmaker, but no year is given. N/A.

7. **What traditional Jeju Island ritual did Kyungha witness during her visit that connected to the theme of ancestral memory?**  
No specific ritual mentioned. N/A.

8. **How many blackened logs were ultimately installed in the memorial project before it was abandoned?**  
The article mentions the project involved blackened logs but doesn't specify the number. N/A.

9. **What was the title of the documentary film Inseon was working on before her career change?**

11. **Within the modern rendition of a violent South Korean historical event, which female character, identified as a historian who endures chronic pain and later embarks on a rescue expedition amidst a snowstorm, becomes central to the narrative?**  
The article mentions Kyungha as a historian with chronic pain and her journey to save the bird. So answer: Kyungha.

12. **In the review’s portrayal of mass atrocities set against an idyllic island backdrop, which uprising—laced with descriptions of infanticide and mass executions—forms the central historical event?**  
The Jeju uprising of 1948-49 is the central event. Answer: Jeju uprising of 1948-1949.

13. **In the English edition of the novel that intertwines lyrical poeticism with stark historical reporting, which translator whose name begins with an E contributed to the translation?**

14. **Amid the narrative’s interplay of disorienting time shifts and resurfacing memories, in which year did the uprising that instigated the governmental atrocities on Jeju begin?**  
The article states the Jeju uprising was between 1947 and 1954, but the main period is 1948-1949. The question asks when the uprising began, so 1947 or 1948. The exact start isn't specified, but the uprising's key period is 1948-49. The article says "the Jeju uprising of 1948 and 1949". So maybe 1948 is the start. But the article also mentions "between 1947 and 1954". Hmm. The question is about when the uprising that instigated the atrocities began. The article says "the 1948-49 uprising is seen by some historians as a precursor to the Korean War." So the uprising itself began in 1948. So answer: 1948.

15. **In the narrative that combines art installation projects with documentary aspirations, whose familial research into past massacres—uncovered by the protagonist—drives the regeneration of repressed memories?**
