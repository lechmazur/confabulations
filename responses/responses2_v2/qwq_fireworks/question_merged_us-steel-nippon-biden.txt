Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and answer each question strictly based on the information given. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks for the percentage of U.S. Steel's workforce that might be affected if they relocate their headquarters, as threatened by Nippon Steel after the deal was blocked. The article mentions that U.S. Steel has around 20,000 workers overall, with about 4,000 in Pennsylvania. If the headquarters were relocated, maybe the Pennsylvania workers could be affected. But the article says U.S. Steel warned they might have to lay off workers, relocate the headquarters, and invest in mills in the South. However, the exact percentage isn't specified. The question mentions "mirroring the reduction seen since its 1940s peak," which was from 340,000 to 20,000. But that's historical data. The question is about a possible future layoff. Since there's no specific percentage given for potential layoffs due to relocation, I think this is N/A.

2. The second question asks what legal precedent Nippon cited in their letter accusing the White House of "impermissible influence," similar to Jason Furman's criticism. The article states Nippon accused the White House of "impermissible influence" but doesn't mention a specific legal precedent they cited. Furman called it a betrayal of allies and abuse of law, but there's no mention of a precedent. So N/A.

3. Third question: What alternative investment did Nippon propose similar to SoftBank's $100 billion pledge? The article mentions SoftBank's pledge but doesn't say Nippon proposed anything else. The article says Nippon pledged to keep the headquarters in Pittsburgh and invest in upgrading mills, but that's not an alternative investment like SoftBank's. So N/A.

4. Fourth question: If U.S. Steel's stock decline mirrored the drop after Cleveland-Cliffs' bid, what action beyond legal challenges did Burritt suggest? The article says Burritt called Biden's action "shameful" and said the company would fight. The question refers to an action beyond legal challenges. The article mentions U.S. Steel might have to lay off workers, relocate, etc., but Burritt's statement doesn't specify another action. The answer might be "fight" but that's legal. The question might be asking for something else. Wait, the article says "U.S. Steel executives have warned that without Nippon, it might have to lay off workers, relocate the headquarters and invest in mills that it has been building in the South." So the specific action beyond legal would be layoffs or relocating? The question says "what specific action...echoing Trump's warning." Trump warned "Buyer Beware!!!" Maybe the answer is layoffs? But the question asks for an action the company would take beyond legal challenges, which is "lay off workers". But the question's exact wording is: "what specific action, beyond legal challenges, did David B. Burritt's statement suggest the company would take, echoing Mr. Trump's social media warning?" The article says Burritt said they intended to fight (legal), but the executives warned layoffs. But Burritt's statement's specific action? Maybe "fight" is legal, so the other action is layoffs. However, the question is about Burritt's statement. His statement was "shameful and corrupt" and "intended to fight". The article says the company would have to lay off workers, but that's from the executives, not necessarily Burritt's statement. So maybe N/A because the question specifies Burritt's statement. The answer might be "N/A" since the article doesn't explicitly state another action he mentioned beyond legal.

5. Fifth question: What formal complaint did U.S. Steel lodge with CFIUS regarding the union's involvement? The article mentions the union opposed the deal, but U.S. Steel's complaint isn't detailed. The question asks if U.S. Steel lodged a complaint similar to Nippon's accusation. The article says Nippon accused the White House, but U.S. Steel's complaint isn't mentioned. So N/A.

6. Sixth question: How many days between the union's opposition and Shapiro's statement? The union opposed the deal from the start. The article says the bid faced opposition from the moment announced in Dec 2023. Shapiro's statement was on Friday after Biden's decision. The exact dates aren't given. The timeline mentions the deal was blocked on Friday (the announcement day), but the exact days between Dec 2023 and the announcement (which is presumably after the election in 2024?) The article says the decision was made on Friday (the article's present time), but without specific dates, can't calculate days. So N/A.

7. Seventh question: What clause in the union contracts did Nippon refuse to honor? The union argued Nippon wouldn't honor contracts and protect pensions. The article says Nippon said they would honor existing contracts, but the union's objection was about future investments and pensions. The exact clause isn't named. So N/A.

8. Eighth question: What specific type of steel did Nippon plan to produce exclusively? The article mentions the Willis Tower used U.S. Steel's metal, but doesn't specify the type. Nippon's plans for upgraded mills in PA aren't detailed beyond "upgrading mills" and "steel production". So N/A.

9. Ninth question: What earlier executive order did Trump enact similar to blocking foreign steel, specifically impacting companies in the article? The article mentions Trump imposed tariffs on foreign steel imports from Mexico, Canada, Europe. The specific executive order would be tariffs on steel imports, like the 2018 tariffs. The question asks for the exact name or reference. The article just says "sweeping tariffs on foreign steel imports", so the answer is "tariffs on foreign steel imports" but the question wants the specific executive order name. Since the article doesn't name it (like EO 13816 or similar), it's N/A.

10. Tenth question: What alternative buyer did CFIUS suggest besides Cleveland-Cliffs? The article mentions Cleveland-Cliffs made a bid, but CFIUS didn't suggest another buyer. The article says U.S. Steel received other offers but doesn't say CFIUS suggested one. So N/A.

11. Eleventh question: What tech advancement did U.S. Steel fail to adopt? The article says they were slow to adopt rapidly evolving technology. The exact tech isn't named. So N/A.

12. Twelfth question: Which 2023 federal infrastructure project drove steel demand? The article mentions "post-pandemic boost to the steel market...federal infrastructure investments", but doesn't name a specific project completed in 2023. So N/A.

13. Thirteenth question: Stock price decline percentage on announcement day? The article says U.S. Steel's stock dropped on Friday, but no percentage is given. So N/A.

14. Fourteenth question: Specific clause in the contract Nippon planned to violate? The union said Nippon wouldn't honor contracts and protect pensions. The exact clause isn't specified. So N/A.

15. Fifteenth question: Total tariffs on Mexican steel under Trump? The article says he imposed tariffs on Mexico, Canada, Europe but doesn't give the dollar amount. So N/A.

16. Sixteenth question: Which PA infrastructure project did Shapiro reference? The article says Shapiro urged U.S. Steel to honor commitments but doesn't mention a specific project. So N/A.
