Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful to answer each exactly based on the text without any assumptions.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks which French concentration camp Marion translated her husband's works from while working as a saleswoman in NYC. The article mentions she worked in a department store, but the translation work started after their marriage. The camp she was in was Gurs, but the timing here is off because she was translating after marriage. Wait, the question says "while working as a saleswoman in NYC"—the article states she worked at a department store in NYC before marriage. But her translation work began after marriage. So the answer might be N/A because the translation wasn't done while she was a saleswoman. Wait, no—the question is phrased as "translated her husband's works from while working..." so maybe it's asking the camp she was in, not where she translated. The camp was Gurs. But the phrasing is confusing. Let me check again. The article says "Following their marriage, she changed the rhythm..." and her translation work started then. So the translation wasn't during her saleswoman days. The question might be a trick. The camp she was in was Gurs. So answer is Gurs.

2. **Question 2:** How many copies sold after Marion convinced Oprah to promote? The article says "three million came after her translation" which was promoted by Oprah. So answer is 3 million.

3. **Question 3:** Name of department store where she met her husband. The article doesn't mention the store's name. It says she worked at a department store in NYC but no name given. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Presidential admin when Beit Tzipora was established? The article says they used the Nobel Prize money from 1986 to found the Elie Wiesel Foundation. The Beit Tzipora Centers are managed by her, but the article doesn't specify when they were established. The question asks during which presidency—maybe Reagan's? Since the Bitburg incident was under Reagan. But the article doesn't state the establishment's date. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Title of her autobiography. The text says she wrote an unpublished reminiscence, but the title isn't given. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Languages translated before marriage. She translated his works after marriage. Before marriage, she was a saleswoman. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** ABC program where she coached him for Ted Koppel interviews. The article mentions frequent TV interviews with Ted Koppel on ABC, but the specific program isn't named. Koppel hosted Nightline. But the article doesn't say, so N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Who recommended her as a wife? The Lubavitcher rabbi urged Elie to marry, but the question is who recommended Marion specifically. The article says the rabbi wrote to Elie to marry, not Marion. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Value of Nobel Prize money. The article doesn't mention the amount. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Who introduced her to Broadway parties? The article says she convinced him to go, but who introduced her? No info, so N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Documentary title about Vishniac's photos. The article says she edited "To Give Them Light" and wrote/narrated "Children of the Night" about Holocaust children. The Vishniac part is "To Give Them Light". The question is about her documentary, which is "Children of the Night".

12. **Question 12:** University attended before NYC. She went to University of Miami but mainly lived in NYC. So answer is University of Miami.

13. **Question 13:** Name of the department store where she worked. The article doesn't name it. So N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Years after marriage to establish the foundation. The foundation was founded with Nobel Prize money from 1986. They married in 1969. 1986-1969=17 years. So 17.

15. **Question 15:** Rabbi influencing Ethiopian children? The article mentions the Lubavitcher rabbi's advice about marriage, but not about Ethiopian children. The Beit Tzipora work isn't linked to the rabbi. So N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Artifact displayed at the museum. The article mentions her mother's jewelry and silver candlesticks were bartered, but doesn't say they were displayed. So N/A.

17. **Question 17:** Broadway cast party's name. The article just mentions a Broadway cast party at Sardi's, not the specific show. So N/A.

18. **Question 18:** Primary language besides English for translations. She translated from French to English. So French.

19. **Question 19:** Number of siblings. The article mentions her parents (Emil and Jetta) but no siblings. So N/A.

20. **Question 20:** Title of Elie's first work she translated. The first book was "Night", but the 2006 translation was the final edition. His first published work might be "Night", but the article says she worked on 14 books including Night. The first one she translated is unclear. The question asks the first he published that she assisted. Since Night was originally translated by Stella, Marion's translation was later. So maybe another book? The article doesn't specify the first one she translated. So N/A.
