Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly what's asked. Let me start by going through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: How does Hazal's use of tarot cards in her soulmate-matching process directly conflict with Cem's scientific protocols at the Love Hospital?  
   The article mentions Hazal uses "smell, horoscopes and kooky social engineering" while Cem has "scientific treatment protocols". Tarot isn't mentioned, but horoscopes are close. Since tarot isn't in the text, maybe it's a trick. The answer should be that her methods (horoscopes) conflict with his science. But the question specifies tarot cards. Since the article doesn't mention tarot, answer N/A?

2. **Question 2**: What childhood trauma involving Cem's father is revealed?  
   The text says Cem's issues start with parents' divorce and his mom. There's nothing about his father's trauma. His father isn't mentioned. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Symbolic object compared to dreamy romance?  
   The article says "fluttering hearts" in the critique. Maybe the answer is "fluttering hearts" as the symbol.

4. **Question 4**: Number of patients cured before Hazal's arrival?  
   The article doesn't mention specific numbers from records in Episode 3. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Tom Green's character cameo?  
   The article mentions Tom Green has new projects on Amazon, but no cameo in "Lovers Anonymous" is stated. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Scent therapy for the flight attendant?  
   The text says Hazal uses "smell" methods. But the specific scent isn't named. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Historical figure's portrait in the lobby?  
   The article doesn't mention any portraits. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Name of the institution?  
   The Love Hospital is explicitly stated. So answer is "Love Hospital".

9. **Question 9**: Streaming platform?  
   Netflix is mentioned. Answer is Netflix.

10. **Question 10**: TV critic's name?  
    The review is by Margaret Lyons of The Times. So her name.

11. **Question 11**: Feature on paper readouts?  
    The article says "the outlines of hearts" on readouts. So answer is "outlines of hearts".

12. **Question 12**: Character with parental divorce and mom issues?  
    Cem's background is mentioned. So answer Cem.

13. **Question 13**: Narrative device integrating patient stories?  
    The article says "serialized plots, "Lovers" also has episodic arcs". So "serialized plots and episodic arcs".

14. **Question 14**: Section title about epic styles?  
    The article has a section titled "The Extravagance of TV Title Sequences". That's mentioned in the context of other topics. So that's the answer.

15. **Question 15**: Renowned publication's critic?  
    The article states Margaret Lyons is a TV critic at The Times. So "The New York Times" (assuming The Times refers to NYT).

Wait, checking each again:

1. The question mentions tarot cards, but the article says horoscopes. Since tarot isn't there, answer N/A.

2. The trauma is with his mother and parents' divorce, not father. So N/A.

3. The article says "fluttering hearts" in the critique. So "fluttering hearts".

4. No numbers given. N/A.

5. No cameo mentioned. N/A.

6. Scent-based therapy is mentioned, but no specific scent. N/A.

7. No historical figure's portrait. N/A.

8. Love Hospital is correct.

9. Netflix.

10. Margaret Lyons.

11. Outlines of hearts.

12. Cem.

13. "serialized plots" and "episodic arcs" are the narrative devices. The question asks for the narrative device mentioned, which is "serialized plots, "Lovers" also has episodic arcs". The device is the combination, but the question asks for the device mentioned in the review. The article says "Along with its serialized plots, "Lovers" also has episodic arcs, with various patients..." So the answer is "serialized plots and episodic arcs".

14. The section titled "The Extravagance of TV Title Sequences" is mentioned in the text, which is about title sequences. So that's the answer.

15. The article says "Margaret Lyons is a television critic at The Times", so the publication is "The Times". But the user might expect "The New York Times", but the text just says "The Times". So answer "The Times".
