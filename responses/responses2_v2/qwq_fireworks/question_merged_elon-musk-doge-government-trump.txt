Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked and not infer beyond the text. Let me go through each question step by step.

1. **Question 1**: The encrypted messaging app used by DOGE representatives to coordinate with Jared Kushner's transition team. The article mentions that communication is conducted on Signal. But does it specifically link Signal to Jared Kushner's team? The article says "much of its communication is conducted on Signal" and that Brad Smith worked with Jared Kushner. So maybe the answer is Signal.

2. **Question 2**: Fellowship program by Marc Andreessen for DOGE's Medicare deregulation. The article says Thiel Fellowship recipients are involved, not Marc Andreessen's program. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Federal agency created under Obama housing DOGE engineers. The article mentions U.S. Digital Service (created by Obama) where some DOGE personnel are housed. So answer is U.S. Digital Service.

4. **Question 4**: Hours Vinay Hiremath spent on classified projects. The article says he worked "100s of calls... next 4 weeks... 100s of calls". But no specific hours per week. He mentions 4 weeks of "100s of calls" but not exact hours. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Revised savings target by Brad Smith. The article says Musk walked back to $1 trillion but the question is about Brad Smith's private disclosure. The text doesn't mention Brad Smith's figure. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Nonprofit handling payroll. The article says DOGE is not incorporated as an outside entity or nonprofit. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: U.S. Code provision cited by James Burnham. The article mentions legal issues but doesn't cite a specific code. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: NIH budget cut percentage by Fishback. The article doesn't mention specific percentages for NIH. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Tech leader mandating 80-hour weeks. The article says Musk asked for 80-hour weeks. So Elon Musk.

10. **Question 10**: Trillion-dollar target by a principal. Musk initially said $2 trillion as best case. So $2 trillion.

11. **Question 11**: Platform where DOGE advertised positions. The article says DOGE's X account posted requests. So X.

12. **Question 12**: Max days for special employees. The article states 130 days in 365. So 130.

13. **Question 13**: Blog recounting Signal groups. Vinay Hiremath's blog is mentioned. So Vinay Hiremath.

14. **Question 14**: Agency housing minority of DOGE outside deployments. The article says minority are in Executive Office of the President at U.S. Digital Service. So U.S. Digital Service.

15. **Question 15**: Healthcare entrepreneur involved in staffing. Brad Smith is a health care entrepreneur and ran DOGE during transition. So Brad Smith.

16. **Question 16**: Lawyer exploring legal issues. James Burnham and others are mentioned, but the question specifies on behalf of a key protagonist. Musk's counsel is Chris Gober. So Chris Gober.

17. **Question 17**: Funding figure proposed by a leader. Musk mentioned $2 trillion initially. So $2 trillion.

18. **Question 18**: Recruitment medium for engineers/back-office. The article says DOGE's X account posted requests. So X.
