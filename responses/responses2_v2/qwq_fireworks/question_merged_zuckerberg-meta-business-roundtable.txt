Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I'm only using the information from the provided article and nothing else. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks which organization Peter Thiel joined after expressing views similar to Zuckerberg's criticism on the Joe Rogan podcast. The article mentions Peter Thiel's mansion where Zuckerberg attended a party, but it doesn't say Peter Thiel joined any organization. The Business Roundtable is mentioned as Zuckerberg joined it. The article doesn't link Thiel joining another group related to Zuckerberg's views. So answer N/A.

2. The event at Peter Thiel's mansion was a black-tie party. The question asks what event Zuckerberg attended after his Joe Rogan podcast. The article says the night before Trump's inauguration, he went to that party. The podcast mention is this month, but the timing isn't clear. Wait, the article says "this month" regarding the podcast, but the inauguration event is the night before. If the podcast was before the inauguration, then after the podcast, he might have gone to the party. But the question says "immediately after his appearance on the podcast." The article doesn't explicitly state the order. The event after the podcast would be the inauguration-related party. But the question says "similar to the one at Thiel's mansion," which was the party. The event immediately after the podcast might be the inauguration, but the answer should be the black-tie party. Wait, the party was the night before the inauguration. If the podcast was before that, then the event after the podcast would be the party. But the question says "immediately after the podcast," which the article doesn't specify. Hmm. The article says he attended the party the night before the inauguration and had the podcast "this month." Since the article's timeline isn't clear, but the only event mentioned after the podcast (if the podcast was recent) would be the inauguration. But the question asks for an event similar to the Thiel party, so maybe the answer is the inauguration? Wait the event at Thiel's was a black-tie party. The question's second part asks for an event similar to that. The article mentions the party at Thiel's mansion as the event before the inauguration. The question's second part is about an event similar to that which Zuckerberg attended after the podcast. Since the article doesn't mention another similar event after the podcast, maybe it's N/A. Wait the question says "immediately after his appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, he attended a black-tie party..." So the answer would be the black-tie party. Wait the question is phrased: "What type of event, similar to the one held at Peter Thiel's mansion, did Zuckerberg attend immediately after his appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast?" The Thiel event was a black-tie party. The answer would be the black-tie party. But the question is asking for an event similar to that, which he attended after the podcast. Since the Thiel party was the one he attended the night before the inauguration, and the podcast was "this month," perhaps the podcast was before the party. So the answer is the black-tie party. So the answer is black-tie party.

3. The question asks what action by the Business Roundtable under Chuck Robbins contradicted Zuckerberg's views. The article says the Business Roundtable in 2019 had a statement about companies considering more than shareholders, but Chuck Robbins is the current chairman and said diversity is good but the pendulum swung. So maybe the Roundtable under Robbins rolled back diversity efforts? Wait the article says Walmart's McMillon rolled back DEI efforts. The Business Roundtable's current chairman is Chuck Robbins, but the article mentions that the Roundtable's 2019 statement was part of "gentle capitalism" which Zuckerberg opposed. Now, under Robbins, did they do something contradicting Zuckerberg? The article states that at Davos, Robbins said diversity is good but the pendulum swung, implying a shift. The action contradicting Zuckerberg (who criticized corporate neutrality) would be supporting the previous stance. But the question is what action under Robbins contradicted Zuckerberg's stance. The Business Roundtable's 2019 statement was the "gentle capitalism" which Zuckerberg opposed. If Robbins is the current chairman, maybe he's moving away from that. The article says the Roundtable's stance had shifted even before Trump's re-election, and corporate focus was back on the bottom line. So maybe the Roundtable's current stance aligns with Zuckerberg, so there's no contradiction. Alternatively, if Robbins is still supporting DEI, but the article says discussion of social issues was absent at Davos. The answer might be N/A because the article doesn't mention a specific action by the Roundtable under Robbins contradicting Zuckerberg. The only mention is that Robbins said diversity is good but the pendulum swung, which might align with Zuckerberg's criticism. So perhaps N/A.

4. The question asks what investment strategy DeepSeek adopted mirroring "gentle capitalism." The article mentions DeepSeek's Rise as a start-up emphasizing research, emerging from a hedge fund. The "gentle capitalism" refers to the 2019 Roundtable statement about considering more than shareholders. If DeepSeek's strategy is research-focused, maybe that's the investment strategy. The question says "mirroring the 'gentle capitalism' approach," which was about more than shareholder interests. So perhaps the answer is research-focused investment. The article says DeepSeek emphasized research, so that's the answer.

5. The question is about Bill Gates' protest form against Trump's policies. The article says Bill Gates is taking a break from the future to examine his past, but doesn't mention any protests. The only protest mentioned is by Silicon Valley workers with subtle acts. The article says Bill Gates isn't like other tech billionaires, but there's no info on his protests. So answer N/A.

6. The unproven blood filter's name in Antigua. The article mentions two companies used an unproven blood filter in Antigua, but the name isn't given. So answer N/A.

7. The aspect of DeepSeek's research criticized by Zuckerberg. The article says Zuckerberg criticized monitoring speech and behavior, but DeepSeek's research isn't linked to that. The article mentions DeepSeek's research but doesn't connect it to Zuckerberg's criticism. So N/A.

8. Walmart's policy under McMillon mirroring Meta's fact-checking stop. The article says Walmart's McMillon rolled back DEI efforts. Meta stopped fact-checking, which is a policy change. The question asks for a similar policy change by Walmart. Since DEI rollback is different from fact-checking, maybe N/A. Unless stopping DEI is similar in corporate policy shift. The question says "mirroring the 'gentle capitalism' approach," but the answer should be about policy change like stopping something. The answer is rolling back diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.

9. Meta's policy shift before Trump's inauguration aligning with 2019 Roundtable statement. The 2019 statement was about considering more than shareholders. Meta's policy before inauguration was stopping fact-checking. That contradicts the Roundtable's stance, so maybe N/A. Wait the question says "directly aligned with the Business Roundtable's 2019 statement on corporate responsibility?" The 2019 statement was part of "gentle capitalism" which Zuckerberg opposed. So stopping fact-checking would not align with that. The question might be tricky. The article says that the Business Roundtable's 2019 stance was what Zuckerberg opposed. So maybe there's no policy by Meta that aligned with it. So N/A.

10. The medical innovation linked to corporate priorities shift at Davos. The article mentions the blood filter in Antigua and the Davos event where social issues were absent. The question asks for the innovation indirectly linked. The answer would be the unproven blood filter, but the name isn't given. So N/A.

11. Meta's policy change regarding speech moderation framed as rejecting the Roundtable's 2019 stance. The Roundtable's 2019 stance included ethical supplier relationships. Meta stopping fact-checking could be seen as rejecting the ethical aspects. So the answer is stopping fact-checking on Facebook posts.
