Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the strict answer format. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks which actor, known for a Barry Jenkins film, might be cast in a neo-western adaptation of "The Perfect Neighbor." The article mentions Stephan James in "Ricky" as part of Barry Jenkins' "If Beale Street Could Talk." Since the film in question deals with emotional turmoil similar to "The Perfect Neighbor," Stephan James is the likely answer.

2. The documentary using police body cams and interviews is "The Perfect Neighbor" by Geeta Gandbhir, as stated in the article. That's straightforward.

3. The central figure associated with Sundance despite not making appearances is Robert Redford. The text mentions he founded the institute and remains president, so that's him.

4. The debut film about a professor dealing with past assault is "Sorry, Baby," directed by Eva Victor. The article describes it as "bruising" and "bitingly funny."

5. The Alabama prison documentary is "The Alabama Solution" by Andrew Jarecki and Charlotte Kaufman, using inmate cellphone footage. That's clear from the text.

6. The essay film with DuBois' "Africana" is "BLKNWS: Terms & Conditions" by Kahlil Joseph. The article mentions it uses the encyclopedia as a jumping-off point.

7. The neo-western critiquing rugged individualism is "Rebuilding" by Max Walker-Silverman, set in Southern Colorado after a fire. The article says it's a critique of individualism and based on family history.

8. The satire with Sevigny, Shawkat, and Turner is "Atropia" by Hailey Gates, about a military training program with actors simulating war. The article lists those actors in that film.

9. The drama with a former prisoner and Stephan James? Wait, the article says "Ricky" stars Stephan James, who was in Barry Jenkins' film. The question mentions the actor known from Barry Jenkins, so yes, Stephan James is in "Ricky." The film is "Ricky" by Rashad Frett.

10. The festival considering Cincinnati or Salt Lake is Sundance, which has outgrown Park City. The article states this explicitly.

11. The critic is Manohla Dargis, the author of the article. The byline at the start says "By Manohla Dargis."

Wait, let me double-check each to ensure I didn't mix up any details. For question 9, the film is "Ricky," and it's discussed alongside Jenkins being a producer on "Sorry, Baby," but the question says the drama is discussed alongside festival producer accolades. The article mentions Jenkins was at the festival and is a producer on "Sorry, Baby," but the film in question here is "Ricky," anchored by James. The question is about "Ricky," so the answer is correct.

Everything else seems to align with the text. No need for N/A here since all answers are present.
