Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then check the article for the answers.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which medical condition Dorothy Parker claimed she developed from her interactions with the intelligentsia in her 1928 New Yorker piece. The article mentions her quote about gray hairs from making whoopee with the intelligentsia. Gray hairs are mentioned, but is that a medical condition? The question specifies a medical condition. The article doesn't state any medical condition, just gray hairs. So maybe N/A?

Wait, the question says "medical condition", but the quote is about gray hairs. Since gray hairs aren't a medical condition, the answer might be N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many episodes of The Tonight Show did Maggie Kuhn appear in with Johnny Carson before her SNL appearance? The article says she appeared "more than once" on The Tonight Show and mentions her SNL appearance with Candice Bergen. But the question asks for the number before her SNL appearance. The article doesn't specify the number of episodes, just that she was on multiple times. So exact number isn't given. Answer N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Primary reason Dwight Garner chose an ear trumpet instead of hearing aids? The article says he plans to use an ear trumpet "rather than hearing inserts, to better scare off children." The reason given is to scare children. So the answer is to scare off children.

4. **Question 4:** Which presidential candidate did AARP officially endorse during their focus on age discrimination? The article mentions AARP focusing on age discrimination politically but doesn't mention any specific presidential candidate endorsement. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Percentage decrease in elderly poverty from Social Security in its first decade? The article states Social Security is "our greatest poverty-reduction program" but doesn't give a specific percentage. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Average retirement age difference between white and Black workers in mid-20th century per Jacquelyne Jackson's research? The article mentions she's a sociologist highlighted by Chappel, but there's no specific number given for the retirement age difference. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Viewers of the final episode of "The Golden Girls" in 1992? The article doesn't provide viewership numbers for the final episode. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Annual income threshold for a dignified retirement per Chappel? The article discusses Chappel's points on retirement dignity but doesn't mention a specific income figure. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Which European country's pension system inspired Roosevelt's Social Security? The article doesn't mention any specific country's system as a model. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Membership fee for Gray Panthers when founded? The article mentions Maggie Kuhn founded Gray Panthers and her appearances, but no fee is stated. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Legislative act that redefined old age as a distinct stage? The article says Social Security helped invent the notion of old age as a stage. The answer is Social Security Act.

12. **Question 12:** Which early 20th-century wit is recalled for a remark on aging? The quote is from Dorothy Parker in 1928, so the answer is Dorothy Parker.

13. **Question 13:** Duke-affiliated historian's work on aging policies? The book is by James Chappel, an associate professor at Duke. So James Chappel.

14. **Question 14:** TV personality spotlighted for advocacy and appearances? Maggie Kuhn is mentioned for founding Gray Panthers and appearing on shows. So Maggie Kuhn.

15. **Question 15:** Sitcom about older women that the reviewer initially avoided? The article discusses "The Golden Girls" which the reviewer didn't watch when young. So The Golden Girls.

16. **Question 16:** Book critic turning 60 and Gen X? The author is Dwight Garner, who mentions his 60th birthday. So Dwight Garner.

17. **Question 17:** President providing compassionate face via poverty program? The article mentions FDR and Social Security as a poverty-reduction program. So Franklin D. Roosevelt.

18. **Question 18:** Conservative economist mistakenly linked to privatizing benefits? The article mentions right-wing efforts but doesn't name an economist. Maybe someone like Milton Friedman? But since it's not in the text, answer N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Number given for Chappel's book length? The book is 357 pages. The question links to decline of pensions, so the number is 357.

20. **Question 20:** Modern sitcom as benchmark for old age discussions? The article mentions "Grace and Frankie," "The Kominsky Method," "Hacks" as recent shows Chappel didn't cover. The benchmark would be The Golden Girls. But the question asks for a modern counterpart. Since the article says Chappel didn't cover recent ones, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "modern counterpart to the nostalgic impact", so maybe one of the mentioned shows. But the question might expect "The Golden Girls" as the benchmark. Wait, the article says "I wish his book had taken us closer to the present day. I would have liked to see him unpack the content of more recent series -- 'Grace and Frankie,' 'The Kominsky Method,' 'Hacks.'" So the benchmark would be The Golden Girls as discussed, and the modern ones are not covered. The question asks for the long-running sitcom implied as the benchmark. The text says "The Golden Girls" is discussed as the benchmark, so answer The Golden Girls. Wait, the question says "modern counterpart"—maybe one of the recent shows? The question might be tricky. The article says those recent shows are not covered, so perhaps the benchmark is The Golden Girls. But the question says "modern counterpart to the nostalgic impact", implying a newer show. Since the article doesn't name one as a benchmark, maybe N/A. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is N/A because the question is about a modern counterpart not mentioned as the benchmark. Hmm. The article says Chappel discussed The Golden Girls, so the benchmark is that show, but the modern ones are not discussed. Since the question asks for the benchmark, it's The Golden Girls. But the question wording is a bit unclear. Let me check again. The question says: "which long-running sitcom is implied to be the benchmark for discussions of American old age?" The article discusses The Golden Girls as the one he wants to revisit, so that's the benchmark. The modern ones are not the benchmark. So answer The Golden Girls. But the question says "modern counterpart"—maybe it's a trick. Wait, the article says "I would have liked to see him unpack the content of more recent series..." so the benchmark is The Golden Girls, so the answer is The Golden Girls. The question might be asking for the benchmark, so yes. So answer The Golden Girls.
