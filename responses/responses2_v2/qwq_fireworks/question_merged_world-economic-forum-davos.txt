Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information from the text and not make any assumptions beyond what's written.

1. **Question 1:** The article says "we livestream more than 50 percent of the sessions." But the question asks for a percentage. The exact figure isn't given, so it's over 50%, but since it's not a specific number, I have to put N/A because the percentage isn't exact.

2. **Question 2:** The text mentions "four shuttle lines connecting the various hotels with the venues." The question specifically asks about shuttle lines to Kurpark Village, which is one of the venues. Since all venues are connected by those four lines, the answer is 4.

3. **Question 3:** Klaus Schwab originally named it the European Management Symposium. The question is about the event that now has over 500 sessions, so the original name is given here directly.

4. **Question 4:** The article states "more than 45 hotels in Davos and the neighboring city of Klosters. Most book accommodations with us when they register." So the number is over 45, but the exact number isn't specified. Wait, the question says "how many hotels... have contracts" and the text says "contracts with more than 45 hotels," so the answer is more than 45. But the question asks for the number, so the exact figure isn't there. Wait, the text says "more than 45" so the answer is "more than 45" but the question might expect the number given. Wait, the question is asking for the number, but the article says "more than 45," so since it's not exact, but the question requires a number, maybe it's N/A. Wait, but the question says "how many hotels... have contracts," and the article says "contracts with more than 45 hotels," so the answer would be "more than 45" but the instructions say to answer with numbers if possible. Hmm, but maybe they want the exact number, which isn't given. Wait, the question says "how many hotels... have contracts with the World Economic Forum, as mentioned by the person who previously held a similar position for the Swiss Re Group?" The person mentioned is Podolak, who previously worked at Swiss Re. The article says "We have contracts with more than 45 hotels..." So the answer is "more than 45," but since the question requires a number, perhaps "N/A" because it's not an exact number. Wait, the question might be expecting the "more than 45" as the answer, but the instructions say to use exact numbers. Since it's "more than," the exact number isn't provided, so N/A? Wait, the instructions say "if the answer is not provided and cannot be logically inferred, write N/A". The article says "more than 45," so the answer is more than 45, but the question asks "how many," so maybe the answer is "more than 45" but the instructions prefer numbers. Since it's "more than," perhaps the answer is N/A? Hmm, maybe I should check again. The exact wording is "more than 45 hotels in Davos and the neighboring city of Klosters. Most book accommodations with us when they register." The question is asking how many hotels have contracts. The answer is "more than 45" but since the question wants a number, but it's not exact, maybe the answer is N/A? Or maybe the question is expecting the "more than 45" to be written as "over 45" but since it's a number, perhaps they just want 45? Wait, the article says "more than 45," so the actual number is 46 or higher. But since the exact number isn't given, the answer should be N/A. Wait, the question says "how many hotels... have contracts..." and the article states "more than 45," so the answer is "more than 45," but since the question requires a numerical answer, perhaps it's N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting the number mentioned, which is 45, but the article says "more than 45," so that's incorrect. Hmm. Maybe I need to go with "N/A" here.

5. **Question 5:** The article mentions "multiple checkpoints throughout" but doesn't specify the number. So the exact number isn't given, so N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The sessions are "roughly 45 minutes to an hour long." The maximum duration would be 60 minutes. The question is asking the maximum duration as determined by the person in charge of setup. The text says "the sessions are roughly 45 minutes to an hour long," so the maximum is an hour, which is 60 minutes.

7. **Question 7:** The Kurpark Village debuted in 2024 as a temporary wooden chalet. The article says "Kurpark Village, a nearly 65,000-square-foot temporary wooden chalet that debuted in 2024."

8. **Question 8:** The shuttle lines are four, as stated earlier. The question is the same as question 2 but phrased differently. So answer is 4.

9. **Question 9:** The head is Severin Podolak, who previously worked at Swiss Re Group. The article says "Severin Podolak... held a similar position for the Swiss Re Group."

10. **Question 10:** The event originally called European Management Symposium by Klaus Schwab is the World Economic Forum's annual meeting, known as Davos. The article states "Davos, which begins Monday... was started in 1971 by... Klaus Schwab, who initially named it the European Management Symposium."

11. **Question 11:** The charity is 4Reasons. The article says "donate whatever we can save to a local charity, 4Reasons."

12. **Question 12:** The article says "at least 45 minutes between sessions to clean the room and set up for the next session." So the minimum duration is 45 minutes.

13. **Question 13:** The Davos Ice Stadium is mentioned as a venue where hockey is played. The question is which venue might be mistaken for culinary because the article mentions food planning. The Congress Centre might be where sessions are, but the Ice Stadium is for hockey. However, the question is looking for a venue that's known for hockey but might be assumed to be culinary. Wait, the article mentions that the food and beverage concept is managed, but the Ice Stadium is for hockey. The answer is Davos Ice Stadium because it's mentioned as a venue, even though the food planning is part of the event logistics, not the stadium itself. The question is tricky, but the answer should be Davos Ice Stadium.

14. **Question 14:** The article states there are "around 5,000 security people on site during Davos."

15. **Question 15:** The heating is provided by "local wood pellets" exclusively, not oil or gas.

16. **Question 16:** The planning team meets "every day, sometimes multiple times daily" two months before Davos. The frequency is daily.
