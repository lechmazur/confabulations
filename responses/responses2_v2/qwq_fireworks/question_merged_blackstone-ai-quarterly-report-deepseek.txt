Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the provided article. 

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions that DeepSeek challenged the idea that AI needs huge power but doesn't specify terawatts. So, answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The article doesn't name any Silicon Valley venture capital firms backing DeepSeek. N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Blackstone's investments are mentioned as $10B for QTS in 2021 and $16B for AirTrunk. The time frame is 2020-2023, but the article only gives specific deals in 2021 and last year (2022). The total would be $26B, but since the question is between 2020-2023 and maybe other years aren't mentioned, but the exact total isn't given. Wait, the article says "In 2021, it purchased QTS for $10B, and last year (2022) led a $16B deal for AirTrunk." So between 2020-2023, the two deals sum to $26B. But the question is asking for the total between 2020-2023. Since the article doesn't mention any other investments in that period, maybe the answer is $26B? Wait, but the question says "total dollar amount Blackstone invested in data center infrastructure between 2020-2023". The article only mentions 2021 and 2022 (last year from the time of the article's context). Assuming the article's current year is 2023, "last year" would be 2022. So 2021 and 2022 are covered. The exact total is $10B + $16B = $26B. But does the question allow that? The article states those two deals, so the answer is $26 billion. Wait, but the question might require the exact figure from the article. Let me check again. The article says "In 2021, it purchased the U.S. data center firm QTS for $10 billion, and last year, it led a roughly $16 billion deal to buy AirTrunk". So between 2020-2023, the two deals are 2021 and 2022 (assuming "last year" is 2022). The total would be $26B. The question is asking for the total between 2020-2023. Since the article doesn't mention any other investments in those years, the answer is $26 billion. But wait, the question might be tricky. The article says "In recent years, Blackstone has made an aggressive push into buying and building data centers"—but the only numbers given are the two deals. So the answer is $26 billion. But the question is phrased as "total dollar amount Blackstone invested in data center infrastructure between 2020-2023?" The article mentions 2021 and last year (which would be 2022 if the article is in 2023). The total is $26B. So answer is $26 billion? Wait, but the article says "the roughly $16 billion deal to buy AirTrunk, which operates data centers in Asia." So yes, the total would be 10 + 16 = 26. But the question asks for the total between 2020-2023. Since the article doesn't mention 2020 or 2023 investments, but only 2021 and 2022, then the answer is $26B. So answer is $26 billion? But the article's exact wording is "In 2021... and last year... led a roughly $16 billion deal". So the total is $26B. Therefore, the answer is $26 billion. But maybe the question expects N/A because the article doesn't explicitly state the total between those years, only individual numbers. Hmm, tricky. The question asks for the total between 2020-2023. The article mentions two specific deals in 2021 and 2022, so adding them gives 26. But the question is asking for the total invested in that period, which the article provides the components of. So I think the answer is $26 billion. Wait but the article says "In recent years, Blackstone has made an aggressive push into buying and building data centers"—so maybe there were other investments not mentioned? The article only gives those two specific numbers. Since the question is about the total based on the article's info, it should be 26. So answer is 26 billion. But let me check the exact question again. The question says "total dollar amount Blackstone invested in data center infrastructure between 2020-2023?" The article only mentions 2021 and last year (2022). So the answer is $26B. So answer is $26 billion? The answer should be written as 26 billion? The article says $10 billion and $16 billion, so yes. So answer is $26 billion. Wait but the question says "total dollar amount", so the answer is $26 billion. So I'll put that.

4. **Question 4:** The article doesn't mention Microsoft's stock price change after Nadella's comments. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The article states that Gray expected the cost of computing power to fall drastically, leading to wider adoption, but doesn't give a percentage. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** AirTrunk operates in Asia, but the article doesn't specify which countries. The answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "AirTrunk, which operates data centers in Asia." So the countries aren't listed. So answer is N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The article says Blackstone builds data centers only for companies that sign long-term leases. The exact term isn't given, so the answer is "long-term" but the question asks for the length. Since it's not specified, N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The article doesn't mention QTS's power capacity in megawatts. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The article mentions Blackstone's stock up 40% in a year but not quarterly revenue growth from AI investments. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The article says Schwarzman made comments in July, but the first announcement isn't specified. The article mentions his July comments, but there's no info on when he first announced the pivot. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The article mentions AirTrunk was acquired for $16B, not $24B. The correction states the earlier version had $24B but it's actually $16B. So the answer is N/A because the question says $24B which is incorrect per the correction. So answer is N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Schwarzman cited $1 trillion in the U.S. over five years. The question says "over the next decade"—so the article says five years, not a decade. So the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "over the next five years". The question asks for a decade, so the answer is N/A.

13. **Question 13:** The article states Blackstone builds data centers only for companies with long-term leases, not speculative. No specific company named as having a speculative project. The question asks which company signed a long-term lease for a speculative project, but the article says they don't build speculatively. So no such company, so N/A.

14. **Question 14:** The article says Gray's comments echoed Nadella's views, but doesn't state the primary reason Nadella gave. N/A.
