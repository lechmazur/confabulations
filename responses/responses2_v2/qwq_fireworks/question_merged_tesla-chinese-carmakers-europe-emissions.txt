Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and answer exactly what's asked. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. The first question asks which French automaker's CEO estimated penalties over $15 billion. Scanning the article, I remember there's a quote from Luca de Meo of Renault. The text says, "Luca de Meo, chief executive of Renault, estimated that paying fines could cost the industry more than $15 billion this year." So Renault is the answer here.

2. The second question is about an American business leader who sells emissions credits and criticizes EU tariffs. Elon Musk is mentioned as Tesla's CEO, and the article states he criticized EU tariffs on Chinese EVs. That fits, so Elon Musk is the answer.

3. The third question is about the EU's target for emission reduction by 2030. The article says, "Regulators insist that Europe stay the course to cut emissions by 55 percent by 2030, compared with 1990 levels." So 55% is the percentage.

4. The fourth question refers to a country that rolled back auto pollution rules. The text mentions the U.S. under Trump: "the United States, where Mr. Trump has vowed to curb business regulations and rolled back auto pollution rules in his first term." So the answer is the United States.

5. The fifth question asks for the required fraction of zero-emissions cars. The article states, "The E.U. measures also require at least a quarter of all new cars produced this year to be electric." A quarter is 25%, so 25%.

6. The sixth question is about an automaker from a merger of PSA and Fiat Chrysler that bought credits. The text mentions Stellantis: "Stellantis, formed from the merger of PSA Group and Fiat Chrysler, purchased around $2 billion in emission credits from Tesla from 2019 to 2021." So Stellantis is the answer.

7. The seventh question is about the European Commission leader promising swift action. The article says Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged challenges and pledged regulators were "acting swiftly." So her name is the answer.

8. The eighth question asks which manufacturers had a 45% increase in EV sales. The text mentions Chinese manufacturers: "their share of the market is only expected to increase." Specifically, "Chinese manufacturers, who recorded a 45 percent increase in E.V. sales in Europe." So Chinese manufacturers.

9. The ninth question is about the financial institution projecting Tesla's compensation. The article says UBS analyzed this: "According to an analysis by the Swiss bank UBS, Tesla's compensation could exceed $1 billion this year under the pooling scheme." So UBS.

10. The tenth question refers to an American political figure who reduced pollution rules and threatened tariffs. That's Trump, as mentioned: "President Trump... rolled back auto pollution rules... His threats to impose tariffs could further squeeze European automakers." So Donald Trump.

I need to make sure each answer is directly from the text and matches the question exactly. Let me check each again quickly.

1. Renault – correct.
2. Elon Musk – yes.
3. 55% – right.
4. United States – yes.
5. 25% – the article says "at least a quarter," so 25%.
6. Stellantis – correct.
7. Ursula von der Leyen – yes.
8. Chinese manufacturers – the text says "Chinese manufacturers" with 45%.
9. UBS – correct.
10. Trump – yes.

All answers are present in the text. I don't see any N/A here. Let me confirm each question's specifics again. The questions are all answered directly except maybe question 8, which specifies "45 percent increase" which the article states exactly for Chinese manufacturers. So all answers are valid.
