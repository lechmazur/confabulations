Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article provided. I'll go through each question carefully to ensure I'm not missing anything and that I'm strictly adhering to the text.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions that the toe-tapping sequence in "With All of Your Heart" references "Step in Time" from *Mary Poppins*. The choreographer associated with that is not named here, but the key point is that the sequence is from *Mary Poppins*, so the choreographer would be the one from that film. However, the article doesn't name the choreographer, only the movie. Since the question asks for the choreographer, and the article doesn't specify their name, this might be N/A. Wait, but the article says "from 'Step in Time' in 'Mary Poppins,' when Mary is dancing with the chimney sweeps." The choreographer for *Mary Poppins* was Jeremy Summers, but the article doesn't mention his name. Therefore, since the article doesn't name the choreographer, the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The article doesn't mention the exact number of dancers cast as "Immortals" in the original Kennedy Center production. It refers to a chorus of body-suited dancers, but no number is given. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The article states that in the stage version of *Schmigadoon!*, performers spell "S-C-H-M-I-G-A-D-O-O-N" with their bodies, similar to "Y.M.C.A." The question asks for the name of the dance number where this happens. The article says it's the opening number, but doesn't name it specifically. The article mentions the opening number as "a la 'Oklahoma!'" but the name of the song is "Schmigadoon!" so maybe that's the title. The answer might be "Schmigadoon!" but the question specifies using ASL to spell words. Since the article says "spell the letters with their bodies, a la 'Y.M.C.A.'" the dance number's name isn't given, so N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Ariana DeBose referenced Vera-Ellen and Donna McKechnie. The question asks for a famous Broadway dancer from the 1950s. Vera-Ellen was active in the 50s, so she's the answer. The article explicitly mentions her, so answer is Vera-Ellen.

5. **Question 5**: Michelle Williams' role in the 1992 film *Death Becomes Her* is Viola Van Horn, as stated in the article. So answer is Viola Van Horn.

6. **Question 6**: Gattelli developed his style during Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS events. The article says his earliest jobs were for those events, but doesn't name a specific event. Since the question asks for the event name, and it's just the general events, not a specific one, maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "during which Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS event"â€”since the article doesn't mention a specific event name, just the events in general, so N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The article doesn't mention the running time of the opening dance sequence. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The Immortals' supernatural nature is emphasized through their movements. The article mentions their "sinister sinuosity" like Fosse's *Pippin*, but Fosse isn't a ballet technique. The question asks about a classical ballet technique. The article mentions Maria Tallchief as a prima ballerina, but that's in a different paragraph. The Immortals' choreography isn't linked to ballet techniques here. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The article says Gattelli sent emails with links to YouTube videos, but doesn't specify the total number. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The Liza Minnelli cameo includes jazz hands, which are associated with Bob Fosse's style? Or maybe Michael Bennett? Wait, the article says "jazz hands flying" which is a Fosse move? Or maybe the Liza Minnelli reference is to her own style. The article mentions "jazz hands flying" and Fosse's *Pippin* in the same context. The article says the Immortals are like Fosse's *Pippin* ensemble. The Liza Minnelli cameo's jazz hands might be referencing Fosse. The question asks which choreographer's hand movements she used. Since Fosse is mentioned in the context of the Immortals' style, maybe Bob Fosse.

11. **Question 11**: The article says the opening number of *Schmigadoon!* spells the title with bodies like "Y.M.C.A." The original musical that "Y.M.C.A." is from is *The Village People's* song, but the question refers to a Golden Age musical. Wait, the article says "a la 'Oklahoma!'" for the spelling, but the body spelling is like "Y.M.C.A." The question is which Golden Age musical's opening they mimic. The article says "a la 'Oklahoma!'" so the answer would be Oklahoma!.

12. **Question 12**: The Immortals' self-aware movements reference Fosse's *Pippin*. The article says "like the self-aware dance ensemble of Fosse's 'Pippin'". So the choreographer is Bob Fosse.

13. **Question 13**: Gattelli credits the Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS events as where his passion for humor began. The question asks for the event during a Zoom call. The article states: "Some of my earliest choreography jobs were for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS events. That's the kind of audience that will get 90 percent of the theater jokes you make..." So the answer is Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS events.

14. **Question 14**: The second season of *Schmigadoon!* uses Bob Fosse's pigeon-toed style. The article says "he brought in the pigeon-toed slinkiness of Bob Fosse and the splayed-fingers jazz of Michael Bennett."

15. **Question 15**: The performer mentioned is Ariana DeBose, who is in both TV and stage versions, as stated in the article. She discusses Vera-Ellen and Donna McKechnie.

16. **Question 16**: The ballerina is Maria Tallchief, mentioned in the last paragraph as America's first prima ballerina celebrated in her centennial year.

17. **Question 17**: The French ballet dancer is Guillaume Diop from the Paris Opera Ballet and fashion icon.

18. **Question 18**: The dance style is West Coast Swing, described as addictive and innovative in viral videos.

19. **Question 19**: The cautionary tale that elevates is "Death Becomes Her", as the article says "we call a cautionary tale, the idea is still to lift up, not to push down."

20. **Question 20**: The toe-tapping sequence references "Step in Time" from *Mary Poppins*, so the classic film is *Mary Poppins*.
