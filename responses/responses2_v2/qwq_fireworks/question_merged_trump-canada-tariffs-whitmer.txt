merged_trump-canada-tariffs-whitmer.txt
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and don't infer anything beyond what's stated.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks which Michigan automotive companies Whitmer praised for maintaining supply chain relationships with Canadian partners. Scanning the article, I see she mentioned the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Silverado, and Mustang as examples where tariffs would affect costs. But she didn't name specific companies. The answer should be N/A because the article doesn't mention company names, just vehicle models.

2. **Question 2**: How many times did she reference Trump's electoral wins in Michigan while discussing bipartisanship? The article says she noted Michiganders twice supported both her and Trump, and mentions he flipped Michigan in November (presumably 2020 and 2024). She referenced his victories once in the speech context provided. The exact count here is tricky, but the text states she mentioned that Michiganders had twice supported both, so that's once in the speech. So the answer is 1.

3. **Question 3**: Percentage reduction in cross-border transfers? The article doesn't mention any specific percentage, just that components cross multiple times. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Month of first term when she established collaboration. The article doesn't mention any specific month during his first term when she started collaborating. It talks about her approach after the 2020 election (assuming Trump's first term was 2017-2021), but the text doesn't specify. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Monetary value of electricity supply Doug Ford threatened. The article says Ford discussed retaliation including disrupting electricity but doesn't give a figure. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Canadian auto parts facilities highlighted. The article doesn't name specific facilities, just mentions components crossing borders. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Economic growth rate projected. The article doesn't mention a specific growth rate number. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Times Jeep Grand Cherokee components crossed the border. The article says components cross "more than once," but not the exact number. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Proportion of battery workers affected. The text doesn't give a percentage. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Trade agreements cited as models. The article doesn't mention any specific agreements by name. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Three vehicle models she cited. The article lists Silverado, Mustang, and Jeep Grand Cherokee as examples. So those three are the answer.
