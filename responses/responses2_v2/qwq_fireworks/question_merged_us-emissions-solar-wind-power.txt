Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to be careful to only use the information from the provided article. Let me go through each question step by step.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about the percentage decrease in methane emissions from oil and gas operations in 2023. The article mentions that in 2024, emissions from oil and gas dropped 3.7%, and between 2014-2024, there was a 40% reduction per cubic foot. But 2023 isn't specifically mentioned. Since the article doesn't provide 2023 data, the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The question is about the energy source other than wind and solar that will see the most increase. The article says utilities are meeting demand by delaying coal retirements or burning more natural gas. So natural gas is the answer here.

3. **Question 3**: Before the Inflation Reduction Act (enacted in 2022), the article states that low-carbon investments made up 5% after the Act. The question is asking before, but the text doesn't specify the previous percentage. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The question refers to the year with record oil production, near-record gas, and 40% methane reduction. The article says in 2024, methane per gas production dropped 40% since 2014. The power sector emissions increased 0.2% in 2024. So the answer is 0.2% increase, but the question asks for the percentage change, so +0.2% or 0.2%.

5. **Question 5**: Assuming a linear trend from 2014-2024 (40% reduction over 10 years), to eliminate methane leakage (reaching 0%), how many years? 10 years for 40%, so 25 years more? 2024 + 25 = 2049? But the article doesn't mention continuation, so maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "assuming linear continuation," but the article doesn't say if it's linear. Hmm. Maybe it's possible, but the exact year isn't in the text. The article doesn't state that the trend will continue, so maybe N/A. Wait, the question is hypothetical, but the answer requires calculation. Since the 40% is over 10 years, each year reduces 4% (40/10). To reach 100% reduction from the starting point, it would take (100/4)=25 years. 2024 +25=2049. But the question says "completely eliminated"â€”maybe the article allows this? The question says "assuming linear continuation of the trend observed between 2014-2024". So the answer would be 2049? But the question says "by what year", so maybe 2049. But I need to check if the article allows that. Since the article says the reduction was 40% over that decade, but doesn't say it's linear. The question says to assume linear, so I think that's acceptable. So answer is 2049? But the article's data is up to 2024, so starting from 2014, 10 years to 2024. To reach 100% from 2024, 25 more years (since 40% over 10 years is 4% per year). So 2024 +25=2049. So the answer would be 2049. But the question says "completely eliminated", so maybe the answer is 2049. Let me note that.

6. **Question 6**: The industrial sector's emission decrease when electricity demand surged (due to heat and AC). The article says in 2024, industrial emissions fell 1.8% due to hurricanes and port strikes. The surge in electricity demand was in 2024. So the answer is 1.8%.

7. **Question 7**: The percentage decrease in greenhouse gases in the year when Rhodium reported a surge in electricity demand (2024). The article states that in 2024, emissions fell 0.2% compared to the previous year. So the answer is 0.2%.

8. **Question 8**: The percentage point difference between industrial and transportation sectors in the year the Inflation Reduction Act was passed (2022). The article says in 2024, industrial was down 1.8%, transportation up 0.8%. But the Act was passed in 2022, so the data for that year isn't given. The question is about the year the Act was passed (2022), but the article only gives 2024 data. So N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Gasoline-powered cars' percentage in new sales when transportation emissions rose. The article says 10% were electric, so the rest (90%) would be gasoline, but the question asks specifically for gasoline-powered. Since electric are 10%, the remainder (assuming all others are gasoline) would be 90%. But the article says "electric vehicles still make up a small fraction", so maybe other fuels exist, but the article doesn't mention. Since it's 10% electric, the rest (90%) would be non-electric, which are mostly gasoline. So answer is 90%.

10. **Question 10**: Overall emissions change in the year when Orsted and Equinor slowed offshore wind. The article mentions Orsted and Equinor slowing in the same paragraph as 2024 data. The overall emissions change in 2024 was 0.2% decrease. So answer is 0.2%.

11. **Question 11**: The influence of increased electricity demand (summer heat and data centers) on a fossil fuel's usage. The article says natural gas use spiked. So answer is natural gas.

12. **Question 12**: Main contributor to 2024 emissions rise. The article says the surge in electricity demand led to more natural gas use, offsetting renewables. So the main contributor is increased natural gas use.

13. **Question 13**: Percentage reduction in gas-related leakage over the past decade. The article states a 40% reduction between 2014-2024, so 40%.

14. **Question 14**: Fossil fuel increased despite retiring coal plants. The article mentions natural gas use rose to record highs. So natural gas.

15. **Question 15**: Sector with 0.8% increase that challenges climate targets. The transportation sector had a 0.8% rise, which is the largest source. So transportation.

16. **Question 16**: Unintended consequence limiting emission reduction. The article says increased demand led to more natural gas use despite renewables. So the reliance on natural gas.

17. **Question 17**: Energy source with slight decline despite overall reductions. The article says coal use declined only slightly. So coal.

18. **Question 18**: Sector with 1.8% emissions decline in 2024. The industrial sector, due to hurricanes and port strikes. So industrial.

19. **Question 19**: Pollutant curtailed by 40% per unit production. Methane, as stated in the article (40% less methane per gas produced).

20. **Question 20**: Target reduction by 2030. The article says Biden's goal is 50% below 2005 levels by 2030. So 50%.
