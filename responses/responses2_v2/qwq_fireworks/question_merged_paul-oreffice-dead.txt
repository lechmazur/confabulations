Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks which Italian city Oreffice's family fled to in South America when Mussolini declared war. The article says they moved to Ecuador in 1940. Wait, but the question mentions an Italian city. Wait, the family moved from Italy to Ecuador. The city in Italy where they were originally from is Venice, as stated in his birthplace. But the question is about the city they fled to in South America. Wait, the text says "moved the family to Ecuador in 1940". Ecuador is a country, not a city. Hmm, maybe the question has an error. The answer would be Ecuador, but the question specifies a city. Since the article doesn't mention a specific city in Ecuador, maybe it's a trick. Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong, so the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "Italian city did Oreffice's family flee to in South America"â€”but South American cities aren't Italian. The family moved to Ecuador (country) from Italy. Since the question is about a city in South America, but the text doesn't name a city there, so N/A?

Wait, let me check again. The article says: "His parents... moved the family to Ecuador in 1940..." So Ecuador is the country. The question asks for the Italian city they fled to in South America. Wait, that doesn't make sense. They fled from Italy to Ecuador. The Italian city they were fleeing from is Venice, but the question is about the destination in South America. Since the article only mentions Ecuador as the country, not a city, the answer is N/A. So I'll put N/A here.

2. **Question 2:** How many millions did Dow spend on legal fees defending against the EPA's aerial surveillance before the Supreme Court ruling? The article mentions the case went to the Supreme Court and Dow lost. But there's no figure given about legal fees. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The name of the Dow scientist who documented silicone gel leakage in 1971. The article says Dow Corning released documents showing they knew since 1971, but doesn't name the scientist. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Which university got more donations after Oreffice cut funds to Central Michigan? The article says he canceled donations to Central Michigan after Jane Fonda's speech. But it doesn't mention another university receiving increased funds. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Total compensation in today's dollars for the $180 million settlement. The article states the 1984 settlement was $180 million, and in 1987, the profit was $1.3B (about $3.5B today). But the question is about the settlement's adjusted value. The article doesn't provide an adjusted figure for the settlement, only the profit's equivalent. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Consecutive quarters of profit growth before 1987's record. The article mentions the 1987 profit but no data on quarters. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Which environmental group prompted the "Dow lets you do great things" campaign? The article says the PR campaign was due to controversies, but no specific group named. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Percentage of revenue from consumer products after diversification. The article mentions diversification into consumer products but no percentage. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Number of Kentucky Derby horses Oreffice owned before his successful ones. The article says he invested in Kentucky Derby starters but doesn't state the count. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Annual budget for anti-regulation campaigns. The article says he financed campaigns but no figure. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** University threatened with lawsuit after actress's criticism. The actress was Jane Fonda at Central Michigan University. The article says he canceled donations to Central Michigan, not threatening to sue. The question mentions suing, but the text says he canceled donations. So the answer is Central Michigan University. Wait, the question says "threaten to sue after a prominent actress criticized..." The article says he wrote to the president of Central Michigan, not suing the university. So maybe N/A? Wait, the question is about which university he threatened to sue. The article says he canceled donations but didn't mention a lawsuit threat. So N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Years in the Army before joining Dow. The article states he worked for Dow in 1953 after two years in the Army. So answer is 2.

13. **Question 13:** The rare cancer not linked to dioxin. The article mentions "rare soft-tissue cancer in humans" linked to dioxin, but the company (Dow) claimed it wasn't linked. The name isn't given. The question asks for the name of the cancer. Since it's not specified, N/A.

14. **Question 14:** Herbert Dow Doan's position when he commented on Oreffice's style. The article says he was a former Dow president. So answer is President.

15. **Question 15:** Final title before retirement. Oreffice was chairman until 1992. So the final title was Chairman.

16. **Question 16:** Breed of horses for Preakness. The article mentions thoroughbred racehorses. Answer: Thoroughbred.

17. **Question 17:** Agency that jailed him in Italy. The article says his father was jailed by the Fascist dictatorship. The question refers to Oreffice being jailed, but the text says his father was jailed. So the answer would be the Fascist government, but the question asks for the government agency. Since the article mentions Mussolini's regime, the agency might be part of that, but not specified. So N/A because it's his father, not him.

18. **Question 18:** Cleaning fluid from diversification. The article mentions Fantastik. Answer: Fantastik.

19. **Question 19:** Settlement amount in 1987 currency. The settlement was in 1984 for $180 million. The question asks for 1987 currency, but the article doesn't adjust it. So N/A.

20. **Question 20:** City where he encountered WASP culture. The article says he first worked in Midland, Mich., where he encountered WASP culture. Answer: Midland.
