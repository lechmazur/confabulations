Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article provided.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York. He's a Democratic congressman from Harlem. The question asks about a senator, but Rangel was a congressman, not a senator. So the answer is N/A because there's no mention of a senator.

2. **Question 2:** The article says the union helped 3,000 members gain legal status through the 1986 immigration reform. The time frame between 1986 and 1995 would include that number. So the answer is 3,000.

3. **Question 3:** The article doesn't mention the name of the factory where Mazur's father worked. Only that he was a presser in a clothes factory. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Mazur joined the union at 18. The article states he was born in 1932, so 18 would be around 1950. The presidential administration then was Harry S. Truman until 1953, but the exact year isn't given. Wait, the article says he joined at 18, but his career started in the 1950s? The exact administration isn't specified. The article doesn't mention the president at that time, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The article doesn't provide a percentage of undocumented workers in Unite when he stepped down. It mentions legalizing undocumented members but no specific percentage in 2001. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** There's no mention of the vote count when he was elected president in 1986. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The article doesn't name a Republican congressman he convinced. It talks about Democrats and Clinton's administration. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The annual budget isn't mentioned for the immigrant assistance program. The services are listed but not the budget. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The number of factories moving to China after PNTR isn't given. The article mentions job losses but not factory counts. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The article mentions a strike in 1982 in Chinatown leading to employers backing down, but no specific name for the agreement. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The 1982 protest was in Columbus Park, Chinatown. The union branch he managed before presidency was Local 23-25, which had Chinese workers. So the majority were Chinese immigrants.

12. **Question 12:** The union under Mazur offered those benefits. The question asks which leader did that, so Jay Mazur.

13. **Question 13:** The merger with Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union formed Unite, which he led until 2001. The result is the formation of Unite.

14. **Question 14:** The article mentions a rally in Seattle in 1999 against WTO, which involved demonstrations and the National Guard. The form was a protest/rally.

15. **Question 15:** The obit mentions his wife Connie, daughter Ilana, son Marc, siblings, etc. The question asks for a family member continuing his legacy. Since he was a union leader, maybe his children? The article says "survived by his son Marc... daughter Ilana." It doesn't explicitly state who continued his legacy, so N/A unless implied. Wait, the question says "family member noted in the obituary as continuing his legacy." The obit doesn't mention anyone continuing his work, so N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Cause of death was congestive heart failure, as stated by his son Marc.

17. **Question 17:** The article says in 2004, three years after his retirement (he retired in 2001?), the union merged with Hotel Employees to form Unite Here.

18. **Question 18:** Started at 18, became president in 1986. 1986 minus 1950 (since born 1932, 18 would be 1950) is 36 years. Wait, exact years: 1986 - 1950 = 36 years. But the article says a 51-year career, so from 18 to 69 (since he was 92 when he died in 2024, but the article says he died in 2024? Wait, the article says he died on Jan 14, but the current year isn't given. Wait, the article's byline says Trip Gabriel is a reporter, but the death date is given as Jan 14 (year not specified in the text provided?), but the main text says "died on Jan. 14 at his home in Manhattan. He was 92." Assuming the article is recent, but the questions are about his career. His career was 51 years, starting at 18. He became president in 1986. So from 1950 (18) to 1986 is 36 years. The answer is 36? The question asks "how many years did he work in the union before reaching that leadership post?" So yes, 36.

19. **Question 19:** He opposed Clinton's trade policies. The article says his criticism was against Clinton's administration's support for free trade. So the answer is Bill Clinton.

20. **Question 20:** He has four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Total is 7.
