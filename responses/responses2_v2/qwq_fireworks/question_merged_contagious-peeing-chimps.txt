Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to go through the article carefully and make sure I understand what's being asked for each question.

Starting with question 1: "How did the structural patterns in humpback whale songs relate to the social cohesion hypothesis proposed for contagious urination in chimpanzees?" The article mentions humpback whales' songs having structural patterns similar to human language, but I don't see a direct link between that and the social cohesion hypothesis in chimps. The social cohesion part is about the chimps' urination, so maybe they're unrelated? The answer here would be N/A because the article doesn't connect the whale songs to the chimp hypothesis.

Question 2: The connection between the Eaton fire and the bear under the property. The article says the resident came home after being displaced by the Eaton fire to find the bear there. So the fire caused the resident to leave, and the bear was there when they returned. The connection is the fire displaced the resident, allowing the bear to stay. So the answer is that the bear was present after the resident was displaced by the fire.

Question 3: Which primate species besides chimps have contagious urination in the wild? The article mentions Dr. Surbeck saying they might see it in wild apes but doesn't name any specific species. It says "great apes" in general, but not a specific one like bonobos. Wait, the article says Surbeck studies chimps and bonobos, but the study was on captive chimps. The article doesn't explicitly state any other primate has been observed doing it. So answer is N/A.

Question 4: How many orphaned tiger cubs were reintroduced alongside Boris and Svetlaya? The article mentions Boris and Svetlaya were raised together as orphans and reintroduced separately. So Boris and Svetlaya are two, but the question asks how many were with them. Wait, the question says "reintroduced to the wild in Russia alongside Boris and Svetlaya before Boris began his trek." But the text says they were reintroduced separately. So maybe the answer is 1 (Svetlaya) but the wording is tricky. Wait, the text says "Boris and Svetlaya were raised together as orphaned cubs, and then reintroduced to the wild in Russia separately." So when they were reintroduced, they were separate. So the answer would be N/A because the article doesn't mention others with them during reintroduction.

Question 5: Martin Surbeck's role in the discovery. The article says he wasn't involved in the research. So his role is none in the discovery, just commenting. The question asks what role the article attributes to him, so answer is N/A or "none". But the question asks for his role in the discovery, which he didn't have, so N/A.

Question 6: Link between spotted hyena in Egypt and chimp urination. The hyena is mentioned as a separate news item. The article doesn't connect them. So N/A.

Question 7: Numerical correlation between 1,300 instances and 600 hours. The article states Onishi observed over 1,300 instances while spending over 600 hours. So the correlation is 1,300 instances in 600 hours. The answer is 1,300 instances over 600 hours. The question asks for the numerical correlation, so the answer is "1,300 observed instances in 600 hours" but maybe just the numbers? The question says "how does the article link them" so the answer is the number of instances (1,300) over the hours (600). But the exact wording is "how many observed instances... total hours". The answer would be 1,300 instances over 600 hours. But the question asks for the numerical correlation, so maybe 1,300 instances in 600 hours. The article says "observing them peeing together over 1,300 times. After crunching the numbers..." So the answer is 1,300 instances in 600 hours. But the question is phrased as "how does the article link the 1,300 observed instances and the total hours..." so it's just the numbers. So the answer is "1,300 instances over 600 hours".

Question 8: Evidence that contagious urination influences hierarchy. The article says chimps lower on the social ladder were more likely to join. So that's evidence. The answer is that lower social standing chimps were more likely to participate.

Question 9: Connect Wisdom's age to evolutionary function. The article mentions the albatross's age but doesn't link it to the chimp's urination function. So N/A.

Question 10: The Kyoto student who noted proximity correlation. The article says Onishi noticed that the nearer a chimp was to the initial urinator, the more likely to join. So answer is Ena Onishi.

Question 11: Social standing attribute. The article says lower on the social ladder were more likely to go. So the attribute is "lower social standing".

Question 12: Harvard biologist commenting on wild occurrence. Martin Surbeck is the Harvard biologist who said the behavior wouldn't be unexpected in the wild. So answer is Martin Surbeck.

Question 13: Term for the phenomenon. The article says they call it contagious urination. So answer is "contagious urination".

Question 14: Human analogy to the chimps' peeing. The article mentions contagious yawning as the analogy. So answer is "contagious yawning".

Question 15: Species with songs like human language. Humpback whales are mentioned. Answer: humpback whales.

Question 16: Sanctuary where the behavior was recorded. The article says Kumamoto Sanctuary in Kyoto. So answer is Kumamoto Sanctuary.

Question 17: Year of initial observation. The article says 2019. So answer is 2019.

Question 18: Origins of the chimps before captivity. The article says many were rescued from biomedical research. So answer is "rescued from the biomedical research industry".

Question 19: Animal noted for reappearance after 5,000 years. The spotted hyena in Egypt. The question says which animal might be confused with the chimp research. Since the hyena is mentioned in the same article as the chimp study, but it's a different topic. The answer is spotted hyena.

Now, check each question again to ensure accuracy. Let me go through each one again quickly.

1. N/A because no link between whale songs and chimp social cohesion.

2. The Eaton fire displaced the resident, allowing the bear to stay under the property. So the connection is that the fire caused the resident to leave, leading to the bear's presence when they returned. Answer is "The bear was present after the resident was displaced by the fire."

3. N/A because no other primate species are named.

4. N/A since the article says reintroduced separately, so no others with them.

5. N/A as Surbeck wasn't involved in the research.

6. N/A, no connection.

7. The answer is "1,300 instances in 600 hours" or "over 1,300 instances over 600 hours".

8. "Lower social standing" is correct.

9. N/A.

10. Ena Onishi.

11. "Lower on the social ladder" or "lower social standing".

12. Martin Surbeck.

13. "Contagious urination".

14. "Contagious yawning".

15. Humpback whales.

16. Kumamoto Sanctuary.

17. 2019.

18. "Rescued from the biomedical research industry".

19. Spotted hyena.

Okay, that should cover all. Now format the answers as per instructions.
