Okay, I need to go through each question one by one and find the answers strictly from the provided article. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question asks how many additional staff the Greenland Minister hired to handle investor inquiries due to Trump's language of force and the snowstorms. The article mentions that after the snowstorms, the ministry's permanent secretary, Jorgen Hammeken-Holm, said their interest turned in another direction. But there's no mention of hiring more staff. So the answer should be N/A.

2. The second question is about the combined market cap of $TRUMP and $MELANIA coins on inauguration day. The article states their combined market cap was about $6 billion as of Friday, which was just days before the inauguration. Since the question specifies the day of the inauguration, and the article says "introduced just days before," maybe the $6 billion is the figure right after launch. But the exact day's cap isn't specified. Wait, the article says "as of Friday," which might be the day before inauguration. Since the exact day's figure isn't given, but the question says "on the day of Trump's inauguration," it's possible the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "introduced just days before... had a combined market cap of about $6 billion as of Friday." So maybe Friday was the day before inauguration, so the exact inauguration day's cap isn't given. But the question asks for the market cap on the day of inauguration, which isn't explicitly stated. So N/A?

Wait, actually the article says "the $TRUMP and $MELANIA cryptocurrency tokens, introduced just days before President Trump's inauguration, had a combined market cap of about $6 billion as of Friday." So "as of Friday" is the closest date given, but we don't know if that was the inauguration day. The inauguration day is not explicitly stated here, so the exact figure on the inauguration day isn't given. So the answer is N/A.

3. The third question is about the specific fish Naaja suggested for export. The article says she listed Arctic deepwater fish, like delivered fresh to New York. The exact name is "Arctic deepwater fish."

4. The fourth question asks who noted the snowstorms redirected attention. The article quotes Jorgen Hammeken-Holm as saying that the snowstorms turned their interest. So his name is Jorgen Hammeken-Holm.

5. The fifth question is about the law firm's name. The article mentions Jason Schwartz, labor and employment co-chair at Gibson Dunn. So the law firm is Gibson Dunn.

6. The sixth question is straightforward: the island is Greenland.

7. The seventh question asks the British company through which Bezos and Gates invested. The article says they invested through Blue Jay Mining.

8. The eighth question is about who issued the TikTok executive order. The article says President Trump did.

9. The ninth question is the hotel chain with French crystal chandeliers: Baccarat.

10. The tenth question is the nation with 70% tariff likelihood. The article mentions Goldman Sachs gave 70% odds on China.

11. The 25% tariff on a neighbor is Mexico.

12. The retailer that stopped D.E.I. programs is Target.

13. The token named after a political figure is $TRUMP or $MELANIA. The question asks for one, so either is correct, but since it mentions "named after a former political figure," both are, but the answer should list one. The question specifies "one of these tokens," so either is acceptable. The article mentions both, but the question asks for one, so maybe $TRUMP.

14. The app linked to TikTok and ByteDance is TikTok.

15. The debt amount is up to $3 billion.

16. The island with the flight route is Greenland.

17. The tariff threat linked to a service is TikTok (100% tariff on China if TikTok isn't sold).

18. The institution targeted was USAID.

19. The executive confronted was Brian Moynihan of Bank of America.
