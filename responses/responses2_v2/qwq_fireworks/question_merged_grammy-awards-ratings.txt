Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article and answer exactly as per the instructions. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about the percentage increase in Academy Awards viewership the year after the Grammys' lowest pandemic viewership. The article mentions the Grammys' lowest was 9 million in 2021. But the Oscars' growth is mentioned as having three consecutive years leading to 19.5 million last year. Wait, but the question is about the year following the Grammys' lowest (2021). The article says Oscars had three years of growth, so last year's Oscars were 19.5M. The previous year before that would be 2022, but the exact percentage isn't given. Hmm, maybe I need to check again. The article says "the Oscars is no exception: It has had three consecutive years of ratings growth, leading to last year's audience of 19.5 million viewers." So if 2022 was the start of the three-year growth, then the first year after 2021 (the Grammys' low) would be part of that growth. But the question is about the Academy Awards' increase in that specific year. Since the article doesn't give the exact percentage for any specific year of Oscars' growth, only that it's had three years, I can't find the exact percentage. So maybe N/A?

Wait, the question is phrased as "the year following the Grammys' lowest-rated, pandemic-affected broadcast." The pandemic Grammys was in 2021 with 9M. The next year would be 2022. But the Oscars' viewership in 2022 isn't given. The article only states that last year's Oscars (probably 2024?) had 19.5M, which is after three years of growth. Without knowing the starting point, can't compute percentage increase. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The network that aired the show with Taylor Swift presenting to Beyonce (Grammys on CBS) compared to the upcoming Oscars (on ABC). The article says the Grammys brought in $47M in ad revenue, while the Oscars had $80M. So the difference is 80 -47 = 33. So the answer is 33.

3. **Question 3**: The news outlet falsely accused by Trump of government payments is Politico. The article mentions that the transcript of a "60 Minutes" interview with Harris was part of a lawsuit between CBS and Trump. But the question is about the outlet accused by Trump. The first paragraph says "Politico: President Trump spread unfounded claims that the government had paid Politico and other news media outlets for positive coverage of Democrats." So the answer is Politico.

4. **Question 4**: If Grammys' decline mirrored Golden Globes' percentage drop. The Grammys dropped 9% from 17M to 15.4M. The Golden Globes dropped from 10.3M to 9.3M, which is a 10% decrease (since 10.3 to 9.3 is a decrease of 1 million, which is roughly 9.7%, so approx 10%). So if Grammys had a 10% drop from previous year (17M), then 17M * 0.9 = 15.3M. But the question is hypothetical, so the answer would be 15.3? Wait, the question is phrased as "how many viewers would have tuned in" if the Grammys' drop matched the Golden Globes' percentage. The Golden Globes had a drop of (10.3-9.3)/10.3 ≈ 9.7% (about 10%). So applying that to the Grammys' previous year viewership (17M), 17 * (1 - 0.10) = 15.3M. The answer is 15.3, but in millions. So 15.3 million. The question says "how many viewers, in millions" so the answer is 15.3? But the article says the actual Grammys drop was 9%, so maybe the question is asking to apply Golden Globes' percentage (which was ~9.7%) to the Grammys' previous viewership (17M), leading to 15.3. So answer 15.3.

5. **Question 5**: The fundraising milestone by the Recording Academy (Grammys org) for wildfire relief. The article says they raised over $24 million. So the answer is 24 million.

6. **Question 6**: The company affiliated with Trump (his social media company) is aiming to become a financial services firm. The article says "Trump's social media company is moving to position itself as a financial services firm..." So the answer is financial services.

7. **Question 7**: Projected viewership for next Oscars, assuming same growth as past 3 years. The Oscars had 19.5M last year, and had 3 years of growth. To project next year, need to know the growth rate. But the article doesn't give the previous years' numbers except last year's 19.5. Without knowing the growth rate, can't calculate. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The performer praised as the best in years and received Best Country Album. The article says "Variety calling it the best Grammys 'in years'" but the award winner is Beyonce for Best Country Album (presented by Taylor Swift). So Beyonce received the award. The answer is Beyonce.

Wait, the question is asking which performer was praised as the best in years (the show) and also received the award. The critics praised the production, not a performer. The award Beyonce received was Best Country Album. But the question might conflate. The answer is Beyonce, since she got the award and the show was praised. But the question says "which performer... also received the Best Country Album award". So yes, Beyonce.

9. **Question 9**: The news org in the lawsuit over the "60 Minutes" transcript is CBS, but the question is about the one that added subscribers. The article mentions "The New York Times: The company added 350,000 digital-only subscribers..." So the answer is 350.

10. **Question 10**: Oscars out-earned Grammys by $80M - $47M = $33M. So answer is 33.

11. **Question 11**: The percentage decrease from 17M to 15.4M. (17-15.4)/17 = 0.094, so 9.4%, which rounds to 9% as stated. The article says 9% decline. So 9%.

12. **Question 12**: The stripped-down pandemic ceremony was 9 million viewers.

13. **Question 13**: The artist embraced by Taylor Swift when presenting Beyonce. The article says Taylor Swift embraced Beyonce while presenting her with the award. So Beyonce was the recipient.

14. **Question 14**: The artist who joined Lady Gaga for "California Dreamin'" is Bruno Mars, as stated.

15. **Question 15**: The awards show with three-year rise to 17M before decline. The Grammys had a three-year streak broken this year, so the answer is the Grammys.

16. **Question 16**: The streaming service for the Grammys is Paramount+.

17. **Question 17**: The Oscars are referenced as having $80M ad revenue, contrasting with Grammys' $47M. So the answer is the Academy Awards (Oscars).

18. **Question 18**: The TV news channel with Lara Trump's show is Fox News.

19. **Question 19**: The awards show that went from 17M to 15.4M is the Grammys.

Now, let me check each answer again to ensure they're correct based on the article.

1. N/A because no specific percentage for Oscars' increase after 2021.

2. 33 (80-47).

3. Politico.

4. 15.3 (if using Golden Globes' ~10% drop on Grammys' previous 17M).

5. 24 million.

6. Financial services.

7. N/A.

8. Beyonce.

9. 350.

10. 33.

11. 9%.

12. 9.

13. Beyonce.

14. Bruno Mars.

15. Grammys.

16. Paramount+.

17. Academy Awards.

18. Fox News.

19. Grammys.

Everything seems to align except maybe question 4: the Golden Globes' drop was from 10.3 to 9.3, which is (1.0/10.3)*100 ≈9.7%, so applying that to Grammys' 17M would be 17*0.903 ≈15.351, so 15.3 or 15.4? The question says "mirrored the percentage drop", so precise calculation would be (9.3/10.3)=0.9029, so 17*0.9029≈15.35, so 15.3 or 15.4? The answer in the options would be 15.3 as it's a mirror of the percentage, so the answer is 15.3.

Okay, that's all.
