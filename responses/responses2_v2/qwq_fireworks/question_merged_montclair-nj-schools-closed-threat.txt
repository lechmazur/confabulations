Okay, I need to answer these questions based only on the provided article. Let me go through each question one by one.

1. The first question asks about the name of the virtual reality education company Mr. Doctry founded before becoming a teacher. The article mentions his LinkedIn profile states he owns a business creating virtual-reality lessons, but it doesn't give the company's name. So the answer is N/A.

2. The second question is about how many students Mr. Doctry tutored during the pandemic according to Matthew Frankel. The article says Frankel has two children who were tutored by Doctry, but it doesn't specify the number of students. So N/A again.

3. The third question asks which social media platform he used to post threats. The article says he threatened the principal on social media and later mentions a YouTube video. Since YouTube is a social media platform, maybe that's the answer. Wait, the initial threat was on social media, and the video was part of that. The caption of the YouTube video had the threats. So the platform is YouTube.

4. The fourth question is about the color of the letterman jacket. The article describes him holding a letterman jacket but doesn't mention the color. So N/A.

5. The fifth question asks how many hours elapsed between the closure announcement and the neutralization update. The closure was announced Monday morning, and the update came "several hours later." The exact time isn't given, so N/A.

6. The sixth question is about the grade he taught. The article says he taught sixth-graders in Montclair before, but at Northeast Elementary, which is elementary. Wait, sixth grade is usually middle school. The article says he was a teacher at Northeast Elementary, but the directory didn't list him. The LinkedIn mentions he taught sixth-graders in Montclair and students in Newark. The question is about Northeast Elementary, so maybe sixth grade? But the school is elementary, which might not include sixth grade. The article doesn't specify his grade at Northeast, so N/A.

7. The seventh question asks which Philadelphia hospital did the evaluation. The article mentions he was taken to a Philadelphia hospital but doesn't name it. So N/A.

8. The eighth question is when the district noticed his erratic behavior. The article states he was put on leave last week when signs appeared. The incident happened Monday, so "last week" is the time frame, but exact days aren't given. So the answer is "last week."

9. The ninth question is the total number of racist assertions. The caption had "a string of profane, political and racist assertions," but the exact count isn't provided. So N/A.

10. The tenth question asks how many additional officers were assigned. The article mentions increased patrols but doesn't specify the number. So N/A.
