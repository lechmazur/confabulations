Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information given in the article and follow the strict answer format. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and cross-referencing the article.

1. **Question 1:** The Detroit-based center where Howard first developed his therapy. The article mentions he volunteered at a center for developmentally disabled children in Detroit before the diagnosis criteria for autism were established. The name isn't given here. The article later mentions he founded the Adam Shelton Center in Saint-Denis. But the first center in Detroit isn't named. So answer N/A?

Wait, the question asks for the name of the Detroit center where he first developed the techniques. The text says he volunteered at a center there but doesn't name it. So yes, N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The French literary award in 1991. The article states he was made a chevalier of arts and letters by the French Culture Ministry in 1991. That's the award. So the answer is "chevalier of arts and letters".

3. **Question 3:** Years between publishing "Burt" in the US and moving to France to open the center. "Burt" was published in the US in 1981 (article says "1981" when his girlfriend broke up, etc., and the novel was published then). He moved to France in 1981 after the novel's success. The center was founded in 1996 according to the article ("His clinic, the Adam Shelton Center, opened in 1996"). Wait, the question says "after publishing in the US and moving to France to establish his center in Saint-Denis". The move was in 1981, but the center was opened in 1996. Wait, the article says "By day, Mr. Buten volunteered at an autism clinic before founding his own center in Saint-Denis" after moving in 1981. Wait, the exact text: "Mr. Buten's three lives coalesced when he moved to France in 1981 after the unexpected success of 'Burt'... By day, Mr. Buten volunteered at an autism clinic before founding his own center in Saint-Denis". So he moved in 1981, then later founded the center. The center was founded in 1996. So the time between publishing "Burt" (1981) and moving (same year) is zero years? Wait the question is: How many years after publishing "Burt" in the US did he move to France to establish the center? The move was in 1981, same year as the US publication. But the center was founded later, in 1996. The question is specifically about moving to France to establish the center. Wait, the article says he moved in 1981, and then later founded the center. The question might be asking the time between publishing and moving, which is 0. But the question is phrased as "move to France to establish his center" — so the move was in 1981, and the center was established later, but the move itself happened the same year as the publication. So the answer is 0 years? Wait, but the question is how many years after publishing the book did he move to France to establish the center. Since the move was in the same year as the book's publication, the answer is 0. But the article says he moved in 1981 after the success of "Burt", which was published in the US in 1981. So the time between is 0. So answer is 0.

4. **Question 4:** Autobiography published two years after his Molière win. He won the Molière in 1998. The autobiography is "Buffo" published in 2005. Wait, two years after 1998 would be 2000, but the article says the autobiography was published in 2005. Wait, need to check the article again. The article says: "Buffo" (2005). The Molière was in 1998. 2005 - 1998 = 7 years. So that's not two years. Hmm. Did I miss something? Wait the question says "published two years after his Molière win?" The article says he won a Molière in 1998. The autobiography was in 2005, so that's seven years later. So the answer would be N/A. Wait, the article says "his autobiography, 'Buffo' (2005)" but maybe there's another reference. Wait the article says "Through the Glass Wall: Journeys Into the Closed-Off Worlds of the Autistic" (2004). Wait, maybe the question is referring to another book. Let me recheck. The question says "autobiography that detailed his integration of clowning and clinical psychology, published two years after his Molière win?" The Molière was in 1998. Two years after would be 2000. The article mentions "Buffo" (2005), which is 7 years after. So perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, maybe the article says something else. Alternatively, perhaps "Through the Glass Wall" (2004) is the book? But that's his clinical work. The autobiography is "Buffo" (2005). So unless there's a different book. The question might be a trick. The answer is N/A because the autobiography was published in 2005, which is 7 years after the Molière. Therefore, answer N/A.

Wait, maybe the question is correct. Let me check again. The Molière win was in 1998. Two years after is 2000. The article says "Buffo" (2005). So the answer is N/A. Therefore, answer N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Vaudeville performer from his mother's career that inspired Buffo's musical routines. The article mentions his mother was a tap dancer and vaudeville performer. But does it say which performer's style influenced Buffo? The text says Buffo was a homage to Grock, the Swiss clown. Grock is mentioned as the inspiration for Buffo's persona. The question is about a vaudeville performer from his mother's career. The article says his mother was in vaudeville, but it doesn't name a specific performer she worked with whose style influenced Buffo. So answer N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Neurodegenerative disorder causing death. The article states the cause was a neurodegenerative disorder, but the name isn't specified. So answer N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Copies sold in the US after reissue in 2000. The article says "Burt" sold fewer than 10,000 copies in the US originally, but after reissue under the French title in 2000, it got "newfound appreciation" but doesn't give numbers. So answer N/A.

8. **Question 8:** University for doctorate. The article says he earned a doctorate from Fielding Graduate University in Santa Barbara, Calif., in 1986. So answer "Fielding Graduate University".

9. **Question 9:** Therapy method at Adam Shelton Center combining clowning and autism. The article mentions "reciprocal imitation training" as the technique. So answer "reciprocal imitation training".

10. **Question 10:** Character compared to Adam Shelton. The article says "Burt" was about a child in an institution. The question asks which character from his novels was explicitly compared to Adam Shelton. The text says the method was inspired by Adam, but the novel's character Burt is described as similar in being considered disturbed. The article says "Adam was on Mr. Buten's mind when he wrote 'Burt'". So the character is Burt. So answer "Burt".

11. **Question 11:** Color removed for clinical responsibilities. He used black for appointments at the autism center. If that color is removed, then the other colors are yellow/orange for Buffo, blue for writing. The question asks which hue would denote the autism center if black is removed. But since black was for the center, removing it leaves no color for the center. Wait the question is, if he removes the color reserved for clinical (black), then what hue implicitly denotes the time for the center? But if he removes black, then there's no color assigned. The question might be a trick. Alternatively, perhaps it's asking which color was for clinical, so answer black. The question says "what hue would then implicitly denote the time dedicated to his work with the autism center?" If he removes black (the color for clinical), then there's no color left for that, so N/A? Or maybe the question is asking what color was used for clinical, which is black. The wording is tricky. The question is phrased as if after removing one color (the one for clinical), what color now represents it? But if he removes black, then there's no color for it, so the answer would be N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking which color was originally used for clinical, which is black. But the question's wording is confusing. The exact question: "what hue would then implicitly denote the time dedicated to his work with the autism center?" If he removes the color reserved exclusively for clinical (black), then there's no color left. So the answer is N/A. Wait the article says he used black for appointments at the center. So the answer to the question is black, but the question is asking if he removes that color, then what color denotes it? Since he removes it, there's no color. So answer N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is simpler: the color for clinical was black, so answer black. The question might be trying to trick by asking "if he removes one color (the clinical's color), then what color is left for the center?" which would be none, hence N/A. Hmm. The article states that the color codes were yellow/orange for Buffo, black for the center, blue for writing. So the answer to the question is black. But the question is phrased as "if he removes the color reserved for clinical (black), then what color denotes it?" which would be none, so N/A. The question is ambiguous. Since the question is about which color was used for clinical, the answer is black. But the way it's phrased might be a trick. Wait the exact question: "what hue would then implicitly denote the time dedicated to his work with the autism center?" after removing the color reserved for clinical. Since he removed that color, there's no color left, so N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick where the answer is that there is no color, hence N/A. I'll go with N/A because the question is about what color would be left after removing black, which would be none.

12. **Question 12:** Behavioral method from his interactions with a patient that influenced Buffo's silent traits. The article says he used imitation with Adam Shelton, leading to Buffo's mute characteristics. The method was reciprocal imitation training. So the answer is "reciprocal imitation training".

13. **Question 13:** Highest degree obtained despite dropping out. He earned a doctorate in clinical psychology. So "doctorate in clinical psychology".

14. **Question 14:** What unexpected circumstance prompted his move to France? The article says he moved in 1981 after the unexpected success of "Burt" in France. The book's success there led him to move. So the answer is the unexpected success of "Burt" in France.

15. **Question 15:** European cultural ministry honor. The chevalier of arts and letters from the French Culture Ministry in 1991. So answer "chevalier of arts and letters".

16. **Question 16:** Internal shift when applause ends. The article says "Buffo disappears, and Howard returns". So answer "Buffo disappears, Howard returns" or just the key part. The exact quote is "Buffo disappears, and Howard returns". So the answer is that.

17. **Question 17:** Child whose behaviors inspired both therapy and Buffo. The child was Adam Shelton. So answer "Adam Shelton".

18. **Question 18:** Character compared to Holden Caulfield. The article says "Burt narrates in one of the most charming voices since Holden Caulfield's" from The Washington Post review. So answer "Holden Caulfield".

19. **Question 19:** Vaudeville background that spurred his performance. His mother was a vaudeville performer. The question asks whose background, so "his mother" or her name? The article just says his mother was a vaudeville performer, so answer "his mother" (Dorothy Fleisher Buten? But the question asks "whose background", so the answer is his mother's.

20. **Question 20:** Incident with his pet. The article mentions his dog Frank was run over. So answer "his dog Frank was run over".

Let me go through each again quickly:

1. N/A (Detroit center's name not given)
2. Chevalier of arts and letters
3. 0 (moved same year as publication)
4. N/A (Buffo was 2005, Molière 1998)
5. N/A (mother's performer not named)
6. N/A (disorder not specified)
7. N/A (no sales figure after reissue)
8. Fielding Graduate University
9. reciprocal imitation training
10. Burt
11. N/A (removing black leaves no color)
12. reciprocal imitation training
13. doctorate in clinical psychology
14. unexpected success of "Burt" in France
15. chevalier of arts and letters
16. Buffo disappears, Howard returns
17. Adam Shelton
18. Holden Caulfield
19. his mother (or her name, but just "mother" suffices)
20. his dog Frank was run over

Wait for question 19, the exact wording: "whose background in vaudeville provided an indirect model..." His mother's background. So answer is "his mother" (Dorothy's background).

Okay, that's all. Now format the answers properly.
