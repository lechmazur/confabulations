Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I don't look anywhere else, just the text given.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions Glaser did 91 test runs before the ceremony. The question is asking how many more she scheduled after New Year's Day. The text says she had flow issues on New Year's Day but doesn't mention additional test runs beyond the 91. So, probably N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The "common goal" punchline had a reference to "parlay a Golden Globes win into an appearance on 'Hot Ones.'" The other allusion? The initial idea was "To get out of here before Dax Shepard asked you to do his podcast." So Dax Shepard's podcast is the other one. But the question is about the "common goal" premise. Wait, the first line in the article says "We come together tonight with a common goal." The joke she considered was "Getting Ted Sarandos's personal number." Ted Sarandos is Netflix's chief content officer. The "common goal" punchline that was cut had a Kamala Harris reference. Wait, the article says she temporarily reinstated it as "the goal being to get Kamala Harris elected president." But the question is about the initial allusion before it was cut. Wait, the first part says the initial premise was "To get out of here before Dax Shepard asked you to do his podcast." The other part she considered was "Getting Ted Sarandos's personal number." The question is asking besides "Hot Ones," what other podcast? The Dax Shepard podcast is mentioned. So the answer is Dax Shepard's podcast. But the question is about the "common goal" premise. Wait, the original "common goal" line was "We come together tonight with a common goal." The joke was "To get out of here before Dax Shepard asked you to do his podcast." So the allusion is to Dax Shepard's podcast, which is the other one besides "Hot Ones." So answer is Dax Shepard's podcast.

3. **Question 3**: The article says during the postgame at Comedy Cellar, Convy asked, "Where are we on 'Anora'?" and the answer mentions "Anora" as the nominated film. The question is asking for another film besides Anora that Convy asked about. The text doesn't mention another film, so N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The article says she held her phone in one hand during the Comedy Cellar performance. The question asks what other prop she held. The text doesn't mention another prop, so N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Glaser says her current set was 70% better than the initial jokes. The exact wording: "the current set beats the jokes at the writers' room meeting in early December... 70 percent better." So 70% is the answer.

6. **Question 6**: She rewatched Steve Martin's Oscar monologue and another one. The text says she rewatched Fey and Poehler's monologues. Wait, the question is asking besides Steve Martin, which other monologue? The article mentions she rewatched Fey and Poehler's monologues. The specific one for celebrity names? The question is about analyzing how to incorporate more names. The article says she rewatched a Steve Martin Oscar monologue and was impressed with how he shoehorned names in. The other one? The question says besides Steve Martin, so the answer is Fey and Poehler's, but the question is about a specific award show monologue. The article says she rewatched Fey and Poehler's Globes monologues. So the answer is Fey and Amy Poehler's Golden Globes monologue.

7. **Question 7**: The physical ailment she's concerned about besides fainting or stroke? The text says she mentioned fainting or stroke as her biggest worries, so nothing else is mentioned. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The "common goal" was cut again after a temporary reinstatement. The reinstated punchline was "the goal being to get Kamala Harris elected president." Then it was cut again because it stepped on another line. So the answer is "to get Kamala Harris elected president."

9. **Question 9**: The Tom Brady roast was praised by Conan O'Brien, but the question asks for another host. The article doesn't mention another host, so N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The debate about Harrison Ford's public persona. The article says during writers' meeting, they debated whether people knew "Call Her Daddy" or Eisenberg. The question is which comedian's podcast was referenced. Wait, the text says she referenced a podcast when considering the joke about Diddy that worked in clubs but might not at Globes. Wait, looking back: "The joke about Diddy that killed at a club but warned the crowd it might not work at the Globes. Someone yelled: 'Do it!' 'You promise you will still be hollering on your couch when it dies in the room? I don't think you will,' she responded, explaining her thoughts by phone the next day." Not sure. Wait, the question is about Harrison Ford's joke. The article says in the writers' room, when discussing the Harrison Ford joke, they were debating whether more people would get a reference to "Call Her Daddy" or to Eisenberg. The fight was between Glaser and her boyfriend/producer Chris Convy over which reference was better. The question is which comedian's podcast was referenced here. Wait, maybe the podcast was mentioned elsewhere? The article mentions "Dax Shepard's podcast" in the first part. The Harrison Ford joke was part of the initial brainstorming where they considered "Getting out without having a conversation with Jesse Eisenberg." The debate was about references, but the podcast mentioned in the text related to the Dax Shepard's podcast. However, the question is about the Harrison Ford joke's reference debate. The article doesn't mention a specific comedian's podcast here, so maybe N/A. Wait, the article says "their fight was over whether more people would get a reference to 'Call Her Daddy' or to Eisenberg." The podcast might be Dax Shepard's since he's involved with that movie? But the question is about a comedian's podcast. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The original Kamala Harris punchline was "the goal being to get Kamala Harris elected president." So that's the answer.

12. **Question 12**: The initial "Nikki World" team includes 10 writers, but the specific group for Ozempic joke at Ice House? The article mentions the inner circle: Convy, O'Connor, Gibbons, Frange. Plus the assistant and publicists. The Ozempic joke was tested there, but the question is how many writers were part of the team for that. The inner circle has four writers (O'Connor, Convy, Gibbons, Frange). The question says "part of the initial Nikki World team," so maybe the 10? The article says she meets with an inner circle of 4 and a larger group of writers. The Ozempic joke was part of the process, but the exact number isn't given. The question might be N/A unless the answer is 4 or 10. The article says "inner circle of writers (O'Connor, Convy, Mike Gibbons and Brian Frange)" so four. The Ozempic joke was part of their meetings, so the answer is 4.

13. **Question 13**: The actor whose singing ability was contentious was Jeff Goldblum. She tested the joke about him not being a good singer and even polled the audience. So Jeff Goldblum is the answer.

14. **Question 14**: The political joke that bombed made her question if it "bums people out." The health concern she cited? The text says her biggest worries were fainting or stroke, but the question is about the political joke's effect. The article doesn't mention a health concern related to that, so N/A.

15. **Question 15**: The film's press tour compared to Jeff Goldblum's singing in "Wicked" to "Joker 2." The article says the "Wicked" and "Joker 2" lines were in early drafts. The press tour for "Wicked" inspired the joke. So the film is "Wicked."

16. **Question 16**: The holiday metaphor for career aspirations: "the scent of holly and pine to remind me of writing." So the metaphor is "the scent of holly and pine."

17. **Question 17**: Ted Sarandos is the Netflix exec in the joke about getting his number. The article says "Getting Ted Sarandos's personal number" was a joke idea during the Zoom brainstorming. So Ted Sarandos is the answer.

18. **Question 18**: The question is how many pedophile jokes were in the final monologue. The article says she wondered "Do we have too many jokes about pedophiles?" but doesn't specify the number. So N/A.

19. **Question 19**: She rewatched Fey's "30 Rock" to study transitions. Wait, the article says she binges Fey's sitcom "30 Rock" when in a rut. The question is about studying transitions for "Wicked" pacing. The article says she rewatched Fey and Poehler's monologues. The specific sitcom is "30 Rock." But the question is about studying transitions between punchlines. The article mentions she rewatched their monologues, so Fey's Golden Globes monologue, not the sitcom. Wait, the article says: "Glaser advised her writers to study those monologues and took a moment to marvel at Fey's starting her 2015 Globes gig..." So the answer is Fey's 2015 Golden Globes monologue, but the question asks for an Emmy-winning sitcom. "30 Rock" was an Emmy-winning sitcom. The article says she rewatched "30 Rock" when in a rut. The question is about studying transitions for "Wicked" segment. The article says she rewatched Fey and Poehler's monologues to see how to incorporate names, but for transitions, maybe it's "30 Rock." The question says "which comedian's Emmy-winning sitcom"â€”Fey's "30 Rock" won Emmys. So the answer is "30 Rock."
