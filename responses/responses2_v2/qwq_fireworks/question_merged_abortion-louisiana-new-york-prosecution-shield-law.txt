Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions that medication abortions account for nearly two-thirds of pregnancy terminations in the U.S. But it doesn’t specify Louisiana's percentage before Dobbs. Since it's a general stat, not specific to Louisiana, the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The Louisiana indictment mentions only Dr. Carpenter. The Texas suit also only names her. So no other doctors are named, so the answer is 0.

3. **Question 3:** Governor Hochul referenced New York's shield law. The question asks for a precedent before shield laws, but the article says shield laws are the basis. Maybe she didn’t cite a prior law, so N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The Texas civil suit was filed in December. The question asks for 2023, but the article says December (2024 is mentioned for Louisiana's case). Wait, the Texas lawsuit was filed in December, but the article doesn't specify the year. Wait, the Louisiana case involved a girl in April 2024, and the Texas case was in July. The article says the Texas suit was filed in December. Wait, the article says "in December" but the year isn't clear. Since the Louisiana case's April 2024 is mentioned, maybe Texas was December 2023? The article says "the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, also against Dr. Carpenter, for prescribing and sending pills to a woman in Texas. On Friday, Tony Clayton..." The article was written after the Louisiana indictment in April 2024. The Texas case was filed in December (probably 2023). But the question asks for the month in 2023. The article says "That case was filed in December by the Texas attorney general..." but doesn't specify the year. Since the Louisiana case is April 2024, maybe the Texas case was 2023? The answer would be December, but the question specifies 2023. Since the article doesn't say the year, but it's possible the Texas case was before Louisiana's April 2024, so December 2023. So answer December.

Wait, but the article says the Texas lawsuit was filed in December. The article mentions the Louisiana case involving April 2024. The article's current timeline isn't clear on the exact years. But the article says "the Texas lawsuit was filed in December" without the year, but since the Louisiana case's April 2024 is mentioned, maybe the Texas case was 2023. So the answer is December. But the question specifies "in 2023". Since the article doesn't explicitly state the year, but the Texas case was before Louisiana's April 2024 (assuming the article is written in 2024), so December 2023. So answer is December. But if the article doesn't mention the year, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says "That case was filed in December by the Texas attorney general, also against Dr. Carpenter..." and the Louisiana case's date is April 2024. Since the Louisiana case's date is given as April 2024, the Texas case's December could be 2023. Since the question asks for the month in 2023, the answer is December. So answer is December.

5. **Question 5:** The article says after the 911 call, police took the teenager to a hospital. The name of the hospital isn't mentioned. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The Louisiana patient was under 18 (a teenager, specifically a girl who was under 18, maybe 17?), and the Texas patient was a 20-year-old woman. The age difference is 3 years (if the girl was 17 vs. 20). But the article says "the case involved a girl who was under 18" and the Texas case was a 20-year-old. The exact ages aren't given, so the difference isn't specified. The question asks for the stated age difference, which isn't provided. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The article says eight states have adopted shield laws. The question asks how many had stronger protections. The article says "telemedicine abortion shield laws, which have been adopted by eight states so far, have become a significant avenue..." but doesn't mention any with stronger protections. The answer is N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The Comstock Act's specific section isn't mentioned. The article refers to the "Comstock Act" but doesn't cite a section. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The organization is SBA Pro-Life America. The article says "Katie Daniel, director of legal affairs for SBA Pro-Life America, said in a statement."

10. **Question 10:** The article mentions a "reveal party" but doesn't name it. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The doctor used New York's shield law. The article states "operating under New York's telemedicine abortion shield law."

12. **Question 12:** The Dobbs decision is mentioned as overturning Roe, leading to the current landscape. The question asks which Supreme Court decision contributed, so Dobbs v. Jackson.

13. **Question 13:** The district attorney is Tony Clayton of West Baton Rouge Parish.

14. **Question 14:** Dr. Carpenter is a specialist in reproductive health.

15. **Question 15:** The FDA change in 2021 was lifting the in-person requirement for mifepristone.

16. **Question 16:** The 911 call by the teenager led to the hospital and investigation.

17. **Question 17:** The Texas woman had "severe bleeding."

18. **Question 18:** The director mentioned "coercion" as a new form of domestic violence.

19. **Question 19:** New York's attorney general, Letitia James, condemned it.

20. **Question 20:** Governor Kathy Hochul of New York.
