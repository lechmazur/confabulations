Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions beyond what's written. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question asks for the chief executive of the cloud computing provider that might face penalties. The article mentions Oracle and other cloud computing providers. Oracle's CEO is mentioned later as Tim Cook? Wait, no, Tim Cook is Apple's CEO. Wait, the article says: "Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple". So Oracle's CEO isn't named here. The question is about the cloud provider's CEO. The article lists cloud providers like Oracle but doesn't name their CEO. So maybe this answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "the cloud computing provider mentioned as potentially facing penalties". The article says "cloud computing providers like Oracle and other cloud computing providers". Since Oracle is one example, but the article doesn't name their CEO, so the answer would be N/A because the article doesn't specify the CEO of the cloud provider mentioned. Hmm, but maybe I missed a part where a CEO is named. Let me check again. The only CEO mentioned in the context of cloud providers is Tim Cook, but he's Apple's CEO. So answer is N/A?

Wait, the question is about the CEO of a cloud computing provider. The article mentions cloud computing providers like Oracle. But the CEO of Oracle isn't mentioned here. The only CEOs listed in the inauguration dais are Zuckerberg (Meta), Jeff Bezos (Amazon), Elon Musk, and Tim Cook (Apple). Oracle's CEO isn't mentioned here. So the answer is N/A. Because the article doesn't name the CEO of the cloud provider in that context. So answer 1 is N/A.

2. The Republican megadonor with ties to Club for Growth who influenced Trump through a meeting. The article says Jeff Yass helped found Susquehanna and is a supporter of Club for Growth, which hired people with Trump ties. Also, Trump met with Yass, who owns a share of ByteDance. So the answer is Jeff Yass.

3. The financial penalty per user. The article states penalties as high as $5,000 per person who uses TikTok after the ban. So the answer is $5,000.

4. The family member besides Ivanka and Donald Jr. The article says "Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Kai Trump, the president-elect's granddaughter". So Kai Trump.

5. The former Trump official at Susquehanna is Tony Sayegh, who was a Treasury official and now works there.

6. The buyer group excluding the algorithm: Frank McCourt's group bid without the algorithm.

7. Schumer referenced a blocked bill that would extend by 270 days. The article says he accused Republicans of blocking a bill to extend the deadline by 270 days. So 270 days.

8. The constitutional amendment about the lawsuits against CBS and Des Moines Register. The article mentions First Amendment experts, so the answer is the First Amendment.

9. The military academy that ended clubs due to Trump's D.E.I. order: West Point, as per the DEI section.

10. The country's minerals linked to Trump's annexation comments: Canada, from the Trudeau part.

11. The administrative measure to allow TikTok to operate despite the ban: an executive order, as the first paragraph mentions.

12. The professor quoted with the metaphor about the executive order: Alan Z. Rozenshtein, who said it should be taken with "a medium-sized boulder of salt".

13. The maximum penalty per user is again $5,000, same as question 3.

14. The administration responsible for enforcing the ban after the inauguration: the next administration, which would be Trump's, but the article says it would fall to the next administration (since Biden's term ends Monday, and the ban is Sunday). Wait, the article says: "because of the timing... it would fall to the next administration to carry out the law, the official said." The next administration is Trump's, so the answer is Trump's administration? Wait, the article says "the next administration" refers to the incoming one, which is Trump's since he's the president-elect. Wait, the article says Biden's term ends Monday, a day after the ban. So the next administration after Biden is Trump's, so the answer is the Trump administration.

15. The tech executive who made a personal donation: Tim Cook donated $1 million to the inaugural committee.

16. The trading firm connected to the megadonor: Susquehanna International Group, as Yass co-founded it.

17. The progress marker for extending the deadline: "significant progress" toward a deal with a non-Chinese owner.

18. The effect on operational performance: the article mentions "video load times and the functionality of the app may respond" uncertainly. So possible answer: affect video load times and functionality.

19. The deficiency of the executive order: it's not a law, so can't change the legislation. The article says "legally would not change the legislation passed by Congress".

20. The proposal Schumer said was blocked: the 270-day extension bill, as mentioned in question 7. So 270 days extension.

Wait, let me verify each again:

1. N/A because the cloud providers like Oracle aren't specified with their CEO except Apple's CEO is Tim Cook, but Oracle's isn't mentioned here.

2. Jeff Yass.

3. $5,000.

4. Kai Trump.

5. Tony Sayegh.

6. Frank McCourt's group.

7. 270.

8. First Amendment.

9. West Point.

10. Canada.

11. Executive order.

12. Alan Z. Rozenshtein.

13. $5,000.

14. Trump's administration (since it's the next one after Biden's term ends).

15. Tim Cook.

16. Susquehanna International Group.

17. "significant progress" toward a deal.

18. The article says "unclear how video load times and functionality may respond" so answer: affect video load times and functionality.

19. Not a law (the answer is that it can't change the legislation, so the deficiency is that it's not a law).

20. 270-day extension.

Now, let me make sure all answers are in the text. For example, question 18's answer is inferred from "the law also affects internet hosting companies like Oracle and other cloud computing providers, and it is unclear how video load times and the functionality of the app may respond." So the effect is on load times and functionality.

Question 19: The article says an executive order "legally would not change the legislation passed by Congress and signed by President Biden." So the deficiency is that it can't alter the law, so the answer is "not a law".

Question 20: The blocked legislation was to extend by 270 days, so the answer is 270 days.

Okay, that's all. Now, time to format the answers properly.
