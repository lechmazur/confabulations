Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let's start with the first question.

1. **Question 1:** How many characters, on average, did Night slaughter daily in "Darknoon" before joining Pablo's gang?

Looking at the article, the text says that Apolline and Pablo's avatars kill around 100 characters a day. But the question is about Night. The article mentions Night as Pablo's love interest, but there's no specific mention of Night's actions in the game before joining the gang. The 100 characters are from Apolline and Pablo. So the answer here would be N/A because the article doesn't state Night's involvement in the game's killings before joining the gang.

2. **Question 2:** What element of Apolline's unexplained hostility toward her father does the director use to mirror the shutdown of the "Darknoon" server?

The article states that Apolline has an unexplained hostility to her father. The director's method to mirror the server shutdown's message ("Connection impossible") is mentioned in the context of her loneliness and the game's end. However, the article doesn't explicitly link the hostility to her father as a mirroring element. The connection might be implied through her isolation, but since the article doesn't specify how the hostility is used to mirror the shutdown, the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Considering the film's exploration of unreal worlds, what specific aspect of Tom Green's new projects on Amazon Prime Video directly parallels the central theme of "Eat the Night?"

The film's theme involves finding identity in unreal worlds, like the video game. The article mentions Tom Green's return with new projects on Amazon, but it doesn't specify the content of these projects. Without info on how his projects relate to unreal worlds, this answer is N/A.

4. **Question 4:** What visual style, originally intended to make TV series appear epic, does Raphael Vandenbussche employ in his cinematography to emphasize the bland surroundings of Le Havre?

The article says Vandenbussche's camera captures the surroundings "coolly" and mentions "The Extravagance of TV Title Sequences" as a separate section. The visual style in question is the title sequences' extravagance, but the article states that Vandenbussche's style is "easygoing" and emphasizes blandness. Since the article links the extravagance to title sequences in another context, but Vandenbussche's style is the opposite, maybe "easygoing" isn't the answer. Wait, the question asks for the visual style originally meant to make TV look epic (title sequences) but the article says he uses that style to emphasize blandness. The article says "The Extravagance of TV Title Sequences: A visual style originally meant..." So maybe the answer is "extravagant title sequences" but he uses it inversely. Wait, the question is about what visual style he employs. The article says his camera is "easygoing", but the title sequences are a different part. Since the question asks what style he uses to emphasize blandness, and the article says "bland surroundings coolly captured by Raphael Vandenbussche's easygoing camera." The visual style here is "easygoing cinematography," but the original style mentioned in the article for TV is "extravagant title sequences." The question might be a trick, but the answer might be "N/A" because the article doesn't explicitly state that he uses title sequences' style. Wait, the article says "The Extravagance of TV Title Sequences" is a separate section. So the answer would be N/A because the director's style is described as "easygoing" not using the title sequence's extravagance. So maybe N/A here.

5. **Question 5:** In what way does the increasing violence in "Eat the Night," specifically the turf war with Mathieu Perotto, enhance the sweeter, more haunting moments between Night and Apolline?

The article says that the film's escalating violence "frequently smothers its sweeter, more haunting moments," but the question asks how the violence enhances them. Since the article says the violence smothers, not enhances, the answer would be N/A unless there's an opposite interpretation. The article might imply that the contrast highlights those moments, but the exact wording is "smothers," so enhancing isn't stated. Thus, N/A.

6. **Question 6:** What is the name of the grocery-store where Night works that mirrors the title sequences of TV shows?

The article mentions Night works at a grocery store but doesn't name it. The title sequences part is in another section. Since no name is given, answer is N/A.

7. **Question 7:** How long after the "Darknoon" server shutdown does the film suggest Apolline's computer announces "Connection impossible," mirroring the message Pablo and Night receive?

The article states "Apolline's computer announces, pointedly, as the game goes dark. And in another part of town, in a very different way, Pablo and Night are getting exactly the same message." The timing isn't specified; it's simultaneous. So the answer is "at the same time" but the question asks for "how long after." Since it's concurrent, maybe "immediately" or "N/A" if exact time isn't given. The article doesn't mention a duration, so N/A.

8. **Question 8:** What type of business does the rival dealer, who sparks the turf war that endangers Apolline's routine, run, mirroring the extravagance of TV title sequences?

The rival dealer is described as a "small-time drug dealer" like Pablo. The article says "turf war ignites between Pablo and a rival dealer (Mathieu Perotto);" no mention of the rival's business type beyond dealing drugs. The extravagance part is from the title sequences section, but the question links the business to mirroring that. Since the article doesn't state the rival's business mirrors extravagance, N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Which of the new Black directors chronicling Black life at a different speed, like Jane Schoenbrun, also directed a 2024 goosebumper similar to "I Saw the TV Glow?"

The article mentions Jane Schoenbrun's 2024 "I Saw the TV Glow" and lists directors including RaMell Ross, A.V. Rockwell, Raven Jackson, and Garrett Bradley. The question asks which of these directors also directed that 2024 film. Since Jane Schoenbrun is the one mentioned with the 2024 film, but the question says "like Jane Schoenbrun," implying someone else from the list. Wait, the article says "Jane Schoenbrun's 2024 goosebumper, 'I Saw the TV Glow,' 'Eat the Night' is interested..." So the answer is Jane Schoenbrun herself, but the question says "new Black directors like Jane Schoenbrun" (the others listed). Wait, the directors listed are "new Black directors" and Jane is mentioned separately. The question asks which of the new Black directors (from the list: RaMell Ross, A.V. Rockwell, Raven Jackson, Garrett Bradley) also directed the 2024 film. Since the article states Jane's film, and she's not in the listed group, the answer is N/A because none of the listed directors are linked to that film.

10. **Question 10:** How does the film parallel the phrase "Connection impossible" between the game’s shutdown and the deterioration of Pablo’s relationship with his mother?

The article mentions the "Connection impossible" message regarding the game and Pablo and Night getting the same message. However, there's no mention of Pablo's relationship with his mother. The question refers to his mother, but the text doesn't discuss his mother. Thus, N/A.
