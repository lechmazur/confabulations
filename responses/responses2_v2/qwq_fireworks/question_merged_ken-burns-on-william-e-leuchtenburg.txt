Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the given article. I need to make sure I only use the information provided and answer exactly as per the instructions.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about a methodology Leuchtenburg suggested for illustrating the impact of the 1920s sexual revolution in the Benjamin Franklin documentary. The article mentions that in the Roosevelt series, Leuchtenburg used a stadium analogy for unemployment. The sexual revolution part is mentioned in Prohibition, where he talked about discovering the clitoris. Wait, the question is about Benjamin Franklin? Hmm, the article says he contributed to Benjamin Franklin (2022), but the methodology with the stadium was in the Roosevelt series. The question might be a mix-up. Let me check again. The article says: "He first talks about filling up a stadium with people and then emptying it..." in the fifth episode of the Roosevelt series. The sexual revolution part was in Prohibition. The question is about Benjamin Franklin, so maybe there's no mention here. Answer would be N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The cavernous filing system comparison is Burns' own analogy (like Citizen Kane/Raiders), not directly related to Leuchtenburg's parents' alcoholism. The question links the parents' alcoholism to a scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark, but the article doesn't mention that. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The question asks for another documentary besides the listed three that focused on the American Revolution and WW2 weaponry. The article mentions Burns was working on the American Revolution when Leuchtenburg died, but the documentaries listed are Prohibition, Roosevelts, and Benjamin Franklin. The article doesn't mention another one on the American Revolution with Leuchtenburg's WW2 insights. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Burns had to pause work after hearing of Leuchtenburg's death. The article says "everything just crashed to a halt." The question is how many times he paused. The text mentions once, so the answer is 1.

5. **Question 5**: Jazz musician referenced in notes. The article says Leuchtenburg had interests including jazz but doesn't name any musician. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Family history related to Vietnam in Baseball? The article says his parents were alcoholics and that influenced Prohibition. Vietnam's dynamics aren't tied to his family here. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The fifth episode of Roosevelts where the stadium analogy is used. The article mentions the fifth episode, but the title isn't provided. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Age when he last appeared in Prohibition (2011). He died at 102 in 2022 (since Franklin was 2022). So 2011 would be 102 - (2022-2011)= 102-11=91? Wait, but the article says he died at 102, so born in 1920. In 2011, he'd be 91. So answer is 91.

9. **Question 9**: Vehicle in 1920s exemplifying sexual freedom discussed in WWII film. The article mentions the clitoris remark in Prohibition, but no vehicle. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Editorial suggestion on alcoholics in Benjamin Franklin. The article says Leuchtenburg's parents were alcoholics and he felt repeal wasn't good, but that's in Prohibition. Not about Franklin. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Which documentary had Leuchtenburg discuss parental alcoholism and New Deal views. The article says his parents were alcoholics, and Prohibition's repeal was bad for him. The New Deal is part of the Roosevelts series. So "The Roosevelts: An Intimate History".

12. **Question 12**: Episode of American Revolution where stadium analogy appears. The analogy was in Roosevelts' episode 5. The American Revolution series isn't mentioned in that context. N/A.

13. **Question 13**: Number of docs he both consulted and appeared in. He appeared in three (Prohibition, Roosevelts, Franklin), and consulted on many more. So the ones he appeared in are part of the consulted ones. So total would be 3 (since appearing implies consulting). But the question is how many he both did. The article says "consulting on many more". So total is 3 (appeared in) plus others consulted. But the question asks for both, so the three he appeared in are also consulted. So answer is 3.

14. **Question 14**: Last documentary before his death (2022) was Benjamin Franklin, which he worked on when he died. So "Benjamin Franklin".

15. **Question 15**: Jazz influenced Baseball's segment. The article mentions his interest in jazz, and he contributed to Baseball. So jazz is the genre.

16. **Question 16**: Artifact from childhood education: his notes had schoolboy handwriting like Burns' eighth grade cursive. So "schoolboy handwriting" or "handwritten notes in eighth-grade cursive".

17. **Question 17**: Clitoris remark was during Prohibition. The 1920s era, so answer "1920s".

18. **Question 18**: When did he start sending notes? The article says "he first began sending" but doesn't specify the project. The earliest documentary he appeared in was Prohibition (2011). But the notes might have started earlier. Since the text doesn't say, N/A.

19. **Question 19**: Architectural comparison for his filing system: "cavernous place at the end of Citizen Kane or Raiders of the Lost Ark". So the comparison is to those movie scenes.

20. **Question 20**: The stadium metaphor in Roosevelts' episode 5 illustrated economic impact under which administration? The Roosevelts series covers FDR, so likely the New Deal era, so "Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration".

Wait, let me verify each again:

1. N/A (stadium was in Roosevelts, not Franklin)
2. N/A (no link to Raiders scene)
3. N/A (no other doc on Revolution mentioned)
4. 1
5. N/A
6. N/A
7. N/A (no title given)
8. 91 (assuming born 1920, died 2022)
9. N/A
10. N/A
11. The Roosevelts: An Intimate History
12. N/A (American Revolution series not mentioned for the analogy)
13. 3 (since he appeared in 3 and consulted on them)
14. Benjamin Franklin
15. jazz
16. schoolboy handwriting (or "handwritten notes with little schoolboy handwriting")
17. 1920s
18. N/A (no specific project mentioned)
19. cavernous place like Citizen Kane or Raiders of the Lost Ark
20. Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration
