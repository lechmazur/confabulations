Okay, I need to tackle these questions based solely on the given article. Let me go through each question one by one and see what the article says.

1. **Which federal agency was tasked with creating a comprehensive database of international students who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations at universities?**  
The article mentions the Education Department, Homeland Security, and State Department guiding colleges to report activities. But it doesn't mention creating a database. Maybe N/A?

2. **How many discretionary grant programs did the Education Department identify as being in violation of Trump's executive order on diversity initiatives?**  
The article says "identified 200 websites that it would take down." Wait, but the question is about grant programs. The article says "identified 200 websites" but not grant programs. So N/A.

3. **What percentage of federal Title I funding did the executive order reallocate to private school voucher programs?**  
The article states that Title I funding is set by Congress, and using it for this could be an uphill battle. So the order didn't reallocate a specific percentage. Answer N/A.

4. **Which university's policy changes regarding antisemitism definitions were directly cited by Trump as the model for his executive order?**  
The article mentions NYU and Harvard changed policies, but Trump didn't cite them as models. So N/A.

5. **What punishment did the executive order prescribe for K-12 teachers found to be teaching about unconscious bias?**  
The order says schools could face investigation and loss of funding. So the punishment is loss of federal funding.

6. **How many members were appointed to serve on the reinstated 1776 Commission under the executive order?**  
The article doesn't mention the number of members. N/A.

7. **What criteria did the Education Department establish for determining whether a school's history curriculum qualified as "patriotic education"?**  
The criteria would follow the 1776 Commission's road map challenging slavery teaching and portraying left-wing movements as subversive. But exact criteria? The article says "portray left-wing social and political movements as subversive." Maybe that's the criteria.

8. **Which civil rights organizations' research was cited in the executive order to justify the removal of transgender-related content from school curricula?**  
The article mentions Lambda Legal opposing the order, but not their research being cited. The order itself didn't cite specific orgs' research. So N/A.

9. **What timeline did the Education Department set for schools to comply with the new restrictions on teaching about racism before losing federal funding?**  
The article doesn't mention a specific timeline. N/A.

10. **How many book-banning complaints did the Office for Civil Rights dismiss after declaring them part of the "Biden book ban hoax"?**  
The article says "dismissed pending complaints," but the number isn't given. N/A.

11. **How many staff members at the Education Department were ultimately fired due to the executive order to purge diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, as applauded by Nicole Neily?**  
The article says the department "took steps toward firing staff" but doesn't specify how many. N/A.

12. **What specific type of legal action, similar to those faced by CBS News and The Des Moines Register, did the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights initiate against schools defying the "Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling" order?**  
The article mentions Trump's lawsuits against media, but not schools facing similar actions. N/A.

13. **Which federal agency, criticized by Rebecca Pringle for diverting funds, was tasked with producing the "ending indoctrination strategy" focusing on uprooting instruction about transgender issues?**  
The Education Department was tasked with that strategy. Rebecca criticized voucher programs, so maybe the Education Department.

14. **According to the report cited in Trump's third executive order, what percentage decrease in reading proficiency demonstrated the need for voucher programs, a priority of Betsy DeVos?**  
The article mentions a report found "students' proficiency in reading had floundered" but no specific percentage. N/A.

15. **What was the name of the prison facility, mentioned in connection with Guantanamo Bay, where international students accused of antisemitic harassment were to be detained, according to the House Republicans' report?**  
The article says they're held in the same prison as Guantanamo Bay that housed Al Qaeda suspects. The name is Guantanamo Bay prison.

16. **Besides the National Education Association, what other organization, headed by James Grossman, condemned the president's order on classroom instruction, citing misrepresentation of how history is taught?**  
James Grossman is with the American Historical Association. The article says he commented on misrepresentation.

17. **Which specific program, providing grants to high-poverty schools, was mentioned as potentially being repurposed to fund the 1776 Commission, reinstated by one of Trump's executive orders?**  
The Title I program is mentioned, but the article says the discretionary grants might be repurposed. The 1776 Commission funding is from discretionary programs, not Title I directly. So N/A.

18. **In what month did House Republicans release the report that suggested deporting international students who expressed support for organizations deemed terrorist, a policy echoed in one of Trump's executive orders?**  
The report was released in December, as per the article.

19. **What specific government body, other than the Education Department, was directed to guide colleges to report potentially antisemitic activities by students and staff, potentially leading to deportation, as criticized by Radhika Sainath?**  
The State Department and Homeland Security were mentioned along with Education. So Homeland Security or State Department. The question asks for one other than Education. The article says "State Department, Education Department and Homeland Security Department". So Homeland Security or State. Let me check: "directed the State Department, Education Department and Homeland Security Department to guide colleges..." So two other agencies. The question asks for one, so either is correct? The article lists all three. The answer could be Homeland Security Department.

20. **What was the stated mission of the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights during Biden's administration, before it was altered under Trump to address what it termed the "Biden book ban hoax"?**  
The article says under Biden, the Office was "apolitical 'a neutral fact-finder'". So the mission was to be a neutral fact-finder.
