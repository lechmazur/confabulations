Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions beyond that. 

Starting with question 1: The question asks which pharmaceutical company was the primary source of organofluorine contamination. The article mentions that organofluorines are used in pharmaceuticals, but it doesn't name any specific company. So the answer here should be N/A.

Question 2: How many gallons of contaminated wastewater are released daily? The article talks about water scarcity and reuse but doesn't provide specific numbers on gallons. Another N/A.

Question 3: Percentage reduction in PFAS by the most effective facility. The article states that treatment facilities don't effectively remove these compounds and that PFAS became more concentrated after treatment. So no percentage is given, making this N/A.

Question 4: Three states with highest organofluorine concentrations. The article doesn't mention specific states, so N/A again.

Question 5: Cost estimate for upgrading all facilities. There's no mention of costs, so N/A.

Question 6: Number of organofluorine compounds more harmful than PFAS. The text says "many" but doesn't specify a number. N/A.

Question 7: Correlation between water temperature and PFAS. The article doesn't discuss temperature effects. N/A.

Question 8: Industry sector contributing the most PFAS. The article mentions household sewage and business/factory wastewater but doesn't identify the largest contributor. N/A.

Question 9: Mathematical model used for the 23 million figure. The study used modeling but didn't name the specific model. N/A.

Question 10: Years of historical data analyzed. The text doesn't mention the time frame of data used. N/A.

Question 11: Chemical increasing after processing. The article says PFAS became more concentrated after treatment. So PFAS.

Question 12: Broad chemical group used in nonstick and refrigerants. The article mentions organofluorines include PFAS and are used in those products. Organofluorines.

Question 13: Contaminant affecting 23 million. The study says PFAS from wastewater is contaminating drinking water of 23 million. PFAS.

Question 14: Forever chemical posing risk after treatment. The article mentions PFAS specifically. PFAS.

Question 15: Substance resistant to degradation and concentrating during treatment. PFAS are called forever chemicals and the article says they become more concentrated. PFAS.

Question 16: Pollutant in sludge and water linked to cancer. PFAS are linked to cancer and mentioned in sludge. PFAS.

Question 17: Contaminant more concentrated after treatment. The article directly states PFAS became more concentrated. PFAS.

Question 18: Chemical group including pharmaceutical compounds under-measured. Organofluorines include PFAS and others used in pharmaceuticals. Organofluorines.

Question 19: Chemical group magnified due to less dilution. PFAS, since they persist and concentrations increase without dilution. PFAS.

Question 20: Chemical associated with severe risks persisting in recycled water. PFAS, as they're linked to cancer and the article states they remain in treated water. PFAS.

I need to make sure each answer is exactly from the text. For example, question 11 asks for the chemical that paradoxically increases after processing, which the article says PFAS became more concentrated after treatment. So that's correct. The rest follow similarly, using the exact terms from the article where possible.
