1. **First question**: The final selling price of the "Lady Blunt" Stradivarius adjusted for inflation to 2024. The article says the Lady Blunt sold for $15.9 million in 2011. But there's no info on inflation adjustment, so I can't calculate that. Answer: N/A.

2. **Second question**: Number of students using the violin each semester between 2015-2024. The article mentions four students used it over the past decade for 1-2 years each, but not per semester. So exact number per semester isn't given. N/A.

3. **Third question**: Geneva Lewis performed the Largo from Bach's Sonata No. 3. The text states this directly. Answer: Largo from Bach's Sonata No. 3.

4. **Fourth question**: Minimum bid increment set by Sotheby's. The article mentions the bidding started at $8M and sold for $10M, but no info on bid increments. N/A.

19. **Nineteenth question**: Show's farewell related to Fred Armisen and Arrested Development. The Blue Man Group's farewell. Answer: Blue Man Group.

Wait, let me double-check each one to ensure I didn't miss anything. For question 18, the article says Jimmy Fallon's Broadway debut in "All In". So that's correct.
