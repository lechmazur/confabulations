Wait, for question 1, the article says "Season 2 of "Mo," premiering Thursday on Netflix," but does it say that Season 1 was on Netflix? The first line says "the second season of the Netflix comedy," implying that Netflix also had Season 1. So the question is asking if another platform originally aired Season 1 before Netflix. Since the article doesn't mention another platform, the answer would be N/A. So all answers are N/A except maybe none? Let me check again.

Looking back at the article: "Season 1 aired all the way back in August 2022, several streaming lifetimes ago." But the article is about Season 2 on Netflix. It doesn't say Season 1 was on another platform. So the answer to question 1 is N/A because the article doesn't mention another platform. So all answers are N/A. Wait, but maybe I missed something. Let me recheck each question again.

Another possible point: The article mentions "the semi-autobiographical auteur comedy genre has been running on fumes..." but that's genre talk. No other info. So yes, all answers are N/A except perhaps none. Wait, but the user might have trick questions. Let me check again.

Question 4: The article says "Mo delivers the call to prayer at his cousin's encouragement" but no holiday. So N/A.

Alright, proceeding to list all N/A answers except maybe none.
