Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information provided in the article. I need to be careful to answer exactly based on what's written and avoid any assumptions or external knowledge.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions that the USDA released genetic information but didn't provide details like where or when samples were collected. The delay in releasing data is attributed to the USDA. However, the specific agency responsible for delaying the release related to California's emergency declaration isn't explicitly named beyond the USDA. Since the question asks for the federal agency, the answer is USDA.

2. **Question 2:** The article states the federal stockpile has "a few million doses of vaccine against bird flu," but it's noted that the vaccine might need updating for an evolved strain. The question asks how many updated doses are available. The article doesn't specify the number of updated doses, so it's N/A.

3. **Question 3:** There's no mention of a percentage of asymptomatic dairy workers in Texas. The article discusses reinfections in Idaho herds and mentions asymptomatic cases in cattle but not workers. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The Canadian teenager's case involved a new virus version with mutations during infection. A mutation in a lab setting was mentioned (a single mutation enhancing human cell infection), but the specific mutation name isn't given. The question asks for the mutation from her case, which isn't named here. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The article says Idaho herds had milder symptoms on reinfection but doesn't provide a percentage reduction in milk production. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The article mentions Ginkgo Bioworks partners with a company assessing half the nation's milk supply. The partner's name isn't given, so N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The article states cooking meat at high temperatures kills the virus but doesn't specify a temperature threshold. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The article mentions farmworkers in Texas Panhandle are unaware and not using gear, but no numbers are provided on how many contracted H5N1. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** No mortality rate is given for domestic cats from contaminated pet food. The article mentions recalls but not the rate. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The article says California declared an emergency after cases rose sharply, but the highest number of asymptomatic cases in dairy cattle between August-December 2023 isn't specified. The first case in California was in August, but numbers aren't compared across states. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The USDA stated no new infections in Idaho since October, contradicting state reports of November cases. The month mentioned is October. So October.

12. **Question 12:** Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was mentioned as someone who "would lead the federal health and human services department if confirmed." So HHS Secretary.

13. **Question 13:** The Louisiana patient's virus gained mutations that might allow better human infection. The specific mutation isn't named here. N/A.

14. **Question 14:** The article doesn't mention the start year of H5N1 vaccine production. N/A.

15. **Question 15:** Dr. Juthani refers to California's declaration. The article states Governor Newsom declared an emergency in December, so California.

16. **Question 16:** The article states 67 cases in 2024 and 1 in 2022, totaling 68. But "between 2022 and 2024" might include 2023. The article mentions "in 2024...infected 67 Americans, compared with just one in the years before, in 2022." So 2023 cases? The article doesn't specify, but total would be 67 (2024) +1 (2022) = 68. But maybe the question is from 2022 to 2024 inclusive? The article says "between 2022 and 2024" but only mentions 2022 and 2024. So 68.

17. **Question 17:** The federal bulk milk testing started in December but excluded Idaho. The program's name? The article says "testing bulk milk began in December...still does not include Idaho." The program is the USDA's, but the question asks for the agricultural product tested. The answer is bulk milk.

18. **Question 18:** The Canadian girl's only risk factor was obesity. The answer is obesity.

19. **Question 19:** The article mentions a brand was recalled but doesn't name it. So N/A.

20. **Question 20:** The lab study mentioned a single mutation enhancing human cell infection. The mutation isn't named, so N/A.
