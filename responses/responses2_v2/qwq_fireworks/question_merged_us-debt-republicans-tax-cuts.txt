Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions that Trump announced plans to create the Department of Government Efficiency. It doesn't mention a specific Republican senator proposing it. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The Tax Foundation estimated a 20% tariff would raise $3.3 trillion from 2025-2034. The question asks about the External Revenue Service's revenue. Since the External Revenue Service collects tariffs, this figure applies. So $3.3 trillion.

3. **Question 3:** Bessent's goal was to reduce the deficit to 3% of GDP from 6.2%. The percentage reduction isn't stated, so N/A. Wait, the question asks for the promised percentage reduction. Since it's from 6.2% to 3%, the actual percentage decrease isn't calculated in the text. The answer should be N/A because the article only states the target, not the percentage reduction achieved through the fund.

4. **Question 4:** The text doesn't mention any former Treasury Secretary Bessent cited. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The article says a tent city to house 30,000 migrants is being prepared, but it doesn't mention other facilities beyond Guantanamo. So the answer is 1 (Guantanamo), but the question asks for "how many migrant detention facilities beyond Guantanamo Bay were mentioned". The answer would be 0 since only Guantanamo is mentioned. Wait, the article states they're preparing a tent city in addition to the Guantanamo facility. The question is about facilities beyond Guantanamo. The tent city is another facility, so that's 1. But the exact number? The text says "a tent city" which is one. So answer 1.

6. **Question 6:** The CBO says rescinding $20B from IRS adds $46B to deficits. The question asks cost savings from redirecting tech upgrades to pursue tax evaders. The article says Bessent suggested the IRS should focus on tech over chasing evaders. So the savings would be the $46B not added, but the question is phrased as "projected cost savings". Since the article doesn't state savings from redirecting, but the $46B is the added deficit from cutting IRS funding, the answer might be N/A. Wait, the question is about savings from redirecting tech to pursue evaders. Since the article says they plan to cut IRS funding and redirect to tech, but the CBO says cutting IRS funding adds $46B. So if they redirect tech towards evaders instead, maybe that's a different scenario. The article doesn't specify savings from that action, so N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The CBO report mentions higher salaries and stock values led to smaller deficits. The article doesn't state when the CBO first identified this, so N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The DEI section says West Point ended a dozen clubs. So 12 were discontinued, but how many continued under modified guidelines? The text doesn't say how many remained, only that a dozen were ended. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The article states Trump called for USAID closure, with most staff suspended or laid off. The exact percentage isn't given. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The lawsuits against CBS and Des Moines Register are mentioned, but no info on which won a motion. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The debt hits 118% by 2035. If tax cuts extend, the debt would rise faster. The article says extending tax cuts would add over $4T, implying reaching 118% sooner. The text doesn't state the exact years, so N/A.

Wait, the article says "by 2035, the debt as a share of the U.S. economy will rise to 118 percent, the largest in history. The debt is currently 100 percent..." but then mentions extending tax cuts would cost $4T, making the deficit worse. So if tax cuts are extended, the 118% would be reached earlier. The question asks how many years sooner. The text doesn't provide specific years, so N/A.

12. **Question 12:** The rescission of $20B from IRS leads to $46B added to deficits. The discrepancy is between the $20B cut and $46B impact. The answer is the $46B figure, so the numerical discrepancy is $20B vs. $46B. The question asks for the discrepancy between the $20B and its impact. So the answer is $46 billion (the projected impact is higher than the cut).

13. **Question 13:** Extending tax cuts cost $4T over decade. The tariff would raise $3.3T. The total cost would be $4T (cost of tax cuts) minus $3.3T (revenue from tariffs) = $0.7T net? But the question says "total projected cost of both extending... and implementing..." So adding both? The tax cuts cost $4T, and the tariff's cost isn't a cost, but a revenue. Wait, the question says "total projected cost of both...". The tax cuts' cost is $4T. The tariff's revenue would offset that. But the question might be asking for the total of both the tax cuts' cost and the tariff's revenue? Not sure. The text says the tax cuts cost $4T over decade, and the tariff would raise $3.3T. So combined, the net would be $700B more deficit, but the question is about total cost of both measures. Maybe the answer is $4 trillion (tax cuts) plus the cost of the tariff? But tariffs are revenue. The question might be a trick, so perhaps N/A. Wait the question says "total projected cost of both extending the 2017 tax cuts and implementing a 20% universal tariff..." The tax cuts cost $4T, the tariff's cost isn't a cost but revenue. So the total cost would just be $4T. But the question might be looking for the difference. The article doesn't combine these numbers, so N/A.

14. **Question 14:** The article says 10 migrants are held at Guantanamo and preparing a tent city for 30,000. The specific numerical threshold mentioned for Guantanamo's current holdings and future is 10 and 30,000. But the question asks for the specific number related to both current and future. The answer is 30,000 as the capacity mentioned for the tent city. But the question is about Guantanamo's capacity? The article says they're preparing a tent city to house 30,000 migrants. The Guantanamo part is 10 held there. The question asks for the numerical threshold mentioned in relation to both current holdings and future preparations at Guantanamo. The current is 10, but future preparations might be the tent city's 30k. Since the question specifies "at Guantanamo Bay", the answer is 10, but the tent city is separate. The article says "preparing a tent city to house as many as 30,000 migrants" but that's not at Guantanamo. So the Guantanamo part is holding 10, but the question might be about the capacity there. The text doesn't mention capacity plans for Guantanamo beyond the 10 held, so maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "specific numerical threshold for migrant detention capacity at Guantanamo Bay". The current holdings are 10, but the preparations for the tent city are elsewhere. So the answer is N/A because the 30k is for a tent city, not Guantanamo. The Guantanamo part just mentions 10 held, not capacity. So N/A.

Wait, let me check again each question carefully.

1. N/A (no senator named)
2. $3.3 trillion (from Tax Foundation's estimate)
3. N/A (target is 3%, but the question asks the promised reduction percentage via the fund)
4. N/A (no former Treasury Secretary mentioned)
5. 1 (the tent city is one facility beyond Guantanamo)
6. N/A (no savings figure given for redirecting tech)
7. N/A (no date given)
8. N/A (only mentions 12 ended, not how many continued)
9. N/A (no percentages given)
10. N/A (no info on motions won)
11. N/A (no specific years given for when it would reach earlier)
12. The $20B rescission leads to $46B added, so the discrepancy is $46 billion (the impact is higher than the cut)
13. N/A (the tax cuts cost $4T, tariff brings in $3.3T, but total cost isn't stated)
14. N/A (the Guantanamo has 10 held, but the 30k is for a different facility)
