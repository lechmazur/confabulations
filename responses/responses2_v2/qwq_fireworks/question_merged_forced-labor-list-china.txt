Okay, I need to answer these questions based solely on the provided article. Let me go through each question one by one and check the text carefully.

1. The first question asks which European country was the first to implement import restrictions after the U.S. law. The article mentions that since the law went into effect, other governments in Europe and Canada have taken steps. But it doesn't specify which European country was first. So I should answer N/A.

2. For Zijin Mining's subsidiaries added, the article says the 37 entities include subsidiaries of Zijin Mining but doesn't state how many exactly. So N/A here too.

3. The question about polysilicon percentage: The article says Xinjiang produces significant amounts of polysilicon, but there's no specific percentage given. So N/A.

4. PVH's sourcing start date according to Chinese investigations: The article mentions the Chinese government investigated PVH but doesn't state when they started sourcing. So N/A.

5. Monetary value of imports blocked from the new companies: The text doesn't provide any figures on the value. Answer N/A.

6. Which major retailer terminated after the 2021 law? The article says H&M cut ties with a Huafu subsidiary. That fits here. So H&M.

7. Number of labor programs linked by NYT to Zijin: The article states the NYT reported links with labor transfer programs but doesn't specify the count. N/A.

8. Marco Rubio's role during Biden's implementation: Rubio was the primary author of the law, but the question is about his role in enforcement under Biden. Since he's a Senator and later Secretary of State under Trump, not Biden's admin, maybe N/A? The text says Rubio was primary author and a proponent, but his role in Biden's phase isn't stated. So N/A.

9. Month Homeland Security finished investigations: The article doesn't mention the specific month. N/A.

10. Cotton imports blocked in the first year: No data on volume is provided. N/A.

11. Product category Mayorkas cited: The Secretary's quote mentions free markets and forced labor, but the article doesn't specify a product category he named. Wait, the question asks what he cited as a priority. The quote says "halting imports of goods made with forced labor, including products from Xinjiang." But the exact product category? The article states that Xinjiang produces cotton, polysilicon, etc., but Mayorkas's statement might not specify. Wait, the text says the action includes suppliers of critical minerals and textiles. The Secretary's quote doesn't list a specific category, so maybe the answer is N/A. Wait the question says "specific product category cited by Mayorkas during his remarks about free markets." The exact quote from Mayorkas in the text is about the law's importance, but the article doesn't quote him mentioning a specific product. So N/A here too.
