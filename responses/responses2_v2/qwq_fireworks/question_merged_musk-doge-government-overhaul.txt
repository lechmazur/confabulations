Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the given article and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks how many billions in federal contracts related to building maintenance did DOGE cancel in its first week. The article mentions that DOGE said they canceled contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars, specifically mentioning "DEI contracts and unoccupied buildings." But the exact amount isn't specified, so the answer is N/A because it's not a specific number in billions.

2. The next question is about the name of the weekly podcast Musk and Ramaswamy launched. The article says they "floated the possibility of hosting a weekly podcast together," but it doesn't mention the actual name. Since they only considered it and didn't confirm a name, the answer is N/A.

3. The third question asks which former Twitter executive Musk brought to lead the IRS tech modernization. The article mentions Amanda Scales, who worked at xAI (Musk's AI company) is now at the Office of Personnel Management. Also, Michael Grimes from Morgan Stanley, who helped with Twitter, might join but isn't leading the IRS part. The IRS focus is mentioned with Baris Akis, but he's an investor. Wait, the article says "Baris Akis, participated in the transition team's agency review at the I.R.S." but doesn't say he's leading it. So maybe no one is named as the leader here. Hmm, so maybe N/A?

Wait, looking again. The article says "people involved with DOGE, including the tech investor Baris Akis, participated in the transition team's agency review at the I.R.S." But it doesn't state he's leading it. The leader isn't named here, so N/A.

4. The fourth question is about the percentage reduction in federal workforce through automation. The article mentions Musk aims to automate IRS work to reduce employees but doesn't give a specific percentage from the first round. So N/A.

5. Deputy Director after Ramaswamy's departure? The article doesn't mention who took over as Deputy Director. It says Musk has full command now. So N/A.

6. Total budget allocated to DOGE's first year? The article doesn't mention any specific budget numbers. N/A.

7. Three federal agencies for the AI pilot? The article mentions IRS specifically and that DOGE teams are embedded in IRS, but the question is about three agencies. The article doesn't list three, only IRS is mentioned explicitly. N/A.

8. Criteria Amanda Scales used for probationary employees? The article says agencies were asked to send lists of probationary employees "easier to fire" by Friday. The criteria is being on probationary status, so the answer is "being on probationary status."

9. Number of xAI team members granted special status? The article mentions Amanda Scales and others, but no number is given. N/A.

10. The sole leader of the cost-cutting effort is Musk, as per the article. The question states this, so answer is Elon Musk.

11. The rebranded office is the United States Digital Service renamed to DOGE Service. So the original name was United States Digital Service.

12. The key role in federal hiring agency is Amanda Scales as chief of staff at OPM. The question mentions a hiring freeze period, and she's in that role. So answer: Amanda Scales.

13. The entrepreneur "out-bodied" is Ramaswamy, as stated in the article. The quote from an ally says Ramaswamy was "out-bodied" by Musk.

14. The agency from Obama's time is the United States Digital Service, now DOGE. So answer: United States Digital Service.

15. The agency with $5T revenue and 80k employees is the IRS. The article mentions IRS as an early focus for tech upgrades and workforce reduction.

16. The billionaire comparing government reform to rockets is Musk, as he posted a meme on X comparing his effect to rocket innovation.

17. The individual emphasizing tech improvements is Mina Hsiang, the former Digital Service admin. She's quoted saying focusing on everyday problems could help.

18. The person who initially projected a 30% reduction is Musk. The article says he initially said $2T (30% of ~6.75T) and later lowered it.

19. The agency targeted for downsizing despite Congress's role is the IRS. The article mentions IRS employee reduction via automation, and Congress still holds spending power. So IRS.

Wait, let me check each again quickly.
