Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions beyond that.

1. **Question 1:** Which streaming platform commissioned Sean Baker's latest iPhone-shot project mentioned in the article?  
The article mentions Sean Baker's "Tangerine" was shot on an iPhone, but his latest project isn't specified. The latest mentioned for him is "Anora," but the article doesn't say who commissioned it. So, N/A.

2. **Question 2:** How many minutes of footage did Danny Boyle shoot on an iPhone for "28 Years Later" according to the review?  
The article says Danny Boyle's upcoming "28 Years Later" was made with an iPhone, but there's no mention of footage duration. N/A.

3. **Question 3:** What was Maya's occupation before she started caring for her dying mother?  
The article states Maya was "sullen and directionless" after her mother's death and before the job. It doesn't mention her previous job. N/A.

4. **Question 4:** In which European city did Maya first meet her father's mysterious clients?  
Maya goes to Cairo with her father first. The article mentions Cairo but doesn't specify if that's a European city. However, Cairo is in Egypt, so maybe not European. The question might be a trick. The article doesn't clarify, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** What technological innovation did Neil Burger cite as his primary inspiration for shooting "Inheritance" on an iPhone?  
The article says Burger used an "experimental style" with minimal rehearsals and setups. The primary inspiration mentioned is the lightweight and portable cameras. So, the answer is the smartphone's lightweight and portable features.

6. **Question 6:** Which character in "Inheritance" reveals the truth about Maya's mother's past during their conversation in Mumbai?  
The article mentions mini-sermons by minor characters about Maya's mother but doesn't name a specific character. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** How much was Maya offered to work as a guide for her father's wealthy clients?  
The article says "a job that pays well" but doesn't specify an amount. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** What color phone did Charlie Kaufman use to shoot "Jackals and Fireflies"?  
The article says Charlie Kaufman used a Samsung Galaxy, but color isn't mentioned. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Which famous director mentioned in the article pioneered the use of smartphone cinematography in 2012?  
Sean Baker shot "Tangerine" on an iPhone, which was released in 2015. Steven Soderbergh's "Unsane" (2018) and "High Flying Bird" (2017). The article mentions "long before he made 'Anora' Sean Baker shot 'Tangerine' on an iPhone." The first mention of smartphone use is Baker, so he's the pioneer here. The question is about 2012. Since "Tangerine" was 2015, maybe Soderbergh's "Unsane" is 2018. The article doesn't specify 2012, so N/A.

10. **Question 10:** What was the budget difference between shooting "Inheritance" with traditional cameras versus using iPhones?  
No budget figures are mentioned. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Which director's upcoming zombie film shot on an iPhone is noted for employing a similar experimental shooting style to "Inheritance," involving minimal rehearsals and spontaneous street filming?  
Danny Boyle's "28 Years Later" is mentioned as using iPhones. The article says Burger used an experimental style with minimal rehearsals. The question asks which director's film used a similar style. The answer would be Danny Boyle, as his film is noted as using iPhones similarly. Wait, the article says "Danny Boyle's upcoming zombie movie '28 Years Later' was made with an iPhone, too." But "Inheritance" also uses the same experimental style. So the answer is Danny Boyle.

12. **Question 12:** What specific technological limitation of smartphone cameras does the article imply hindered "Inheritance's" ability to create tension compared to Danny Boyle's iPhone-shot thriller?  
The article mentions that "Inheritance" had issues with the aesthetic not selling, but specifically, the problem was the loose technique leading to lines feeling read, shaky footage, and underbaked story. The tech limitation isn't explicitly stated. Maybe the "light footprint" but that's an advantage. Since the article says Danny Boyle's approach might work for a documentary style but "Inheritance" didn't, perhaps the limitation is the shaky hand-held look that didn't serve the thriller aspect. The article says "the way the film was made that sucks all the fun out of it... occasional shaky hand-held footage." So the limitation is the shaky footage affecting tension.

13. **Question 13:** What documentary mentioned in the article used guerrilla-style iPhone footage to achieve a tone that "Inheritance" unsuccessfully attempted to replicate through its experimental filming approach?  
The article mentions documentaries using phone footage for obvious reasons but doesn't name a specific one. N/A.

14. **Question 14:** How does the article suggest Neil Burger's use of smartphone cameras in "Inheritance" directly contradicts the thematic purpose of Sean Baker's iPhone-shot film "Tangerine"?  
The article states that auteurs like Baker used the iPhone's look to the story's advantage (form follows function), while Burger's didn't. So the contradiction is that Burger's didn't align the tech with the story, unlike Baker who did. So the answer is that Burger's use didn't align with the story's needs, unlike Baker's which did.

15. **Question 15:** What R-rated content descriptor does the article explicitly link to Phoebe Dynevor's character engaging in illegal activities that undermine the film's moral messaging about being a "good person"?  
The R rating is listed as "for bad language, bad behavior and bad accents." "Bad behavior" likely includes her shoplifting, which is an illegal activity mentioned. So the answer is "bad behavior."

16. **Question 16:** Which auteur's Samsung Galaxy-shot work is contrasted with "Inheritance's" iPhone aesthetic to highlight deficiencies in Burger's integration of technology with storytelling?  
Charlie Kaufman's "Jackals and Fireflies" used a Samsung Galaxy. The article contrasts Burger's failure with those who "sell it," so Kaufman is the contrast. The answer is Charlie Kaufman.

17. **Question 17:** What narrative device does the article claim "Inheritance" overuses to artificially maintain suspense about Maya's father, despite audiences already deducing key plot points?  
The article says "we're already a step or two ahead of her. That's part of the problem: A thriller works only when the audience is thrilled." So the overused device is withholding information the audience already knows. The answer is "withholding information" or "keeping the audience ahead." The exact term might be "keeping the audience ahead of the protagonist."

18. **Question 18:** What technological advancement in smartphone cameras does the article credit with enabling the "light footprint" filmmaking approach that both "High Flying Bird" and "Inheritance" attempted but only one executed effectively?  
The article mentions "shrinking camera sizes made it easier to shoot on location... smartphones provide lightweight, powerful, portable cameras." The advancement is the lightweight and portable nature, so the answer is "lightweight and portable cameras."
