Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer strictly based on that. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Which Broadway musical did Mel Shapiro direct that featured songs written by Stephen Sondheim?**
   The article mentions "Follies" as competition for the Tony Awards for "Two Gentlemen of Verona." Since "Follies" was by Sondheim, but the question asks which musical Shapiro directed that had Sondheim's songs. However, the article says Shapiro's musical was competing against "Follies," not that he directed it. So the answer is N/A because Shapiro didn't direct "Follies."

2. **How many years did Mel Shapiro spend teaching Korean language skills to military personnel at the Army Language School before becoming a theater director?**
   The article states he learned Korean at the Army Language School in Monterey and served as a translator in Japan for two years. It doesn't mention teaching, so "teaching" might be an incorrect premise. The answer would be N/A because the text doesn't say he taught there, just learned the language.

3. **What was the name of the play that John Lahr directed at the Guthrie Theater which led him to recommend Mel Shapiro to John Guare?**
   The article says John Lahr recommended Shapiro because Shapiro had been a producing director at the Guthrie. But it doesn't mention a specific play directed by Lahr. The play Shapiro directed there isn't specified either. So N/A.

4. **During which decade did Barbara Cason win a Tony Award for her performance in Shapiro's production of "The Skin of Our Teeth"?**
   The article mentions Barbara Cason was in a Stanford Rep production of "The Skin of Our Teeth" in 1965. There's no mention of a Tony Award for her in that role. So N/A.

5. **What was the running time of the original Shakespeare version of "Two Gentlemen of Verona" when it was first performed at the Delacorte Theater before being adapted into a musical?**
   The article says Shapiro and Guare turned the five-act play into a 90-minute show. The original's runtime isn't specified, so N/A.

6. **Which famous Hollywood actor starred in Mel Shapiro's production of "Long Day's Journey into Night" at Arena Stage?**
   The article lists Shapiro directing "Long Day's Journey into Night" at Arena Stage but doesn't mention the actor. So N/A.

7. **What was the box office revenue for "The House of Blue Leaves" during its initial run at the Truck and Warehouse Theater?**
   The article doesn't provide financial figures, so N/A.

8. **How many students from Mel Shapiro's UCLA directing program went on to win Tony Awards?**
   The text doesn't mention student outcomes at UCLA, so N/A.

9. **What was the name of the documentary that Lee Grant completed about divorce after directing "The Lay of the Land"?**
   The article says Lee Grant was preparing to make a documentary when she got Shapiro's play, but it doesn't name the documentary. So N/A.

10. **Which famous rock musician collaborated with Galt MacDermot on the original songs for the musical version of "Two Gentlemen of Verona"?**
    The article says Galt MacDermot (known for "Hair") was the composer. No other musician is mentioned, so just Galt MacDermot. But the question asks for a collaborator besides him? Wait, the article says "Galt MacDermot, the composer best known for 'Hair,' to write a rock score and Mr. Guare to write lyrics." So the collaborator is John Guare on lyrics, but the question asks for a rock musician. Since MacDermot is the composer, maybe the answer is just Galt MacDermot. But the question specifies "collaborated with Galt MacDermot on the original songs." Since Guare wrote lyrics, but he's not a rock musician. So perhaps N/A because there's no other musician mentioned besides MacDermot. Wait, the question might be a trick. The article says "Galt MacDermot, the composer best known for 'Hair,' to write a rock score and Mr. Guare to write lyrics." So the collaborator for the songs would be Guare, but he's a playwright, not a rock musician. So maybe the answer is N/A.

11. **Which Eugene O'Neill play did Mel Shapiro direct during his tenure at the Guthrie Theater, solidifying his reputation for tackling psychologically complex works?**
    The article mentions he directed "Long Day's Journey into Night" at Arena Stage, not the Guthrie. At Guthrie, it says he was a producing director but doesn't specify plays there. So N/A.

12. **What was the title of the documentary Lee Grant was researching when she discovered Shapiro's play, which she later adapted into a film about marital strife?**
    The article states Lee Grant was preparing to make a documentary about divorce when she received Shapiro's play. The play's title is "The Lay of the Land," but the documentary's title isn't given. So N/A.

13. **Which international conflict directly influenced Shapiro's decision to join the Army and later informed his staging of military themes in "The Lay of the Land"?**
    The article says he joined the Army near the end of the Korean War. The play's themes might relate, but the text doesn't explicitly state the conflict influenced the play's themes. So N/A.

14. **Which composer of a iconic Vietnam War-era rock musical did Shapiro initially approach to collaborate on "Two Gentlemen of Verona" before hiring Galt MacDermot?**
    The article mentions Galt MacDermot was the composer chosen. There's no mention of another composer being approached first. So N/A.

15. **What foreign language proficiency acquired during Shapiro's military service became a recurring motif in his experimental productions at Arena Stage?**
    He learned Korean in the Army, but the article doesn't mention using that in his work at Arena Stage. So N/A.

16. **Which Pulitzer Prize-winning dramatist mentored Shapiro during his early directing career at the Pittsburgh Playhouse, as cited in his textbook "An Actor Performs"?**
    The article doesn't mention a Pulitzer winner mentoring him there. So N/A.

17. **At which Ivy League university did Shapiro establish a groundbreaking graduate theater program after leaving Carnegie Mellon, later referenced in Paul Schoeffler's tribute?**
    After Carnegie Mellon, he went to UCLA, which isn't Ivy League. The article says he went to UCLA's theater department. So N/A because UCLA isn't Ivy League. The question might be a trick. The answer is N/A since the article doesn't mention an Ivy League school.

18. **What was the name of the avant-garde theater collective Shapiro co-founded with John Guare during their collaboration on "Bosoms and Neglect" in the 1970s?**
    The article mentions collaborations but no specific collective name. So N/A.

    The article says the Broadway revival starred Sammy Davis Jr., who won an Academy Award. So answer: Sammy Davis Jr.

20. **How many Drama Desk Awards did Shapiro receive across his career for innovations in adapting classical texts, beyond his Obie and Tony recognitions?**
    The article doesn't mention Drama Desk Awards. So N/A.
