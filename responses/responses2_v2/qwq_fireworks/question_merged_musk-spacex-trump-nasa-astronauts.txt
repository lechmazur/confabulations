Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and answer exactly what's asked without any extra details.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions Bill Nelson as NASA's administrator during the Biden administration, but the question asks about Trump's presidency. Wait, the article says "Bill Nelson, the NASA administrator during the Biden administration..." so Trump's admin isn't mentioned here. The decision to extend their stay was due to Starliner's malfunction. The text says NASA officials decided, but doesn't name the admin under Trump. So maybe N/A?

Wait, the article says "Lingering unease with the vehicle led NASA officials to decide..." but who was the administrator then? The article only mentions Bill Nelson under Biden. Since the question specifies Trump's presidency, but the article doesn't mention a different admin, answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The article states "the space station has been resupplied four times since the two arrived." So resupply missions were successful. The question asks how many failed. The article doesn't mention any failed attempts. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The original mission duration was "not supposed to last much longer than a week or two." So answer is "a week or two" or "about a week or two".

4. **Question 4:** The backup commander isn't mentioned. The article says Williams is the current commander. No info on backup, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The malfunction was Starliner's propulsion system. The critical system that prompted NASA to consider return? The article says they extended their stay because of the malfunction. But the prompt for return isn't a system on the station, but the Starliner's problem. The question asks about a space station system? The answer might be N/A. Wait, the problem was the Starliner's propulsion, not the station's. So the critical system malfunction on the station? No, the issue was with the spacecraft. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Before this flight, how many successful Starliner missions? The article says this was a test flight, implying it was the first. So zero previous successful ones. Answer: 0.

7. **Question 7:** The minimum crew size needed? The article says "just three astronauts" if they left early. So 3? But NASA's usual is 7, but if they leave early, it might be 3. The question is about essential operations. The text mentions "understaffed... three astronauts" so answer is 3.

8. **Question 8:** International partner proposing an alternative? The article mentions "NASA and its international partners" but doesn't name which agency proposed a solution. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Manufacturing defect in Crew Dragon? The article says SpaceX needed more time for manufacturing and testing of the new capsule. But the defect isn't named. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Number of spacewalks completed? The article doesn't mention any specific number. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Sole astronaut for spacewalk if only one American left. The article says "one NASA astronaut aboard -- Don Pettit -- to perform the task." So answer: Don Pettit.

12. **Question 12:** Tech entrepreneur criticizing the administration. The article mentions Elon Musk on X (Twitter) criticizing the Biden admin. So answer: Elon Musk.

13. **Question 13:** Company preparing for Crew-10 despite delays. The article says "SpaceX has been planning to use a brand-new Crew Dragon for Crew-10." So answer: SpaceX.

14. **Question 14:** Commander during extended stay. The article states "Ms. Williams is the current commander." So Suni Williams.

15. **Question 15:** Revised timeline for return if delays persist. The article says "delayed again, to late March." So answer: late March.

16. **Question 16:** Which spacecraft's malfunction led to not using it? The Starliner's propulsion malfunction caused them to leave Williams and Wilmore on the station. So Starliner.

17. **Question 17:** Nation's astronauts as helpers if only one American. The article says "the two Russian astronauts on board could help." So Russia.

18. **Question 18:** Private company whose spring mission might be bumped. The article mentions Axiom Space's mission could have astronauts bumped if older Crew Dragon is used. So Axiom Space.

19. **Question 19:** Company with test flight explosion. The article mentions "SpaceX test flight explosion" leading to FAA investigation. So SpaceX.

20. **Question 20:** Government agency stating "as soon as practical". The article says NASA said that. So NASA.
