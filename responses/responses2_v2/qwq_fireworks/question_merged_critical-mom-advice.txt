Okay, I need to answer these questions based solely on the provided article. Let me go through each question one by one and check the article for the answers.

1. **Question 1**: The mother's specific response when the daughter suggested finding a therapist. The article says the daughter told her mother that her venting hurts her, and the mother replied she needed to air frustrations. Wait, but the question is about suggesting a therapist. Let me check again. The therapist's advice includes the step: "I'm happy to support you in finding a therapist..." and the mother's response to the daughter's initial complaint was "she needed to air her frustrations with someone." The article doesn't mention the mother's response to the therapist suggestion directly, so maybe N/A?

Wait, the article's advice from the therapist includes a script where the daughter says she'll support finding a therapist. But the original question is about what the mother actually said when the daughter suggested that. Since the article only quotes the mother's response to the daughter's hurt feelings, not to the therapist suggestion, the answer might be N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Years Lori Gottlieb practiced before becoming columnist. The article says she's a psychotherapist and best-selling author, but doesn't mention years of practice. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Medical condition linked by Kennedy to aluminum. The article says Kennedy blamed aluminum in vaccines for allergies and other illnesses. So allergies is the answer.

4. **Question 4**: Metaphor for healthy vs enmeshed relationships. The therapist uses the metaphor of two trees intertwined like enmeshed branches. The metaphor is "two trees that have grown so close together that their branches have become intertwined."

5. **Question 5**: Percentage success rate for ineffective boundaries. The therapist says if you end the conversation 90% of the time, the other 10% undermines it. So the ineffective is 90% compliance, but the question is asking for the percentage that makes it ineffective. Wait, the article says "if you end only 90% of the time, why would they honor it?" So the answer is 90%? Wait, the question is what percentage would make boundaries ineffective. The article says that 100% is needed, so any less makes it ineffective. The answer is 90% is insufficient, so the ineffective is 90%? The question asks "what percentage success rate... ineffective". The answer is 90% would be ineffective because you need 100%. So the answer is 90%? Or the article says "if you end only 90% of the time..." so the percentage that makes it ineffective is 90%? So answer is 90%.

6. **Question 6**: Organic molecules linked to life's origin. The article says "organic molecules that shed light on how life arose." The exact molecules aren't named, so N/A. Wait, the article says "a wide assortment of organic molecules that shed light on how life arose." Since they aren't specified, answer N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Compensation for trial volunteers. The article mentions "brave volunteers" but doesn't say what they get. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Afternoon slump's most severe phase. The article says "afternoon slump: this drowsy feeling is temporary..." but doesn't specify the time. The question asks "during which phase of the day"â€”maybe "afternoon" is the answer. Wait, the question is phrased as "during which phase of the day did the article indicate... most severe?" The article just mentions "afternoon slump" so the phase is afternoon. So answer "afternoon".

9. **Question 9**: Term for mother's blame transfer. The therapist mentions "enmeshment" and "hypercritical" but the specific term for blaming the daughter-in-law instead of son might be "scapegoating" but the article says the therapist used "enmeshment". Wait, the question is about the term for transferring blame from son to daughter-in-law. The article says "blames my sister-in-law for my brother's failings". The therapist's term for the pattern is enmeshment. The question asks for the term describing the blame transfer. The article says "enmeshment, a relationship pattern in which boundaries...". So the answer is enmeshment?

Wait, the question is "psychological term... mother's pattern of transferring blame from son to daughter-in-law?" The article says the mother blames the sister-in-law for the brother's failings. The therapist says this is part of enmeshment. Is there another term? The article doesn't mention a specific term for the blame transfer, just enmeshment as the overall pattern. So enmeshment is the answer.

10. **Question 10**: Number of steps outlined before the three steps. The therapist outlines three steps: state the issue, set the boundary, hold the boundary. The question asks how many steps were outlined before describing the three main steps. The article introduces the three steps as "three steps", so before that, the answer is zero. But maybe the question is a trick? The answer is 0, so N/A unless specified. Wait, the question says "how many steps did the therapist outline for successfully implementing boundaries before describing the three main steps?" The three steps are the main ones, so before those, there were none. So answer is 0? But the question might be tricky. The article says "establishing a boundary consists of three steps", so prior to that, perhaps no steps. So answer is N/A? Or 0? Since the question is about steps outlined before the three steps, maybe 0. But the answer format requires either a number or N/A. Since the article doesn't mention any steps before the three, answer is 0? Or N/A? Since the question might expect a number, but the article doesn't state steps before, so N/A?

Wait, the question is phrased as "how many steps did the therapist outline for successfully implementing boundaries before describing the three main steps?" Since the three steps are the main steps, there were none before, so the answer is 0. But maybe the article didn't mention any prior steps, so N/A? Hmm. The article says "establishing a boundary consists of three steps", so prior steps? No, so answer is 0. But the instructions say to write N/A if not present. Maybe 0 is acceptable as a numerical answer. I'll go with 0.

11. **Question 11**: Percentage reduction in conversation length. The article says if you end only 90% of the time, it's ineffective. The question asks for a starting point, like 10%? Or maybe the question is mixing parts. The article doesn't mention a percentage for conversation length reduction. The 90% is about compliance, not conversation length. So N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Number of asteroids needed to separate from mother. The question is metaphorical, asking how many Bennu-like asteroids the daughter needs to separate from. The article mentions Bennu in the sidebar, but the main article's enmeshment is compared to two trees. The question is asking for a number from the article, but the article doesn't mention Bennu in the therapy context. So N/A.

13. **Question 13**: Therapeutic intervention for daughter's negativity. The article's advice on managing afternoon slump isn't linked to the therapist's advice. The slump's coping methods are separate. The question asks for a method from the slump context. The article says for the slump: "experts have ways to cope" but doesn't specify. Since the question wants a specific intervention mentioned, and it's not there, N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Month and year to start boundary steps mirroring Bennu sample collection. The article's sidebar mentions Bennu samples collected by NASA, but no date. So N/A.

15. **Question 15**: Organic molecule compared to emotional overflow. The metaphor was trees' branches, not molecules. The emotional overflow is compared to the daughter as a vessel. The asteroid's molecules aren't compared to that. So N/A.

16. **Question 16**: Number of volunteers representing emotional resilience. The article mentions "brave volunteers" but no number. So N/A.

17. **Question 17**: Health condition like being drained. The daughter feels drained, Kennedy linked aluminum to allergies. So allergies is the answer, but the question asks for a condition that mirrors the feeling. The article doesn't link allergies to feeling drained, so N/A?

Wait, the question is: "what specific health condition... incorrectly attributed to aluminum by Kennedy mirrors the daughter's feeling of being drained..." So the daughter feels drained, which Kennedy might have linked to aluminum's effect. Since Kennedy blamed aluminum for allergies and other illnesses, maybe "allergies" is the answer, but the feeling is emotional drain. The article doesn't say the daughter has an allergy, so N/A.

18. **Question 18**: Element analogous to aluminum enhancing vaccine effectiveness. The bird flu section isn't linked to vaccines except the aluminum part. The question is asking for an element that would enhance the effectiveness of the daughter's defense, like aluminum in vaccines. Since aluminum is in vaccines to boost immune response, the analogous element would be aluminum itself? But the question is asking for an element from the bird flu discussion. The bird flu part doesn't mention elements, so N/A.

19. **Question 19**: Symptom representing emotional state when ending conversations. The therapist advises ending the conversation. The trials have symptoms like vomiting, shivering. The article says when ending, the daughter should be firm. The symptom that represents the emotional state (resilience) might be something like enduring discomfort. The trials' symptoms are the ones volunteers experience. The question asks for the symptom that best represents the emotional state when ending conversations. The article says the daughter should end it despite guilt. The trials' symptoms (vomiting etc.) are physical, but the emotional state is firmness. Since the article doesn't link them, N/A. Or maybe "determined" but not in text. So N/A.
