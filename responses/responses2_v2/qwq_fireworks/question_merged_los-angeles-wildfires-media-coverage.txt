Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer strictly based on that. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks how many migrants the Trump administration is preparing to house in a tent city near Guantanamo Bay. Looking at the article, the relevant part is: "U.S Forces are also preparing a tent city to house as many as 30,000 migrants." So the answer is 30,000.

2. **Question 2:** The question is about West Point's action related to D.E.I. The article states: "DEI: West Point leaders complied with President Trump's D.E.I. ban by ending a dozen student clubs." The action was ending student clubs. The question mentions "mirroring President Trump's directive on D.E.I.," so the answer is ending a dozen student clubs.

3. **Question 3:** The question asks which other news organization besides CBS and The Des Moines Register is facing a lawsuit from Trump. The article says: "Media: First Amendment experts still believe that Trump's cases against CBS News and The Des Moines Register lack legal merit..." No other news organizations are mentioned as facing lawsuits here. So this might be N/A. Wait, but the question says "besides" those two, so unless there's another one listed, it's N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Kristin Crowley's reason for limited wildfire quelling. The article states Ryan Saavedra reported Crowley's warnings about budget cuts: "budget cuts to the department had 'severely limited' its ability to quell wildfires." So the answer is budget cuts.

5. **Question 5:** The specific global event similar to Ghana's inauguration that Trudeau participated in. The article says: "Threats to Canada: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in a talk with business leaders, said Canada's wealth of critical minerals are behind Trump's comments about making its northern neighbor a U.S. state." Wait, the question is about an event Trudeau participated in that's similar to Bass attending Ghana's inauguration. The article mentions Trudeau's talk with business leaders, but it doesn't name a specific event like an inauguration. So maybe N/A?

Wait, the question says "similar to the Ghanaian presidential inauguration that Mayor Bass attended, what specific global event did Trudeau participate in?" The article says Trudeau talked with business leaders, but there's no mention of him attending an inauguration or similar event. So answer N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Dana Griffin mentioned a weather phenomenon combined with drought. The article states: Dana Griffin said, "Those embers during those hurricane-force winds were pretty much playing hopscotch to vehicles and homes..." So the weather phenomenon is hurricane-force winds.

7. **Question 7:** The governmental agency Trump wanted to close. The article says: "U.S.A.I.D.: Trump directly called for the closure of the U.S. Agency for International Development..." So the answer is U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

8. **Question 8:** The delegation Bass was part of when she went to Ghana. The article mentions: "Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles. When the fires broke out, Ms. Bass was visiting Ghana as part of a delegation for the inauguration of the country's new president..." The delegation is for the inauguration of Ghana's new president. The exact name isn't given, so maybe the answer is the delegation for the inauguration of Ghana's new president, but the question asks for the name. Since it's not specified beyond "delegation for the inauguration," perhaps N/A. Wait, the question asks for the name of the delegation. The article just says "a delegation for the inauguration of the country's new president," so the name isn't provided. So answer N/A.

Wait, but the question is "what was the name of the delegation that included Mayor Bass..." Since the article doesn't name it beyond being for the Ghanaian inauguration, it's N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The fish Trump mentioned that Beckwith called irrelevant. The article says: "hearing Mr. Trump blame Gov. Gavin Newsom... questioning some of his past policies involving water and fish." Then Beckwith wrote that the cause wasn't "a fish." So the fish isn't named. The question asks for the name of the fish, but it's not mentioned. Answer N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The two natural factors Beckwith cited. The article states Beckwith argued the cause was "a combination of a drought, extremely high winds" and urban planning. The question asks for the two natural factors, so drought and high winds. Urban planning is a human factor. So the answer is drought and extremely high winds.
