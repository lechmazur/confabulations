Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The article says Homo erectus had brains "larger than those of earlier hominins, though only about two-thirds the size of our own." Wait, the question is comparing Homo erectus to the hominins from six million years ago (the split from apes). The article mentions that those early hominins lived in open woodlands. The brain size comparison here is between Homo erectus and earlier hominins. The text states their brains were "two-thirds the size of our own," but how does that compare to the earlier ones? Wait, the exact wording is: "Their brains were also larger than those of earlier hominins, though only about two-thirds the size of our own." So Homo erectus had larger brains than earlier hominins. But the question asks for the percentage. The article doesn't give a specific percentage, just that they were larger. Hmm, so the answer is N/A because it's not quantified. Wait, the question says "percentage larger"—the text doesn't specify, so answer N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The shift in adaptability narrative. The article states that the study suggests adaptability isn't just Homo sapiens but includes earlier relatives. The question asks which genus Dr. Mercader's research suggested was solely responsible for expansion beyond Africa. Wait, the article says Homo erectus expanded out of Africa, getting as far as Indonesia. The shift is that adaptability isn't just humans. The question is phrased as "genus... solely responsible for the expansion beyond Africa". The article mentions Homo erectus did that. The answer is Homo erectus. But the question says "solely responsible"—maybe the answer is Homo erectus, but the article says that the expansion beyond Africa was done by them, so the genus is Homo. Wait, the genus is Homo. But the question might be looking for the species? Wait, the question says "genus"—so the answer is Homo. Wait, no, the genus is Homo, but the species is erectus. The question says genus, so Homo. But the article says the research expanded adaptability to include earlier relatives (Homo erectus). The previous view was that adaptability was a hallmark of modern humans, but the study suggests that Homo erectus also had that. The question is about which genus's expansion was considered, but the answer is Homo erectus as a species? Wait, the question says "genus did Dr. Julio Mercader's research suggest was solely responsible for the expansion of hominins beyond Africa?" The expansion beyond Africa was done by Homo erectus. The genus is Homo. But the article says that the study's point is that adaptability isn't unique to Homo sapiens, so maybe the answer is Homo (the genus), but the question is phrased as "solely responsible for expansion beyond Africa"—the genus involved in expansion is Homo (since erectus is part of Homo). But maybe the answer is Homo erectus, but the question specifies genus, so Homo. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to get Homo erectus as the species, but the question says genus, so answer is Homo. Wait, the article says "Homo erectus expanded out of Africa". The genus is Homo, so the answer is Homo. But the question says "solely responsible"—maybe the answer is Homo erectus (the species), but since it's genus, Homo. I'll go with Homo.

3. **Question 3**: Fauna similar to Indonesia found in Engaji Nanyori. The article mentions that Homo erectus in Indonesia became extinct 100k years ago, and in Africa, they might have given rise to Homo sapiens. The question is about fauna in Engaji Nanyori similar to Indonesia. The article says "the animals that also showed up there, butchering their carcasses by the thousands." Wait, but the text says that in Engaji Nanyori, they hunted animals at watering holes. The part about Indonesia is that Homo erectus reached there. The question is about fauna in the arid environment similar to that in Indonesia. The article doesn't mention specific fauna types in Engaji Nanyori that are similar to Indonesia's. So maybe N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Hunting method from butchering patterns. The article says they hunted the animals that showed up at watering holes and butchered carcasses by the thousands. The preferred method? The text says they scavenged and hunted, but the question is about the method. It mentions "hunted the animals that also showed up there, butchering their carcasses by the thousands." The method here is hunting at watering holes. But the exact method? The answer might be "hunting" but the question specifies "preferred method of hunting employed... as deduced from butchering patterns". The article says they changed the way they scavenged, but butchering suggests they hunted and then processed. The answer is "hunting" but maybe the article specifies "scavenging" or "hunting". Wait, the text says "they hunted the animals that also showed up there, butchering their carcasses by the thousands." So the method is hunting. But the question is about the "preferred method of hunting"—maybe the answer is "hunting at watering holes" but the exact wording? The article doesn't specify a particular method like using tools, but the butchering implies they used tools. The question might be looking for "hunting" as the method. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "butchering carcasses by the thousands" but that's the result. Since the question asks for the method, the answer is "hunting" but the article doesn't give a specific term beyond that. Hmm, maybe "hunting" is sufficient. The article says "they hunted the animals that also showed up there", so the method is hunting. So answer: hunting.

5. **Question 5**: Preferred mineral composition for tools. The article says they "preferred material from particular places" but doesn't name the mineral. The exact wording: "they preferred material from particular places. And once they made a tool, they carried it with them." No specific mineral mentioned, so N/A.

6. **Question 6**: How many years did the open woodland persist before the climate shift? The article says "For hundreds of thousands of years, the researchers determined, Engaji Nanyori had been a comfortable open woodland. But around a million years ago, the climate dried up..." So the shift happened a million years ago, and the woodland existed for hundreds of thousands of years before that. The question is how many years? The article says "For hundreds of thousands of years"—so the exact number isn't given. The answer is N/A because it's not specific.

7. **Question 7**: Westernmost point reached by the Homo erectus that adapted to desert shrub lands. The article states that the desert belt stretched "across much of the Middle East and into Asia." So the westernmost point would be the farthest west they reached. The Middle East is west of Africa, so the westernmost point might be the Middle East? But the article doesn't specify a specific location like a country. Alternatively, the text says the belt stretched into Asia, but the westernmost point would be where the belt ended. Since it mentions stretching into Asia from Africa through the Middle East, the westernmost would be the Middle East region. But the question is about the westernmost point reached by the species. Since they expanded out of Africa, their westernmost point would be as far as they went west. But the article doesn't mention specific locations beyond Indonesia (east) and the Middle East. Wait, the article says "across much of the Middle East and into Asia"—so the westernmost point is the Middle East? But the question says "westernmost point reached by the Homo erectus species that adapted to the desert shrub lands stretching from Engaji Nanyori". The desert belt stretched into Asia, so the westernmost would be the farthest west in the Middle East. The article doesn't specify a particular place, so N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Earlier hominin species with slender legs preceding Homo erectus at Engaji Nanyori. The article says Homo erectus had "long slender legs to run on." Earlier hominins lived in open woodlands. The text mentions that Homo erectus evolved 2 million years ago, and before that, hominins were in open woodlands. But which species immediately preceded them at Engaji Nanyori? The article doesn't name the species that came before Homo erectus at that specific site. The text only says "earlier hominins" in general. Since the question asks for the species, and the article doesn't name it, answer N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Primary prey species based on pollen analysis. The article says they hunted animals at watering holes, but the primary prey isn't named. The pollen analysis was used to determine the environment, not the prey. So N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Title of the journal article by Paul Durkin. The article mentions the study was published in Communications Earth and Environment, co-authored by Durkin. The title is given as "which was published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth and Environment." The exact title isn't stated in the text. Wait, the first paragraph says "a new study hints that maybe we aren't so special. A million years ago, researchers have found, an extinct species of human relatives known as Homo erectus thrived in a harsh desert landscape..." The title of the article in the journal is not given explicitly. The user might think the title is "Homo erectus thrived in harsh desert landscapes a million years ago" but the article doesn't state the exact title. The article's own title is "A million years ago, a species known as Homo erectus most likely survived in an arid desert with no trees. By Carl Zimmer..." but that's the article's headline, not the study's. The study's title isn't provided in the text. So the answer is N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Erroneous conclusion about Homo erectus extinction and Homo sapiens emergence in Indonesia. The article says "In Africa, many researchers suspect, they gave rise to our own species in the past several hundred thousand years before disappearing there as well." Wait, the question is about an erroneous conclusion regarding their extinction in Africa and emergence in Indonesian jungles. The article mentions that in Africa, they might have given rise to Homo sapiens, but in Indonesia, Homo erectus became extinct 100k years ago. The article states that a previous version misspelled the site name, but that's not related. The erroneous conclusion might be the assumption that Homo sapiens emerged in Indonesian jungles, but the text says Homo erectus in Africa gave rise to Homo sapiens. The article says that the previous view might have thought that only modern humans could adapt to deserts, but the study shows erectus did. The question is about an erroneous conclusion the article suggests. The text says "many researchers suspect, they [Homo erectus] gave rise to our own species in the past several hundred thousand years before disappearing there as well." The erroneous conclusion might be that Homo erectus' extinction in Africa allowed Homo sapiens to emerge there, but the article says that erectus may have given rise to sapiens. Alternatively, the question might refer to the assumption that extreme environments were off-limits before Homo sapiens, which the study refutes. The article says "a million years ago... Homo erectus thrived in a harsh desert landscape once considered off limits before Homo sapiens came along." The erroneous conclusion was that such environments were only habitable after Homo sapiens, so the answer is that the erroneous conclusion was that such deserts were off-limits until Homo sapiens arrived. But the question says "the relationship between Homo erectus' extinction in Africa and the emergence of Homo sapiens in the Indonesian jungles." Wait, the article says that in Africa, erectus might have given rise to sapiens, but in Indonesia, erectus became extinct 100k years ago. The article doesn't mention Homo sapiens in Indonesian jungles, but orangutans are there. The erroneous conclusion might be that erectus in Africa went extinct before sapiens emerged there, but the text says they may have given rise to sapiens. So the erroneous conclusion is the assumption that Homo erectus in Africa went extinct before Homo sapiens emerged there, but the article suggests that erectus might have given rise to sapiens. Wait, the article says "many researchers suspect, they [Homo erectus] gave rise to our own species in the past several hundred thousand years before disappearing there as well." So the erroneous conclusion might be the opposite: that erectus didn't contribute to sapiens. But the article doesn't state an erroneous conclusion about their extinction in Africa and emergence in Indonesia. The question is a bit confusing. Alternatively, the article mentions that the previous narrative considered extreme environments off-limits until Homo sapiens, which the study refutes. The erroneous conclusion related to the question's wording might be that Homo erectus in Africa became extinct only after Homo sapiens emerged, but the article says they might have given rise to sapiens and then disappeared. The answer might be "N/A" because the article doesn't mention an erroneous conclusion about their extinction in Africa and emergence in Indonesian jungles. Wait, the question says "the erroneous conclusion about the relationship between Homo erectus' extinction in Africa and the emergence of Homo sapiens in the Indonesian jungles?" The article doesn't discuss Homo sapiens in Indonesia's jungles. Orangutans are in Indonesia, not sapiens. The article states that in Africa, erectus may have given rise to sapiens. The erroneous conclusion might be that erectus in Africa went extinct before sapiens emerged there, but the article says the opposite. Alternatively, maybe the article points out an error in thinking that erectus couldn't survive in deserts until sapiens, but the question's specifics about extinction in Africa and emergence in Indonesia aren't addressed. Since the article doesn't mention an erroneous conclusion about their extinction in Africa leading to sapiens in Indonesian jungles, the answer is N/A.
