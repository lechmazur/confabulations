Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each exactly as per the instructions. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **First question**: The user is asking about the critical reception of "Cabinet of Horrors" and how it was similar to the inspiration from Yale's men's room graffiti. The article mentions that a reviewer compared her work to a "nuclear assault". So the answer should be "nuclear assault".

2. **Second question**: The medium for "First National Dick" similar to "Three Panel Vertical". The article says "Three Panel Vertical" is charcoal-on-paper. "First National Dick" (1969) is described as mixed-media, but the question asks for a medium reminiscent of the charcoal piece. Wait, the question says "similar to the 'Three Panel Vertical'", which uses charcoal. The answer might be charcoal, but the question specifies "artistic medium reminiscent of the 'Three Panel Vertical' piece". Since "First National Dick" is mixed-media but the charcoal was used in "Three Panel Vertical", maybe the answer is charcoal? Wait, the article says "First National Dick" is a mixed-media piece. Hmm, but the question is about the medium. The article says "charcoal-drawn screws" for her early works, so "First National Dick" might also use charcoal. The answer is charcoal?

Wait the article says "First National Dick" is a "mixed-media piece". So maybe the answer is mixed-media? But the question says "reminiscent of the 'Three Panel Vertical' piece", which uses charcoal. The answer should be charcoal? Or mixed-media? Let me check again. The "Three Panel Vertical" is charcoal-on-paper. The "First National Dick" is mixed-media. So perhaps the answer is charcoal? But the question is about the medium used in "First National Dick", so mixed-media. Wait the question says "similar to the 'Three Panel Vertical'", which uses charcoal. Hmm, maybe the answer is charcoal. Wait the question says "artistic medium, reminiscent of the 'Three Panel Vertical' piece", so maybe the answer is charcoal. Alternatively, since "First National Dick" is mixed-media, but the question is about the medium that's reminiscent of the other piece, which uses charcoal. Hmm, perhaps the answer is charcoal. Wait the article says "First National Dick" (1969) is a sardonic salute to Nixon, and it's a mixed-media piece. The "Three Panel Vertical" is charcoal-on-paper. The question is asking for the medium of "First National Dick" that is reminiscent of the "Three Panel Vertical's" medium. Since "Three Panel Vertical" uses charcoal, but "First National Dick" is mixed-media, maybe the answer is mixed-media. Wait, but the question is asking for the medium used in "First National Dick", so the answer is mixed-media. But the question also mentions "similar to the Three Panel Vertical piece", so maybe it's charcoal? I'm confused. Wait the article says "First National Dick" is mixed-media, so the answer is mixed-media. The question says "similar to the Three Panel Vertical piece", but the medium is charcoal there, so perhaps the answer is charcoal? But the article says "First National Dick" is mixed-media. Hmm. Maybe I need to check again. The article says "First National Dick" is a "mixed-media piece". So the answer is mixed-media. The other part of the question says "satirized a political figure in a manner similar to her later work 'Seal of Disbelief'". The "Seal of Disbelief" is a presidential seal with altered text. The "First National Dick" satirizes Nixon, similar to how "Seal of Disbelief" satirizes Trump. The question is about the medium, so the answer is mixed-media. But the question says "reminiscent of the 'Three Panel Vertical' piece", which is charcoal. Maybe the answer is charcoal? Wait, the question is about the medium of "First National Dick", so the answer is mixed-media. I'll go with mixed-media.

3. **Third question**: Material in "Cabinet of Horrors" piggy banks and "Horizontal". The article says "Cabinet of Horrors" had a collection of vintage piggy banks. "Horizontal" (1973) was made with charcoal? The article says "large-scale charcoal-drawn screws". The institution that acquired "Horizontal" is the Met. The question asks for the material similar to the piggy banks. The piggy banks are vintage, so maybe the material is piggy banks themselves? Wait the question says "material similar to that used in the piggy banks featured in 'Cabinet of Horrors'". The material would be, like, the material of the piggy banks? The article doesn't specify the material of the piggy banks, but "Horizontal" is charcoal. Wait the question says "material" used in "Horizontal" which was acquired by the same institution as Thomas Schutte's retrospective. The Met acquired "Horizontal", and Schutte had a retrospective at MoMA, but the question might be referring to the same institution. Wait the question says "the same institution that hosted Thomas Schutte's retrospective" which is MoMA. But the Met acquired "Horizontal". Hmm, maybe the question is mixing up. The answer for "Horizontal" is charcoal, so the material is charcoal? The piggy banks are objects, but the material in "Horizontal" is charcoal. So the answer is charcoal?

Wait the question is asking for the material in "Horizontal" similar to the piggy banks (which are objects, but maybe their material isn't specified). Since the article doesn't mention the material of the piggy banks beyond them being "vintage piggy banks", maybe the answer is N/A? Wait the question is: "What material, similar to that used in the piggy banks featured in 'Cabinet of Horrors', did Bernstein employ in her piece 'Horizontal'...?" Since the piggy banks are made of some material like ceramic or metal, but the article doesn't specify, so the answer can't be inferred. However, "Horizontal" is a charcoal drawing. So maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, if the question is about the material of "Horizontal", which is charcoal, and the piggy banks are objects, perhaps the answer is N/A. Hmm, tricky. Maybe the answer is N/A.

Wait the question says "similar to that used in the piggy banks". Since the piggy banks are objects, their material isn't specified. The article says "vintage piggy banks" but not their material. So can't answer that part. Therefore, the answer for "Horizontal" is charcoal, but since the question is about similarity to piggy banks material, which isn't specified, so N/A.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is piggy banks? No. The material of "Horizontal" is charcoal. The question is looking for a material similar to the piggy banks' material, but since that's unknown, answer is N/A.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me move on and come back.

4. **Fourth question**: Phrase altered in "Seal of Disbelief" and incorporated at A.I.R. The "Seal of Disbelief" has "In Evil We Trust" instead of "In God We Trust". The question is about a phrase altered similarly at A.I.R. The article says she was part of A.I.R. (feminist gallery) but her work was alienated there. The answer might be "In Evil We Trust", but the question is about the phrase used at A.I.R. The article doesn't mention a specific phrase at A.I.R. However, the New Museum show's title is "HARD", and maybe the altered phrase was something else. Alternatively, the question might be referring to her signature. Wait the article says "her framed 1995 charcoal-drawn signature is also emblazoned in huge letters on the gallery's glass front". But that's Kasmin. Wait the question says "to express the same sentiment as the title of her New Museum show 'HARD'". The New Museum's show title is "HARD", so the phrase at A.I.R. that's similar in sentiment (maybe bold or confrontational) could be her signature? But the question says "phrase altered in a similar way to the text in 'Seal of Disbelief'". The seal altered "In Evil We Trust" from "In God We Trust". So maybe the A.I.R. piece had a similar altered phrase. The article mentions her work at A.I.R. included screws, but the text in "Seal of Disbelief" is an altered motto. The article doesn't mention any other altered phrases at A.I.R. So maybe N/A?

Wait the question says "incorporated into her work at A.I.R., the feminist gallery she co-founded, to express the same sentiment as the title of her New Museum show". The New Museum's show was "HARD", so the phrase might be "HARD", but she used it in the New Museum, not A.I.R. Alternatively, maybe her signature, which is bold, but that's not a phrase. Hmm, maybe N/A. Alternatively, the answer is "In Evil We Trust", but that's from the Seal piece. The question is about the A.I.R. work. Since there's no info, answer is N/A.

5. **Fifth question**: City where Bernstein created Death Heads, similar to Anne Frank's environment and Lorna Simpson's cosmic show. The article says she created Death Heads in her studio in Manhattan, NYC. Anne Frank's Secret Annex is in Amsterdam, but the question says a city similar to that environment (tumultuous upbringing). The article says Bernstein was born in Newark, NJ, and raised there with a lot of screaming at dinner. The question asks the city where she created Death Heads. The answer is New York City (Manhattan). The other part of the question mentions Lorna Simpson's show at Hauser & Wirth in Chelsea, which is NYC. So the answer is New York City.

6. **Sixth question**: Artistic technique for exuberant energy in Death Heads and Techne. The article says Death Heads "burst with exuberant energy" and Techne are digital installations at BAM. The technique might be neon palette, as mentioned in the Death Heads description. The article says Death Heads use "neon palette". Techne uses digital installations. The technique common is "neon palette" or "loopy, liberating lines". The question asks for the technique used by both. The article says Techne is digital, so maybe "digital installations" but that's the venue's medium. The Death Heads use neon. Since the question is about technique, maybe "neon palette" or "digital installations" but they are different. Wait the question says "technique employed by Bernstein in her Death Head series and also evident in the digital installations at BAM's Techne". Since Techne is digital, maybe the technique is not shared. The article says Death Heads have "neon palette" and "loopy, liberating lines". The Techne installations are digital, so maybe "digital" is not Bernstein's technique. The answer might be "neon palette" but Techne's technique isn't mentioned. Alternatively, the article says Death Heads "burst with exuberant energy" and Techne's installations are digital, but the technique might be "digital" but that's not Bernstein's. Hmm, perhaps the answer is "neon palette" but the question's second part refers to Techne's technique. Since the question is about Bernstein's technique, the answer is neon palette. The Techne part is a distractor. The question is asking what technique Bernstein used that's also evident in Techne. Since Techne's installations are digital, but Bernstein's is neon, maybe N/A. Alternatively, the article says Techne's installations are "digital", so the technique is digital? No, because Techne is another artist's work. The answer might be N/A. Alternatively, "exuberant energy" is the technique, but that's vague. Hmm, this is tricky. The article says Death Heads use "neon palette" and "loopy, liberating lines". The question says the technique is used in both. The Techne installations are digital, so unless "loopy lines" are also in Techne, but the article doesn't say. So perhaps the answer is N/A.

7. **Seventh question**: Specific element in "Money Shot" critiquing capitalism, mirroring vaginal imagery. The article says "Money Shot, Yellow" has the Capitol building (spelled Capital) as a slot machine with vaginal slot and penile handle. The element is the vaginal slot in the slot machine. The answer is "vaginal slot".

8. **Eighth question**: Venue similar to Center for Jewish History where she showed "Cabinet of Horrors". The Center for Jewish History hosted the Anne Frank Annex reconstruction. The "Cabinet of Horrors" was at the Drawing Center. The question asks what type of venue, similar to the Center (which is a museum/exhibition space), she used. The answer is "Drawing Center".

9. **Ninth question**: Color of the coat and used in black-lit "Money Shot". The coat is flaming red. The "Money Shot" pieces are black-lit but the color mentioned is yellow in "Money Shot, Yellow". The question says the color prominent in the coat and in the black-lit pieces. The coat is red, and "Money Shot, Yellow" uses yellow. But the question says "black-lit pieces" (which might have neon colors). The article says Death Heads use neon, but the Money Shot pieces are in black light. The color in the coat is red, which is also in "Money Shot, Yellow" (the name has yellow). The question asks for the color used in both the coat and the black-lit pieces. Since the coat is red and the black-lit pieces have yellow (as in "Money Shot, Yellow"), maybe the answer is yellow? Or the coat is red, and the black-lit pieces might use neon colors, but the article says "neon palette" for Death Heads. Wait the question says "prominent in the flaming red coat and also featured in a piece critiquing capitalism, was used in the black-lit pieces of 'Money Shot'". The red coat and the "Money Shot, Yellow" has yellow. But the black-lit pieces might have yellow. The article says "black-lit pieces that didn't stint on biting humor" in 2018 Kasmin show. The color in the coat is red, but the black-lit pieces might have neon colors like yellow. Since the question asks for the color used in both the coat and the black-lit pieces, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, but the coat is red, and the "Money Shot, Yellow" has yellow. The question says "the same gallery as Lorna Simpson's cosmic exhibition" which is Kasmin. The Kasmin show had "Money Shot" with black-lit pieces. The coat is red, but the pieces in Kasmin's "Money Shot" include "Money Shot, Yellow". The color yellow is in that piece. The question says "color prominent in the flaming red coat and also featured in a piece critiquing capitalism". The coat's color is red, but the piece's color is yellow. So maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is yellow? Because the coat is red, but the question says "the same color" used in both? Not sure. Hmm.

Wait the question says "what color... was used in the black-lit pieces of 'Money Shot' shown at the same gallery as Lorna Simpson's cosmic exhibition?" The coat's color is red. The "Money Shot" pieces at Kasmin (same as Lorna Simpson's show at Hauser & Wirth? Wait the article says Lorna's show is at Hauser & Wirth, so maybe the same gallery is Kasmin? Wait the question says "same gallery as Lorna Simpson's cosmic exhibition", which is Hauser & Wirth. But "Money Shot" was at Kasmin. Wait the article says "Money Shot" was a 2018 Kasmin show. Lorna Simpson's is at Hauser & Wirth. So maybe the question is wrong, but according to the article, the answer for "Money Shot" at Kasmin has pieces with yellow (Money Shot, Yellow). The coat is red. The question is asking for the color used in both the coat and the black-lit pieces. Since they are different, perhaps N/A. Alternatively, the color in the black-lit pieces is neon, but the coat is red. Hmm. The answer might be yellow because the piece's name includes it, but the coat is red. So maybe N/A.

Wait the question says "the color prominent in the flaming red coat and also featured in a piece critiquing capitalism, was used in the black-lit pieces of 'Money Shot' shown at the same gallery..." So the coat is red, the piece critiquing capitalism (Money Shot, Yellow) has yellow. The black-lit pieces might have yellow. So the color in question is yellow? The coat's color is red, but the piece has yellow, so maybe the answer is yellow, even though the coat is red. The question might be asking for the color used in the black-lit pieces, which includes yellow. The coat's color is separate. The question might be phrased to combine both. Maybe the answer is yellow because the black-lit pieces include it. The coat's red is separate. The question says "the color prominent in the flaming red coat and also featured in a piece... was used in the black-lit pieces". So the color must be present in both the coat and the black-lit pieces. Since the coat is red and the black-lit pieces have yellow, there's no overlap. Thus N/A.

10. **Tenth question**: Governmental structure depicted in "Money Shot, Yellow" similar to altered presidential seal. The piece has the Capitol building (spelled Capital) as a slot machine. The altered presidential seal in "Seal of Disbelief" is the presidential seal with "In Evil We Trust". The governmental structure here is the Capitol. So the answer is Capitol.

11. **Eleventh question**: Museum that acquired "Horizontal" in 2023 after censoring it in 1974. The article says the Met acquired it in 2023. The 1974 censorship was at the Philadelphia Civic Center Museum. The answer is Metropolitan Museum of Art.

12. **Twelfth question**: Material for Death Heads, given earlier works used charcoal. The article says Death Heads are "wordless" and use "neon palette", but the material isn't specified. Earlier works used charcoal, but Death Heads are "Death Head paintings" which could be painted. The article doesn't specify the medium, so N/A.

13. **Thirteenth question**: Political figure inspiring "Cabinet of Horrors" and "Seal of Disbelief". Both were inspired by Trump, as mentioned in the article. The answer is Donald Trump.

14. **Fourteenth question**: Symbolic motif in "Money Shot" merging capitalist critique with anatomy. The article says "vaginal slot and a penile handle" in "Money Shot, Yellow". The recurring motif is "vagina dentata" as per the article's mention of "repeated images of fanged vagina dentata". So the answer is vagina dentata.

15. **Fifteenth question**: Institution's 2012 retrospective that brought her back after 30 years. The New Museum had her show "HARD" in 2012. So the answer is New Museum.

16. **Sixteenth question**: How upbringing with a bookkeeper mother influences textual elements. The article says her home was filled with screaming, leading her to need to express herself vocally, translating to her art's textual messages. But the question is about her mother's job (bookkeeper) influencing textual elements. The article doesn't directly link her mother's job to text. The answer is N/A.

17. **Seventeenth question**: Medium for 1995 framed signature at Kasmin. The article says "framed 1995 charcoal-drawn signature". So the answer is charcoal.

18. **Eighteenth question**: Which artist compared her work to "nuclear assault". The article says "one reviewer compared Bernstein's in-your-face artful attack to a 'nuclear assault'". The artist mentioned in the article is Joan Semmel, but the reviewer isn't named. The question asks which artist mentioned in the article did this. The only other artist mentioned is Joan Semmel, but she didn't write the review. The answer is N/A because the reviewer isn't named among the mentioned artists (like Thomas Schutte, Lorna Simpson, etc.). The question specifies "which artist mentioned in the article", so N/A.

19. **Nineteenth question**: Event prompting Death Heads: the article says she started them during "Covid time". So the answer is the pandemic or Covid-19.

20. **Twentieth question**: Gallery with Anne Frank's Annex and her retrospective. The article mentions the Center for Jewish History hosted the Anne Frank exhibit alongside her "Public Fears". The answer is Center for Jewish History. Wait the question says "which gallery's 2024 exhibition included a reconstruction of Anne Frank’s Secret Annex alongside Bernstein’s 'Public Fears'". The article says "an exhibition at the Center for Jewish History reconstructs the Frank family's hiding place during the devastation of the Holocaust. A.I. Art at BAM... The Acid Comedy of Thomas Schutte... A Turn to the Cosmos... Looking for More Art? Here are the gallery shows not to miss in January." The "Public Fears" is at Kasmin. The Anne Frank exhibit is at the Center for Jewish History, not a gallery. The question asks for a gallery, so maybe N/A. But the article says the Center for Jewish History is hosting it, so if the question considers it a gallery, then Center for Jewish History. But the question says "gallery", so maybe N/A. Wait the article says "the Center for Jewish History reconstructs the Frank family's hiding place". The answer might be N/A because it's a Center, not a gallery. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the Center for Jewish History even if it's not a gallery. The question might have a mistake, but based on the article, the answer is Center for Jewish History.
