Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by going through each question and check the article for answers.

1. **Portuguese folk songs taught by Rogerio to his son**: The article mentions that Rodrigues's father, Rogerio, hummed songs from a mysterious "Teresa," but there's no specific folk song names listed. So, answer N/A.

2. **Number of performances at Theatre de la Colline before NTGent**: The article says the play premiered at NTGent and mentions a European tour, but no info on prior performances elsewhere. N/A.

3. **Significance of Teresa's character in the article**: The article mentions Teresa as the source of the songs Rogerio hummed, but the actual significance to the article's title isn't specified. N/A.

4. **Scene from "By Heart" reimagined in the hospital**: The article only states "By Heart" pays tribute to his grandmother by teaching a poem. No specific scene mentioned as reimagined here. N/A.

5. **Black pen incident's role in their relationship**: The father berates the son for forgetting a black pen, showing their strained relationship. The article says this indicates Rogerio's exacting nature. So the answer is the black pen incident highlighted his exacting nature, showing deterioration.

6. **Nurse's influence on transforming scribbles into dialogue**: The nurse explains the play is an imagined version of the article, so she introduced the fictional framework. Answer: She explained the play imagines the article's content.

7. **Duration of exile in France shaping music**: The article mentions Rogerio was in exile in France but doesn't specify duration. N/A.

8. **Jacques Brel song by the mother's ghost**: The article states she sings a song by Jacques Brel but doesn't name it. N/A.

9. **Role switches between Azevedo and Bras during opening**: The article says they "keep exchanging roles" but doesn't specify the number of times. N/A.

10. **Final legible entry in the notebook**: The title mentioned is "The Dead Don't Eat Yogurt," which inspired the play's title. So the answer is that title.

11. **Name for the father character during death scenes**: They are called Longbeard. The question asks during the grotesque death bursts, so yes, Longbeard.

12. **Term for the source of the father's songs**: The article says "Teresa" is the name given as the source. So Teresa.

13. **Installment number in NTGent's series**: The sixth installment in "History(ies) of Theater" series. So 6.

14. **Notebook title hinting at yogurt twist**: "The Dead Don't Eat Yogurt" is the title found in the notebook. The play's title is similar but adjusted.

15. **Element in Van den Heuvel's sets symbolizing breakdown**: The sets look like layers of cracked earth. So cracked earth.

16. **Indispensable object the father insists on**: The black pen he was given. The son was chided for not bringing it.

17. **Dramatic effect for death scenes**: Sudden bursts of stage smoke.

18. **Item the nurse distributes for gender-bending**: Fake beards.

19. **Languages used in the play**: Portuguese and Flemish.

20. **Instrument providing melancholy soundtrack**: Guitar, played by Helder Goncalves from a hospital bed.

Wait, let me check each again to be sure.

For question 14, the notebook's title is explicitly stated as "The Dead Don't Eat Yogurt," so that's correct.

Question 15: The sets are described as "layers of cracked earth," so that's the element.

Yes, I think that's all. Now, format each answer properly without markdown.
