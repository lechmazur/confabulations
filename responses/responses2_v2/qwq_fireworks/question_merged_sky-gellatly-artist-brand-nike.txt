Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and answer exactly what's asked without adding any extra details.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks about the type of art Gellatly curated for the LVMH sneaker-in-residence exhibition that reminds him of his childhood home. The article mentions his upbringing with Shaker furniture, Noguchi lamps, and a Keith Haring print. But the LVMH exhibition isn't directly linked to those items. Wait, the article says he curated the LVMH sneaker-in-residence exhibition. However, the part about his childhood art includes Noguchi, which is mentioned in the context of his home. The Noguchi lamp is part of his upbringing, but the exhibition's specific art isn't detailed beyond that. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says he curated the LVMH exhibition but doesn't specify the art style. The question ties it to his childhood home's art. Since Noguchi is mentioned in his home, maybe that's the link. But the question is about the exhibition's curation. The article doesn't explicitly state that he used Noguchi-style art there. So perhaps N/A?

Wait, the article states he curated the LVMH sneaker-in-residence exhibition, but the type of art isn't specified. The question connects it to his childhood home's art (Shaker, Noguchi, Keith Haring). Since there's no direct mention of those in the exhibition, the answer might be N/A. Wait, but the article says "the artist Nina Chanel Abney" in the Air Jordan collaboration, but that's a different project. Maybe I missed something. Let me recheck. The LVMH sneaker exhibition is mentioned, but the art style isn't specified. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Gellatly's role in securing Futura's Mets collaboration. The article says he "produced artist collaborations with... the New York Mets" and mentions the baseball hat and Bobblehead. His role as the one who facilitated this, given his behind-the-scenes approach. The question asks for his specific role, which is producing the collaborations. The answer is "produced" or "producer"? The text says "producing artist collaborations with the New York Mets".

3. **Question 3**: The "Just Like Heaven" show with Jacobs. The article says it highlights Jacobs's collaborators like Sofia Coppola, etc. The merging of cultural spheres could be the blend of art and fashion, but the question refers to the integration seen at Complex magazine. The article mentions that his background in editorial (Complex, MTV, etc.) influenced his view of high culture and digital coexistence. The show might use a mix of media or collaborations that bridge art and fashion, like the MoMA Design store and Air Jordan. Wait, the "Just Like Heaven" group show is at Control gallery, featuring Jacobs's collaborators. The element that exemplifies merging could be the inclusion of both art and fashion figures, or perhaps the curation itself. The article doesn't explicitly state the element, so maybe N/A? Wait, the article says the show highlights Jacobs's collaborators, which are artists and high-wattage people. The merging might be the combination of art and fashion, but the question asks for a specific element. The article doesn't specify, so perhaps N/A? Wait, the article says "conceptualized with Jacobs to highlight... their high-wattage collaborators." Maybe the integration is the group show itself combining art and fashion. Alternatively, since the question mentions the integration similar to Complex, which was editorial and marketing, maybe the show uses both media. Hmm, not sure. Maybe N/A.

Wait, the article says "the 'Just Like Heaven' group show... at Control, the Los Angeles gallery of which Gellatly is a partner." The merging could be the collaboration between art and fashion through the show's content. Since the question asks for an element, maybe the inclusion of both art and fashion figures. The article doesn't specify a particular element like a digital component, so perhaps N/A. Alternatively, maybe the collaboration between MoMA and Nike socks is another example, but that's a different project. Hmm. Maybe the answer is N/A here.

4. **Question 4**: Percentage of earnings from Nina Chanel Abney's Air Jordan collection that would traditionally go to a gallery. The article states that galleries traditionally take "half of what the artist earns." So 50%. The question is about Nina's earnings, but the article doesn't mention her specific case, but the general gallery practice is 50%, so the answer is 50%. 

5. **Question 5**: The art fair where he appeared for the FL-001 Mini Pointman. The article says he was at Miami Art Basel last month for the Futura's sculpture. The event was at the Art Basel Gift shop in Miami. So the answer is Art Basel.

6. **Question 6**: The Japanese artist with a studio like Disney's. The article mentions Takashi Murakami's studio in Japan compared to Disney. So the answer is Takashi Murakami.

7. **Question 7**: The designer's studio shown on Oprah. The article says Marc Jacobs's studio was on Oprah, which influenced him. So Marc Jacobs.

8. **Question 8**: The wearable item from the museum and sports brand. The article mentions Nike socks with MoMA and Nike logos. So the answer is Nike socks with MoMA logo.

9. **Question 9**: The athletic brand involved in the 2026 World Cup projects. The article says Nike is collaborating on projects centered around the 2026 World Cup. So Nike.

10. **Question 10**: The magazine his mom subscribed to. The article says Interview magazine. So Interview.

11. **Question 11**: The percentage flowing to galleries. The article states "Half of what the artist earns goes back to the gallery." So 50%.

12. **Question 12**: The media form coexisting with high culture. The article says digital media coexisted with print. So digital media.

13. **Question 13**: The sport for the artist's fan collaboration. Futura is a lifelong Mets fan, so baseball.

14. **Question 14**: Total employees in NY and LA. The article says 20 in NY and 20 in LA, total 40.

Wait, let me check each again:

1. The question asks for the type of art he curated for LVMH that's reminiscent of his childhood. The article says he curated the LVMH sneaker exhibition, but the art type isn't specified. His childhood had Noguchi, Shaker, etc., but the exhibition's art isn't linked. So N/A.

2. His role in securing Futura's Mets collab is "producing artist collaborations" as per the article. So "producing".

3. The element of "Just Like Heaven" that shows merging of cultural spheres. The article says the show highlights Jacobs's collaborators (artists, filmmakers, etc.), which merges art and fashion. The merging might be the collaboration between different fields. But the question refers to the integration similar to Complex's editorial and marketing. Since the article says he saw high culture and digital media coexisting, maybe the show uses digital elements. However, the article doesn't specify, so N/A?

Wait, the question says "best exemplifies this merging of cultural spheres, similar to the integration seen at Complex magazine?" Since Complex was part of his editorial background where he saw high culture and digital coexist, the show's approach might be similar. The article says the show is a group show with Jacobs's collaborators, which combines art and fashion. The merging could be the blend of art and fashion, so the answer is the group show itself, but the question asks for an element. Since the article doesn't specify, maybe N/A. Alternatively, the collaboration with MoMA and Nike socks is another example, but that's a different project. Hmm, maybe N/A here.

4. 50% is correct as per the article's statement.

5. Art Basel Miami.

6. Takashi Murakami.

7. Marc Jacobs.

8. Nike socks with MoMA logo.

9. Nike.

10. Interview.

11. 50%.

12. Digital media.

13. Baseball (Mets are baseball).

14. 40 (20+20).

So the answers are as above. Let me confirm each again quickly:

1. N/A (since LVMH exhibition's art isn't specified as being like his childhood home's art)

2. Produced

3. N/A (no specific element mentioned)

4. 50%

5. Art Basel

7. Marc Jacobs

8. Nike socks with MoMA logo

9. Nike

10. Interview
