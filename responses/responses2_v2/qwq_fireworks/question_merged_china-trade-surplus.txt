Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. 

1. **Question 1:** Eric Poses uses suppliers in Shanghai for board games and electronics. The article mentions that countries are worried about factory closings in manufacturing sectors due to Chinese competition. The specific sector that would benefit if he shifted production to the US would be manufacturing, but the question asks for a sector experiencing job losses. The text says "factories" are closing in sectors that can't compete with China. Since his products are board games and electronics, the relevant sector would be manufacturing, but looking for a more specific term. The article mentions "factory goods have slowed sharply" and "middle class has lost savings", but the exact sector is manufacturing. Maybe the electronics part? The article says the US doesn't even manufacture many electronics needed for the games. So the sector would be electronics manufacturing? Or just manufacturing in general? The question specifies a sector mentioned as having job losses due to Chinese competition. The article states governments are worried about "factory closings and job losses in manufacturing sectors". The specific sectors like cars, solar panels, etc., but the question wants the sector that would benefit if he moves production. Since he uses electronics suppliers, maybe electronics manufacturing? Or just manufacturing? The answer might be "manufacturing" but the question might expect a more specific sector. Wait, the article says "factories" in general, so maybe "manufacturing".

2. **Question 2:** The question is about the percentage of China's economy that its trade surplus in manufactured goods represented in the year Donald J. Trump was elected. Trump was elected in 2016. The article mentions "in the year Donald J. Trump was elected President" but the data given is about 2024. Wait, the article says "By comparison, U.S. reliance on trade surpluses in manufactured goods peaked at 6 percent of American output early in World War I..." but the question is about China's trade surplus in manufactured goods as a percentage of its economy in the year Trump was elected (2016). The article doesn't provide data for 2016. The only specific percentage given for China's surplus in manufactured goods is 10% of the economy in 2024. The question asks for the year Trump was elected, so 2016, but the article doesn't mention that year's data. So the answer would be N/A.

Wait, but the question might be referring to a different time. Wait, the article says "China's trade surplus in manufactured goods represented 10 percent of China's economy. By comparison, U.S. reliance on trade surpluses in manufactured goods peaked at 6 percent of American output early in World War I..." So the 10% is in 2024. The question is asking in the year Trump was elected (2016), but there's no data for that year. So answer N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The question is which country's post-WWII surplus, when adjusted, is now surpassed by China's but previously held the record at $130B today's dollars. The article states: "The U.S. postwar trade surplus peaked at $12 billion in 1947, which works out to about $130 billion in today's dollars." So the country is the US.

4. **Question 4:** The article says "The widening of China's trade surplus accounted for up to half the entire country's economic growth last year. Investment in new factories for exports represented much of the rest of the growth." So the combination of surplus and investments would be half plus the "rest", but the question asks for the percentage directly attributed to the combination. The surplus itself was up to half, and the investments were "much of the rest". The exact number isn't given for the total combination. The question might be asking for the surplus's contribution alone (half), but the question says combination. Since the surplus was half and the rest from investment (which is part of the same export-oriented strategy), maybe the total is more than half but the exact number isn't stated. Wait, the question says "directly attributed to the combination of its trade surplus and investments...", so the surplus is half, and the investment part is "much of the rest". The total would be the sum. Since the surplus is up to half, and the rest (investment) is the other part, but the exact percentage isn't given. Wait, the article says "the widening... accounted for up to half... Investment... represented much of the rest of the growth." So the total would be half plus "much of the rest". Since "much of the rest" implies more than the remaining half, but the exact figure isn't given. However, the question is about the combination, so maybe 50% (from surplus) plus the investment part. But the exact percentage isn't stated, so maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "directly attributed to the combination of its trade surplus and investments..." The surplus was up to half, and the investments were part of the rest. The total could be the sum, but the article doesn't state the total. Since the surplus alone was up to half, the answer might be "up to half" but the question asks for a percentage. The answer is N/A because the exact percentage of the combination isn't given. Wait, no, the article says "the widening... accounted for up to half... Investment... much of the rest". So the total growth was 5% (as per the report), but the question is about the percentage attributed to surplus + investment. The surplus was half (so 50% of growth) and investment was much of the rest. The total would be more than half but not the entire 5% (since the rest could be other factors). Since the question asks for the percentage directly from the two, but the exact number isn't given, so N/A? Or maybe the answer is 50% plus the investment part. But the article doesn't specify the exact total. So probably N/A.

Wait, the article says "the widening of China's trade surplus accounted for up to half the entire country's economic growth last year. Investment in new factories for exports represented much of the rest of the growth." So "much of the rest" implies that investment plus surplus is more than half but not 100%. The exact percentage isn't given. Since the question asks for the percentage directly attributed to the combination, the surplus was up to half, and investment is the rest. So total would be 100%? No, because "much of the rest" implies that there might be other factors. The question is tricky. Since the surplus is half, and investment is "much of the rest", the total could be 75% or more. But the article doesn't specify, so the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "directly attributed to the combination of its trade surplus and investments in new export-oriented factories". The surplus is up to half, and the investment is "much of the rest", so the total would be half plus "much of the rest". Since "much of the rest" is not quantified, but the question wants the exact percentage, which isn't provided. So answer N/A? Or maybe the question is looking for the surplus's contribution alone (50%), but the question includes investments. Hmm. The article says "the widening... accounted for up to half... Investment... represented much of the rest of the growth." So the total of both would be the surplus (up to half) plus the investment (the rest). But the rest of the growth is not fully attributed to investment. Wait, the investment is part of the rest. So the total contribution would be half plus the investment part. Since the article doesn't state the exact percentage of the investment's contribution, but the question combines both, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "up to half" but that's only the surplus. The question requires the combination, so the exact figure isn't given. Therefore, N/A.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 50% because the surplus was up to half, and the investments were part of the remaining, but the question asks for the combination. Since the surplus itself is half, and the investment is part of the rest, the total would be more than half but the exact number isn't stated. So the answer is N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Two middle-income countries that implemented tariffs against Chinese exports due to fears of deindustrialization, not mentioned in the same context as EU or US. The article says: "The backlash to China's trade imbalance has come from industrialized and developing countries alike. Governments are worried about factory closings and job losses in manufacturing sectors that cannot compete with low prices from China. The European Union and the United States raised tariffs last year on cars from China. But some of the broadest barriers to China's exports have been put up by less affluent countries with middle-income manufacturing sectors, like Brazil, Turkey, India and Indonesia." So the countries are Brazil, Turkey, India, Indonesia. The question asks for two of them not mentioned with EU or US. The EU and US are mentioned, so the other two are among Brazil, Turkey, India, Indonesia. The answer needs two, so pick any two. The question says "two middle-income countries", so possible answers could be Brazil and Turkey, India and Indonesia, etc. The answer should list two, like Brazil and India.

6. **Question 6:** The total value of net lending by Chinese state-owned banks to industrial sectors in 2020. The article states: "The banks' net lending to industry was $83 billion in 2019, before the pandemic. That increased to $670 billion by 2023, although the pace slowed somewhat in the first nine months of last year." The question is about 2020. Since the data jumps from 2019 to 2023, there's no info for 2020. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The U.S. government agency cited for documenting America's trade surpluses from 1870-1970. The article says: "The United States ran persistent trade surpluses from 1870 to 1970, according to researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis." So the answer is Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

8. **Question 8:** The percentage of global manufactured goods China accounted for in 2024. The article states: "China now produces about a third of the world's manufactured goods..." So the answer is one-third, which is 33.3%.

9. **Question 9:** The policy unrelated to "Made in China 2025" that enabled China's transition to car exporter. The article says: "China has pursued national self-reliance over the last two decades, most notably through its Made in China 2025 policy... China has gone from importing cars to becoming the world's largest car exporter, surpassing Japan..." Wait, the policy mentioned is Made in China 2025. The question asks for a policy *unrelated* to that. Hmm. Wait, the article says "pursued national self-reliance over the last two decades, most notably through its Made in China 2025 policy". But the transition to car exporter is attributed to that policy? Or is there another policy? Wait, the question says "unrelated to Made in China 2025". Maybe the answer is N/A, but the article says Made in China 2025 is the main one. Wait, the article says "China has pursued national self-reliance over the last two decades, most notably through its Made in China 2025 policy". So the national self-reliance policy is the overarching one, but the specific policy mentioned is Made in China 2025. The question is looking for another policy. The article doesn't mention another policy, so the answer might be N/A. Wait, the question says "policy initiative... credited in the article with enabling the country's transition from car importer to world's largest car exporter". The article only mentions Made in China 2025 as part of the national self-reliance, so maybe the answer is Made in China 2025. But the question specifies "unrelated to", so maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, perhaps the national self-reliance policy is the one, but that's the same as the overarching approach including Made in China 2025. Hmm. The article says "Made in China 2025 policy, for which Beijing pledged $300 billion to promote advanced manufacturing". The transition to car exporter is part of that policy. Since the question asks for a policy *unrelated* to Made in China 2025, there's no other mentioned. So answer N/A. Wait, but maybe "national self-reliance" is the policy, but that's the broader approach. The article says "national self-reliance over the last two decades, most notably through its Made in China 2025 policy". So the national self-reliance is the overarching policy, and Made in China 2025 is part of it. The question might consider "national self-reliance" as the policy unrelated to Made in China 2025, but that's part of the same initiative. Alternatively, maybe there's another policy. The article doesn't mention another, so the answer must be N/A. Wait, the question says "credited in the article with enabling the country's transition from car importer to world's largest car exporter". The article says "China has pursued national self-reliance... most notably through its Made in China 2025 policy". So the transition is due to Made in China 2025. But the question asks for a policy unrelated to that. Since there is none mentioned, answer N/A.

Wait, maybe the policy is "national self-reliance" but that's the overarching approach. The question might accept that as the answer, but since it's part of the same initiative (the policy is part of the national self-reliance), but the question says "unrelated". Therefore, the answer is N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The exact month in 2023 when Chinese banks slowed lending. The article says: "the pace slowed somewhat in the first nine months of last year". The article was published in 2024, so "last year" is 2023. The first nine months end in September. The question asks for the exact month. The article only mentions the first nine months, not a specific month. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The U.S. state where the board game company is located. The article mentions Eric Poses' company as "a Miami Beach firm", so Florida.
