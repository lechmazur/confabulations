Okay, I need to tackle these questions based solely on the provided article. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then cross-referencing the article to find the answers. 

1. The first question asks which NFL team Allison visited during her NBC Sports tour. The article mentions she was in Kansas City, Mo.; Sao Paulo, Brazil; and Detroit. The teams in those cities are the Chiefs (Kansas City), but Sao Paulo isn't an NFL city. Wait, the article says "games in Kansas City, Mo.; Sao Paulo, Brazil; and Detroit." Sao Paulo might be an international game, but the teams there could be the Raiders or another team? Wait, the article says she was documenting NFL games in those locations. The Kansas City team is the Chiefs, Detroit's team is the Lions. But the question is about the team she visited. The article says she was with NBC Sports and crisscrossing continents. The answer might be the Kansas City Chiefs, but the question is about the team she visited, but the article doesn't explicitly state the team names, just the cities. Hmm, maybe the question is looking for the cities, but the question specifies the NFL team. Wait, the article says "games in Kansas City, Mo.; Sao Paulo, Brazil; and Detroit." The teams in those cities are the Chiefs, the game in Sao Paulo might be an international game (like the Chiefs vs someone?), but the article doesn't name the teams, just the cities. The question asks which NFL team she visited, but maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question might be referring to the teams in those cities. Let me check again. The article says she was documenting games in those locations. The teams there would be the Chiefs (Kansas City), the Lions (Detroit), and the game in Sao Paulo could be, for example, the Raiders (since they played there before?), but the article doesn't specify the team names. Since the question asks for the NFL team she visited, but the article only mentions the cities, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "during her private jet tour documenting stadium environments for NBC Sports". The article lists Kansas City, Sao Paulo, and Detroit. The NFL teams in those cities are the Chiefs, Lions, and the game in Sao Paulo might be a specific team's game, but the article doesn't name the team. So perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question might accept the cities as teams? Or maybe the first one is Kansas City Chiefs. Let me see if the article mentions the team names elsewhere. The article mentions the Las Vegas Raiders when Rochell was released. But the question is about the teams she visited. Since the article doesn't name the teams, just the cities, maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm.

2. The second question: How many TikTok followers did Isaac Rochell gain from his viral posts? The article says Isaac was active on social media, but the only follower count given is for Allison's 3 million. There's no info on Isaac's follower count or how much he gained. So N/A.

3. The third question: The name of the Chargers podcast episode where he proposed. The article says he proposed while recording a Chargers podcast in 2020, but doesn't mention the episode name. So N/A.

4. When did the NFL introduce the "Mr. Kuch" jersey? The article says the NFL sent Rochell a jersey with that nameplate, but no specific year is given. So N/A.

5. What interior design project did Allison complete for the Raiders before her husband's release? The article mentions she worked as an interior designer but doesn't specify a project for the Raiders. She sobbed when the Raiders released him, but no project mentioned. N/A.

6. What clothing item did Kristin Juszczyk design for Taylor Swift? The article says Kristin started a clothing line and designed outerwear for Swift and Biles. So the answer is outerwear.

7. Viewership increase for NBC Sports during her coverage. The article doesn't mention viewership numbers. N/A.

8. How many episodes of Netflix's series feature Keeta Hill? The article mentions the series includes Keeta Hill but doesn't state the number of episodes. N/A.

9. Voter registration metrics from the campaign with Obama. The article states they participated in a campaign but doesn't give specific metrics. N/A.

10. Which platform did Alix Earle use for her Fox Sports segment? The article says she's a TikTok influencer, but the Fox segment's platform isn't specified. The question asks which platform she used, but it's Fox Sports, which is a network, not a social media platform. Maybe the answer is N/A, since the question might expect a platform like TikTok, but the article just says Fox Sports recorded a segment. So N/A.

11. Who received the "Mr. Kuch" jersey? The article says the NFL sent Rochell a jersey with that nameplate. So Isaac Rochell.

12. The person who shared emotional distress over losing an NFL opportunity while pregnant and moving. The article mentions Kucharczyk sobbed when Rochell was released by the Raiders while she was pregnant. So Allison Kucharczyk.

13. Collaborated with NBC Sports and appeared on the red carpet at Super Bowl event. The article says Kucharczyk was a red-carpet correspondent last year. So her.

14. The defensive lineman with stints in Indy, Cleveland, Vegas, and shared pre-game buffets. Isaac Rochell, as per his career moves.

15. The influencer merging fashion and stories to shift NFL interest and has over 3M followers. That's Kucharczyk, since she has 3M and does that.

16. The 2017 Chargers draft pick compared to Travis Kelce/Taylor Swift. Isaac Rochell was drafted by Chargers in 2017.

17. Who did a voter reg campaign with Obama. The couple (Rochell and Kucharczyk) participated with Obama.

18. The player involved in marketing projects and social media, with team changes and international coverage. Isaac Rochell.
