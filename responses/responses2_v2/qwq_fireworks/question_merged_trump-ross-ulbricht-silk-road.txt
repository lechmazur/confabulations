Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by reading through the questions again and then check the article for each answer.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions the crypto industry spent over $100 million, but it doesn't specify which exchange platform provided the majority. So probably N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The article says Silk Road facilitated over 1.5 million transactions, but it doesn't specify how many Ross personally did. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The article mentions the Second Circuit affirmed the conviction but doesn't name the initial judge in 2014. N/A.

4. **Question 4**: The article doesn't mention the value of his Bitcoin holdings over time. N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Trump embraced the cause at a libertarian event and a Bitcoin conference in Nashville. The article doesn't say who first revealed it at Nashville. Wait, Elon Musk mentioned Ross on X after the election. But the question is about the Nashville conference. The article says Trump first spoke at a libertarian event and then at the Nashville Bitcoin conference. It doesn't name who first revealed the pardon there. Hmm, maybe N/A?

Wait, the article says "After the election, a message from Ulbricht posted on X said he had 'immense gratitude to everyone who voted for President Trump on my behalf.'" So maybe Elon Musk's post was after the election but not at the Nashville event. The article states that Musk responded to a post on X, writing "Ross will be freed too." But the question is about who first revealed it at the Nashville conference. The article says Trump embraced the cause at the Nashville conference. So the answer might be Trump? But the question is asking who "first revealed" the pardon at Nashville. The article says Trump embraced his cause there, so maybe the answer is Trump. But the question says "prominent tech entrepreneur", Elon Musk is a tech entrepreneur, but the article says Musk's post was after the election, not necessarily at the conference. The article mentions Trump spoke at the conference, so maybe the answer is N/A because the question specifies a tech entrepreneur, not Trump. Hmm, tricky. Let me check again. The question says "prominent tech entrepreneur first revealed Ulbricht's imminent pardon at the Nashville Bitcoin conference". The article states that Trump first spoke at a libertarian event and then at the Nashville Bitcoin conference. The article doesn't mention any tech entrepreneur revealing it there, so maybe N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The article says Silk Road was a drug marketplace, but doesn't specify the percentage of non-drug transactions. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The article mentions the FBI tracked him down but doesn't name the informant. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The crypto industry donated over $130 million to election candidates, but the question is about the "Free Ross" legal defense fund. The article doesn't mention the exact amount donated to the fund specifically. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The article doesn't state the monthly user growth rate. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The article says authorities seized the site's revenue but doesn't specify the percentage. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The article mentions a recording played at a Bitcoin conference in Miami in 2021. So the answer is Miami.

12. **Question 12**: The article mentions heroin and cocaine as explicitly sold, and at least six deaths were attributable to drugs bought on Silk Road. It doesn't specify which drug caused two of the deaths. So N/A.

13. **Question 13**: The article says the FBI tracked him, but no other agency mentioned during sentencing. The judge's comments didn't mention another agency. N/A.

14. **Question 14**: The father of one of the victims who spoke in court is mentioned, but his name isn't given. The article says "the father of one of the people who died said..." so no name provided. N/A.

15. **Question 15**: The article mentions Trump posted #FreeRossDayOne on Truth Social. Elon Musk used that hashtag? Wait, the article says Musk responded with "Ross will be freed too" on X, but the hashtag was from Trump. The question says "promoted by Elon Musk on X after Trump's election". The article says Musk posted on X, but the hashtag mentioned was Trump's. The question's answer would be #FreeRossDayOne, but the article states Trump used that hashtag, not Musk. So maybe N/A because Musk didn't use that hashtag. The article says Trump used the hashtag, so the answer is N/A.

Wait, let me check again. The article says: "He doubled down on social media, posting the hashtag #FreeRossDayOne on Truth Social, the site he owns." So the hashtag was from Trump, not Musk. The question asks which hashtag Elon Musk promoted. Since Musk didn't mention the hashtag, answer N/A.

16. **Question 16**: The article states "facilitating more than 1.5 million transactions" as reported by authorities. The question says "as reported by Bitcoin Magazine". The article says "according to authorities" so maybe Bitcoin Magazine didn't report that number. The article mentions Bitcoin Magazine in a quote from Pete Rizzo, but the 1.5M is from authorities. So N/A.

17. **Question 17**: The Second Circuit court acknowledged the life sentence was severe. The answer is the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.

18. **Question 18**: The article mentions an annual Bitcoin conference in Nashville where Trump embraced the cause. The name of the conference isn't given. So N/A.
