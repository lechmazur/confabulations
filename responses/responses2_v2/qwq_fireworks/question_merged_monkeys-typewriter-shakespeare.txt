Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not anything else.

1. **First question**: The Yale professor's computer program run duration before producing the text. The article mentions the Yale professor in 1979 managed to get "startlingly intelligible" text but doesn't specify how long the program ran. So, no info here. Answer: N/A.

2. **Second question**: The mathematical theorem Borel developed during the French Resistance that contradicts the infinite monkey theorem. The text says Borel introduced a law during the war called Borel's law, which states events with very small probabilities never occur. The theorem's name is Borel's Law. So answer: Borel's Law.

3. **Third question**: The water-usage researcher who first proposed resource constraints. The article mentions Jay Falletta, a water-usage researcher at UTS, discussed the idea with Woodcock during lunch. So answer: Jay Falletta.

4. **Fourth question**: Successful iterations before the Paignton Zoo computer got five pages of S. The article says the outcome was five pages primarily filled with S, but doesn't mention how many attempts or iterations were made. So N/A.

5. **Fifth question**: Probability for the first act of Hamlet. The article gives the chance for the first word ("To be...") as 1 in 900, but for the entire first act, there's no specific number. The example given is for "Curious George" (1 in 10^15000), but Hamlet's first act isn't mentioned. So N/A.

6. **Sixth question**: Programming language Jesse Anderson used. The article doesn't specify the language he used in 2011. Answer: N/A.

7. **Seventh question**: Average typing speed of chimps in Woodcock's model. The text doesn't mention their typing speed, only their lifespan (30 years). So N/A.

8. **Eighth question**: Number of generations needed for the first scene of A Midsummer Night's Dream. The article doesn't give specifics on scenes or generations required. Answer: N/A.

9. **Ninth question**: Temperature threshold due to entropy. The article talks about entropy causing heat to dissipate in 10^100 years but doesn't mention a specific temperature. So N/A.

10. **Tenth question**: Dawkins' evolutionary algorithm. In "The Blind Watchmaker," Dawkins discusses cumulative selection. The example given is the "weasel program" which uses cumulative selection. So answer: cumulative selection.

11. **Eleventh question**: How Dawkins' argument conflicts with Woodcock's assumptions. Dawkins mentions iterative/learning processes (like reinforcement training) are needed, which Woodcock's model might not account for since it requires editors for learning. The article states that without iterative training, progress is impossible, implying Woodcock's model might not include such mechanisms. So the conflict is that Dawkins requires iterative learning (editing) which Woodcock's paper's assumptions (maybe no learning?) don't allow. The exact answer from text: "Unless the typing were 'iterative,' though, Dr. Dawkins said in an interview, progress would be impossible." So the answer is iterative training or reinforcement training. Wait, the question asks for the algorithm's name. The article says Dawkins discusses "iterative" methods. The specific term in the book might be "cumulative selection," which is part of the evolutionary algorithm he proposed. The answer would be cumulative selection. But the question is about the algorithm's name. Since the question specifies "evolutionary algorithm," and Dawkins' example is the "weasel program" using cumulative selection, the answer is cumulative selection.
