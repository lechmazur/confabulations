Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by going through each question and cross-checking the article for answers.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions Talese misses Elaine's and George Plimpton. The question asks besides George Plimpton, who else? Wait, the article says "I miss George Plimpton. But really, this neighborhood hasn't changed..." So the only person named is George Plimpton. The answer should be N/A because the question asks for someone else besides him, but the text doesn't mention another person. Wait, the question says "who else did Talese say he missed from the New York literary scene, causing him to frequent P.J. Clarke's more often?" The text says he misses Elaine's and George Plimpton, but P.J. Clarke's is mentioned as still being open. The answer might be N/A since no other names are given except George Plimpton.

2. **Question 2**: The daughters thought he owned the Verrazzano Bridge. The article states: "My daughters Catherine and Pamela thought I owned that bridge." The prompt is what made them think he was responsible for the medical building? Wait, the medical building is next to his home, but the question is about the Verrazzano Bridge. The medical building isn't related. The answer here is N/A because the medical building isn't mentioned in that context. Wait, the question says "medical building" but the article mentions the medical building as where he lives next to, but the daughters' belief is about the bridge. So the answer to this question is N/A because the question mixes the bridge with the medical building. The article doesn't connect the medical building to his daughters' belief.

3. **Question 3**: The tie at Elaine's? The article says at a holiday party he wore a three-piece suit with a yellow silk tie with blue stripes. But the question mentions Elaine's. However, the article says he misses Elaine's, but the description of the suit is from a party. There's no mention of him wearing that tie at Elaine's. So the answer would be N/A because the tie description is from a different event (the holiday party) not Elaine's.

4. **Question 4**: The number of stories in "A Town Without Time"? The article says it's a collection, but doesn't specify the count. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The Verrazzano piece won a Pulitzer? The article says Talese mentions he never won a Pulitzer. So answer is N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The deaf sportswriter for NYT covering Yankees in Atlantic City. The article mentions John Drebinger, deaf, wrote for NYT, covered Babe Ruth. So answer is John Drebinger.

7. **Question 7**: Han Kang's novel mentioned as inspiration? The article lists Han Kang's "We Do Not Part" but that's in a different section (the "Other" parts like the Book Review Podcast mentions). However, Talese's influences are listed as including Mary McCarthy, but the question asks which novel by Han Kang Talese mentioned as an inspiration. The article says Talese mentioned Mary McCarthy, but Han Kang's novel isn't linked to Talese's work. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The year his father made a $3k suit. The article says "most of the '50 or 60' handmade suits in his collection date to the 1950s". The question asks when his father made a $3k suit. The article says "One young novelist asked how much a bespoke pattern would have cost in 1980. 'Three thousand,' said Talese..." So the cost in 1980 was $3k, but the suits in his collection are from the 50s. The question is about when his father made a $3k suit. The answer might be N/A because the $3k cost refers to 1980, but the father's suits were from the 50s. The question is about the father's suit costing $3k, but the article says the 1980 cost was $3k, not the father's. So answer N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Architectural feature of his brownstone for small-town connection. The article says he doesn't have a super or doorman, so neighbors help him. The architectural feature? The text says "the hardware store" and knowing the tailor. Maybe the lack of a doorman? The question asks for a specific feature. The article says "because I don't have a super or doorman, some of the supers at neighboring buildings help me out." So the architectural feature might be "no doorman/super" but the question asks for a feature of the building. Maybe the building itself is a brownstone which is a type, but the question wants a specific feature. The article doesn't mention a specific architectural feature like a garden or entrance. So N/A?

Wait, the question is "what specific architectural feature... allows him to maintain a small-town connection..." The article says he knows the drugstore, tailor, hardware store, and the neighboring supers help. The architectural feature might not be specified. The answer could be N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Play by Scott Turow referenced? The article mentions Scott Turow's "Presumed Innocent" and "Presumed Guilty" but those are novels. The question asks for a play. Since the article refers to novels, the answer is N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Sartorial item blamed for men's health decline. Talese says people near the medical building wear jeans, sneakers, etc. He blames their attire for needing to go to the doctor. The item is jeans or sneakers? The question asks for the specific item. The answer is "blue jeans" as per "dressed dreadfully, in blue jeans, sneakers, wind breakers". The question asks what item he blames. The answer is blue jeans.

12. **Question 12**: Pulitzer winner incorrectly cited as influencing his style. The article lists authors like Hemingway, Faulkner, etc., but Talese says he never won a Pulitzer. The question is which Pulitzer winner he falsely implied influenced him. The article doesn't mention any Pulitzer winner in his influences except maybe someone else? The text says "I never won any prizes like the Pulitzer, or anything like that." So he didn't mention a Pulitzer winner as an influence. So the answer is N/A.

13. **Question 13**: Reconcile admiration for Seymour Krim with jeans criticism. The article says he admires Krim, but criticizes jeans. The text doesn't explain how he reconciles this. So N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Wartime event with Yankees leading to Verrazzano piece. The article says the Yankees came to Atlantic City in 1944 for spring training because of the war. But the Verrazzano piece is unrelated to that event. The question asks which event led to his first published piece about the bridge. The article doesn't connect the Yankees' training to the bridge story. So N/A.

15. **Question 15**: Erroneous claim about Drebinger's deafness and reporting on Babe Ruth. The article says Drebinger was deaf with earpieces but knew Babe Ruth. The implication is that despite being deaf, he knew Babe Ruth. The erroneous claim might be that his deafness didn't hinder his reporting. But the question asks what Talese falsely implied. The text doesn't say Talese made an error here. So N/A.

16. **Question 16**: Fictional character influencing his descriptions. The question asks which character by a writer Talese admires is incorrectly cited. The article mentions authors like Salter (his father?), but the question refers to a fictional character. The text doesn't mention any specific fictional character as an influence. So N/A.

17. **Question 17**: Anecdote about daughters vs. archival honesty. Talese kept letters where he wrote badly about his marriage but now says it's not true. The daughters thought he owned the bridge, but he didn't correct them. The contradiction is between his archival honesty (keeping the letters) and the bridge story. The answer is N/A unless there's a direct link. The article says he didn't tell them he didn't own the bridge for a long time, which is a personal story, but his letters are about his marriage. So maybe the answer is N/A because the two are separate.

18. **Question 18**: Iconic restaurant closure due to casual attire. The article mentions Elaine's closure as what he misses. The question asks which restaurant's closure he attributes to the shift to casual attire. Since he misses Elaine's, and he criticizes casual dress, perhaps the answer is Elaine's. The article says "I miss Elaine's. I miss that place. Because today, the city does sleep. P.J. Clarke's is open late, but I don't always want a hamburger." The closure of Elaine's might be linked to the city's change (sleeping, casual attire). So answer is Elaine's.

19. **Question 19**: Parallel between father's tailoring and bridge uniforms. The article says Talese's father was a tailor, but there's no mention of bridge construction uniforms. So N/A.
