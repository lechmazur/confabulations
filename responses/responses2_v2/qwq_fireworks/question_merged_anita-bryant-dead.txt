Okay, I need to tackle these 20 questions based solely on the provided article. Let me go through each question one by one and check the article for the answers. 

1. **Which brand did Anita Bryant not endorse in her commercials?** The article mentions she endorsed Florida Citrus Commission (orange juice), Coca-Cola, Holiday Inn, Friedrich air-conditioners, Phillips 66, and Tupperware. The question asks which brand she *didn't* endorse. Since the options aren't listed, but the question is based on the article's details, the answer should be the one not listed. Wait, the article says "before her job promoting orange juice, Ms. Bryant also appeared in commercials for Coca-Cola, Holiday Inn, Friedrich air-conditioners, the energy company Phillips 66 and Tupperware." So the brands she did endorse are listed. The question asks which one she *didn't*—but since the user didn't list options, maybe it's a trick. Wait, the question is phrased as "according to the details provided about her advertising career?" The article says "most memorably, she represented the Florida Citrus Commission..." and others. The question is which brand she *did not* endorse. The article doesn't mention her not endorsing a specific brand except possibly others not listed. Wait, but the question is phrased as a negative. Wait, the article lists the brands she did endorse. Since the question is asking which she did *not* endorse, but the article only lists the ones she did, perhaps the answer is "N/A" because there's no mention of a brand she rejected. Wait, no, maybe the answer is "Florida Citrus Commission" is the main one, but the question is about a brand she did *not* endorse. Wait, the article says she represented Florida Citrus Commission, so that's a yes. The question is which brand she did *not* endorse. Since the article only lists the brands she did, perhaps the answer is "N/A" because there's no mention of a non-endorsed brand. Wait, but maybe the question is referring to the list given. Wait, the article says "before her job promoting orange juice, she also appeared in commercials for Coca-Cola..." So the brands listed are the ones she did endorse. The question asks which brand she did *not* endorse. Since the article doesn't mention any other brands she didn't endorse, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question is phrased as "according to the details provided about her advertising career?" Maybe there's a trick here. Wait, the article says "most memorably, she represented the Florida Citrus Commission in a long campaign of television commercials..." So perhaps the question is looking for a brand not listed in the article. Since the article lists all the ones she did, maybe the answer is "N/A" because there's no mention of a non-endorsed brand. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check again. The user is asking which brand she did *not* endorse, but the article only lists the ones she did. So perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, no, the first sentence says she was a spokeswoman for Florida orange juice, so that's a yes. The question is which brand she *didn't* endorse. Since the article lists the brands she did, but the question is phrased as "which brand did she not endorse," but since there's no info on brands she rejected, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe there's a specific brand mentioned elsewhere. Let me check again. The article mentions "Florida Citrus Commission," Coca-Cola, Holiday Inn, Friedrich air-conditioners, Phillips 66, and Tupperware. The question is which of these she did *not* endorse. Wait, no, the question is phrased as "which brand did she not endorse in her commercials, according to the details provided". Since the article lists those, the answer would be N/A unless there's a brand mentioned elsewhere that she didn't endorse. Wait, maybe the question is a trick. Wait, the first paragraph says she was a spokeswoman for Florida orange juice. The article lists the other brands as part of her pre-orange juice endorsements. So maybe the question is looking for a brand not in the list. Since there's no mention of any other brands, the answer must be N/A. Hmm, but maybe I missed something. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is "Tupperware" is part of the list, so not the answer. Wait, maybe the answer is "Anita Bryant Music Mansion" but that's her later venture, not a commercial endorsement. So the answer is N/A. But maybe I'm wrong here. Let me hold that thought and proceed to the next questions, maybe I can come back.

2. **Title of the 2016 play featuring a fictional interview with her.** The article says "plays, including 'Anita Bryant Died for Your Sins' (2009) and 'Anita Bryant's Playboy Interview' (2016), opened on both coasts." So the 2016 play is "Anita Bryant's Playboy Interview".

3. **President’s funeral she performed at.** The article states she performed "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" at President Lyndon B. Johnson's graveside.

4. **Religious organization founded after divorce sponsoring 1980 TV special.** The article mentions her 1980 special was sponsored by her religious organization which supported conversion therapy. The article says she founded "Save Our Children" earlier. After her divorce, she might have another group. Wait, the article says "As the publicity about her anti-gay views died down, she returned to television in 1980 with a two-hour variety show special, 'The Anita Bryant Spectacular,' smiling big... The special was sponsored by her religious organization, which supported 'conversion therapy' for gay men." The name of the organization isn't explicitly stated here, but earlier she founded Save Our Children. Wait, but maybe after her divorce, she used the same org? The question says "after her divorce"—she divorced in 1980. Wait, the article says "Two months after the special, Ms. Bryant ended her marriage to her manager, Robert Einar Green..." So the special was in 1980, then the divorce happened after. The religious org that sponsored the special might still be Save Our Children, but the question says "religious organization Ms. Bryant founded after her divorce". Wait, the divorce was after the special. So the org was founded before. Hmm, perhaps the answer is Save Our Children, but the question specifies "after her divorce". Wait, maybe she founded a new one after. The article doesn't mention another org. The only one named is Save Our Children. So maybe the answer is Save Our Children. The question might be a trick, but the article says she founded Save Our Children in 1977, which was before her divorce in 1980. So the answer might be N/A. Wait, the question says "religious organization Ms. Bryant founded after her divorce". Since she divorced in 1980, perhaps after that, but the article doesn't mention another. The 1980 special was sponsored by her religious organization, but the name isn't given here. The only named org is Save Our Children. Since the question says "founded after divorce", which is after 1980, but the article doesn't mention another, so answer N/A. Wait, maybe I'm missing it. The article says "her religious organization, which supported 'conversion therapy' for gay men." But the name isn't given. So the answer is N/A? Or maybe the question is referring to Save Our Children, even though it was before divorce. The question says "founded after her divorce"—so N/A. Hmm.

5. **City where family placed paid obituary.** The article says "The family placed a paid obituary in The Oklahoman, a newspaper in Oklahoma City, on Thursday." So the city is Oklahoma City.

6. **First husband's occupation before marriage.** The article states her first husband was Robert Einar Green, a former disc jockey whom she married in 1960. So his occupation before marriage was disc jockey.

7. **Song in Michael Moore's documentary.** The article says "Michael Moore's documentary 'Roger & Me' (1989), Ms. Bryant embodied forced optimism, singing the pop song 'Joy to the World' to audiences..." So the song is "Joy to the World".

8. **Anti-gay org opposing Dade County ordinance.** The article says she founded Save Our Children, which opposed the Dade County ordinance. So the answer is Save Our Children.

9. **Year her second husband died.** The article mentions "Mr. Dry died in 2024." Her second husband was Charlie Hobson Dry, so the year is 2024.

10. **Type of pie in 1977 protest.** The article says "a demonstrator walked up to Ms. Bryant and pushed a banana cream pie into her face." So banana cream.

11. **Pivot point in her backlash.** The article states that her opposition to gay rights began in 1977, leading to her career decline. The pivot was when she opposed the Dade County ordinance, so the point is her 1977 opposition.

12. **Year citrus contract ended.** The article says "the contract was canceled before the decade ended." The decade here is the 1970s, so 1979 or 1980. The question asks when the termination coincided with her increased notoriety (which started in 1977). The contract ended before the decade ended (1979/1980). Since the question says "calendar year," the answer is 1979? Wait, the article says "before the decade ended" (the 70s ended in 1979?), no, the decade is 1970-1979, so "before the decade ended" would be by 1979. Wait, the contract was canceled before the decade ended, so the decade of the 70s ended in 1979. So the answer is 1979? Or maybe 1977? Wait, the article says "the contract was canceled before the decade ended." The decade is the 1970s, so the answer is 1979. But maybe the article says "the contract was canceled before the decade ended," meaning by 1979, so the answer is 1979. Alternatively, the exact year isn't given, but the decade is 1970s, so "before the decade ended" is 1979. The question is asking for the calendar year when the termination coincided with her increased notoriety. The contract was canceled before the decade (1970s) ended, so 1979.

13. **President's graveside ceremony.** The article mentions she performed at Lyndon B. Johnson's graveside. So the answer is Lyndon B. Johnson.

14. **Title of work warning of militant threat.** The article says she wrote "The Anita Bryant Story: The Survival of Our Nation's Families and the Threat of Militant Homosexuality" (1977). So the title is "The Survival of Our Nation's Families and the Threat of Militant Homosexuality".

15. **Medium for comeback performance.** The article says she did a "two-hour variety show special, 'The Anita Bryant Spectacular'".

16. **Honorific label as religious conservative.** The article refers to her as a "Christian celebrity".

17. **Annual monetary figure for citrus contract.** The article states her citrus commission contract was "$100,000-a-year arrangement".

18. **Birthplace shaping her childhood.** The article says she was born in Barnsdall, Oklahoma.

19. **State common to her significant episodes.** Florida is mentioned for her citrus work and Dade County (Miami, FL). The other state mentioned is Oklahoma (birth and later life). But the significant episodes like the citrus promotion and Dade County are in Florida. The question asks which state is common where these episodes unfolded. The citrus work was in Florida, Dade County is in FL, so Florida is the answer.

20. **Citrus fruit associated with her persona and the pie incident.** The article mentions orange juice (citrus fruit oranges) and the pie incident involved a banana cream pie. But the question says "citrus fruit associated... indirectly evoked during a notorious moment". The pie was banana cream, not citrus. However, her persona was linked to oranges (Florida orange juice). The question might be looking for "orange" as the citrus fruit, since the pie was banana, but the symbolic imagery combines her orange juice with the pie incident. The answer would be orange.

Now, let me go back to question 1 again. The question is which brand she did NOT endorse. The article lists Florida Citrus Commission (orange juice), Coca-Cola, Holiday Inn, Friedrich air-conditioners, Phillips 66, Tupperware. The question asks which brand she did *not* endorse. Since the article doesn't mention any other brands she didn't endorse, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick and the answer is "Florida Citrus Commission" is part of the endorsements, so not the answer. Wait, the question is phrased as "which brand did Anita Bryant not endorse in her commercials, according to the details provided about her advertising career?" Since all the listed brands are ones she did endorse, the answer must be N/A unless there's a brand mentioned elsewhere she didn't. The article doesn't mention any others, so N/A. But maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The first paragraph says she was a spokeswoman for Florida orange juice. The article says "before her job promoting orange juice, she also appeared in commercials for Coca-Cola..." So the other brands are pre-orange juice. The question is which brand she did NOT endorse. Since the article lists all she did, the answer is N/A. So I'll go with N/A for question 1.

For question 4: The religious organization that sponsored her 1980 special was her own, but the article says "the special was sponsored by her religious organization, which supported 'conversion therapy' for gay men." The name of the organization isn't given here. Earlier, she founded Save Our Children. The question asks which organization she founded *after her divorce*. She divorced in 1980, after the special (since the special was in 1980 and the divorce was two months after). So the organization was founded before the divorce. Therefore, the answer would still be Save Our Children. The question might have a trick, but since the article doesn't mention another org after divorce, the answer is Save Our Children. Wait, the question says "religious organization Ms. Bryant founded after her divorce", but she founded Save Our Children in 1977, before the divorce in 1980. So the answer would be N/A. But maybe the article mentions another? No. The article says she had Anita Bryant Ministries International later, but when was that founded? The article says "the couple moved back to Oklahoma, where they operated Anita Bryant Ministries International." But the exact founding date isn't given. The question is about the org that sponsored the 1980 special. Since the article doesn't name it, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the article implies it's the same as Save Our Children. But the question specifies "religious organization founded after her divorce"—so N/A.

Hmm, this is tricky. The answer for question 4 might be N/A. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is Anita Bryant Ministries International, but that's later. The article says the 1980 special was sponsored by her religious organization, but the name isn't given. The only named org is Save Our Children. Since the question asks which she founded after divorce, and she founded Save Our Children before, the answer is N/A. I'll go with N/A for question 4.
