Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions beyond what's written.

1. **Question 1:** The NPR program Reuben hosted isn't mentioned by name. The article says he worked at NPR but doesn't specify the show. So, answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The article states Jonas has a brain affliction but doesn't mention how many months he has left. So, N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Mikkel's newspaper isn't named. The text mentions Cecilie works at The New York Times, but Mikkel's isn't specified. Answer N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Reuben's last NPR story subject isn't detailed. The scandal was about a Zoom incident, not his story content. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The article says Reuben shaved his head, not dyed his hair. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The conservative politician's name isn't provided. Just that Mikkel exposed a pedophile. Answer N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The neighborhood isn't mentioned. The text refers to Cecilie's mother's childhood home in Copenhagen but no specific area. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The tattoo design isn't described. Only that he got an ill-advised one. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The treatment Mikkel discouraged isn't named. Just that he advised against lifesaving treatment. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** No info on how long Cecilie and Jonas dated before the events. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The article compares the novel to "Hamlet" in themes, so Mikkel parallels Iago (Svengali-like manipulator). But the text doesn't explicitly state this. Wait, the article mentions "Hamlet" in themes, and Mikkel as Svengali. Iago is from Othello. Hmm, but the question asks which play's character. Since the article references "Hamlet," maybe the answer is Hamlet, but the manipulation might be more like Iago. Wait, the article says "Svengali," which is like in "Trilby," but the themes are from Hamlet. The question is about which Shakespeare play's character Mikkel parallels. The article says the novel uses themes from Hamlet, so perhaps the answer is Hamlet. But the Svengali aspect might relate to another play. Alternatively, the article says "Hamlet" is the play referenced in the title. Since the themes include father-son relationships and deceit, maybe the parallel is with Iago from Othello? The article doesn't explicitly state the character's parallel, so maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "according to the novel's thematic structure." The article says it uses themes from Hamlet, so maybe the answer is Hamlet. But the exact character isn't named. Hmm. The article mentions "Hamlet" in the themes, so perhaps the answer is Hamlet. But I'm not sure. Let me check again. The article says "cribs some of the play's most delicious themes" referring to Hamlet. The manipulation by Mikkel might be like Iago, but the question is about the Shakespearean play's character. Since the article doesn't specify the character, maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "Svengali" which is a type of manipulator, like Iago. But the question is which play's character. Since the article references Hamlet's themes, but the specific character isn't named, so perhaps the answer is Hamlet. But maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, tricky. The article does say "Svengali," which is a term from a different work, but the play here is Hamlet. Since the question is about the Shakespearean play's character, and the article doesn't name it, perhaps N/A. Alternatively, the article mentions "Hamlet," so maybe the answer is Hamlet. But the character Mikkel is a Svengali, so perhaps the parallel is to Iago from Othello? The article doesn't say. Since it's not explicitly stated, I'll go with N/A.

12. **Question 12:** The article says "two months of parental leave in the United States" before moving to Copenhagen. So answer 2.

13. **Question 13:** No specific landmark mentioned for the confrontation. The text talks about Copenhagen but no specific place. N/A.

14. **Question 14:** The article mentions Reuben's biological father's absence but no specific childhood trauma. So N/A.

Wait, let me check again for question 11. The article says the novel cribs themes from Hamlet, so perhaps Mikkel parallels a character from Hamlet. Hamlet's father is a ghost, and there's the manipulation by Claudius. Alternatively, the Svengali aspect might be like Iago in Othello. The article doesn't specify, so maybe the answer is N/A. Since the question asks which play's character according to the novel's thematic structure, and the article mentions Hamlet's themes, but not the specific character, I think the answer should be Hamlet. Wait, the question is about the character that Mikkel parallels. The article says Mikkel is a Svengali, so maybe the equivalent in Hamlet would be Iago? But Hamlet's manipulator is more like Claudius. Hmm. Since the article doesn't explicitly state which character, the safest answer is N/A. So I'll go with N/A for 11.

Alright, proceeding with these answers.
