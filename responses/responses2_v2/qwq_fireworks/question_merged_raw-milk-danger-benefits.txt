Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start by going through each question and checking the article for answers.

1. **Question 1:** The study by Betty van Esch with nine participants found that children allergic to milk had better tolerance to raw milk. The article mentions "an intriguing epidemiological finding" but doesn't specify a percentage. Wait, the exact wording was "children already allergic to milk were better able to tolerate raw milk than milk treated with high heat." But the question asks for a percentage. Since there's no percentage given here, the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The article says that farming children's microbiomes produce more butyrate, but it doesn't mention a specific bacterial strain. The text states "the microbiome that produces more of a metabolite called butyrate," but no strain is named. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The article mentions that a gallon can cost nearly $20, but there's no comparison to pasteurized milk's price or data from California during the pandemic. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The article says a scientist said the inventor deserves a Nobel Prize posthumously "every year." But it's a hypothetical, not an actual calculation. The question asks for the number of Nobel Prizes calculated in epidemiological research. Since there's no number given, N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The temperature threshold isn't specified. The article mentions "using less heat" and "higher temperatures alter proteins," but no exact temperature. N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The studies were in multiple European countries (Switzerland, Austria, etc.), but the question asks which showed the strongest correlation. The article doesn't compare them, so N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The article says "the more intensively their families farmed... the more protected they were," but no mention of generations required. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** McAfee says his customer base diversified from "hippie nut-and-berry moms" but doesn't give percentages. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The studies mention "expectant mothers might consume raw milk during pregnancy," but the specific month isn't stated. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The article says farming newborns had "more regulatory T-cells," but no exact percentage difference. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The scientist suggested a Nobel Prize, but the category isn't specified. The article says "Nobel Prize posthumously" but doesn't mention the category. N/A.

12. **Question 12:** No specific temperature threshold is given by Joost van Neerven. He mentions lower temps preserve proteins but no exact number. N/A.

13. **Question 13:** The milk was from an organic dairy farm in Germany. The article states "untreated milk from an organic dairy farm in Germany." So the answer is Germany.

14. **Question 14:** The article says "more than 200 people have been sickened since then" (post-1998-2018 data). But the question is about hospitalizations between 2020-2023. The article states "228 hospitalized" from 1998-2018, but no data after. So N/A for the specific years.

15. **Question 15:** No specific fungal species is named. The article mentions "fermented feed, fungi" but doesn't identify a strain. N/A.

16. **Question 16:** The 30% reduction in colds is mentioned as an epidemiological finding linked to raw milk, but the country isn't specified. The study by Erika von Mutius is referenced, but her institution is in Germany. Wait, the article says "children on farms who drink raw milk have a 30 percent reduction..." but doesn't name the country. N/A.

17. **Question 17:** The mechanism of lactoferrin neutralizing H5N1 isn't described. The article mentions H5N1 concerns but not the mechanism. N/A.

18. **Question 18:** The federal regulation prohibiting interstate sales is mentioned, but the president who signed it isn't named. N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Caroline Roduit's study isn't detailed enough to state a percentage. The article doesn't mention switching to pasteurized milk leading to asthma rates. N/A.

20. **Question 20:** No specific cow breed is named. The article refers to alpine farms but doesn't mention the breed. N/A.
