Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the given article. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked and not infer beyond the text.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks which character witnessed both religious persecution and theatrical performances and helped stage a secret production leading to their death. Looking through the article, Judith Shakespeare's daughter flees to London and helps an actor with performances in pubs. The actor wants to perform in Oxford, and Judith might be involved. The article mentions "wildly dangerous performance of a lifetime awaits him in the besieged Royalist stronghold of Oxford, and he insists that only Judith can help him get there." But does it say that this leads to their death? The article doesn't explicitly state that Judith's involvement leads to a death. Hmm, maybe the answer is Judith, but I'm not sure if the death is mentioned. Wait, the question says "ultimately helps stage a secret production that leads to their death." The article doesn't specify the outcome, so maybe N/A? Or maybe the actor's fate isn't mentioned. So perhaps N/A here.

2. **Question 2:** The number of narrators in Zabalbeascoa's novel. The article says "almost two dozen narrators" so that's around 20. The exact number isn't given, but "almost two dozen" could mean 20-24. The question asks for the total, so maybe the answer is "almost two dozen" but the instructions say to answer in fragments. Since it's approximate, maybe "N/A" because it's not exact? Wait, the question says "how many total narrators contribute". The article says "almost two dozen", so maybe the answer is 20 or 24? But the article uses "almost", so exact number isn't given. The answer would be N/A. Wait, but the exact question is asking for the total, and the text says "almost two dozen", which is 24. Maybe the answer is "two dozen" but the article says "almost", so maybe they mean around 20. Hmm, the question is strict, so if it's not exact, it's N/A. Or maybe the answer is "almost two dozen". The instructions say to use the exact words from the text if possible. The question asks for "how many total", so since it's approximate, maybe N/A. Wait, the user might expect the answer as stated: "almost two dozen" but the question is about the number. Since the exact number isn't given, the answer is N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Miss Redbud's musical talent and the ghost dance movement. The article states that Miss Redbud is a musician presented as a "paragon of her endangered race". The novel's plot moves between Carlisle and the ghost dance movement. It says her role is caught between two worlds, feeling like a traitor. Her musical talent isn't directly linked to advancing the ghost dance. The question asks how her talent "advances the ghost dance movement among her students". The article doesn't mention her using music to support the ghost dance; instead, she's an instructor trying to erase tribal loyalties. So maybe her talent doesn't advance it, so the answer is N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Semiramis's primary mentor before her rise. The article mentions her marriage to a taciturn warrior, the emperor's companion. It also describes the court dominated by the emperor's mother and a eunuch spymaster. There's no mention of a mentor before her rise. The text says she was an orphan who used cleverness and looks to rise. So primary mentor isn't mentioned, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Judith's medical knowledge to prove innocence. The article says Judith is a midwife's daughter. Witchcraft charges are against her, so maybe her midwifery skills. The article doesn't explicitly state that she used medical knowledge to prove innocence. It just mentions she fled due to the charge. So answer N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Military commander Isidro serves under. The article mentions Isidro is a soldier on the government side in the Spanish Civil War. The key battle changing Mariana's perspective isn't named. The text doesn't mention the commander's name. So N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Traditional ceremony Miss Redbud performs. The article doesn't mention any specific ceremony she does with students before the uprising. It talks about the ghost dance movement on the plains but not at Carlisle. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Eunuch spymaster's informants contributing to Semiramis's marriage. The article says the spymaster trades in secrets. The text says Semiramis's rise is due to her marriage to the emperor's companion. It doesn't mention the spymaster's role in that marriage. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Protestant companion's message to Royalists. Judith's companions include a Bible-spouting zealot. The article doesn't mention the zealot delivering a message to Royalists. The zealot is part of Judith's group going to Oxford. The question's answer isn't in the text, so N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Sacred text for encoding writings. The article mentions Mariana's political writings but doesn't specify using a text like the Bible or Quran. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The phrase about tomorrow's uncertainty. The article says the phrase encapsulates the danger and uncertainty. The answer is that it shows the unpredictability and fear of retribution, highlighting survival's precariousness.

12. **Question 12:** Mariana's meeting with Isidro's role. The article says their stories attract other stories, not a typical tragic romance. The role is to introduce varied perspectives on the conflict. So the answer is to serve as a catalyst for multiple narratives.

13. **Question 13:** Historical figure's maxim in TO SAVE THE MAN. The title comes from Richard Henry Pratt: "To save the man, we must kill the Indian." So the answer is Pratt's maxim.

14. **Question 14:** Inclusion of varied voices affecting perception. The different voices show the war's impact on all groups, intensifying the dread's universality. So the answer is it broadens the portrayal to show collective dread.

15. **Question 15:** Judith aiding the actor suggests merging personal and political. The article says her helping the actor in risky journey implies combining personal rebellion (helping him) with political defiance (Royalist stronghold). So the answer is it merges both aspects.

16. **Question 16:** Recollection of being born into nothing. The text says her memory of having nothing drives her to be alert. So the turning point is her awareness of vulnerability, fueling her caution and ambition.

17. **Question 17:** Metaphor of the endless rope. The rope symbolizes fragile connections that can break, highlighting the instability of alliances in court politics.

18. **Question 18:** Consequence of environment on indigenous identity. The military campus and ghost dance movement create tension between assimilation and resistance, leading to a new identity blending both.

19. **Question 19:** Dispersion of voices intensifying war depiction. The varied perspectives show war's multifaceted destruction, making it feel all-encompassing and personal.

20. **Question 20:** Unifying theme across novels. All deal with conflict, transformation, and personal adversity leading to resilience or change. The theme is the transformative power of conflict and resistance.
