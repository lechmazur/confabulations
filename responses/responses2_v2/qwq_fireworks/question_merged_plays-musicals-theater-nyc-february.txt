Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to be careful and only use the information given, no outside knowledge. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks which Broadway veteran who starred in "True West" directed the Sam Shepard revival with Calista Flockhart. Looking at the article's section about the Sam Shepard revival, it mentions Cooper Hoffman's father starred in "True West." The director of the revival isn't named here, but the article says Scott Elliott directed it. Wait, but the question is about the director who was in "True West." The father of Cooper Hoffman was in the Shepard's "True West" on Broadway. So the father is the actor, not the director. The director of the current revival is Scott Elliott. The question is asking for the director who was in "True West." Hmm, maybe I misread. The article says Cooper Hoffman's father starred in "True West," so the father is the actor, not the director of this revival. Therefore, the director here is Scott Elliott, but the question wants the director who was in "True West." Wait, perhaps the answer is N/A? Because the director of the revival is Scott Elliott, but the article doesn't say he was in "True West." The father is the one who was in it. So maybe the answer is N/A? Or maybe Cooper Hoffman's father is the actor, but the director isn't him. The question is phrased as "directed the Sam Shepard revival... who previously starred in 'True West'?" So the director must have been in "True West." The article only mentions Cooper Hoffman's father as the one who was in "True West," but the director is Scott Elliott. Since there's no info that Scott Elliott was in "True West," the answer might be N/A. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The article says Cooper Hoffman, whose father starred in Shepard's "True West" on Broadway, plays their son. So the father is in "True West," but the director of the current play is Scott Elliott. Since the question is about the director who was in "True West," unless the director is Cooper's father, which isn't stated, the answer is N/A. Hmm, tricky. Maybe the question is a trick. The answer is N/A.

2. The question is how many rotating casts of celebrity performers were announced for Joy Behar's production before its closing in May. The article mentions rotating casts with boldface names: first group is Joy Behar, Susie Essman, Tovah Feldshuh, Adrienne C. Moore until Feb 23. Then from Feb 26 to March 23, it's Judy Gold, Susan Lucci, Tonya Pinkins, Cathy Moriarty. Then March 26 to April 20: Veanne Cox, Jackie Hoffman, Andrea Navedo. Then Gina Gershon joins from April 2-20. Wait, how many distinct casts? Let's count the groups. The first is Joy Behar's group (through Feb 23), then the second (Feb 26-Mar23), third (March26-Apr20), and then Gina Gershon joining the fourth? Or is the April 2-20 part an addition? The way it's written: "followed by Veanne Cox, Jackie Hoffman and Andrea Navedo, March 26 through April 20. Gina Gershon joins them from April 2 to April 20." So maybe the April 2-20 has both the third group plus Gina. But the article says three main rotations: first, second, third, with Gina added to the third. The question asks how many rotating casts were announced. The article lists three distinct time periods with different casts, so three. So answer is 3.

3. Rajiv Joseph's Peace Corps service in Senegal. The article says he spent three years in the Peace Corps there. So the answer is 3 years.

4. Rainn Wilson's role in the dystopian musical. The musical is Urinetown, where public facilities charge. The article says the cast includes Jordan Fisher, Rainn Wilson, Keala Settle, and Jeff Hiller. The roles aren't specified. The question asks what role he portrays, but the article doesn't mention specific roles for the actors. So answer N/A.

5. Temperature requirement for the ice marionette. The article mentions the marionette is made of ice, but doesn't state any specific temperature needed during the show. So N/A.

6. Toraichi Kono's appearances in Chaplin's films. The article says he made fleeting appearances but doesn't give a number. So N/A.

7. Cooper Hoffman's father's role in "Curse of the Starving Class." The question is about the current production. The article mentions Cooper's father was in Shepard's "True West," but the current play's title isn't "Curse of the Starving Class." The Sam Shepard revival's title isn't mentioned, but the question might be a trick. The article doesn't mention Cooper's father's role in the current play, so N/A.

8. Historical event in Senegal for Rajiv Joseph's thriller. The article says the setting is during the year 2000 as the approach, so the event is the year 2000. Answer: the year 2000.

9. Running time of Mary Stuart's monologue. The article states it's a 90-minute monologue, so 90 minutes.

10. Consciousness-raising group in Ohio inspiring Bess Wohl's play. The article mentions the play spans from 1970 Ohio era of women's consciousness-raising groups. The specific group's name isn't given, so N/A unless it's referring to the general movement. The question asks for the name of the group, which isn't provided. So N/A.

11. Second lead in Urinetown revival. The cast includes Jordan Fisher, Rainn Wilson, Keala Settle, Jeff Hiller. The lead is Jordan Fisher (as per typical casting?), but the question asks for the second lead. Since the article doesn't specify roles, can't determine. N/A.

12. Director of the play about Toraichi Kono. The article says Jeff Liu directs the world premiere for Pan Asian Repertory Theater. So answer Jeff Liu.

13. Creative mind behind the ice puppet production. The article says it's by Theatre de l'Entrouvert, conceived and directed by Elise Vigneron. So Elise Vigneron.

14. Director of the two-person play about brothers. The article mentions Jack Serio directs for Signature Theater. So Jack Serio.

15. Title of Rajiv Joseph's thriller in Senegal. The article doesn't name the title, only mentions it's a thriller set there. So N/A.

16. Playwright of the 1977 Obie winner revived with Calista Flockhart. The article says the revival is of Sam Shepard's 1977 Obie winner. So Sam Shepard.

17. Director of the Roundabout play with phone policy. The article says Whitney White directs for Roundabout Theater Company. So Whitney White.

18. Actress in Joy Behar's lineup from Feb26-Mar23. The list includes Judy Gold, Susan Lucci, Tonya Pinkins, Cathy Moriarty. The question asks for a highlighted performer. The article mentions Tonya Pinkins is part of the cast in another show, but in this case, the highlighted might be any of them. The question might expect one of the names listed here. Since it's asking for a highlighted performer, perhaps Tonya Pinkins is mentioned again here. The question says "highlighted performer" but the article just lists the names. The answer is one of them, but since the question is asking for one, maybe the first? But the user might expect any of them. Wait, the question says "which actress... is mentioned as part of the lineup from Feb 26 to March 23, appears as a highlighted performer?" The article lists them all as part of the cast, so perhaps any of them. Since the user might expect one, but the question is singular. Maybe the first one listed, Judy Gold? Or perhaps Tonya Pinkins, since she's also in another show mentioned. Wait, the article mentions Tonya Pinkins is in "My First Ex-Husband" and also in the Joy Behar production. Since the question is about the Joy Behar lineup, the answer would be one of the names there. Since the question is asking for "highlighted performer" perhaps they are all highlighted, but the user wants one example. The first name listed is Judy Gold. Alternatively, the question might have a specific answer. Since the article lists "Judy Gold, Susan Lucci, Tonya Pinkins and Cathy Moriarty take over from Feb. 26 to March 23," the answer is one of these. But the question asks for "which actress" so any of them, but the user probably expects one. Since the question is from the user's list, maybe the answer is Tonya Pinkins, but she's in another show too. Alternatively, since the question says "highlighted performer," perhaps the first name, Judy Gold. But I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the question is looking for Tonya Pinkins since she's mentioned in another part. Hmm. Alternatively, since the question is in the rotating casts, and the user might expect any one of them. Since the answer requires a specific one, maybe the first one listed: Judy Gold. But maybe the question is looking for Tonya Pinkins since she's mentioned in another context. Wait, the article says "boldface names in Joy Behar's 'My First Ex-Husband' and a marionette..." so maybe Tonya Pinkins is part of the initial cast, and then again in the second group. The question is about the Feb 26 to March 23 cast, which includes Tonya Pinkins. So the answer could be Tonya Pinkins. Alternatively, any of the four. Since the question is singular, maybe the first one: Judy Gold. But I'm not sure. The user might have a specific answer. Alternatively, the article mentions Tonya Pinkins as part of the cast in another show, so maybe she's the highlighted one here. Let me check the article again. The Joy Behar production's second cast includes Judy Gold, Susan Lucci, Tonya Pinkins, Cathy Moriarty. The question is asking for an actress in that lineup. Since the question is phrased to pick one, perhaps the answer is Tonya Pinkins, as she's mentioned in another part of the article. Alternatively, it could be any of them. Since the user might have intended Tonya Pinkins, but I'm not sure. Since the question is about "highlighted performer," maybe the most notable name. Among those, Susan Lucci is a well-known name. Alternatively, the answer could be Judy Gold. But since the user's instructions say to pick directly from the text, the question is which is mentioned. Since the question says "highlighted performer" but the article just lists them, perhaps the first name is acceptable. Let's go with Judy Gold. Wait, but the question might have a specific correct answer. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Tonya Pinkins because she's mentioned in another context. Hmm. Alternatively, the user might expect one of the names, so I'll note that but proceed with the first listed, Judy Gold.

19. The performer in Mary Stuart's monologue. The article states Isabelle Huppert stars in it. So Isabelle Huppert.

20. The long-running show that's ending, noted for Fred Armisen's drumming gig. The article mentions the Blue Man Group is ending after 34 years, which gave Fred Armisen a drumming gig. So Blue Man Group.

Now, let me go through each question again to ensure accuracy.

1. The director of the Sam Shepard revival is Scott Elliott. The question asks for the director who previously starred in "True West". Since Cooper's father was in "True West", but the director isn't him, the answer is N/A.

2. Three rotating casts (the first, second, third periods) so 3.

3. 3 years.

4. N/A (no role specified).

5. N/A.

6. N/A (no number given).

7. N/A (the question refers to "Curse of the Starving Class" but the play in the article about Cooper's father is the Sam Shepard revival, which isn't named as "Curse of the Starving Class". The article doesn't mention the title, so can't answer).

8. The year 2000.

9. 90 minutes.

10. N/A (no specific group name).

11. N/A (no info on roles).

12. Jeff Liu.

13. Elise Vigneron.

14. Jack Serio.

15. N/A (no title given).

16. Sam Shepard.

17. Whitney White.

18. Let's go with Tonya Pinkins since she's mentioned in another part, but the article lists all. Since the user might want one, perhaps the first, Judy Gold. But maybe the question expects Tonya Pinkins because she's in another show. Alternatively, the answer is one of the listed, so pick the first.

Wait, the question says "highlighted performer" but the article just lists them. Maybe the answer is Tonya Pinkins because she's also in another show mentioned. Alternatively, the question is just asking for one of them. Since the user might accept any, but the first listed is Judy Gold. I'll go with Judy Gold for now, but perhaps the answer is Tonya Pinkins. Hmm.

19. Isabelle Huppert.

20. Blue Man Group.

Okay, I'll proceed with these answers.
