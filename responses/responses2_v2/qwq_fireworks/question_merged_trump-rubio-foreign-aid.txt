Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article and follow the strict formatting rules. Let me start with the first question.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks about the percentage of South Africa's total health budget that PEPFAR represents, based on Dr. Bekker's estimates. The article mentions that PEPFAR accounts for 20% of South Africa's HIV budget. The question specifies "total health budget," but the article only talks about the HIV budget. Since the question is about the total health budget, and the article doesn't provide that info, the answer should be N/A. Wait, but maybe I misread. Let me check again. The exact line is: "PEPFAR accounts for 20 percent of South Africa's H.I.V. budget". The question is about "total health budget," so unless there's a mention of the total health budget, it's N/A. So answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The article states that Jason Gray put about 60 top officials on paid leave. The question is about unpaid leave, but the article says paid leave. So the answer would be N/A because it's paid, not unpaid. Wait, the question says "unpaid leave" but the article says "paid leave." Since the question specifies unpaid, the answer is N/A. But wait, the exact wording: "about 60 top officials on paid leave." The question is about unpaid, so yes, N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The question asks for another hemorrhagic fever besides Marburg that U.S.A.I.D. contained in the last four years and has an approved vaccine. The article mentions Ebola and other hemorrhagic fevers. Ebola does have a vaccine. So the answer is Ebola.

4. **Question 4:** The article says that in Sudan's civil war, a UN agency screened 5.1 million children under 5 for malnutrition between Jan-Oct. The question is between November last year and end of the year. The article says "between January and October last year," so the period in question (Nov-Dec) isn't covered. The answer is N/A because the 5.1 million is for Jan-Oct, not including November-December.

5. **Question 5:** The article mentions that some former officials think the goal is to dismantle USAID and move its work to the State Department. So the answer would be the State Department.

6. **Question 6:** China Labor Watch employees might lose work visas if they have to return to China. The question asks how many will retain their visas. The article doesn't specify any who retain, only that those laid off might lose visas. So the answer is N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The disease affecting livestock mentioned is swine flu. The article says "animal diseases, like swine flu."

8. **Question 8:** The memo by Rubio allows life-saving humanitarian assistance, including food. The question mentions an exemption allowed despite the halt. The answer is "life-saving humanitarian assistance," but the question also asks what is provided by military aid to Israel. The article says military aid to Israel is exempt, but the question links the exemption to that. Wait, the question says "specifically exempted by Rubio's memo" and "also provided by the military aid to Israel." The exemption includes food, which is part of humanitarian aid. The military aid to Israel is exempted, but the question is about the temporary allowed assistance. The answer is "life-saving humanitarian assistance" (like food and medicine). The military aid to Israel is a separate exemption but the question is about the allowed assistance under the memo. So answer: "life-saving humanitarian assistance."

9. **Question 9:** The question asks about legal actions similar to those against CBS and the Register, which were lawsuits. The article mentions Trump's cases against those media, so similar actions against Health Gap would be lawsuits. But the article doesn't mention Health Gap facing lawsuits. The article states Health Gap's director criticized the shutdown, but no legal action is mentioned. So answer N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The memo that prohibited abortions, etc., was Rubio's. The article says Rubio issued a memo excluding those things. So answer: Marco Rubio.

11. **Question 11:** The divisive figure at State Department with Pentagon and USAID background is Pete Marocco. The article mentions him as the appointee overseeing foreign aid.

12. **Question 12:** The program initiated by a former president (Bush) is PEPFAR. The question is about the long-standing program at risk, so PEPFAR.

13. **Question 13:** The email about officials circumventing orders was sent by Jason Gray, the acting head of USAID.

14. **Question 14:** The disease with no test, treatment, or vaccine is Marburg, as mentioned in the article.

15. **Question 15:** The leader of the South African center is Dr. Linda-Gail Bekker, mentioned in the article.

16. **Question 16:** The 20% figure is for the HIV budget, so answer 20%.

17. **Question 17:** The UN agency involved in Sudan's screening is mentioned as a UN agency but not named. The question says "despite its name not being explicitly provided," but the answer is the UN agency, but the exact name isn't given. Wait, the article says "a United Nations agency relied on U.S. government support to screen..." Since the name isn't provided, answer N/A. Wait, the question says "despite its name not being explicitly provided," so maybe the answer is the UN agency, but since the name isn't given, it's N/A? Or perhaps the article names it elsewhere. Let me check again. The article says "One document says that during the civil war in Sudan, a United Nations agency relied on U.S. government support to screen about 5.1 million children..." So the name isn't given. So answer N/A.

18. **Question 18:** The agency instructed to stop communication with WHO is the CDC. The article says CDC employees were told to stop communicating with WHO.

19. **Question 19:** The organization is China Labor Watch, as mentioned in the article.
