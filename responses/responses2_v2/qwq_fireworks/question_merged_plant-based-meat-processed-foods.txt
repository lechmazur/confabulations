Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked and not infer beyond the text. Let me go through each question step by step.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions that the Good Food Institute states plant-based alternatives have 11% the environmental impact of meat. The question specifically asks about Beyond Meat's reformulated burgers. Since the article ties the 11% figure to the overall sector, I think this is the answer here. So, 11%.

2. **Question 2**: The question asks about the stock price when Beyond Meat went public, according to John Baumgartner. The article says the stock price tumbled from $234 to under $4. The initial IPO price wasn't mentioned, but the peak was $234. However, the analyst John Baumgartner is quoted later, but he only mentions the current situation, not the IPO price. Wait, the article says "Since the company went public in a blaze of glory in 2019, its stock price has tumbled from $234..." So the IPO price might not be given, but the peak was $234. The question is about the price when it went public. The article doesn't state the IPO price, just the peak. So maybe N/A? Wait, but the question says "when the company went public" and the article says "went public in 2019, its stock price has tumbled from $234..." implying that $234 was the peak, but the actual IPO price might be lower. Since the article doesn't specify the exact IPO price, the answer would be N/A. Wait, but the question says "according to John Baumgartner" but he's quoted later talking about recent stock issues. So the answer is N/A because the analyst didn't mention the IPO price.

3. **Question 3**: The article mentions Richard Berman, a former tobacco lobbyist, whose ads contributed to the decline in perceived healthiness. The name is clearly stated here. So Richard Berman.

4. **Question 4**: The World Health Organization classified processed meats (like hot dogs, bacon) as carcinogenic. The article states that plant-based meats are not in that category. The analysis says plant-based alternatives are "neutral to beneficial" and the WHO classified processed meats as carcinogenic. The question asks the classification of plant-based alternatives, which the article says is not carcinogenic. But the exact classification for plant-based is not given; the answer is that the WHO didn't classify them as carcinogenic. But the question is phrased as "what carcinogenic classification did the WHO assign to plant-based...", so the answer would be "not assigned" or N/A? Wait, the article says "processed meats... classified as carcinogenic to humans." The plant-based ones are compared to them but not classified as such. So the answer is N/A because the article doesn't state a classification for plant-based, only that they are not in the same category. Wait, the question is asking what classification the WHO assigned to plant-based alternatives. Since the article says they are not in the carcinogenic category, the answer might be "not carcinogenic" but the exact classification isn't mentioned. The question might be expecting "not classified as carcinogenic", but the article doesn't state an official classification. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The article states that plant-based meat and seafood had $1.2 billion in retail sales in 2023. The question also mentions Impossible changing packaging, which is in the same paragraph. So the answer is $1.2 billion.

6. **Question 6**: The consultants for Beyond Meat's reformulated products were Joy Bauer and Dr. Lederman. The question asks about the "health hub" initiative of Impossible Foods. Wait, the article says "Impossible Foods, which recently changed its packaging... launched a 'health hub'". The consultants mentioned for Beyond's products were Joy Bauer and Dr. Lederman. The question is about the health hub, which is from Impossible, but the consultants mentioned are for Beyond's reformulation. Wait, the article says "Impossible Foods launched a 'health hub' and rebranded..." but the consultants (Joy Bauer and Lederman) are mentioned in the context of Beyond's reformulated burgers. So the answer might be N/A because the health hub consultants aren't named. Wait, the question says "the co-author of 'The Whole Food Diet' books" which is Dr. Lederman, but the registered dietitian is Joy Bauer. The question asks for the name of the dietitian. So Joy Bauer.

7. **Question 7**: Impossible Foods is described as "on a path to profitability" with "strong balance sheet and no debt." The question asks for their debt in billions. The article says "no debt", so 0. But the question asks for the debt in billions, so maybe "0" but the answer format wants the number. However, the question is phrased as "what was the debt... in billions of dollars" and Impossible has "no debt" so 0. But the options might need "0" or "N/A". Wait, the question is about after launching faux chicken, but the article says Impossible has "no debt". So the answer is 0, but written as "0".

8. **Question 8**: The article mentions Michael Pollan as an influential writer who endorsed... Wait, no. It says Michael Pollan has been critical. The question asks who endorsed Beyond Meat's reformulated burgers. The article says "Dr. Lederman... patients swapped..." but no endorsement from Pollan. The question might be a trick because Pollan was critical. The article says "Even if more consumers are swayed by its products, Beyond Meat's challenges..." and mentions Michael Pollan as critical. So the answer is N/A because the article doesn't mention anyone endorsing, except maybe the doctors consulted. The question's premise is incorrect, so N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The article states that Beyond Meat reported revenue growth in Q3 2024, driven by increased prices. The question asks for the percentage increase. The article doesn't provide the exact percentage, so N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The Good Food Institute is mentioned as reporting that plant-based accounted for $1.2B vs conventional's $100B. The question asks which org reported that global meat consumption is declining. The article says "global meat consumption is growing" so the answer would be N/A because the org (Good Food Institute) says it's growing, not declining. The question's premise is wrong, so N/A.

11. **Question 11**: The article says Beyond Meat reformulated burgers with avocado oil and uses legumes directly. The question is which company confirmed this. Beyond Meat.

12. **Question 12**: Impossible Foods is noted as on a path to profitability with no debt, per the CEO's statement. So Impossible Foods.

13. **Question 13**: The review was led by Matthew Nagra, a naturopathic doctor in British Columbia.

14. **Question 14**: Governor Gavin Newsom of California, a Democrat.

15. **Question 15**: Impossible Foods changed packaging to blood red, aiming for "delicious and nutritious" as per McGuinness's statement. So Impossible Foods.

16. **Question 16**: Beyond Meat's stock collapsed from $234 to under $4 with over a billion in debt. So Beyond Meat.

17. **Question 17**: Ethan Brown of Beyond Meat says their process skips animals, using legumes. So Beyond Meat.

18. **Question 18**: Michael Pollan is mentioned as critical, advising against unrecognizable foods.

19. **Question 19**: The article states plant-based was $1.2B vs conventional's $100B. The total conventional is $100 billion.

20. **Question 20**: Both companies downplayed climate benefits in favor of health/taste. The primary driver previously was climate, so the answer is "climate benefits".
