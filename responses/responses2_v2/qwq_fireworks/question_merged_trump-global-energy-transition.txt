Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. 

1. The first question asks which European country's renewable investments influenced China's solar panel manufacturing. The article mentions Norway's incentives for electric cars and Saudi Arabia's 2030 goal, but nowhere does it say a European country's actions directly affected China's decisions. So N/A.

2. For Saudi Arabia's 2024 renewable capacity installed, the article states their 2030 goal but doesn't give 2024 numbers. So N/A.

3. Norway's GDP growth percentage from electric vehicles isn't mentioned. The article says 90% of new cars were electric, but not the GDP impact. N/A.

4. The petroleum minister mentioned is India's Hardeep Singh Puri, who said they might buy more US oil. The question asks who planned to reduce imports, but the article says the opposite. So N/A.

5. Wood Mackenzie's projection about US renewable market share decline isn't in the text. The expert Chris Seiple mentions the US is on a different trajectory, but no specific percentage. N/A.

6. The article mentions sanctions on Russia's exports but doesn't provide the total value. So N/A.

7. Britain's coal plant workers transitioning to renewables isn't discussed. The closure is mentioned, but job numbers aren't there. N/A.

8. The article says China set up EV factories in Thailand and Brazil. So Brazil is the South American country. Answer: Brazil.

9. The economic impact on US GDP from ceding markets isn't quantified in the text. Gallagher argues it's against national interest but no figure given. N/A.

10. The article states Australia increased LNG and Canada increased gas. Both are mentioned as climate leaders increasing fossil fuels. So Australia and Canada.
