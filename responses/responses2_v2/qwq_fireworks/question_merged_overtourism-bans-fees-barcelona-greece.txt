Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict instructions. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then check the article for the answers.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about a specific regenerative measure in Hawaii, similar to New Zealand's tax, mentioned by Rachel Dodds. The article says, "Some places, like New Zealand and Hawaii, are trying to do it as more of a regenerative or stewardship measure." So Hawaii's measure is the regenerative one. The answer should be Hawaii's specific measure. Wait, the article mentions New Zealand's tax of 100 NZD, but for Hawaii, the exact measure isn't specified beyond being part of a regenerative approach. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Wait, the question says "what specific regenerative measure... did Professor Rachel Dodds cite as being implemented in Hawaii..." The article states Dodds mentioned "New Zealand and Hawaii" as examples of regenerative. But the article doesn't list a specific measure for Hawaii, only New Zealand's tax. Since the question asks for the specific measure in Hawaii, but the article only mentions the approach (regenerative/stewardship) without specifics, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, but the question says "similar to New Zealand's increased tourist tax". The article says Hawaii is doing something similar in approach, but the exact measure isn't stated. So maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "regenerative measure akin to New Zealand's increased tourist tax". Since Hawaii is mentioned in the same breath as New Zealand's tax as part of a regenerative approach, but the article doesn't specify Hawaii's tax, perhaps the answer is "N/A".

2. **Question 2**: Bruges implemented a measure similar to Amsterdam's loophole-closing hotel restrictions. The article says Bruges "has halted new hotel construction". Amsterdam's later measure in 2024 was preventing adding more rooms or beds. So Bruges' measure is halting new hotels. That's the specific measure. So the answer is "halted new hotel construction".

3. **Question 3**: New Zealand's tourist tax in NZD. The article states: "New Zealand will require visitors to pay a tourist tax of 100 New Zealand dollars, or about $57 — about three times higher than it was for most of last year". So the answer is 100.

4. **Question 4**: Greece's percentage increase in foreign visitors in 2024. The article mentions "a 24.5 percent surge in foreign visitors in 2024 over the previous year is also behind an increased tax". So 24.5%.

5. **Question 5**: Amsterdam's 2016 measure. The article says "Amsterdam, which began targeting overtourism in 2016". It also mentions that in 2024 they passed a measure preventing adding rooms or beds. But the question is about what they began implementing in 2016. The article says Barcelona started with a tax in 2012, then rentals in 2015, hotel cap in 2017. For Amsterdam's 2016 start, the article says they "began targeting overtourism" but specifies that in 2024 they closed a loophole by preventing adding rooms. Wait, the question asks what specific measure they began in 2016. The article says "in Amsterdam, which began targeting overtourism in 2016". The specific measure they took earlier might be similar to Barcelona's steps, but the article doesn't specify exactly what. Wait, the article says "in November [2024], passed another measure that prevents them from adding more rooms or beds... after imposing a similar measure in 2024, only to discover that some accommodations were exploiting a loophole". So the initial 2016 measure isn't detailed here. Hmm. Wait, maybe the question is referring to the first step they took. The article says "Amsterdam began targeting overtourism in 2016" but the specific action isn't listed. Since the question is about a measure similar to Barcelona's 2012 tax, perhaps the answer is the "targeting overtourism" but without specifics, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "in Amsterdam, which began targeting overtourism in 2016". The question asks "what specific measure... did Amsterdam begin implementing in 2016 to address overtourism". Since the article doesn't specify the exact measure (like a tax or hotel cap), maybe it's N/A. Wait, but maybe the first measure was the initial steps like Barcelona's tax. Wait the article says "in 2024, Amsterdam passed another measure... after imposing a similar measure in 2024". Wait that seems conflicting. Wait, the article says "in 2024, Amsterdam... only to discover that some accommodations were exploiting a loophole, passed another measure in November that prevents them from adding more rooms or beds". So the initial measure in 2024 (not 2016) was the first one, then another in 2024. The 2016 start might have been a different action. The article doesn't specify. Therefore, the answer might be N/A. Wait, perhaps the 2016 action was the start of their measures, but the specific one is not mentioned. Since the question requires a specific measure, and the article doesn't list it, answer N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Professor Dodds suggested a metric other than arrival numbers. The article says "the conversation needs to be, how do we change the metrics of success?" and mentions "rethinking the definition of success". The article states that Bruges and Norway pulled ads, and some companies removed itineraries. But the specific metric isn't given. The question is asking for the specific metric Dodds suggested. The article says "Dodds... said that a solution requires rethinking the definition of success. 'U.N. Tourism still measures success by the number of arrivals... So the conversation needs to be, how do we change the metrics of success?'" So the answer is changing the metrics of success away from arrivals, but the question asks for "what specific metric". Since the article doesn't name a specific one, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, maybe the answer is "tourism's economic contribution" or something else? No, the article doesn't specify. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Japan's measure in Kyoto streets similar to South Korea's curfew. The article mentions "the mountain town of Ginzan Onsen recently joined Mount Fuji and some streets in Kyoto in restricting tourist numbers". So the specific measure in Kyoto is restricting tourist numbers, similar to South Korea's curfew. The answer would be "restricting tourist numbers".

8. **Question 8**: Total tourist tax for one week in Venice and Galapagos after increases. Venice's fee doubled to €10 (the article says "the rate doubles to 10 euros"). The Galapagos doubled its fee to $200. Wait, but the question asks for the total in one week. Venice's tax is per day? The article says "the rate doubles to 10 euros" (probably per person, per day?), and Galapagos is a one-time fee? The article says "the Galapagos Islands has doubled its fee to $200". Assuming that's a one-time entry fee. So for one week in Venice, 10 euros/day * 7 days = 70 euros. Galapagos is a flat $200. But the question asks total combined. Wait, the question is phrased as "total combined tourist tax amount now required for a visitor spending one week in both Venice and the Galápagos Islands after their respective fee increases in 2024?" So if someone visits both places, they pay Venice's daily tax for 7 days plus Galapagos' fee. But Venice's tax is per day? The article says "Venice's 5 euro fee, introduced last year, was hardly dissuasive. Venice seems to have reached the same conclusion: This year, the rate doubles to 10 euros." It doesn't specify if it's per day or a one-time. Since it's a tourist fee, likely per day. The Galapagos' fee is a one-time $200. So total would be 7*10€ + $200. But the question asks for the total amount, but the currencies are different (euros and USD). The question might expect just the numbers added, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the question assumes both are in their local currency? The article doesn't clarify if Venice's tax is per day. Alternatively, maybe Venice's tax is a one-time fee. Wait the article says "tourist tax in Venice" which is often per day. So assuming Venice's tax is 10 euros per day, 7 days would be 70 euros. Galapagos is 200 USD. But the question asks for total combined, but in which currency? The question says "amount" without specifying currency. Maybe it's expecting the sum as 70 + 200 = 270, but in their respective currencies. Since the question is about the total, maybe the answer is "270" but with the currencies, but since the question doesn't specify, maybe it's N/A? Wait the article says "the Galapagos Islands has doubled its fee to $200" (USD) and Venice's is 10 euros. The question asks for the total amount required, so adding them would need conversion, but since the article doesn't provide exchange rates, maybe the answer is 70 euros + $200. But the question might just want the numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the per-day and the one-time, so total is 10*7 + 200 = 270. The question might accept that as the numerical total, even if in different currencies. The article doesn't specify if the Venice tax is per day, but it's a tourist tax, which is typically per night. Assuming per day, the answer is 70 + 200 = 270. So the answer is 270.

9. **Question 9**: The European city that reduced café seating and souvenir stands by 30% and 70%, facing opposition over the 80% resident consent law. The article mentions Dubrovnik's mayor, Mato Frankovic, who reduced cruise ships, restricted rentals, cut café tables by 30%, souvenir stands by 70%, and faced business opposition. The national legislation about 80% resident consent is part of Dubrovnik's measures. So the answer is Dubrovnik.
