Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start by going through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks which celestial body's formation is compared to the collision speed of Charon and Pluto, which was 10 times slower. The article mentions that Charon's impact speed was about 2,000 mph, which is 10 times slower than Earth's moon-forming impact. So the answer should be Earth's moon.

2. **Question 2**: The spacecraft's data cited for Pluto's smaller moons is New Horizons, which observed the moons like Nix, Styx, Kerberos, and Hydra. The article says these were glimpsed when New Horizons flew past Pluto in 2015.

3. **Question 3**: The geological feature on Charon hypothesized due to ice loss. The text states Charon lost most of its ice to Pluto during the impact. So the answer would be loss of ice, but the question asks for a feature. The article mentions "resurfaced" Pluto but doesn't name a specific feature on Charon. Wait, the article says "Charon losing most of the ice on its surface to its companion." So maybe the answer is the loss of ice from Charon's surface. But the question asks for a geological feature. Hmm. The article doesn't specify a named feature like a crater or mountain, just mentions ice loss. Maybe the answer is "N/A" because it's not a specific feature. Wait, the question says "geological feature," but the text says "the entire surface of Pluto gets resurfaced, with Charon losing most of the ice." So maybe the answer is "loss of ice on its surface," but the question is about Charon's surface. The article says "Charon losing most of the ice on its surface to its companion." So the feature would be the loss of ice, but maybe phrased as "loss of ice" or "depletion of ice." The question asks for a geological feature, but the text doesn't name a specific one. Maybe "N/A" here? Wait, the question says "geological feature on Charon's surface hypothesized to have formed due to the loss of ice." Since the ice was lost, perhaps the feature is the lack of ice, but that's not a feature. Hmm, maybe the answer is "N/A" because it's not specified. Wait, but the text says "Charon losing most of the ice on its surface to its companion." So the answer would be the loss of ice from Charon's surface, but as a feature, maybe "depleted ice layer" or just "loss of ice". The question is phrased as "what geological feature...", but the article doesn't name a specific feature. So perhaps the answer is "N/A".

4. **Question 4**: How many rotations Pluto did during contact. The text says Pluto would have been rotating once every 3 hours, and the contact lasted about 10 hours. So 10 divided by 3 is roughly 3.33, but the text says "three times while joined together." So the answer is 3.

5. **Question 5**: Which other Kuiper belt object's moon system is analogous? The article says "the only comparable system is Earth and its moon." So Earth-Moon is the analogy. But the question is about another Kuiper belt object. Wait, the question asks which other Kuiper belt object's system could have formed via "kiss and capture." The article mentions "many other large binary objects also thought to exist in the Kuiper belt." But it doesn't name a specific one. So answer is N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Angular momentum reason for Charon staying bound. The text says "the angular momentum of the spinning Pluto would then have pushed Charon slowly away but, crucially, left it trapped in Pluto's orbit." So the answer is Pluto's angular momentum.

7. **Question 7**: Element abundance in Pluto's crust from Charon's rocks. The article says "If Charon deposited some of its rock into Pluto, you would be able to see that in gravity data." The question asks for an element, but the text mentions "rock" generally. Since rocks contain elements like silicon, iron, etc., but the article doesn't specify. So maybe "rock" is the answer, but the question asks for an element. Alternatively, "N/A" because no specific element is named. Wait, the question says "element's abundance", but the text refers to "rock", which is a material, not an element. So perhaps the answer is N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Collision duration compared to Earth's moon impact. The Charon collision lasted hours (about 10 hours), while Earth's was much faster. The article says "a relatively sedate speed of about 2,000 miles per hour — 10 times as slow as the Earth's moon-forming impact". The duration comparison isn't explicitly stated, but since speed is slower, perhaps the duration was longer. The question asks how the duration compares. The text says the Charon collision lasted "perhaps only hours" before separating, while Earth's was a single impact. The article states the Charon event lasted about 10 hours. Since Earth's moon-forming impact is assumed to have been much shorter (instantaneous?), the duration was longer. So answer is "longer".

9. **Question 9**: Observational feature contradicting full merger. The article mentions that the collision "resulted in Pluto and its quintet of moons orbiting the sun together today" and that they didn't merge. New Horizons data might show features like moons or surface features indicating no merger. The text says "the entire surface of Pluto gets resurfaced" which suggests a new surface, not a merged one. But the question asks for a detected feature contradicting merger. Maybe the presence of Charon as a separate moon is the evidence, but the question is about Pluto's surface. The article doesn't mention a specific feature detected by New Horizons that contradicts merger. So maybe N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Smaller moons from debris. The article lists Nix, Styx, Kerberos, and Hydra as the four smaller moons formed from the impact. The question asks for which one, but since it's plural, maybe the answer is all four, but the question says "hypothesized to have formed from debris". The answer would list all four, but the question asks for "which" (singular). Since it's multiple, but the question might expect one, perhaps N/A. Wait, the question says "which of Pluto's smaller moons is hypothesized...", so maybe all four are listed. The question is singular, so perhaps the answer is N/A because it's multiple. Alternatively, maybe one of them? The article says "the formation of Pluto's four other known moons... were glimpsed when New Horizons flew past". The simulation's prediction includes all four. Since the question is singular, but the answer is multiple, perhaps N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "Nix, Styx, Kerberos, and Hydra", but the question asks for one, so maybe N/A. Wait, the question says "smaller moons" (plural), but the wording is "which... is hypothesized", so singular. Hmm, perhaps the answer is N/A because it's multiple. Wait, the article says "the formation of Pluto's four other known moons... which are tiny compared with Charon". So the four are all hypothesized, but the question asks for "which" (singular), so maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "the four smaller moons" but the question wants a name. Since it's plural but the question is singular, perhaps N/A.

11. **Question 11**: What process prevented coalescence? The text says "the toughness of the two bodies prevented them from breaking apart" but wait, the article says "the toughness of the two bodies prevented them from breaking apart, Dr. Denton said." Wait, actually, the toughness might mean they stayed intact, but the reason they didn't merge was due to angular momentum. Wait, the article states "the two bodies collided and became ensnared without merging" because of their toughness? Or because of angular momentum? The question is asking which process prevented merging. The text says "the toughness of the two bodies prevented them from breaking apart", but the reason they didn't merge is because of their collision speed and angular momentum. Wait, the key sentence: "the toughness of the two bodies prevented them from breaking apart, Dr. Denton said." Wait, but the article says "they remained in contact for about 10 hours before gradually separating but remaining together. The researchers described this encounter as a 'kiss and capture.' The toughness of the two bodies prevented them from breaking apart". Wait, maybe the toughness prevented them from breaking apart into debris, allowing them to stay together but not merge into a single blob. So the answer is their toughness.

12. **Question 12**: Time they remained coupled. The text says "remained in contact for about 10 hours before gradually separating". So the duration is 10 hours.

13. **Question 13**: Speed of impact. The article states "a relatively sedate speed of about 2,000 miles per hour".

14. **Question 14**: Number of full spins during connection. The text says "Pluto would have been rotating once every three hours at the time (the length of a day on Pluto today is some 150 hours), so the two would have swung around three times while joined together." So three rotations.

15. **Question 15**: Transformative event on Pluto's surface. The article says "the entire surface of Pluto gets resurfaced" due to the impact. So the answer is "resurfacing".

16. **Question 16**: Number of moons. The article mentions Charon as the largest and the four others (total five). "quintet of moons" so five.

17. **Question 17**: Analogous characteristic to Earth-Moon. The article says "The reason that Pluto and Charon are so interesting is because Charon is 50 percent the size of Pluto. The only comparable system is Earth and its moon." So the size ratio.

18. **Question 18**: Elemental components. The article mentions both are "very rocky and icy". So "rocky and icy".

19. **Question 19**: Alteration to Charon's outer layer. The article says "Charon losing most of the ice on its surface to its companion." So loss of ice.

20. **Question 20**: Aspect of early Kuiper belt. The article mentions "the large number of objects believed to be drifting around the Kuiper belt in the early solar system" making collisional capture plausible. So "densely populated" or "large number of objects".

Now, checking each answer against the text:

1. Earth's moon (correct)
2. New Horizons (correct)
3. Maybe "loss of ice" but as a feature? The question is tricky. The text says "Charon losing most of the ice on its surface to its companion." So the feature is the loss of ice, but since it's absence, maybe "depleted ice" or just "loss of ice". The question asks for a geological feature, but the text doesn't name a specific feature. So N/A? Or is "loss of ice" acceptable? Since the question specifies a feature, maybe N/A. Hmm, the answer might be "N/A".

Wait, the article says "Charon losing most of the ice on its surface to its companion." So the geological feature would be the absence of ice, but that's not a feature. Alternatively, maybe "resurfacing" but that's on Pluto. So maybe N/A.

4. 3 (correct)
5. N/A (since no specific object named)
6. Pluto's angular momentum (correct)
7. Rock is mentioned, but the question asks for an element. Since rock includes elements, but no specific one, so N/A.
8. Longer (correct, since Charon's collision was slower and lasted hours, Earth's was faster and shorter)
9. N/A (the article doesn't mention a specific detected feature, just the presence of moons)
10. N/A (the question asks for a single moon but the answer is multiple)
11. Toughness (correct)
12. 10 hours (correct)
13. 2,000 mph (correct)
14. 3 (correct)
15. resurfacing (correct)
16. 5 (correct)
17. size ratio (correct)
18. rocky and icy (correct)
19. loss of ice (correct)
20. densely populated (correct, as per "many objects drifting around")

Wait for question 3: The article says "Charon losing most of the ice on its surface to its companion." The geological feature would be the loss of ice from Charon's surface. The question asks for a geological feature, so maybe "depleted ice layer" or "loss of ice". Since the article states it directly, maybe the answer is "loss of ice on its surface" but phrased as "loss of ice". The question says "geological feature", so maybe that's acceptable. Alternatively, the answer could be "N/A" because it's not a specific named feature like a crater. But the text does state that the ice was lost, so the feature is the absence, but perhaps the answer is "N/A".

Alternatively, the article says "the entire surface of Pluto gets resurfaced" but Charon's ice loss is mentioned. Since the question is about Charon's surface feature, maybe the answer is "loss of ice". Since the question allows for that, I'll go with "loss of ice".

Wait, the question says "geological feature on Charon's surface hypothesized to have formed due to the loss of ice". The loss of ice is the cause, but the resulting feature would be a lack of ice. Since that's a feature, maybe the answer is "loss of ice". So answer is "loss of ice".

Rechecking:

3. loss of ice on its surface → "loss of ice" is the answer.

9. The question asks for an observational feature detected by New Horizons that contradicts the merger. Since the presence of Charon and the other moons instead of a merged body is the evidence, but the article doesn't mention a specific surface feature detected by New Horizons indicating that. So N/A.

10. The four smaller moons are Nix, Styx, Kerberos, Hydra. The question asks for "which of Pluto's smaller moons is hypothesized..." (singular). Since it's plural in the text, but the question is singular, maybe N/A. Alternatively, if the answer expects one of them, but the text says all four, so the answer would be N/A.

Now, compiling all answers:

1. Earth's moon
2. New Horizons
3. loss of ice (or N/A if not considered a feature)
4. 3
5. N/A
6. Pluto's angular momentum
7. N/A
8. longer
9. N/A
10. N/A
11. toughness
12. 10 hours
13. 2000 mph
14. 3
15. resurfacing
16. 5
17. Charon is 50% the size of Pluto
18. rocky and icy
19. loss of ice
20. densely populated

Wait for question 7: The article says "If Charon deposited some of its rock into Pluto, you would be able to see that in gravity data." The question asks for an element's abundance. Since "rock" is a material, not an element, so N/A.

For question 17: The comparison is their size ratio. The article says "Charon is 50 percent the size of Pluto. The only comparable system is Earth and its moon." So the answer is the size ratio (Charon being 50% Pluto's size).

For question 18: "both very rocky and icy" → "rocky and icy".

For question 19: "loss of ice on its surface" → "loss of ice".
