Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. 

1. The first question asks which country offered tax incentives and also prioritized local films over American ones. The article mentions China as a country that shifted to local films and lists Britain, Hungary, Australia, and Canada as offering tax incentives. So the answer should be China.

2. The second question is about a natural disaster affecting Mel Gibson. The text says his Malibu home burned down in wildfires, which he referenced when accepting the role. So California wildfires.

3. The third question asks how many years of declining sales due to China's policy. The article says "recent years," but doesn't specify a number. So N/A.

4. Sylvester Stallone is linked to "Tulsa King," a streaming series. The article mentions that, so he's the answer.

5. The tax incentives are mentioned as offered by those countries, but the question asks for the policy. The article says "generous tax incentives," so that's the answer.

6. The question about an initiative tied to diversity programs' fear. The article mentions D.E.I. (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) retreat in the context of Trump's actions causing fear. So the D.E.I. Retreat section is the answer.

7. Jon Voight's role in five films. The article says he had small parts, but doesn't link that to his selection. So N/A.

8. Sylvester Stallone's conflict with projects? The article says he's in "Tulsa King," but no conflict mentioned. So N/A.

9. The question about Brooks Barnes collaborating with someone on tech protests. The article lists Brooks's other articles, but no mention of collaboration. So N/A.

10. Mel Gibson's Malibu house burned, and he mentioned ambassador residence. So Mel Gibson.

11. Jon Voight is 86 and in a film named "Reagan" (a president). So Jon Voight.

12. Sylvester Stallone is in "Tulsa King," so him again.

13. Trump's social media post appointing envoys. The answer is his social media post about special ambassadors.

14. Mel Gibson was ostracized and working on "Passion of the Christ 2." So Mel Gibson.

15. The actor with scandals linked to addressing production issues. Again Mel Gibson, since he's mentioned with scandals and the problem.

16. Jon Voight in "Reagan" film, so him.

17. Mel Gibson with scandals accepted the role. So Mel Gibson.

18. Sylvester Stallone in streaming's "Tulsa King," so him.

19. Mel Gibson again, as he's the controversial one chosen for rejuvenation.

Wait, let me check each again for accuracy. For question 5, the policy is tax incentives, which is directly stated. Question 6 refers to the D.E.I. section which mentions Trump's actions causing fear. The rest seems to align. I need to ensure all answers are directly from the text.
