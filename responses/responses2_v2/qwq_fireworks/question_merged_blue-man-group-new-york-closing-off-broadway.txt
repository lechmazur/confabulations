merged_blue-man-group-new-york-closing-off-broadway.txt
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions beyond that.

1. **Question 1: How many gallons of paint did the Chicago production of Blue Man Group use before it closed?**
   - The article mentions that the New York show used 82,150 gallons of paint over its run, but there's no specific number for Chicago. Since Chicago is closing, but the total isn't given, this must be N/A.

2. **Question 2: What color was the spot on Tobias Funke's back that he couldn't reach?**
   - The article states that Tobias painted himself blue except for a diamond spot he couldn't reach. The color isn't mentioned, so maybe it was the original skin color? But the question asks for the color of the spot. Since it says "except for that diamond spot on his back that he couldn't reach," the color isn't specified. Wait, the article says he painted himself blue except for that spot, so the spot wasn't blue. But the question is about the color of the spot. Since the text doesn't say, maybe it's the original skin color, but the article doesn't specify. Hmm, maybe it's implied to be not blue, but the exact color isn't given. So N/A?

3. **Question 3: What object did Micah St. George replicate in his parents' basement?**
   - The article says Micah made a replica tubulum in his parents' basement. So the answer is "tubulum".

4. **Question 4: Besides Boston, Las Vegas, and Berlin, where else was Cirque planning to have a show?**
   - The article mentions Orlando, Florida as a planned return gig. So "Orlando, Fla." or "Orlando".

5. **Question 5: Material sourced from Brooklyn factory for tubulum?**
   - The article says they used castoff plastic piping from a Brooklyn factory. So "plastic piping".

6. **Question 6: Name of Chris Wink's post-punk band?**
   - The article says Wink was a drummer in post-punk bands but doesn't name them. So N/A.

7. **Question 7: Year of debut on Jay Leno's Tonight Show?**
   - The article states they appeared a week into "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno" in 1992. So 1992.

8. **Question 8: Award show where they performed with Moby and Jill Scott?**
   - The article mentions they performed on the Grammy Awards show when their album was nominated. So "Grammy Awards".

9. **Question 9: What element did Fred Armisen incorporate into his comedy?**
   - The article says Fred incorporated the "idea of just doing something for fun, or for the hell of it" or "wordless, abstract – but not cynical – humor". The question asks for the element described by Wes Day. Wait, the exact quote from Armisen is about the "idea of just doing something for fun..." So the answer is "something for fun" or "abstract... not cynical"? Wait, the question says "element of the Blue Man character... described by Wes Day as central to the show's appeal". Wait, the article says Wes Day said: "It's just been spreading joy, sharing color and being awe-inspired at the world around it". The element from the character's description might be "awe-inspired at the world around it". Alternatively, Fred's approach was influenced by "the idea of just doing something for fun..." So maybe the answer is "awe-inspired at the world around it". Wait, the question says "element of the Blue Man character... described by Wes Day". The article says "the Blue Man is a quizzical but optimistic outsider, delighting in the quotidian... And that was the infectious experience of the production, too: 'It's just been spreading joy, sharing color and being awe-inspired at the world around it,' Day said." So the element is "awe-inspired at the world around it". But the question is asking what Fred incorporated. Wait, the article says Fred took "the idea of just doing something for fun..." So maybe the answer is "something for fun" but the question is phrased as what Wes Day described as central. Wait, the question says: "What element of the Blue Man character, described by Wes Day as central to the show's appeal, did Fred Armisen incorporate..." So Wes Day's description is "awe-inspired at the world around it". But Fred's takeaway was the "idea of just doing something for fun..." which might not be directly from Wes. Maybe I need to check again. The question is a bit tricky. The article says "the Blue Man vision influenced other artists. Fred Armisen... The material was wordless, abstract – but not cynical – and yet the audience was giddy. 'It was, for me, a new way of being funny,' Armisen said. 'The idea of just doing something for fun, or for the hell of it or for who knows why – that also implanted in me.'" So the element Fred took was "doing something for fun". But the question is asking for the element that Wes Day described. Since the question says "described by Wes Day as central to the show's appeal", and Day's quote is about "spreading joy, sharing color and being awe-inspired...", maybe the answer is "awe-inspired at the world around it". But the question connects it to what Fred incorporated. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is conflating, but according to the text, the element that Fred took is "doing something for fun". Since the question asks what Wes described as central, and that's what Fred incorporated, then the answer would be "awe-inspired at the world around it". Or maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question says "element of the Blue Man character, described by Wes Day as central to the show's appeal" which Fred incorporated. Since the article says Day's quote is "It's just been spreading joy, sharing color and being awe-inspired at the world around it," so the element is "awe-inspired at the world around it". The answer is that.

10. **Question 10: Seating capacity of the Public Theater?**
    - The article mentions the Public Theater is across from the Blue Man venue but doesn't state its seating capacity. So N/A.

Wait, let me confirm each again:

1. Chicago's paint gallons? N/A (only NY's total is given)
2. Tobias's back spot color? The article says he painted himself blue except for a diamond spot he couldn't reach. The color of the spot isn't stated, so N/A.
3. Micah's replica: tubulum. Yes.
4. Orlando is the planned return city. So answer Orlando.
5. Plastic piping from Brooklyn. Yes.
6. Wink's band name? Not mentioned. N/A.
7. 1992. Correct.
8. Grammy Awards. Yes.
9. The element from Wes Day's description is "awe-inspired at the world around it". But Fred took "doing something for fun". The question says the element that Wes described as central, which Fred incorporated. Since the question connects both, but the article says Fred took the "idea of just doing something...", perhaps the answer is that. Wait, the question might be a bit ambiguous. Let me recheck the exact text.

The article says: "the Blue Man vision influenced other artists. Fred Armisen... The material was wordless, abstract – but not cynical – and yet the audience was giddy. 'It was, for me, a new way of being funny,' Armisen said. 'The idea of just doing something for fun, or for the hell of it or for who knows why – that also implanted in me.'" 

The question asks: "What element of the Blue Man character, described by Wes Day as central to the show's appeal, did Fred Armisen incorporate..."

Wes Day's quote: "the Blue Man is a quizzical but optimistic outsider, delighting in the quotidian... And that was the infectious experience of the production, too: 'It's just been spreading joy, sharing color and being awe-inspired at the world around it,' Day said."

So the element described by Day is "spreading joy, sharing color and being awe-inspired at the world around it". The part Fred took was "the idea of just doing something for fun..." which is not directly from Day's quote. Therefore, the question might be a trick. Since the question says the element described by Wes Day that Fred incorporated, but Fred's takeaway was from the material's approach, not directly from Day's quote. Therefore, perhaps the answer is N/A, but maybe the question expects "awe-inspired at the world around it" even if Fred's was different. Alternatively, maybe the question is conflating, but according to the text, the answer would be "awe-inspired at the world around it" as that's what Day said, even if Fred took a different element. Since the question is phrased that way, I should go with Day's description. So the answer is "awe-inspired at the world around it".

10. Public Theater's capacity? Not mentioned. N/A.
