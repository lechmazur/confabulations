Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each question precisely as per the instructions. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **What specific percentage tariff did Trump threaten to impose on Canadian and Mexican products if they failed to address concerns about Chinese auto factories in Mexico?**
   - The article says Trump threatened a 25% tariff on products from Canada and Mexico. The reason mentioned includes Chinese companies in Mexico, so this should be the answer.

2. **Which international economic organization did Ana Swanson reference as overseeing the 2026 review process of the USMCA?**
   - The article doesn't mention any specific international organization like the WTO or NAFTA. The review is a joint one among the three countries. So maybe N/A.

3. **What was the original threshold for North American content in vehicles under NAFTA that the USMCA increased to qualify for zero tariffs?**
   - The article states USMCA raised the threshold but doesn't specify the original percentage. Since it's not given, answer N/A.

4. **Which U.S. state did Trump claim was most directly threatened by Chinese auto companies establishing factories in Mexico during his Detroit Economic Club speech?**
   - He spoke at the Detroit Economic Club, and Detroit is in Michigan. The article says he warned about Mexico becoming like China affecting U.S. car manufacturing, so Michigan might be implied here. But the exact state isn't stated. Wait, the article says he mentioned "car manufacturing" in general. Hmm, maybe N/A? Or maybe the question is asking for the state where the speech was, which is Michigan, but the question is about the threatened state. The article doesn't specify a state, so probably N/A.

5. **How many public comments did Trump's executive order direct agencies to collect before the 2026 review of the trade deal?**
   - The article says to "begin soliciting public comments" but doesn't specify a number. So N/A.

6. **What specific date did Trump initially propose for imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico before delaying the decision pending further negotiations?**
   - The article says he planned to move forward with tariffs on Feb. 1. That's the date mentioned.

7. **Which Mexican industry, besides automotive, did Trump accuse of violating trade terms by exceeding export limits to the U.S.?**
   - The article mentions Mexico violating a separate agreement to limit metal exports. So the metal industry.

8. **What was the primary reason Mexico and Canada insisted on delaying the USMCA review until 2026, according to the unnamed negotiation source?**
   - The article states they wanted to get through a second Trump administration. So the reason is avoiding a second Trump term.

9. **Which provision of the USMCA did Trump's team explicitly blame for failing to prevent Chinese auto parts from entering the U.S. via Mexico?**
   - The article says they think the terms (like the rules of origin for autos) weren't restrictive enough. The specific provision might be the rules governing the auto sector, but the exact name isn't given. Maybe N/A?

10. **What specific metric did Trump's executive order require agencies to analyze regarding the impact of the USMCA on American dairy farmers?**
    - The article doesn't mention dairy farmers specifically. It talks about workers, farmers, and businesses. Since the question asks for a specific metric, but it's not detailed, N/A.

11. **Considering the president's warning to impose tariffs on products from the two nations for allowing undesired flows at the border, what percentage tariff did he threaten to implement?**
    - Same as question 1, 25% again.

12. **Reflecting on the originally scheduled review process of the trade pact, how many years after the deal was activated was the joint review supposed to occur before any early renegotiations?**
    - The review is after six years, so the answer is 6.

13. **Linking changes to automotive production rules and trade exemptions, which production requirement was raised as part of the trade deal alterations in order to qualify vehicles for tariff-free status?**
    - The article mentions raising the threshold of a vehicle's content produced in North America, so the North American content requirement.

14. **Based on the president’s earlier comments regarding the influence of foreign competitors in auto manufacturing, which nation did he metaphorically liken Mexico to, thereby implying a shift in production dynamics?**
    - The article says he called Mexico "the second China."

15. **Integrating the trade negotiation plans with another related trade dispute mentioned in the text, which country is alleged to be violating a separate agreement by over-exporting metal to the U.S.?**
    - Mexico is accused of violating a separate agreement on metal exports.

16. **Considering the timeline discussions and the strategic advantages for his administration, what future administrative scenario did Mexico and Canada hope to secure by delaying the trade review until the period beyond the current term?**
    - They hoped to get through a second Trump administration, so avoiding another Trump term.

17. **Taking into account the new directive issued through an executive order, what collective body was urged to provide feedback as part of the preparatory steps for the upcoming trade pact review?**
    - The public, as the order directed soliciting public comments.

18. **By synthesizing the concerns over auto industrial policies and competitive pressures, which nation’s companies are reported to be expanding their exports of vehicles and auto parts via operations in Mexico?**
    - Chinese companies.
