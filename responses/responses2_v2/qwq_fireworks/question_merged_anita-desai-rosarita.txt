Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then scanning the article for the answers.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions that "Rosarita" links the Indian Partition of 1947 with another historical event in Mexico. The text says it's the Mexican Revolution, which began in 1910. So the answer should be the Mexican Revolution.

2. **Question 2:** The question asks about two artists who collaborated with Satish Gujral in Mexico. The article states he studied with Diego Rivera and other Mexican muralists. The other names mentioned here are not given, but the key one is Diego Rivera. Wait, the question says "two artists," but the text only explicitly mentions Diego Rivera. The others might be implied as muralists like Orozco or Siqueiros, but since the article doesn't name them, maybe it's just Diego Rivera. Hmm, maybe the question is expecting Diego Rivera and another, but since only one is named, perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "as mentioned in the context of 'Rosarita''s thematic inspiration?" The article says "studied with Diego Rivera and other Mexican muralists." Since only Diego is named, but the question asks for two, maybe the answer is N/A? Or maybe the other is not specified, so maybe just Diego Rivera? Wait, the question says "two artists collaborated with Satish Gujral during his time in Mexico, as mentioned..." Since the article only mentions Diego Rivera specifically, perhaps the second is not named here. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question might be expecting Diego Rivera and another, but since others are not named, maybe I should put Diego Rivera as one, but since two are needed, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "studied with Diego Rivera and other Mexican muralists"—so "other muralists" but not their names. Since the question requires two names, and only one is given, answer is N/A? Hmm, tricky. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering Diego Rivera and the "other Mexican muralists" as a group, but the question asks for two specific names. Since the article only gives Diego Rivera's name, the answer is N/A.

Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The exact line: "the Punjabi artist Satish Gujral, who studied with Diego Rivera and other Mexican muralists". The question asks for two artists. The article mentions Diego Rivera and "other Mexican muralists", but doesn't name the others. Since the question asks for two, but only one is named, the answer would be N/A. Because we can't list two artists since only one is specified.

3. **Question 3:** The article describes "Rosarita" as set in San Miguel de Allende, but does it mention any specific architectural or geographical feature central to the ghostly atmosphere? The article says it's a "ghostly meditation" but doesn't specify a particular feature like a building or landscape. So maybe N/A. Wait, the question is about the setting's feature contributing to the ghostly atmosphere. The text doesn't mention a specific place like a mine or a specific building, so N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Salman Rushdie compared Desai's style in "The Zigzag Way" to another Latin American author, diverging from his Austen comparison. Wait, the article says that for "Rosarita", Rushdie says it's more like Borges than Austen. But the question is about "The Zigzag Way". Wait, the article says: "Rosarita" signals a 'new departure for Anita,' he added; with its air of mystery and otherworldliness, it suggests Jorge Luis Borges more than Austen." So the comparison to Borges is for "Rosarita", not "The Zigzag Way". The question is about "The Zigzag Way". The article might not mention "The Zigzag Way" in relation to Rushdie's comparison. Wait, the article mentions "The Zigzag Way" as another work set in Mexico. The Rushdie quote is about "Rosarita". So maybe the answer is N/A because the question is about "The Zigzag Way" but the article doesn't link that to Borges. So answer is N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The novella's mother's artistic past is set in which decade? The article says the mother's past as an artist in 1950s Mexico. So 1950s.

6. **Question 6:** The first visit to America, she encountered a filmmaker whose surname is mentioned alongside another. The article says she came to visit the filmmakers Ismail Merchant and James Ivory. Their surnames are Merchant and Ivory. The question asks for the filmmaker's last name mentioned alongside another. So either Merchant or Ivory. Since the question says "the filmmaker whose surname is mentioned alongside another", the answer could be Merchant or Ivory. Since the question asks for the surname, perhaps the answer is Merchant and Ivory. But the question says "what is that filmmaker’s last name?" implying one. Wait, the question says "collaborated with Satish Gujral" but that's not here. Wait, the first visit: "to visit the filmmakers Ismail Merchant and James Ivory". The question is asking for the filmmaker's last name mentioned alongside another. So the answer is either Merchant or Ivory. The question says "the filmmaker whose surname is mentioned alongside another", so the answer could be either. Since the question is asking for the surname of the filmmaker (singular) mentioned alongside another, perhaps the answer is Merchant and Ivory. Wait, but the question says "what is that filmmaker’s last name?" Maybe it's expecting both names, but the question says "surname" (singular). Wait, maybe the answer is "Merchant and Ivory" but the question might expect one. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the first name mentioned, which is Merchant. Hmm. Let me check the article again. The exact line: "to visit the filmmakers Ismail Merchant and James Ivory". The question asks for the surname of the filmmaker whose surname is mentioned alongside another. So the two surnames are Merchant and Ivory. The question wants the surname (one of them) but since both are mentioned, perhaps the answer is either. But the question is phrased as "what is that filmmaker’s last name?" So maybe either is acceptable. Since the question is from the first visit, perhaps the answer is Merchant and Ivory, but the question asks for one surname. Wait, maybe it's expecting both. Wait the question says "what is that filmmaker’s last name?" (singular). So perhaps the correct answer is either one. But since the question is about the first visit, maybe the answer is Merchant (since it's first), but I think the correct answer is both. However, since the question asks for the surname (singular), maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting the two names as the answer. But the instructions say to answer in a sentence fragment or words. Since the question says "surname" (singular), but the two are mentioned, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, no. The question says "the filmmaker whose surname is mentioned alongside another". So the filmmaker (either one) has a surname mentioned alongside another. The surname would be either Merchant or Ivory. Since the question is asking for the surname, maybe it's expecting both, but since it's singular, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, maybe the question is asking for the surname of the filmmaker mentioned alongside another person. Since both are mentioned, the answer would be either Merchant or Ivory. Since the article lists them as "Ismail Merchant and James Ivory", the first surname is Merchant, the second Ivory. The question is asking for the surname of the filmmaker (either one) mentioned alongside another. Since both are mentioned, but the question is phrased to get one, perhaps the answer is Merchant and Ivory. But since the question asks for the surname (singular), maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the question is looking for the two surnames, but the answer should list both. Since the instructions say to answer in words, maybe "Merchant and Ivory". Let me check the exact question again: "what is that filmmaker’s last name?" So the filmmaker (singular) whose surname is mentioned alongside another (the other filmmaker). So the answer is either Merchant or Ivory. Since the question is phrased to get the surname, perhaps the answer is "Merchant" or "Ivory". But the article mentions both. Since the question is about the first visit, perhaps the answer is Merchant and Ivory. Wait, maybe the question is referring to the first name mentioned. The first surname is Merchant. So the answer is Merchant.

7. **Question 7:** The country that's surrealistic and reminiscent of her cultural roots is Mexico, as stated in the article: "It's strange because it's so like India, I feel utterly at home there. And yet there's something about Mexico that's surrealistic rather than realistic." So Mexico.

8. **Question 8:** The season's severity that made her seek refuge in Mexico. The article says she moved to the US in the mid-1980s and the harsh winters prompted her to go to Oaxaca. So winter.

9. **Question 9:** The family member who debuted in the late 90s and got a Booker Prize is her daughter Kiran. The article says Kiran's debut was "Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard" in 1998, and her later book won the 2006 Booker Prize. So Kiran Desai.

10. **Question 10:** The work that's an elegy for Urdu poetry and was adapted into a Merchant-Ivory film is "In Custody".

11. **Question 11:** The historic Indian locale frequently depicted in her early writings is Old Delhi, as mentioned: "That Old Delhi home and life was the one I knew best, the one I wrote about constantly".

12. **Question 12:** The author compared to Desai's style is Jane Austen, as per Rushdie's comment: "Both Anita and Austen present a deceptively quiet and gentle surface...".

13. **Question 13:** The literary form she favors is the novella, as she mentions the novella form allows her to finish before it exhausts her: "It doesn't take the immense energy and stamina that the novel requires... You can finish it before it finishes you."

14. **Question 14:** The color suggested in the title "Rosarita" – "Rosarita" sounds like "rosa", which is Spanish for red or pink. The article mentions the novella's setting in San Miguel de Allende, but doesn't explicitly state the color. However, "Rosarita" might imply "rosa" (pink/red). Since the question says "subtly suggested", maybe the answer is "rosa" (pink/red), but the article doesn't mention the color. Alternatively, maybe "Rosarita" is a name, not a color. The question might be a trick. Since the article doesn't mention a color, answer N/A. Wait, the question says "which color is subtly suggested in Desai’s latest narrative..." The title is "Rosarita". "Rosarita" could be derived from "rosa" (rose), so perhaps the color is pink or red. But the article doesn't state this, so the answer is N/A.
