Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article and answer strictly based on that. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks what percentage of the California FAIR plan's $458 billion exposure in September was directly attributed to private insurers dropping 2.8 million policies between 2020-2022 according to RBC's Heleniak. The article mentions that the FAIR plan's exposure increased to $458 billion by September, and that private insurers dropped 2.8 million policies during 2020-2022. However, it doesn't specify the percentage of the exposure directly linked to that drop. So I think this is N/A.

2. The Supreme Court denied Trump's reprieve, and the proceeding was "set to take place this morning" after the denial. The article mentions the denial and the proceeding happening "this morning," but without specific dates, I can't determine the days between. Wait, the article says "the proceeding is set to take place this morning and will formalize..." So if the denial was the last-minute bid, the sentencing was the next day? The article might not give exact days, so maybe it's the same day, but the question asks how many days after. Since the timeline isn't clear, maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "the proceeding is set to take place this morning" after the denial, so the same day? But the question says "how many days after" the denial. If the denial was on the same day, then 0 days. Hmm, but the exact timeline isn't clear. The article doesn't specify days between, so perhaps N/A.

Wait, let me check again. The article says the Supreme Court "rejected the president-elect's last-minute bid to halt his sentencing in the New York case, noting that he doesn't face jail time and he could appeal his conviction. The proceeding is set to take place this morning and will formalize Trump's status..." The denial happened, and the proceeding is "this morning." So if the denial was on Thursday, and the proceeding is Friday morning, then 1 day. Wait, the first part of the article mentions the wildfires are ongoing overnight and "critical red flag conditions to continue on Friday before the hurricane-force winds... subside in the afternoon." The Supreme Court section is after that, but the timeline markers: the wildfires part is current, then the Supreme Court part says "the proceeding is set to take place this morning," so "this morning" from the article's perspective (when written). The exact days aren't specified, so maybe the answer is N/A because there's no numerical value given. Hmm, tricky. The question might be expecting 1 day, but since the article doesn't explicitly state, maybe N/A.

Wait the article says "the proceeding is set to take place this morning" after the denial. So the denial and the proceeding are on the same day? Then the answer would be 0 days. But the question says "how many days after the Supreme Court denied Trump's reprieve... was his sentencing proceeding scheduled to occur?" If the denial happened and then the proceeding is "this morning" (same day), then 0. But maybe the article's timeline is such that the denial was on Thursday, and the proceeding is on Friday. The first part mentions "Forecasters expected 'critical red flag' conditions to continue on Friday before the hurricane-force winds..." so maybe the article is written on Thursday, and the sentencing is Friday. If the denial was on Thursday, then the proceeding is the next day, so 1 day. But the article doesn't explicitly say the number of days. Since it's not stated, I think the answer is N/A.

Hmm, maybe the question is expecting that the proceeding is scheduled the same day, so 0 days? The question might be a trick, but without exact days, probably N/A.

Moving on to question 3: The specific date for the TikTok ban. The article says "the law requiring ByteDance to sell to non-Chinese buyers -- or face a ban. TikTok is seeking to block the law. And President-elect Donald Trump has asked the high court to delay the ban, set to take place the day before his inauguration..." So the ban is set for the day before Trump's inauguration. The article doesn't state the exact date, so N/A. The question asks for the specific date, which isn't provided, so N/A.

4. The two former government officials at Paul Weiss who worked in the same Justice Department component as Damian Williams (who was a U.S. attorney in the Southern District). The article mentions that Paul Weiss has recruited Loretta Lynch (former AG and US attorney in Brooklyn) and Jeh Johnson (ex-sec homeland sec). The Southern District is part of the DOJ. Loretta Lynch was a US attorney in Brooklyn, which is a different district. The question asks for those who worked in the same component as Damian Williams (Southern District US attorney). The article says Paul Weiss has Loretta Lynch (Brooklyn) and Jeh Johnson (not a US attorney). Wait, the article says "Paul, Weiss has recruited a number of former government officials, including Loretta Lynch, who served two stints as US attorney in Brooklyn and later was AG under Obama; and Jeh Johnson, a former sec of homeland security." So neither of them were in the Southern District. The question is which two former officials at Paul Weiss worked in the same component (Southern District US attorney role) as Williams. Since the article only mentions Lynch (Brooklyn) and Johnson (not a US attorney), perhaps there are none mentioned? Wait, the question says "based on their described roles". The article mentions "Jeh Johnson, a former secretary of homeland security" so not part of the same. The answer might be N/A because there are no two mentioned. Wait, the article also mentions "UBS is said to be near a deal..." but that's unrelated. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to Lynch and someone else? Wait, the article says "Paul, Weiss has recruited a number of former government officials, including Loretta Lynch and Jeh Johnson..." so maybe the answer is N/A because none of them were in the Southern District. But the question says "two former government officials now at Paul Weiss worked in the same Justice Department component as Damian Williams prior to his private sector move". The component here is the Southern District US Attorney's office. Since Lynch was in Brooklyn, and Johnson not a US attorney, then N/A. So answer N/A.

5. The percentage decline in restaurant tipping Jenni Emmons reflects. The article says "Tipping at restaurants hit a six-year low last year, according to The Wall Street Journal, with rising menu prices and increasing demands for gratuities being blamed. JPMorgan Chase..." Then mentions Jenni Emmons as a server. The question asks what percentage decline her experience reflects compared to the six-year low. But the article doesn't state the percentage decline, just that it hit a low. So N/A.

6. The energy sector acquisition citing cryptocurrency mining demand. The article says "Constellation Energy agreed to buy Calpine... in a bet on increased demand for power by tech companies." The question asks if it specifically cited cryptocurrency mining. The article says "tech companies" but not specifically crypto. So N/A.

7. Financial instrument maintaining value despite losses: The article mentions "One group that appears to have been spared so far: holders of catastrophe bonds, which have largely held their value even as local insurance losses mount." So the answer is catastrophe bonds.

8. The state-backed coverage plan on brink of insolvency after one season: The article says "the California FAIR plan... was 'one bad fire season away from complete insolvency'... The FAIR plan's exposure soared by 61 percent..." So the answer is California FAIR plan.

9. Time of labor report: "The report is due at 8:30 a.m. Eastern." So 8:30 a.m. Eastern.

10. Publicly traded company's market value referenced for TikTok without algorithm: The article says McCourt valued TikTok without the algorithm at around $20 billion, which is "roughly the market value of Snap, the parent company of Snapchat." So Snap.

11. Former US attorney recruited by Paul Weiss: Damian Williams was recruited by Paul Weiss, so the answer is Damian Williams. Wait, the question says "which former U.S. attorney was recruited by a prominent firm, noted for leading several high-stakes investigations?" The article says Damian Williams joined Paul Weiss. The answer is Damian Williams.

12. Institution pausing government bond purchases: The article mentions "China's central bank pauses purchases..." So People's Bank of China.

13. Projected insured damage: "insured losses could top $20 billion" according to Heleniak. The previous record was $12.5 billion. So $20 billion.

14. Year of Damian Williams' appointment: The article says he was appointed by Biden in October 2021. So 2021.

15. Unique status from Supreme Court: The proceeding will formalize his status as the first felon to occupy the Oval Office. So first felon.

16. Constellation's acquisition amount: $16.4 billion for Calpine.

Let me check each again quickly:

1. N/A (no % given linking exposure to policy drop)
2. N/A (no days specified)
3. N/A (date not given)
4. N/A (no two mentioned in Southern District roles)
5. N/A (no percentage given for her case)
6. N/A (tech companies, not crypto specifically)
7. catastrophe bonds
8. California FAIR plan
9. 8:30 a.m. Eastern
10. Snap
11. Damian Williams (but the question says "former U.S. attorney recruited...", so yes, he is the answer)
Wait the question says "which former U.S. attorney was recruited by a prominent firm...", so the answer is Damian Williams. The question is correct. The answer is Damian Williams.

12. People's Bank of China
13. $20 billion
14. 2021
15. first felon to occupy the Oval Office
16. $16.4 billion
