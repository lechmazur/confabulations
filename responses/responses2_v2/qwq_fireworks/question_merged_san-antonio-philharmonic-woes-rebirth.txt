Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly what's asked without any extra info.

1. **Annual budget of the San Antonio Symphony before bankruptcy?** The article mentions financial problems worsened by the pandemic but doesn't state the actual budget. So, N/A.

2. **How many musicians from the original Symphony declined to join?** The text says the Philharmonic has 70 members, about half from the Symphony. If the Symphony had 72, then 70/2 ≈35 joined, so 72-35=37 declined? Wait, the Symphony had 72 players, and Philharmonic has about half, so 36. 72-36=36 declined. But the exact number isn't given. The article says "half of whom played in the San Antonio Symphony." So half of 70? Wait, Philharmonic has 70, half from Symphony. So 35 from Symphony, meaning 72-35=37 didn't join. But the article doesn't specify the exact number who declined. So N/A.

3. **Major donor for the Scottish Rite Cathedral?** The article says they hoped to secure private donations and government aid but doesn't name a specific donor. N/A.

4. **Average attendance rate in first season?** No data on attendance rates provided. N/A.

5. **Ticket revenue increase after community programs?** No figures given on revenue changes. N/A.

6. **Percentage of $40M secured?** The article mentions needing over $40M but doesn't say how much is secured yet. N/A.

7. **Guest conductor before Kahane?** Kahane is the music director now, but the article doesn't mention an inaugural conductor before him. N/A.

8. **Outstanding loans in lawsuit?** The lawsuit mentions loans for a music library and band shell, but the amount isn't specified. N/A.

9. **Board members resigned during power struggles?** The article says the board was paralyzed by power struggles, and a former member sued, but doesn't state how many resigned. N/A.

10. **Monthly salary under old contract?** The article says base pay was $160 per concert/reheal, but doesn't mention monthly salary. N/A.

11. **Years between Symphony founding (1939) and first rehearsal in 2023?** The Philharmonic's first rehearsal in the cathedral was in November 2023. 2023-1939 = 84 years. But the article says the Symphony was founded in 1939. So 2023-1939=84. Answer is 84.

12. **Pay increase percentage?** Old was $160 per concert, new is $184. The increase is 24. (184-160)/160 = 15%. So 15%.

13. **City's orchestra model referenced by Mark Volpe?** The article mentions New Orleans, Kansas City, Denver, etc. But Volpe says "they have to show a united front" but doesn't specify a particular city. Wait, the sentence before: "San Antonio hopes to follow the example of other orchestras that have emerged from bankruptcies... in places like New Orleans; Kansas City, Mo.; Denver and elsewhere." But Volpe's quote doesn't name a specific city. So the question asks which city Mark Volpe referenced. The answer is N/A because he didn't mention a specific one.

14. **Originally scheduled weeks for 2024-25 season?** The current season is 18 weeks, compared to previous 26. So before cuts, was it 26? The article says the Philharmonic's season is now 18 weeks, compared to 26 previously. The 2024-25 season had financial cuts leading to trims. So the original was 26? Wait, the Symphony had 26 weeks before, but the Philharmonic's current is 18. The question is about the Philharmonic's 2024-25 season's original schedule. The article says "financial strains have forced the orchestra to make last-minute trims to its season." But it's unclear if the original was longer. The only number given is that the Symphony had 26 weeks. The Philharmonic's season is now 18, but perhaps the original was 18? The article says "the season is 18 weeks long, compared with 26 weeks previously." The "previously" refers to the Symphony. So the Philharmonic's current is 18, which might have been the original plan. The question is about the 2024-25 season's original schedule before cuts. Since it's now 18, but they had to trim, maybe the original was more? The article doesn't specify. So N/A.

15. **Community initiative with west side offices?** The article says they opened offices on the west side to make arts accessible. The specific initiative is "opening offices on the west side." But the question asks for a specific initiative launched in partnership. The text mentions "opened offices... part of its efforts to make the arts more accessible." Maybe the answer is the offices themselves, but the question asks for an initiative like a program. Since the article doesn't name a specific program, N/A.

16. **Instrument Lauren Eberhart played?** She is a trumpet player. The answer is trumpet.

17. **Total lawsuits filed against Philharmonic before 2024?** The article mentions a lawsuit by David Wood and Colette Holt, and the Philharmonic filed a countersuit. That's one lawsuit (theirs was a countersuit). So one lawsuit against them, but the question says "filed against" – the couple sued them, so that's one lawsuit. The answer is 1.

18. **Cost of music library and band shell?** The lawsuit mentions loans to acquire these items, but the amount isn't stated. N/A.

19. **Pop star at lucha libre in 2023?** The article says they played with Christopher Cross, who's from San Antonio, and "Selena Vive" this month (article's current time is when it was written, but the question specifies 2023. The article mentions "in recent months" including Christopher Cross. Since the Philharmonic was formed after 2022, and the article is from 2023/2024, so Christopher Cross is the answer.

20. **Full-time staff resigned during transition?** The article mentions staff turnover but no specific number. N/A.
