Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly.

1. The first question asks which state's DMV sent letters about tripling registration fees starting in 2024. The article mentions Vermont's DMV sent letters about doubling the fee to $178 starting Jan 1. Wait, the question says "tripling" but the article says "twice as much". Hmm, maybe a mistake here. Since the article says Vermont's fee is twice the regular, but the question says tripling. Since the question's premise is incorrect, I should answer N/A. Wait, but the question says "tripling of registration fees starting in 2024". The article says Vermont's fee starts Jan 1 (assuming 2024 is the year mentioned?), but the article's date isn't clear. Wait, the article's first paragraph says "starting Jan 1 they would have to pay $178 a year, twice as much as owners of vehicles with internal combustion engines." The article might not specify the year, but the question mentions 2024. Since the article doesn't mention the year 2024 explicitly, maybe it's N/A. Wait, but maybe the question is referring to the current context. Alternatively, maybe the article's example is Vermont, so the answer is Vermont. But the fee is doubled, not tripled. So the question's premise is wrong, so answer N/A.

Wait, the question says "tripling" but the article says "twice as much". So since the question's fact is wrong, the answer is N/A. So I should answer N/A for question 1.

2. The second question is about Texas's revenue from their $200 fee in the first six months. The article doesn't mention any specific numbers about revenue generated. So N/A.

3. The third question asks the percentage of the Highway Trust Fund shortfall attributed to EV adoption per a Congressional analysis. The article mentions Baumhefner's statement that EVs aren't the main cause, and that they're 2% of total vehicles. But there's no specific percentage from a Congressional analysis. The article says "not the main cause of revenue gaps" but doesn't give a percentage. So N/A.

4. The fourth question: which Democratic governor proposed matching rebates for EVs if federal credits end? The article says California's Newsom said his state would step in. So the answer is Gavin Newsom.

5. Fifth question: average annual mileage in Vermont's pilot. The article mentions Vermont plans to use odometer readings starting in 2026, but there's no data on average mileage tracked yet. The question is about a pilot program that's planned, not implemented yet. So N/A.

6. Sixth question: number of charging stations built with fees. The article says fees are earmarked for infrastructure like chargers, but no specific number. So N/A.

7. Seventh question: formula Texas used for $200 fee. The article says Nichols said they analyzed how much gas vehicle owners pay. But the exact formula isn't specified. The answer would be "based on average gasoline tax revenue" but the question asks for the mathematical formula, which isn't provided. So N/A.

8. Eighth question: which environmental group studied Wyoming's fees. The article mentions NRDC's Baumhefner criticizing fees as punitive but doesn't mention a specific study on Wyoming by an org. The article says Consumer Reports cited Texas as overcharging, but not Wyoming. So N/A.

9. Ninth question: percentage in NJ opting for mileage-based instead of $250. The article mentions NJ has a $250 fee but doesn't say anything about mileage-based options or participation rates. So N/A.

10. Tenth question: Rivian's contribution to infrastructure with the $6B loan. The article states the loan is for the factory but doesn't mention infrastructure contributions. So N/A.

11. Eleventh question: state with gas tax below average and EV fee double the standard. The article says Texas has a $200 fee (double? Let's see: regular registration fee plus $200. Wait, the article says "on top of the regular registration fee", so the EV fee is an extra $200. If the regular fee is, say, X, then the EV pays X + 200. But the question states "double the amount of its standard registration fee". Wait, maybe Texas's EV fee is $200, and their regular fee is lower? The article says Texas' gas tax is 20c, below the average. So the state in question is Texas, because it has a low gas tax and charges $200 extra, which might be double the regular fee. Wait, the question says "annual fee that is double the amount of its standard registration fee for ICE vehicles". So the EV fee is double the standard. The article says in Texas, the EV fee is $200 "on top of the regular registration fee". So the total would be regular + $200, but the question is about the fee being double the standard. Unless the $200 is double. For example, if the standard is $100, then $200 is double. The article doesn't give the regular fee amount for ICE vehicles in Texas. But the question says "the fee is double". The article says "in imposing the higher fee, Vermont became the latest state to make people pay a premium... including $50 in Hawaii and $200 in Texas". So the $200 is the additional fee. The question is asking which state has the EV fee (the additional part) equal to double the standard registration fee. Since the article states Texas charges $200, and if that's double the standard fee, then Texas is the answer. Since the question specifies "gas tax below the national average", which Texas has (20c vs 50c average), so answer is Texas.

12. Twelfth question: Robert Nichols' primary reason for the fee. The article quotes him saying "everybody needs to pay for the road" and mentions that it's not anti-EV. So the main reason is to ensure all drivers contribute to road funding.

13. Thirteenth question: progressive state with $250 fee and high gas tax. The article says New Jersey has a high gas tax (more than twice Texas') and charges $250. Since NJ is a blue state, the answer is New Jersey.

14. Fourteenth question: Republican-led state with Tesla factory and $200 fee. The article mentions Texas has Tesla's HQ and factory, and charges $200. So Texas.

15. Fifteenth question: Chris Harto's criticism of flat fees. The article says he mentions it's unfair to low-income drivers and gas guzzlers aren't penalized as per-gallon taxes do. So the criticism is that flat fees are unfair to low-income and don't tax based on usage, unlike gas taxes which do.
