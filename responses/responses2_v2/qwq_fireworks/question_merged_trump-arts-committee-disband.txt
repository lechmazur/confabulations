Okay, let me go through each question one by one based on the article provided. 

1. The question asks which former Goldman Sachs executive served as co-chair alongside Lady Gaga on Biden's revived arts committee. The article mentions Robert Menschel as a former Goldman Sachs partner. When Biden revived the committee, the co-chairs were Lady Gaga and Bruce Cohen. Wait, but Bruce Cohen isn't mentioned as a Goldman Sachs person. Wait, looking back: "Biden named 31 members, including... the co-chairs were the singer Lady Gaga and the producer Bruce Cohen". Robert Menschel was a former Goldman Sachs partner but that was under Reagan/Clinton times. The current co-chairs are Lady Gaga and Bruce Cohen, but Bruce isn't Goldman Sachs. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question is about the co-chair alongside Lady Gaga. Since Bruce Cohen isn't a Goldman Sachs exec, then the answer would be N/A? Wait, but the question says "former Goldman Sachs executive". The article says Robert Menschel was a former Goldman Sachs partner, but he wasn't a co-chair in Biden's time. The co-chairs were Lady Gaga and Bruce Cohen. Since Bruce Cohen isn't mentioned as a Goldman Sachs person, the answer is N/A. Wait but maybe I missed someone else. The article lists the co-chairs as Lady Gaga and Bruce Cohen. The former Goldman Sachs exec mentioned is Robert Menschel, but he wasn't a co-chair here. So the answer is N/A?

Wait, no. Wait the question says "served as co-chair alongside Lady Gaga on Biden's revived arts committee". The co-chairs were Lady Gaga and Bruce Cohen. The article says Bruce Cohen is a producer and a Biden supporter who received a National Medal of Arts. The Goldman Sachs exec mentioned in the committee's history was Robert Menschel, but that was in the past. The current co-chairs don't include him. So the answer is N/A?

Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The article says: "The co-chairs were the singer Lady Gaga and the producer Bruce Cohen, a Biden supporter who also received a National Medal of Arts that same year." So Bruce Cohen is the other co-chair. The question is asking for a former Goldman Sachs exec. Since Bruce Cohen isn't linked to Goldman Sachs, the answer is N/A.

2. The second question asks how many members remained after the Charlottesville resignations. In 2017, 17 members resigned. The original committee's membership isn't stated, so we can't compute the remaining number. The article doesn't give the total before the resignations. So the answer is N/A.

3. The annual budget allocation for Dr. Murthy's loneliness epidemic campaign. The committee reviewed a proposal for a campaign to combat loneliness. The article says the committee had an annual budget of ~$335k, but it doesn't specify how much was allocated to that specific initiative. So answer N/A.

4. The museum director appointed to lead the National Garden of American Heroes. The article mentions Trump reinstated his call for creating the National Garden of American Heroes in an executive order, but it doesn't say who was appointed to lead it. So N/A.

5. The percentage of the budget for Turnaround Arts under Obama. The article says the committee developed Turnaround Arts under Obama, but there's no mention of budget percentages. So N/A.

6. The Department of Defense liaison for the Semiquincentennial planning. The order says the task force would be housed within the Department of Defense, but no specific person is named. So N/A.

7. Recommendations on foreign language education during Biden's tenure. The committee under Biden's revival didn't mention foreign language; that was in the 90s under Clinton. The article says under Clinton, they petitioned for foreign language competency. Under Biden's time, their activities included the loneliness campaign. So the answer is N/A.

8. Number of meetings Frank Sinatra attended. The article mentions Sinatra was a member but doesn't state how many meetings he attended. N/A.

9. Tax incentives proposed in the 90s. The committee petitioned to expand tax incentives for cultural philanthropy, but the total amount isn't given. So N/A.

10. Specific schools that improved under Turnaround Arts. The article says the initiative was for the nation's lowest-performing schools but doesn't name specific ones. N/A.

11. How the 2023 executive order tied DoD to cultural efforts. The order housed the task force within the DoD, so the answer is "housed within the Department of Defense".

12. Co-chairs who collaborated on the loneliness campaign. The co-chairs were Lady Gaga and Bruce Cohen. The article says the committee reviewed a proposal for the loneliness campaign. It doesn't say the co-chairs collaborated on it. So N/A.

13. Justification in 2017 for disbanding the committee citing overlap with National Garden. The article says in 2017, Trump's White House called it not a responsible use of tax dollars, but didn't mention the National Garden. The dissolution in 2023's executive order included reinstating the Garden, but the 2017 reason didn't reference that. So N/A.

14. Member of the committee during Trump's first term who joined the 1776 Commission. The article mentions Trump revived the 1776 Commission in 2023. The committee's members during Trump's first term (before Biden's revival) aren't specified as joining the 1776 Commission. The article doesn't mention any overlap. So N/A.
