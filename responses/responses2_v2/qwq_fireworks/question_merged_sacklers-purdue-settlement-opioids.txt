Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful and only use the information given.

1. The first question asks which state attorney general announced they would pursue individual lawsuits instead of joining the fund. The article mentions Washington State is weighing options, but the first to announce was New York's Letitia James. Wait, no, the article says Ms. James announced the framework, but the question is about a state pursuing lawsuits instead. The text says Washington State is considering not signing onto the deal. But the question specifies the first to announce. The article states: "A spokesman for Washington State... said the state was weighing its options." So maybe Washington is the one? Or is there another? The article says "the states, which are responsible for the bulk of the payments... Washington State, which has successfully pursued other pharmaceutical companies rather than sign onto national deals, said the state was weighing its options." So maybe Washington is the one, but the question asks which attorney general first announced intention to pursue lawsuits. The article doesn't explicitly state that any have announced yet. It says Washington is considering. The answer might be N/A because the article doesn't name a specific one that announced yet. Wait, the first paragraph mentions "the deal has to now be sold to all the claimants..." and the 14 states are on board. The remaining states might include Washington, but the article doesn't say any have announced to opt out yet. So the answer is N/A?

Wait, the question is "Which state attorney general first announced their intention to pursue individual lawsuits against the Sacklers rather than participate in the reserve fund arrangement?" The article mentions Washington State as one that's considering options, but does it say they announced an intention to pursue lawsuits instead? The article says "Washington State... said the state was weighing its options." Not an announcement yet. So maybe the answer is N/A.

2. How much money would be returned to states annually after 5 years from unused portions. The article says "After five years, unused funds would start reverting back to the states." But the question is about the annual amount. The text doesn't specify the amount per year. So N/A?

3. Total dollar amount for Native American tribes. The article mentions that "the deal has to be sold to... hundreds of Native American tribes" but doesn't state a specific amount allocated. So N/A.

4. Federal court judge who approved the legal defense fund mechanism before the announcement. The article says the framework was announced by NY AG, but doesn't mention any federal judge's prior approval. The Supreme Court struck down the previous deal, but the question is about a judge approving the fund before the announcement. The text doesn't mention any such judge, so N/A.

5. Number of Sackler family members required to contribute. The article says the Sacklers (family) would pay up to $6.5B, but doesn't specify the number of members. So N/A.

6. Percentage allocation for individual vs government in the defense fund. The article doesn't mention percentages for specific cases. N/A.

7. When Purdue first proposed the defense fund concept. The article says the new deal framework includes it, but doesn't state when it was first proposed. N/A.

8. Additional money states get if they waive the fund. The article doesn't mention any extra payment for waiving. N/A.

9. Consulting firm for distributing the $897M. The article says "Final calculations for how much... fees are still under discussion," but no firm named. N/A.

10. Deadline set by bankruptcy court for states to decide on the fund. The article doesn't mention a specific deadline. N/A.

11. Washington State's share from the $897M. The article says NY could get up to $250M, but no info on Washington's specific amount. N/A.

12. Percentage of $7.4B for legal defense of personal injury victims. The legal defense fund is for Sacklers, not the victims. The question asks about funding for victims' cases against Sacklers. The fund is for Sacklers' defense, so none of the settlement goes to victims' legal defense. So the answer would be 0%? But the question says "directly used to fund the legal defense of individual personal injury victims against the Sacklers?" Since the fund is for Sacklers, not the victims, the answer is 0. But the question might be a trick. However, the article doesn't mention any part of the $7.4B going to the victims' defense, so the answer is 0% or N/A? Since the question is about the percentage from the total settlement, which includes Purdue's $897M and Sacklers' $6.5B, the defense fund is part of the $7.4B. Wait, the $800M is part of the Sacklers' $6.5B? Let me check the article again. The article says "the Sacklers would pay up to $6.5 billion... with a new condition: Claimants... would have to set aside as much as $800 million in an account akin to a legal-defense fund for the billionaires to fight such cases." Wait, so the $800M is not part of the Sackler's payment but is a contribution from the claimants. The total settlement is $7.4B, which includes $897M from Purdue and presumably the Sacklers' $6.5B? Wait, the article says "the overall settlement totaled $7.4 billion, which would include $897 million from Purdue." So the Sacklers' $6.5B is part of that? Or is it separate? The article says the Sacklers' $6.5B plus Purdue's $897M? Wait, the first paragraph says the Sacklers increased their cash offer to settle litigation to up to $6.5B, but with the condition that claimants set aside $800M. The total settlement is $7.4B, which includes the $897M from Purdue. So the Sacklers' $6.5B plus Purdue's $897M equals more than $7.4B? Maybe the total is structured differently. Regardless, the question asks what percentage of the $7.4B (total as per James) is used for the legal defense of personal injury victims against Sacklers. Since the $800M is a reserve from the claimants, not part of the $7.4B, perhaps. The question is confusing. The defense fund is funded by the claimants, not from the settlement money. Therefore, the answer would be N/A, because the $800M isn't part of the $7.4B total settlement. The question's premise might be wrong, so answer N/A.

13. Time period for 140,000 victims to get their share of the $3B initial payment. The Sacklers pay nearly $3B in first 3 years, and the rest over 12 more. The initial $3B is over 3 years. The question is about the time period for their share. So the 140,000 would get their portion over the 3 years? The answer is 3 years. But the article says "remaining payments over an additional 12 years" after the first 3. The question is about the initial $3B's time period. So the answer is 3 years.

14. Maximum Florida could contribute before reversion. The minimum is $200M, max cap is $800M. So the maximum contribution before reversion is $800M, but after 5 years, unused funds revert. The question is what's the maximum Florida could contribute before any unused funds start returning. Since the total cap is $800M for all states, but per state? The article says "the states, which are responsible for the bulk of the payments to the reserve fund, would have to keep a minimum of $200 million in the account, with total contributions capped at $800 million." Wait, the total contributions from all states are capped at $800M. So Florida's maximum would be part of that. The question is asking for Florida's maximum. The article doesn't specify per-state caps, so can't determine. So N/A.

15. Portion of NY's $250M earmarked for tribes. The article doesn't mention specific allocations to tribes within NY's share. N/A.

16. Years for remaining balance after initial $3B. The remaining is over 12 years. So 12 years. The question says "assuming they adhere to the accelerated 12-year payment schedule mentioned for the outstanding amount?" So answer is 12.

17. Total contribution to Texas's addiction efforts. The article states the payments are intended to fund efforts, but doesn't specify per state. The $7.4B total includes Purdue's $897M and Sacklers' $6.5B. But the question is about Texas's portion. Since the article doesn't break it down, N/A.

18. Legal mechanism beyond the fund to protect Sacklers from non-opioid lawsuits. The article says the Supreme Court rejected immunity for them. The new deal doesn't give immunity, so they can be sued. The question asks what mechanism protects them from non-opioid lawsuits. The article doesn't mention any such mechanism. The fund is for legal defense, not immunity. So answer N/A.

19. Number of lawsuits expected to continue. The article says if they object, they can build new cases. The question asks how many, but the article doesn't give a number. N/A.

20. Percentage of Sacklers' $6.5B to admin fees. The article says final calculations for fees are still under discussion, so N/A.

<other>Question 12 asks the percentage of $7.4B settlement directly used to fund legal defense for personal injury victims against the Sacklers. The $800M legal defense fund is for the Sacklers' defense, not the victims' litigation. Thus, 0%.</other>
