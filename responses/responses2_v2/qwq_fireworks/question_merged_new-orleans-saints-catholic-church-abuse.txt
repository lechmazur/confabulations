Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I use only the information from the provided article. Let me start by going through each question and see what the article says.

1. The question asks who offered to help the archdiocese using the team's email. From the article, when Bensel saw the news story about the deacon, he emailed Benson. He offered crisis communications expertise. The article mentions he used his Saints email. So the answer should be Greg Bensel.

2. The news story involved a former deacon removed for abuse but still in a public church role. The article says a local news story revealed this, prompting Bensel's email. The specific story was about George F. Brignac, a former deacon and teacher with abuse accusations.

3. The controversy is the sexual abuse scandal in the Archdiocese of New Orleans. The team helped them manage media fallout from the abuse accusations against priests and employees.

4. The benefactor is Gayle Benson, the Saints owner, who's a major donor to the archdiocese and close to the archbishop. The article mentions her contributions through her foundation.

5. The DA mentioned was Leon Cannizzaro. The emails refer to a conversation with him about the list, and later he's in the AG's criminal division. The article states Cannizzaro didn't return calls but previously said he saw the list when it was public.

6. The list started with a number that increased to 79 after additions. The article says 22 were added, bringing total to 79. So the answer is 79.

7. The question is about whether the list adjustments happened before or after Bensel helped his alma mater. The article mentions Bensel helped Jesuit High School after the Advocate revealed their settlements. The list discussions were in 2018, and the Jesuit involvement is mentioned after the list's release. So the internal discussion (about the list) was before helping the school.

8. The judge was Jay Zainey. The article says he recommended Bensel to the archbishop. He's a federal judge and Catholic.

9. The newspapers were The Advocate and The Times-Picayune. Bensel wrote to their editors to get behind the archbishop.

10. The letter saying it's not right to criticize the archbishop was written by Bensel. The quote is: "Casting a critical eye on him is neither beneficial nor right." So the answer is Greg Bensel.

Wait, let me check each again to ensure accuracy. For question 7, the article says Bensel's work with Jesuit came after the archdiocese's list. The list was in Nov 2018, and the Jesuit involvement is mentioned after, so the adjustment talks (before list release) were before helping the school. So answer is "before".

Double-checking all to avoid mistakes. I think that's all.
