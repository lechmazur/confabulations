Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article and answer each question strictly based on that. Let's start with the first question.

1. The first question asks which Native American tribe assisted the church militia in the Mountain Meadows Massacre according to Brigham Young's orders. The article mentions "executed with help from Southern Paiutes" in the context of the massacre. So the answer should be Southern Paiutes.

2. The second question is about how many episodes of "American Primeval" feature Betty Gilpin's character surviving encounters with the bounty hunter before their final confrontation. The article doesn't specify the number of episodes or encounters between Sara and the bounty hunter (Jai Courtney). It just says he kills for pleasure and profit, but no count is given. So N/A.

3. The third question asks which historical figure Isaac Reed meets that influences his decision. The article says Isaac was raised by Shoshone and there's a Shoshone warrior (Hinkey's character) but no specific historical figure mentioned that he meets. The article doesn't state a meeting with a historical figure influencing him. So N/A.

4. The fourth question is about the year survivors got asylum from the U.S. Army per Jon Krakauer's research. The article mentions Krakauer's book and the FX drama "Banner" (Under the Banner of Heaven) but doesn't state a year when asylum was granted. The Mountain Meadows Massacre was 1857-58, but the question is about survivors being granted asylum. The text doesn't specify a year for that event, so N/A.

5. The fifth question asks the name of the trading post where Dane DeHaan's character meets the Shoshone warrior. The article doesn't mention any specific trading post name in this context. So N/A.

6. The sixth question is about how many militia members were brought to justice in the show's epilogue. The article says the show depicts the massacre but doesn't mention any specific numbers of those brought to justice. N/A.

7. The seventh question compares a character in "The Madstone" to Jai Courtney's bounty hunter. The article says "The Madstone" has a young woman similar to Sara, but the bounty hunter's backstory isn't compared to any character in the novel. The question asks for a character with the same tragic backstory as the bounty hunter. Since the article doesn't mention the bounty hunter's backstory in relation to the novel, N/A.

8. The eighth question about the Shoshone ritual paralleling "The Revenant." The article says both shows depict tribes' customs accurately. The ritual isn't specified, so N/A unless there's a direct mention. The article doesn't name any specific ritual, so N/A.

9. The ninth question asks how many wagon train survivors escaped in Episode 1. The article states the massacre killed 120, but doesn't mention survivors escaping. So N/A.

10. The tenth question about the secret document Sara carries. The article doesn't mention any specific document she carries. N/A.

11. The eleventh question asks how many episodes focus on the aftermath with the same ferocity as in "Banner." The article says Episode 1 shows the massacre with ax-swinging ferocity. But how many episodes focus on the aftermath? The article says "the series is more viscerally brutal... averaging multiple murders..." but doesn't specify episode counts. The question also references "Under the Banner of Heaven" influencing the structure of the novel. The article mentions "Banner" includes the massacre context, but no episode count. So N/A.

12. The twelfth question is complex. It asks the specific directive from Brigham Young in "Under the Banner of Heaven" that led to the massacre, mirroring "The Madstone." The article says Young declared martial law in response to U.S. military activity, leading to the militia attack. The question links this to "The Madstone's" plot. Since the article states that Young's declaration of martial law led to the attack, the answer is declaring martial law.

13. The thirteenth question compares a Shoshone custom to feeding corpses to hogs in "Deadwood." The article mentions "Deadwood" has Mr. Wu's hogs fed corpses. The question asks what Shoshone custom parallels this. The article doesn't mention any specific Shoshone ritual similar to that, so N/A.

14. The fourteenth question asks what survival skill Isaac would use against the Laffertys. The article says Isaac guided Sara and has Shoshone upbringing. The skill isn't specified, so N/A.

15. The fifteenth question about the symbolic weapon in Episode 1. The article mentions "ax-swinging, blood-gushing ferocity" in Episode 1. So the answer is axes.

16. The sixteenth question on vengeance act by the Shoshone warrior. The article doesn't describe specific acts beyond vengeance, so N/A.

17. The seventeenth question about which Slotkin book to adapt. The article mentions Slotkin's fourth book "A Great Disorder" (2024) as part of his series. The question asks which beyond the original trilogy, so that's "A Great Disorder."

18. The eighteenth question about U.S. Army involvement contradicting heroic myths. The article says the show depicts the Army as one of the groups in antagonism, which contradicts heroic myths. The specific aspect might be their involvement in the Utah War without heroism, but the article states Young's martial law response to U.S. military activity. The question links to Brenda's murder's context. The U.S. Army's role as antagonists, not heroes, so the answer is their involvement in the Utah War, but the exact aspect? The article says the Army is one of the groups at each other's throats, so maybe their role in the conflict as antagonists, but the question specifically asks what aspect contradicts heroic myths. Since the article says the show critiques heroic myths by showing chaos, the U.S. Army's role as antagonists instead of heroes. But the exact phrase from the text: "the U.S. Army and Brigham Young's followers..." as groups in conflict. The aspect is their role in the antagonism, so perhaps "their involvement in the Utah War as antagonists" but the article doesn't specify a particular action. Since the question references Brenda's murder context (from "Under the Banner of Heaven"), maybe the Army's failure to protect? The article says the massacre was carried out with church militia help. The U.S. Army's involvement in the Utah War led to the militia's attack. The specific directive from Brigham Young was declaring martial law. The question asks what aspect of the Army's involvement contradicts the myths. The article states the series shows the West as a place to survive, not conquer, so the Army's role in the conflict without heroism. The exact answer might be "their role in the Utah War as antagonists" but the article doesn't phrase it that way. Alternatively, the article says "the U.S. Army and Brigham Young's followers among the Church..." so their mutual antagonism. Since the question is about contradicting heroic myths, maybe their being part of the conflict instead of heroes. The answer might be their role in the Utah War, but the article doesn't give a specific aspect beyond being one of the groups. Since I can't find a specific answer, maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "Young... declared martial law in response to U.S. military activity in the area. The ensuing attack..." So the U.S. military's presence led to the militia's attack. The aspect contradicting heroic myths would be their role in provoking the massacre, making them antagonists. But the question says "what specific aspect of the U.S. Army's involvement..." The answer could be their military activity prompting Young's martial law, which led to the massacre. The article states that, so the answer is "their military activity in the Utah Territory prompting Brigham Young's declaration of martial law."

19. The nineteenth question about Dane and Saura's relationship resembling Benjamin and Nell. The article says both have a fugitive woman and a protector. The article states that in "The Madstone," Benjamin is the protector, and similarly, the article's characters (Dane and Saura are church members, but their dynamic isn't detailed. Wait, the article says Sara (Gilpin) is with a fugitive and her son, guided by Isaac. The article says "Dane DeHaan and Saura Lightfoot-Leon" are a non-militia couple from the church. Their relationship's aspect isn't compared to Benjamin and Nell, but the fugitive's journey is similar. The question asks about the relationship between Dane and Saura after events in "Banner." The article doesn't specify their dynamic, so N/A.

20. The twentieth question on why the bounty hunter would clash with Al Swearengen. The article says Swearengen is ruthless but "Primeval" is more serious. The bounty hunter's personality driven by historical context (maybe his role in the massacre) and his motivation for pleasure/profit. Swearengen is pragmatic, so perhaps the bounty hunter's lack of humor or his extreme methods. The article mentions "Primeval" is self-serious vs. "Deadwood's" humor. So the answer might be his lack of humor or seriousness conflicting with Swearengen's pragmatism. But the article doesn't explicitly state this. Alternatively, since Swearengen is from "Deadwood" and the bounty hunter is more violent, maybe his disregard for profit for pleasure's sake. The article says he kills for pleasure and profit. Swearengen is pragmatic, so the clash is about methods. The answer could be his prioritizing killing for pleasure over profit, conflicting with Swearengen's pragmatism. The article says "killing as much for pleasure as for profit," so the answer is "his killing for pleasure as much as profit," conflicting with Swearengen's pragmatism. But the question asks for the aspect of his personality. So the answer is "his motivation to kill for pleasure as well as profit."
