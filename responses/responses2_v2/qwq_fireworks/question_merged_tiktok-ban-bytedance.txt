Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one based strictly on the given article. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. The first question asks about the percentage of ByteDance's total revenue from Douyin in the first half of 2024. The article mentions that ByteDance's total revenue was roughly $73 billion in the first half of 2024, and Douyin is their main revenue source. However, the exact percentage isn't provided. The article says Douyin is the biggest contributor but without specific numbers, so I have to say N/A.

2. The second question is about the legal strategy suggested by the former head of e-commerce during ban speculation. The article mentions Sandie Hawkins told her team to focus on what was in their control. So the answer here is "focus on what was in your control".

3. The third question asks which investment firm with a significant stake in ByteDance would be most affected if Trump's executive order mirrors the 2020 deal. The article lists Susquehanna Capital as owning 15%, so that's the one with the most stake. The failed deal involved Oracle and Walmart, but the firm holding shares is Susquehanna.

4. The fourth question requires calculating Brazil's revenue based on user base. The article says TikTok has 170M in the US (most valuable) and larger outside. Brazil is a major market but no exact user numbers. Without specific user numbers for Brazil vs Indonesia, can't compute. So N/A.

5. The TD Cowen survey and Marc Jacobs' strategy point to YouTube Shorts as the Google service benefiting. The answer is YouTube Shorts.

6. The question asks for the percentage captured by Snap and Pinterest combined. The article states that 85% goes to Meta and Google, so the rest (15%) might go to others like Snap and Pinterest. So 15%.

7. The algorithm focus: the article says TikTok's algorithm lets unknown creators find audiences, unlike Instagram which favors established ones. The answer is "lets relatively unknown creators find an audience".

8. To offset revenue loss, need to know US revenue vs Douyin's. The US revenue is $10B out of total $20-26B. But without knowing Douyin's user numbers and revenue per user, can't compute the percentage. So N/A.

9. The commission program similar to TikTok Shop is mentioned for YouTube and Meta. The article says both offer commission on e-commerce. So the answer is "commission on e-commerce sales".

10. If the ban is overturned, YouTube's feature beyond video service might be Shorts, but the question asks what's most crucial. The article doesn't specify beyond video services, so maybe the Shorts feature itself. But the question says "beyond video service", perhaps the algorithm? Wait, the article says YouTube Shorts focuses on established creators, but the question is about features beyond video. Maybe the article doesn't specify, so N/A? Wait, the article says "video services and programs to share commission with creators". Maybe the commission program? Hmm, but the question is if the ban is overturned, so maybe the algorithm? The article doesn't mention another feature. Maybe N/A.

Wait, the question says "if the Supreme Court had overturned the ban, mirroring user behavior predicted by TD Cowen, what feature of YouTube beyond video service would be crucial?" The article mentions YouTube's Shorts, but that's a video service. The other part is the commission program. The article says both YouTube and Meta have programs to share commission. So the feature is the commission-sharing program. So the answer would be "commission-sharing programs" or "sharing commission on e-commerce sales".

11. The platform capturing the majority of ad revenue is Instagram (Meta) and YouTube (Google). The article states 85% goes to Meta and Google, so the majority is split between them. The question asks which platform (singular) is expected to capture the overwhelming majority. Since Instagram is part of Meta, but the article mentions both Meta and Google. Wait, the article says "as much as 85 percent...move to Instagram (Meta) and YouTube (Google)". So the majority would be between these two, but the question asks which one is the "overwhelming majority". Since it's split between two, maybe N/A? Or the question might consider both as part of their parent companies. But the answer should be one. The article says "Meta and Google", so perhaps the answer is "Meta" (Instagram) and "Google" (YouTube). But the question asks for the platform, so maybe "YouTube" or "Instagram". Wait, the first part of the question says "which U.S. platform is expected to capture the overwhelming majority". The article says 85% goes to both, but which one is the majority? The article doesn't specify which of the two takes more. So maybe N/A? Wait, the exact quote: "as much as 85 percent of TikTok's U.S. revenue is expected to quickly move to Instagram, which is owned by Meta, and YouTube, which is owned by Google". So 85% split between the two. The question asks which platform would get the majority of the 85%? Since it's split between two, maybe the answer is "N/A". Alternatively, maybe the question considers the combined total, but the question says "overwhelming majority" so maybe the answer is "Meta and Google" but the question asks for a platform. Hmm. The question says "U.S. platform", so maybe Instagram (Meta) and YouTube (Google) are the platforms. Since it's 85% split between them, but the question wants the one with the majority, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the article doesn't specify which of the two gets more. So answer N/A?

Wait, the question says "overwhelming majority of TikTokâ€™s lost advertising revenue despite differing algorithm features". The article says "as much as 85 percent...move to Instagram and YouTube". The majority of the lost revenue (which is 100%) would be 85% split, so the majority of the total is still 85%, but the question is which platform gets the majority of the 85%. Since it's split, maybe the answer is N/A. But maybe the question expects the answer to be Meta/Instagram and Google/YouTube together. But the question says "platform", so perhaps the answer is "Instagram" and "YouTube", but the question wants one. Since the question is phrased as "which U.S. platform", maybe the answer is both, but the format requires one. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the parent companies, but the platforms are Instagram and YouTube. Since the question says "platform", perhaps the answer is "YouTube" or "Instagram", but without knowing which, it's N/A. Wait, the article doesn't specify which of the two takes more. Hmm, maybe I need to check again. The article says "Instagram and YouTube quickly filled the void" in India. Maybe the answer is Instagram? Not sure. Alternatively, the question might have a trick. Wait, the exact quote: "as much as 85 percent of TikTok's U.S. revenue is expected to quickly move to Instagram, which is owned by Meta, and YouTube, which is owned by Google". So the 85% is split between them. The question asks which platform is expected to capture the overwhelming majority (i.e., more than 50% of TikTok's lost revenue). Since 85% is split, maybe one of them takes the majority of that 85%. But the article doesn't say which. Therefore, the answer is N/A. But the question might be expecting the parent companies, but the platforms are Instagram and YouTube. Since the question says "platform", perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the two together, but the wording is "overwhelming majority" so maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick, and the answer is Instagram and YouTube, but the user has to pick one. Since the question says "overwhelming majority", perhaps the answer is N/A because it's split. Let me note that for now and come back.

12. The investment firm with 15% is Susquehanna Capital, as stated in the article. So the answer is Susquehanna Capital.

13. The political leader proposing the executive order is Donald J. Trump. The article says "President-elect Donald J. Trump is considering an executive order to allow TikTok to keep operating until new owners are found."

14. The nation that banned in 2020 and lost 200M users is India.

15. The primary revenue generator besides TikTok is Douyin, mentioned as "the biggest share of its revenue from another product, Douyin".

16. The e-commerce head who left is Sandie Hawkins.

17. The platform favoring large followers over TikTok's algorithm is Instagram Reels.

18. The proportion reallocated is 85%, as per the article's statement.

19. The ban takes effect on Sunday, as per "when the law takes effect on Sunday".

20. The global user range is 1.2 to 1.8 billion monthly users.

Going back to question 10: The article mentions that YouTube has Shorts, but the question is about a feature beyond video service. The article says YouTube and Meta offer commission programs. If the ban is overturned, the crucial feature would be their existing video services and the commission programs. Since the question specifies "beyond video service", maybe the commission-sharing program. The article says "video services and programs to share commission on e-commerce sales or ads with their popular creators." So the feature beyond video is the commission-sharing. Hence, the answer would be "commission-sharing programs".

Question 11: The majority of the 85% could be split, but the question asks which platform is expected to capture the "overwhelming majority". Since the 85% is split between Instagram and YouTube, but the question wants the platform, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the majority of the total lost revenue (which is 100%) would have 85% going to Meta and Google, so the majority is the combined, but as a platform, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "move to Instagram... and YouTube". The question says "which U.S. platform is expected to capture the overwhelming majority". Since it's split between two platforms, the answer is N/A. But maybe the question assumes that the majority is the 85% total, but the question is phrased as "overwhelming majority" of the lost revenue, so the answer would be the two together. But the question asks for a single platform. Since it's not specified which of the two takes more, the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick and the answer is YouTube or Instagram. Let me check again. The article says "Instagram and YouTube quickly filled the void" in India, so maybe Instagram was more, but the article doesn't specify. So N/A.

Wait, the article says "as much as 85 percent...move to Instagram... and YouTube". The wording "move to" might imply that the 85% is split between them. Since the question asks which platform, not which company, and the platforms are two, then N/A.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the parent companies, but the platforms are Instagram and YouTube. Since the question says "platform", the answer is N/A. So I'll go with N/A for question 11.
