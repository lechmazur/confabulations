Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question asks which major publishing house first signed Jeneane O'Riley after her TikTok success. The article mentions that she later signed with Bloom Books, a romance imprint at Sourcebooks. So the answer should be Sourcebooks.

2. The most successful BookTok creator mentioned is Cait Jacobs, who has 314,000 followers. The question specifies "during the pandemic," but the article says she started gaining followers at the start of the pandemic. The exact number is given as 314k, so that's the answer.

3. The question is about the percentage of Barnes & Noble's displays dedicated to TikTok titles. The article says they created displays for trending books, but there's no specific percentage mentioned. So N/A.

4. Sourcebooks' marketing director, Molly Waxman, mentions they'll focus on platforms like Instagram, Threads, or Reels. The primary one isn't specified, but the question asks for the "primary focus." Since she says "if everyone goes on Substack..." but doesn't name a single primary, maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "if everyone goes on Substack, we'll work... if everyone goes on Reels..." but the exact primary isn't stated. Hmm, perhaps the answer is N/A.

5. Cait Jacobs' revenue from Penguin Random House in her first year isn't given. The article mentions she makes a couple thousand a month but doesn't specify the total or per publisher. So N/A.

6. The article mentions sales shot up after the viral post, but the exact number of copies sold isn't provided. So N/A.

7. The article doesn't mention any specific marketing budget allocated by Sourcebooks for transitioning. N/A.

8. The month when Barnes & Noble implemented the TikTok section isn't stated. N/A.

9. No percentage increase in sales is provided. N/A.

10. The article doesn't specify the number of self-published authors who got contracts in 2023. It mentions authors like Lucy Score, Hannah Grace, Jasmine Mas, but no number. N/A.

11. The retailers mentioned creating displays are Barnes & Noble, Target, and Walmart. Jasmine Mas's works would be featured there. The question asks which two? The article says "Barnes & Noble, Target and Walmart" so maybe two of those, but the question says "specifically featured Jasmine Mas's works." The article says those retailers track trends, but not specifically Jasmine's works. N/A.

12. The national security concern mentioned is about the Chinese government using TikTok for propaganda or surveillance. The question asks for the specific use related to influencing elections via propaganda. The article says "supporters of the law argue... spread propaganda or conduct surveillance." So the answer is spreading propaganda.

13. Shannon DeVito credited TikTok with forcing publishers to focus on print because influencers want physical books. The platform is TikTok, so answer is TikTok.

14. The percentage of Gen Z users shifting to print isn't given. N/A.

15. Anna Hall from Zando mentioned they help authors on Patreon and YouTube. The author isn't named here. The article mentions Jasmine Mas, Lucy Score, etc., but not specifically who used Patreon post-ban. N/A.

16. The author with 52k followers is Jeneane O'Riley, who signed with Sourcebooks. The ban would impact her community, so answer is Jeneane O'Riley.

17. The proprietor is ByteDance, as stated in the article.

18. The author of "How Does it Feel?" is Jeneane O'Riley, who later signed with Bloom Books (Sourcebooks). So her name again.

20. The number of US users is 170 million.

21. The bookstore is Barnes & Noble, as mentioned by Shannon DeVito.
