Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I use only the information from the article provided. Let me start by going through each question and see what the article says.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which pharmaceutical company's NaV 1.7 breakthrough drug was approved by the FDA in late 2023 for treating chronic nerve pain. Scanning through the article, there's a mention of Vertex Pharmaceuticals announcing promising results for a drug called Suzetrigine targeting NaV 1.8. Wait, the question specifies NaV 1.7, but the article says NaV 1.8. Hmm, maybe I missed the 1.7 part. Let me check again. The article states that Vertex's drug targets NaV 1.8, but there's a mention of NaV 1.7 in the context of previous research. The article says, "the company Vertex Pharmaceuticals announced that it had had promising results for a painkiller, Suzetrigine, which worked on a related channel, NaV 1.8." So, the answer here might be Vertex, but the question mentions NaV 1.7. Since the article says NaV 1.8, maybe the answer is N/A because it's not 1.7. Wait, but the question says "NaV 1.7 breakthrough drug" but the article says Vertex's drug is for NaV 1.8. Therefore, the answer should be N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The author's hours per week doing nerve flossing. The article mentions she tried nerve flossing, but doesn't specify how many hours. The only number given is about her colleague spending 20 hours a week on therapies. So, answer N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Percentage reduction in the Yale/VA study using carbamazepine. The article states that blocking NaV 1.7 with carbamazepine could stop joint damage and pain, but no percentage is given. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Autoimmune condition causing the author's pain. The author's tests didn't find an autoimmune cause; they were negative. The article says "none of those tests could point to an obvious cause, I fell into the mystery bucket." So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The researcher who discovered ketamine's effect. The article mentions Motzkin as a neurologist, but the link between ketamine and nerve sensitization isn't directly attributed to a researcher here. The article says the UCSF clinic uses ketamine infusions, but no specific researcher is named for that discovery. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Months for John's pain relief from antibiotic. The article says John had a bad reaction leading to years of pain. No mention of a time frame for improvement with treatment. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Cost savings from UCSF clinic. The article mentions Veasley spent $25k out of pocket but doesn't compare to UCSF's approach. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Genetic marker overlooked by others. The case with Motzkin found a spinal lesion, not a genetic marker. The article says the patient had a lesion indicating possible MS, which was overlooked. So the answer is the spinal lesion (but the question asks for a genetic marker, which isn't mentioned here). So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** Percentage improvement from gabapentin + nerve flossing. The article doesn't provide specific stats on combined treatments. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Number of samples for AI accuracy. The article mentions Juliet Mwirigi trained an algorithm over two months, but no number given. N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Molecule reduced by anti-inflammatory leading to gut issues. The article says ibuprofen inhibits cyclooxygenase, reducing prostaglandin, which protects the gut. The molecule is prostaglandin. So answer: prostaglandin.

12. **Question 12:** Sodium channel as "starting gate" for pain. The article says NaV 1.7 acts as a starting gate. So NaV 1.7.

13. **Question 13:** Cluster of cells in bouquet analogy. The dorsal root ganglion is described as the bouquet's switchboard. So dorsal root ganglion.

14. **Question 14:** Time since last non-opioid pain med. The article states it had been two decades since a new non-opioid drug was approved before recent advances. So 20 years.

15. **Question 15:** Surgery with high nerve pain risk. The article mentions breast surgeries (mastectomy) with 40-60% risk, hernia 1 in 7. The question asks which is noted as high. Answer: breast surgeries/mastectomy.

16. **Question 16:** Anti-seizure drug causing color confusion. Gabapentin caused the author to mix up words like "phoenix" and "blue/green." So gabapentin.

17. **Question 17:** Rehab technique with gliding arms. Nerve flossing is mentioned as a technique with gliding motions. So nerve flossing.

18. **Question 18:** Specialist comparing pain to a roommate. The psychologist Uta Maeda uses the analogy. So Uta Maeda.

19. **Question 19:** Cannabinoid receptor for non-psychoactive relief. The article mentions CB1 for targeting without psychoactive effects. So CB1.

20. **Question 20:** Tech enabling receptor mapping. The article mentions advances like proteomics, spatial transcriptomics, and computing power. But the specific tech in the cancer analogy is "new imaging technologies and computing abilities" allowing receptor structure analysis. The answer might be "computing abilities" but the question asks for the technological advance. The article says "radical advances in drug design" due to imaging and computing. The exact term used in the cancer analogy is "time scale" due to new imaging and computing. Since the question asks for the tech credited, perhaps "computing abilities" or "new imaging technologies." Alternatively, the answer might be "proteomics" or "spatial transcriptomics." Wait, the article states: "Thanks to new imaging technologies and computing abilities, he explained, 'we can get information on the structure of receptors, and how drugs attach to them, on a time scale that was impossible 10 years ago.'" So the answer is imaging technologies and computing abilities, but the question asks for the technological advance credited. Since the options are limited, maybe the answer is "imaging technologies and computing abilities" but the question might expect a specific term. Alternatively, the article says "new imaging technologies" so maybe imaging technologies. But the answer must be exact. Let me check the exact quote: "radical advances in drug design. 'Science is just different now,' Gereau said. Thanks to new imaging technologies and computing abilities..." So the answer is imaging technologies and computing abilities. However, the question might expect a single term. Alternatively, maybe "computational power" but the article says "computing abilities." Alternatively, the answer is "new imaging technologies and computing abilities" but since it's a fill-in, maybe "new imaging technologies." But I'll go with the exact phrase mentioned in the context of enabling mapping: "imaging technologies and computing abilities." But the question asks for the technological advance credited, so perhaps "computing abilities" or "imaging technologies." Alternatively, the article says "the structure of receptors... on a time scale... due to new imaging and computing." So the answer is imaging technologies and computing abilities. But since the answer needs to be concise, maybe "imaging technologies and computing" but the user might expect one term. Alternatively, the answer is "proteomics" but that's part of the lab techniques. Hmm. Alternatively, the key tech is "proteomics, spatial transcriptomics and metabolomics" but the question's answer in the article's cancer analogy part mentions "new imaging technologies and computing abilities." Since the question is about the analogy, the answer is the technological advance enabling mapping: imaging and computing. The user might want the exact term from that part. Since the user says to use only the article, the answer must be as per the article's exact wording here. The article says "new imaging technologies and computing abilities" so combining those into a phrase. But since the answer must be concise, perhaps "imaging technologies and computing abilities" is acceptable. Alternatively, maybe "computational power" but not sure. Alternatively, "proteomics" is part of the lab's methods, but the question refers to the analogy with cancer research where the breakthrough was due to understanding genetics. The article says in the cancer analogy, the breakthrough was genetic and cellular analysis. But the question specifically asks for the tech enabling mapping of receptor structures. The answer would be the imaging and computing. Since the user requires exact terms, I'll go with "imaging technologies and computing abilities."
