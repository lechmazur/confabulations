Okay, let me go through each question one by one using the article provided. 

1. The first question asks how many times Digenis Koumas visited the Leonardo da Vinci exhibition, based on his visits to the Van Gogh show. The article mentions that Koumas had seen the Van Gogh show at least eight times, but there's no mention of him attending the Leonardo da Vinci exhibition. So the answer here should be N/A because the question is about a different exhibition not referenced in his visits.

2. The second question is about the medium Van Gogh used for the monochromatic mountain scene that Ekow liked. The article says Ekow was captivated by a lesser-known piece described as a monochromatic rendering of a mountain. The article only mentions paintings in the exhibition, so unless stated otherwise, it's a painting. The question asks for another medium, but there's no info on other mediums here. So N/A.

3. Diane Martin began sketching around 9 p.m., but she waited until the crowds thinned to draw comfortably. The answer is 9 p.m., but the question specifies when she felt she could draw comfortably. The article says she started at 9 p.m. but only felt comfortable later, near 5 a.m. Wait, the exact time she began was 9 p.m., but she felt comfortable later. The question asks when she began sketching when she could draw comfortably. Wait, the article says "At 5 a.m., Diane Martin flipped to a new page... she had begun sketching around 9 p.m. Only now did she feel a bit tired and could draw without the crowds." So the time she felt comfortable was around 5 a.m., but the question is when she began sketching when she could draw comfortably. The answer might be 5 a.m., but the article says she began at 9 p.m. but only felt comfortable later. The question is phrased: "based on when she felt she could finally draw comfortably?" So the time she started was 9 p.m., but the comfortable time is when she felt it, which is at 5 a.m. The question is asking what time did she begin sketching the olive grove when she could draw comfortably. Wait, the article says she began at 9 p.m. but only felt comfortable later. The question is when she began sketching, but the article says she began at 9 p.m., but the comfortable time was later. The answer might be N/A because the question is mixing when she started and when she felt comfortable. The exact wording: "began sketching the olive grove paintings, based on when she felt she could finally draw comfortably?" Maybe the answer is 5 a.m.? Wait, the article says she started at 9 p.m., but only at 5 a.m. did she feel comfortable. The question is asking when she began sketching the olive grove when she could draw comfortably. The answer would be N/A because the time she began was 9 p.m., but she felt comfortable later. The question might be a trick here. Alternatively, maybe the olive grove was what she was sketching at 5 a.m. The article says "In front of her, an olive grove twisted." So she was sketching that at 5 a.m. So she began sketching the olive grove at 5 a.m.? The article says she had been sketching since 9 p.m., but the olive grove part was when she felt comfortable. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. The article states: "Diane Martin, 73, flipped to a new page in her sketchbook. Martin had come to the show many times. On Friday, she had begun sketching around 9 p.m. Only now, she said, did she feel 'a bit tired.' 'Every time I've been, it's been incredibly busy,' she said, nodding at the people standing in front of her. 'It's been like that the whole exhibition.' The crowds had thinned, just a little. This is what she had been waiting for: A chance to draw without peering through a wall of bodies. 'It was really to just hopefully get a bit of time when I could sit a bit easier and draw,' she said. In front of her, an olive grove twisted." So she started at 9 p.m., but the olive grove part was when the crowds thinned, which was at 5 a.m. So the time she began sketching the olive grove (specifically) would be when she could draw comfortably, which is at 5 a.m. So the answer is 5 a.m.?

4. The fourth question asks what establishment Yuan Lee visited before the exhibition, reflecting his contemplative mood. The article states Yuan Lee went to a bar with friends before coming. So the answer is bar.

5. Hannah and Tilly drove half an hour via subway? The question says they used a drive and then what mode after. The article says they drove half an hour to the end station on a subway line to arrive in time. So they took the subway after driving to the station. The question asks what mode they used to reach the gallery after the drive. So subway.

6. The object Hannah Gilbert considered but didn't buy was Van Gogh's Chair, which is a painting of an empty seat with a pipe and tobacco. The article says she didn't want to buy a postcard of "Van Gogh's Chair" because it was too sad. So the answer is Van Gogh's Chair.

7. The all-nighter began on Friday, as the article mentions "Friday into Saturday" for the event. So the day it began is Friday.

8. The total attendance for the final weekend was nearly 20,000. The article states "nearly 20,000 of those were on the final weekend." So the answer is 20,000 (but since it's "nearly," should it be exact? The question says "total attendance during the final weekend," so the answer is 20,000 (approximate, but the article says "nearly" so maybe 20,000 is acceptable).

9. The item in "Van Gogh's Chair" that activists targeted? The article mentions activists attacked the "Sunflowers" paintings. The question asks which item in Van Gogh's Chair was targeted, but the attack was on the Sunflowers. So N/A because the question refers to Van Gogh's Chair's belongings, but the activists targeted the sunflowers. The answer would be N/A.

10. The director's reason for hanging higher was to let crowds see better. The article says "curators chose to hang the works higher than normal, so that crowds could see them better, anticipating that the show would be popular." So the primary reason is to allow better visibility for crowds.

11. The two paintings flanking the woman in green were the two sunflower paintings. The article states: "Two of van Gogh's famous sunflower paintings... hung in another room. One piece came from... the other from Philadelphia. Between them hung a portrait of a woman in a green dress." So the answer is the two sunflower paintings.

12. The first all-nighter was for Leonardo in 2012, and Van Gogh's in 2023 (since the article is written in present tense but mentions the exhibition closing on Sunday, but the date isn't given. Wait, the article says "the museum said it had been the most popular ticketed event in its history, with nearly 335,000 visits. Nearly 20,000 of those were on the final weekend." The Leonardo exhibition closed in 2012. The Van Gogh's all-nighter is the current one. So the years between 2012 and 2023 (assuming current year is 2023) would be 11 years. But the article might be from 2023? The question is how many years between the first (Leonardo in 2012) and Van Gogh's event. The article says the Van Gogh exhibition was closing on Sunday, and the article's byline mentions Amelia is reporting from 10 p.m. Friday to 5:30 a.m. Saturday. The article doesn't give the current year, but the Leonardo's was in 2012. The Van Gogh's all-nighter is the current event. Since the article doesn't specify the current year, but the Van Gogh's exhibition is happening now, and the article mentions climate activists doused sunflowers in 2022. So maybe the article is from 2023. 2023 minus 2012 is 11 years. So the answer is 11.
