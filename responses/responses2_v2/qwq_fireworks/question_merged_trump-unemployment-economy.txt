Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and follow the instructions strictly. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks what percentage of the American economy is driven by sectors resistant to the traditional business cycle, according to David Kelly. The article mentions that David Kelly said roughly $7 in $10 of the economy comes from consumer spending on services. So that's 70%.

2. The next question is about the projected average monthly payroll jobs for 2025 by the JPMorgan strategist. The text says David Kelly expects 150,000 to 175,000 jobs per month. The answer should be the range given.

3. Skanda Amarnath's concern about tech downturn is linked to a 2013 hiring rate. The article states the current hires rate is like 2013 when unemployment was above 7%. The question asks for the 2017 unemployment rate right after Trump's inauguration. The text says in February 2017, it was 4.6%.

4. Samuel Tombs's view is that AI replaces jobs more than past tech. The question asks for the unemployment rate in the last month before the pandemic. The article says in February 2020 it was 3.5%.

5. Employ America's stance and Fed actions in late 2024. The Fed lowered rates three times to address the housing market. The answer is the rate cuts.

6. Rick Rieder's theory and the cause of the last recession since 2009. The text says the only recession was due to the pandemic.

7. Jeremy Barnum's observation and Trump's action similar to deportation. The article mentions Trump's threat of worldwide tariffs as a possible inflation cause.

8. The unemployment rate when the textbook undulation (pre-financial crisis) ended. The financial crisis recession ended in 2009, but the question refers to the 2002-2007 expansion ending in 2007. The rate in 2007's last month before crisis might not be given. Wait, the article says the last time a traditional recession was in 2002-2007's end. The unemployment rate when that cycle ended? The article states in 2007 before the crisis, but the exact rate isn't given. Wait, the article says in February 2007? No, the text says "the expansion from 2002 to 2007, which ended in the economic carnage of the financial crisis." The unemployment rate in February 2007 might not be specified. Wait, the question says "when the textbook undulation concluded" (the 2002-2007 expansion ended in 2007). The article mentions that in February 2007, but actually the text says in February 2020 the rate was 3.5%. Wait, maybe the question is about the unemployment rate at the end of that cycle, which would be before the financial crisis. The article says in 2007's peak, but the exact number isn't given. Hmm, maybe I'm missing this. Alternatively, the question might refer to the unemployment rate when the traditional cycle ended (the 2002-2007 expansion ended in 2007), but the text doesn't give the exact rate. Wait, the article says "the last time that such a textbook undulation happened was the expansion from 2002 to 2007, which ended in the economic carnage of the financial crisis." The unemployment rate at the end of that period (like in late 2007) might not be in the text. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the unemployment rate when that cycle ended, but the article doesn't state it. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to the rate in February 2007, but the text only mentions February 2017 and 2020. Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check again. The question is: "what was the unemployment rate when the textbook undulation, ending in the financial crisis, concluded..." The text says that the last time was the 2002-2007 expansion ending in the crisis. The unemployment rate at the end of that period might be when the crisis hit. The article doesn't give the exact rate, so maybe it's N/A. Wait, but the question might be looking for the rate in February 2007? The text mentions February 2017 and 2020, but not 2007. So perhaps this is N/A? Wait, the question says "a period now considered to have a hiring pace similar to the present?" The present has a hires rate like 2013 (when unemployment was 7%). The question is asking for the unemployment rate when that textbook cycle ended (2007). The article doesn't state that number, so answer would be N/A. Hmm, but the user might expect an answer. Wait, the text says "the last time that such a textbook undulation happened was the expansion from 2002 to 2007, which ended in the economic carnage of the financial crisis." The unemployment rate at the end of that period (when the recession hit) would be higher, but the exact number isn't given. So answer is N/A.

Wait, but maybe the question is referring to the unemployment rate when the cycle ended, which would be before the crisis started. The article mentions that in February 2007, the rate was not given, but perhaps the question is a trick. Let me re-read the question again: "what was the unemployment rate when the textbook undulation, ending in the financial crisis, concluded, a period now considered to have a hiring pace similar to the present?" The present's hires rate is like 2013 (when unemployment was 7%). The textbook undulation ended in 2007, so the hiring pace then was part of the cycle. The unemployment rate at the end of that period (like when the recession began in 2007) might not be specified. Since the article doesn't provide the exact rate, the answer is N/A. Hmm, but maybe I missed it. Alternatively, the question might be looking for the unemployment rate in 2007's peak before the downturn, but the text doesn't state that. So answer is N/A.

Moving on to question 8, perhaps I'll come back to it.

9. The question is about the size of the migrant tent city and the percentage of economy from consumer spending. The article says the tent city can house 30,000 migrants. The percentage is 70% from consumer spending, so the answer is 30,000.

10. Employ America's stance and West Point's action mirroring USAID closure. The article mentions DEI section: West Point ended clubs due to Trump's DEI ban. The answer is ending a dozen student clubs.

11. The delayed unemployment reading is December, mentioned as pending in the article.

12. The economist who warned that near-term gains could increase recession likelihood is Skanda Amarnath.

13. The historical unemployment rate associated with the current hires rate is 7%, as in 2013 when the hires rate was similar.

14. The CFO who dismissed concerns is Jeremy Barnum from JPMorgan.

15. The Fed's action in late 2024 was lowering rates three times, so the answer is lowering the key interest rate (or "slightly lowered" three times). The exact adjustment: the question asks for the numerical adjustment. The text says "slightly lowered the key interest rate it controls" at three meetings. The answer would be "lowered the key interest rate" but the question specifies "numerical interest rate adjustment". Since the article doesn't specify the exact percentage cuts, maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "what numerical interest rate adjustment action" but the text only says "lowered" without numbers. So answer N/A. Wait, but the question might expect "lowered the key interest rate" but since it's asking for numerical, perhaps N/A.

Wait, the question says "what numerical interest rate adjustment action". The Fed lowered the rate, but the exact numbers (e.g., 0.25%) aren't given, so answer is N/A.

16. The last traditional recession before pandemic was the financial crisis in 2007-2009. The article says the last time a traditional recession was the financial crisis (so the year would be 2007? Or the recession started in 2007, but the question asks the year when that recession occurred. The text says the only recession since 2009 was the pandemic. The last traditional one was the financial crisis, which was in 2008-2009. The question is asking for the year before pandemic disruptions, so 2008? The article says "the U.S. economy's only recession since 2009 was the result of the pandemic", so the last traditional one was 2007-2009, so the year is 2008? The question asks for the year identified as last time before pandemic. The article says "the last time that such a textbook undulation happened was the expansion from 2002 to 2007, which ended in the economic carnage of the financial crisis." The recession started in 2007, so the year would be 2008? The exact year isn't specified, but the article refers to the financial crisis as the last traditional recession before the pandemic. Since the question asks for the specific year, perhaps 2008 or 2009. The text doesn't state the exact year, so N/A? Wait, the article says "the last time that such a textbook undulation happened was the expansion from 2002 to 2007, which ended in the economic carnage of the financial crisis." The recession started in 2007, but the exact year isn't given. The question asks "what specific year does the article identify...", so since it's not specified, N/A. Wait, but the user might think it's 2007? Hmm, but the article says the expansion ended in 2007, so the recession began then, but the exact year of the recession's start isn't given. So answer N/A.

17. The labor market metric is the hires rate, as mentioned in the article.

18. Samuel Tombs argues that AI replaces jobs more than past tech which enhanced workers. The question asks which economist said this, so Samuel Tombs.

Now, going back to question 8: "what was the unemployment rate when the textbook undulation, ending in the financial crisis, concluded..." The textbook undulation was the 2002-2007 expansion ending in the crisis. The unemployment rate at the end of that period (when the recession began) would be when the economy turned down. The article says in February 2007, but doesn't give the rate. The closest is the 2007 peak, but the text doesn't specify. So the answer is N/A.

Question 5: The Fed took three consecutive rate cuts in late 2024 to address the moribund housing market. The action is lowering the key rate.

Let me now compile all answers:

1. 70%
2. 150,000 to 175,000
3. 4.6%
4. 3.5%
5. lowered the key interest rate
6. pandemic
7. worldwide tariffs
8. N/A
9. 30,000
10. ended a dozen student clubs
11. December
12. Skanda Amarnath
13. 7%
14. Jeremy Barnum
15. N/A (since no numerical adjustment given)
16. 2008? Or N/A. The text says the last traditional recession was the financial crisis, but the exact year isn't stated. Since the question asks for the specific year, it's N/A unless the expansion ended in 2007. The recession started in late 2007, but the exact year when the recession occurred would be 2008? The article says "the economic carnage of the financial crisis" but doesn't give the year. So N/A.
17. hires rate
18. Samuel Tombs

Wait, for question 15: "what numerical interest rate adjustment action did the Federal Reserve take during three consecutive meetings in late 2024..." The text says "slightly lowered the key interest rate it controls" but doesn't give the exact percentage. Since the question asks for numerical, like "0.25%" or similar, but since it's not there, N/A.

Question 16: The answer should be the year before the pandemic, which was 2008 (the financial crisis), but the article doesn't specify the exact year, so N/A.

Okay, let me write all answers now.
