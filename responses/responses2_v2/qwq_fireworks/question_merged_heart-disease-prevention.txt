Okay, I need to tackle these questions based solely on the provided article. Let me go through each one carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about Dr. Lara-Breitinger's research on metabolic disorders and the percentage of patients who improved blood glucose levels with hourly exercise. Scanning the article, I see Dr. Lara-Breitinger mentions doing exercises like push-ups every hour, but there's no specific percentage given. So N/A.

2. **Question 2**: Looking for which cardiologist found replacing red meat with plant-based options three times a week reduces plaque. The article says Dr. Lara-Breitinger suggests replacing some red meat dinners with plant-based options, but there's no mention of a specific study or measurable decrease in plaque. So N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The article mentions avoiding screens before bed but doesn't specify minutes. It says "some screen-free time" but no number. Answer N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Comparing blood pressure reduction between DASH and Mediterranean diets. The article states both diets are effective but doesn't provide a comparison. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Trimester linked to gestational diabetes. The text says during pregnancy, blood volume increases and some develop gestational diabetes, but no trimester specified. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Dr. Khan's study on flights of stairs. The article says her tip is to see how many flights they can climb and build on that, but no minimum number stated. N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Triglyceride reduction from limiting alcohol to one night. Dr. Haythe mentions limiting to one night but no percentage given. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Digital tracking device from Northwestern study. The article mentions tracking with devices but not a specific one. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Servings of whole grains for LDL reduction. The plant-based diet includes whole grains but no specific servings. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Early menopause threshold under 40. Dr. Haythe says early menopause before 40 increases risk. So the threshold is before 40. Answer: before age 40.

11. **Question 11**: Percentage of heart deaths from ultra-processed foods by Dr. Khan. The article says smoking causes 1/3 of heart deaths, but ultra-processed isn't quantified. N/A.

12. **Question 12**: Other pregnancy condition besides gestational diabetes. The article mentions high blood pressure or heart failure as temporary risks. Answer: high blood pressure or heart failure.

13. **Question 13**: Dr. Lara-Breitinger's favored diet. The article says plant-based with DASH or Mediterranean. She mentions DASH for high BP, but the question is about metabolic disorders. The DASH and Mediterranean are both recommended. Since she mentions replacing red meat, maybe plant-based. The article says "adopting a plant-based diet" so answer plant-based.

14. **Question 14**: Alcohol frequency for arrhythmias. Dr. Haythe advises limiting to one night or abstain. The question is about Dr. Lara-Breitinger, but the article doesn't mention her advice on alcohol for arrhythmias. N/A.

15. **Question 15**: Autoimmune disease linked to heart disease and breast cancer treatment. The article says lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, which are linked to heart disease and also mentioned with breast cancer treatments. So answer: lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.

16. **Question 16**: Exercise Dr. Khan's staff does hourly. The article says Dr. Lara-Breitinger and her staff do push-ups, squats, or lunges every hour. Wait, the question says Dr. Khan. Wait, check the text again. The article says Dr. Lara-Breitinger's staff do that. Dr. Khan's tip was about stairs. So the answer here would be N/A because it's Dr. Lara-Breitinger's staff, not Khan's. So N/A.

17. **Question 17**: Hormone disrupted by sleep deprivation affecting insulin. The article mentions circadian rhythm and insulin resistance. The hormone would be related to circadian rhythm, like melatonin? But the text says "circadian rhythm and metabolism" but doesn't name a hormone. The question asks for the specific hormone. Since it's not named, maybe N/A. Wait, the text says "disrupt your circadian rhythm and impair your metabolism, leading to weight gain, insulin resistance". The hormone isn't named. So N/A.

Wait, let me double-check each:

10. The answer is "before age 40" as per the text.

12. The answer is "high blood pressure" or "heart failure". The question asks for the other condition besides gestational diabetes, so either of those. The article says "gestational diabetes, high blood pressure or even heart failure". So the answer is high blood pressure or heart failure. Since the question asks for the other condition, list both? But the format requires a direct answer. Maybe list both separated by comma? The question says "what other pregnancy-related condition" so either is acceptable. Let me check the exact wording: "some women may not tolerate these stresses and develop gestational diabetes, high blood pressure or even heart failure that, while temporary, point to an increased risk..." So high blood pressure and heart failure are both mentioned. The question asks for the other besides gestational diabetes, so either is correct. Maybe pick the first one mentioned: high blood pressure.

13. The article says "doctors recommend adopting a plant-based diet" and mentions DASH and Mediterranean. Dr. Lara-Breitinger specifically mentions replacing red meat with plant-based options. So the answer is plant-based.

15. The autoimmune diseases are lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. The question asks for the one linked to breast cancer treatments. Wait, the article says "women have many risk factors that men don't, she said. Early menopause ... and breast cancer treatment can increase the chances of heart disease, as can autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis..." So breast cancer treatment and autoimmune diseases are separate factors. So the autoimmune disease linked to breast cancer treatment? No, the text says breast cancer treatment is a separate risk. So the answer is lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. Since the question specifies "also treated with breast cancer treatments", maybe not. Wait, the text says "breast cancer treatment can increase the chances of heart disease, as can autoimmune diseases like lupus..." So the autoimmune diseases are separate. The question is asking for an autoimmune disease linked to heart disease that is also treated with breast cancer treatments. That might not be in the text. Alternatively, maybe the question is just asking which autoimmune disease is linked, which is lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. Since the question says "also treated with breast cancer treatments" but the text doesn't say that the autoimmune diseases are treated with those. So perhaps the answer is lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. The question's wording might be tricky, but the direct answer from the text is "lupus and rheumatoid arthritis", so list both? Or pick one. The question says "what specific autoimmune disease", so maybe either is acceptable. The answer would be "lupus" or "rheumatoid arthritis". Since the question says "specific", perhaps the first one mentioned: lupus.

16. The question asks about Dr. Khan's staff, but the text says Dr. Lara-Breitinger's staff do the exercises. So answer is N/A.

17. The article doesn't name the hormone, just mentions circadian rhythm. So N/A.

Alright, compiling answers now.
