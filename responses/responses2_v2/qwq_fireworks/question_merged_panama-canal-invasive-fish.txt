Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. I need to be careful and only use the information given in the text.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks about the volume of additional freshwater in Olympic-sized pools from damming a river according to Manuel Cheng Penalba. The article mentions the canal authority is planning to dam another river for a new reservoir but doesn't specify the volume. So, N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Diana Sharpe is mentioned discussing barriers, but the text doesn't specify an electric barrier type. It mentions electric barriers as a possibility but not which one. So, N/A.

3. **Question 3:** Bella Galil talks about species via Suez, like jellyfish, mussels, puffer fish, etc. The article doesn't name a specific crustacean controlled successfully. So, N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Victor Bravo says new fish are harder to catch because they're faster. The primary technique besides harpooning? The article says fishermen use harpoons, but the other method isn't stated. Maybe netting? But the question specifies a primary technique besides harpooning. The text doesn't say, so N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Oswaldo questions tournaments giving prizes for peacock bass. The prize isn't named, just "prizes". So N/A unless "prizes" is acceptable, but the question asks for the specific prize. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Dr. Sanchez uses otoliths, which are analyzed like tree rings. The technique is called "otolith analysis" but the article says "otoliths, the calcified structures... like tree rings". The method might be called "otolith microchemistry" or similar, but the exact term isn't given. The question asks for the technique's name. The article mentions examining stomach contents, but the specific technique for origin isn't named. Wait, the question says "analysis technique similar to dendrochronology". The otolith analysis is the one. The answer might be "otolith analysis" but the article doesn't name it. Hmm. The question is about the technique examining stomach contents? No, the stomach is separate. The otoliths are for origin. The article says "analyzing the fishes' eye lenses, their muscle tissue and the contents of their stomach." So maybe the technique for origin is otolith analysis. But the exact term isn't given. The question says "similar to dendrochronology"—so dendrochronology is tree rings. Otoliths have rings like trees. So maybe the answer is "otolith analysis" but the article doesn't use that term. The text says "examine the fishes' eye lenses, their muscle tissue and the contents of their stomach. Dr. Sanchez is analyzing their otoliths...". The technique's name isn't stated. So N/A?

Wait, the question says "analysis technique, similar to dendrochronology, that Dr. Sanchez is using... examining their stomach contents". Wait, the stomach contents are separate. The otolith analysis is for origin, and the stomach is another part. The question might be mixing. The answer might be "otolith analysis" but since the text doesn't name it, maybe N/A.

Hmm, tricky. Let me check the article again. The article says "Dr. Sanchez is analyzing their otoliths, the calcified structures in their inner ear that, like tree rings, record vivid histories of their surroundings." So the technique is analyzing otoliths using a method similar to dendrochronology. The name of the technique isn't given, so N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Ricaurte Vasquez Morales mentions the expansion was vital to keep up. The question asks for another infrastructure project similar in scale. The article says the canal authority is planning to dam a river for a new reservoir. But the question is what Ricaurte cited as evidence. The text says he emphasized the expansion's importance, not another project. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Bella Galil mentions jellyfish from the Red Sea now in the Med. The article says "jellyfish, mussels, puffer fish, rabbit fish -- hundreds of them in all. The jellyfish weren't known to congregate... in the Mediterranean they gather in swarms." The specific type? The article doesn't name the jellyfish species. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The nets used by the scientists are "at least 150 feet long". The question asks for the maximum length. The article says "each one was at least 150 feet long and 10 feet wide". So maximum isn't stated, but the minimum is 150. Since it's "at least", the answer would be 150 or more. But the question is maximum, which isn't given. So N/A? Or maybe 150? Wait, the question says "maximum length", but the text says "at least 150 feet". So the minimum is 150, but the maximum isn't specified. So N/A.

Wait, maybe the answer is 150 because that's the stated length. The question might be asking for the length given in the text. The article says each net was "at least 150 feet long". The question asks "maximum length", but perhaps the answer is 150 as that's the stated length. Wait, the question is phrased as "the maximum length, in feet, of the nets used... designed to capture a wide range...". Since they were at least 150, but maybe some were longer? The article doesn't say. So N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The article mentions salinity increase but doesn't give a specific percentage. Gustavo Castellanos-Galindo says the increase hasn't been big enough to account for marine fish presence. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** The article says "some of them could crossbreed", but no specific species is confirmed. So N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Before 2016 expansion, the Smithsonian found only a handful. The exact number? The article says "a handful of marine fish species managed to migrate through the waterway and the freshwater reservoir, Lake Gatun". "Handful" is vague, so N/A.

13. **Question 13:** The damming plan would displace "2,000 or so people, most of them poor". The question asks for the number of villages. The text doesn't specify villages, just the number of people. So N/A.

14. **Question 14:** The article mentions lionfish in the Caribbean but not yet in the Pacific. Are they in Lake Gatun? It says "if they made it there through the canal", so not yet established. Other species like snooks, jacks, snappers are there. The question asks for a Caribbean species established in Gatun. The article says "a snook, another coastal species" but doesn't specify Caribbean origin. Maybe the snook? The article says "Caribbean and the Pacific". The specific species is "snooks, jacks, snappers". The article says "a snook from the Caribbean and another from the Pacific". So maybe the Caribbean snook is there. But the question asks for the name of the species established. The answer might be "snooks" but the question specifies "explicitly named". The article does mention snooks, so maybe "snook". But need to check if it's explicitly stated. The text says "snooks, jacks, snappers and more -- have almost entirely displaced the freshwater species". So yes, snooks are there. But the question specifies a Caribbean species. The article says "a snook from the Caribbean" in the net example, so snook is the answer. So answer: snook.

Wait, the question is which Caribbean fish species has established a breeding population. The article says "fish from both oceans -- snooks, jacks, snappers and more -- have almost entirely displaced...". So snooks are among them, and the example mentions a Caribbean snook. So answer: snook.

15. **Question 15:** Felix Martinez Gonzalez caught 16 pounds in 6 hours now, before it was twice as much. So per hour, 16/6 ≈ 2.67 pounds now, previously 5.33. The question asks the numerical reduction per hour. The article says "he would have caught twice as much before". So reduction is half. The exact number? The article states "he would have caught twice as much, he said." So the reduction is from 32 pounds in 6 hours (pre-expansion) to 16 now. Per hour, 16/6 ≈ 2.67 vs 32/6 ≈5.33. The reduction is 2.67 per hour. But the question asks "numerical reduction in peacock bass catches did Felix report experiencing per hour". The article doesn't specify per hour numbers, just total. But the total catch is half. So the answer is "half" or "50%". But the question says "numerical reduction", so maybe "half" is acceptable. The article says "twice as much" so the reduction is half. So answer: half or 50%. Since the question asks for numerical, perhaps "50%".

Wait, the exact wording is "he would have caught twice as much, he said." So his current catch is half of before. So per hour, the reduction is 50%. The answer is "50%".

16. **Question 16:** The article mentions the canal authority is examining ways to desalinate portions of the lake, but no specific 2023 tech solution is named. So N/A.

17. **Question 17:** Bella Galil says "hundreds" of non-native species via Suez. The exact number? The article says "hundreds of them in all". So answer: hundreds.

18. **Question 18:** The article mentions lionfish in Caribbean but doesn't give population size. N/A.

19. **Question 19:** Manuel Cheng Penalba is the critic mentioned, saying the salinity issue wasn't discussed before. So answer: Manuel Cheng Penalba.

10. N/A (no percentage)
11. N/A (no confirmed crossbreed)
12. N/A (handful is vague)
13. N/A (people count, not villages)
14. Snook (since mentioned as Caribbean origin in Gatun)
15. 50% (since twice as much before means half now)
