Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the given article. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and cross-referencing the article.

1. **Question 1:** Which law firm previously represented Drake in his 2023 defamation lawsuit against Spotify before the current federal case was filed?

The article mentions that Drake's current lawsuit is brought by Michael J. Gottlieb of Willkie Farr & Gallagher. The pre-litigation actions in New York and Texas named Spotify. The law firm handling the current case is the same as before? Wait, the article says, "the suit was brought on behalf of Drake by Michael J. Gottlieb, a partner at the firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher." The earlier pre-litigation actions in NY and Texas were part of the same case? The question is about the law firm in the 2023 pre-litigation. The article states that the current federal lawsuit was filed after withdrawing the earlier NY case. So the same firm would be representing him. So answer is Willkie Farr & Gallagher.

2. **Question 2:** How many registered sex offenders were indicated by the markers on Drake's house in the "Not Like Us" cover art?

The article says the cover art "features a photo of Drake's Toronto home dotted with markers meant to represent the presence of registered sex offenders." But it doesn't specify the number. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** What was the settlement amount Drake received from iHeartMedia following the pre-litigation actions in Texas?

The article mentions the Texas matter includes iHeartMedia but doesn't state any settlement amount. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Which streaming platform did Universal Music Group allegedly use bot accounts on to artificially boost "Not Like Us" streams in October 2023?

The article says "Not Like Us" has been streamed over one billion times on Spotify. The lawsuit alleges covert financial incentives on streaming platforms, but the specific platform isn't named for bots. Wait, the pre-litigation filings sought info about potential use of bots and payola. The article says "covertly offering financial incentives to third parties to deceptively stream the Recording on streaming platforms." But the question is specifically asking which platform? The article mentions Spotify as where the streams are counted (over a billion on Spotify), so maybe the answer is Spotify. But the question is about bot use. The article doesn't explicitly state which platform, but since Spotify is mentioned, maybe that's it. Wait, the exact quote is "covertly offering financial incentives to third parties to deceptively stream the Recording on streaming platforms". Since "on streaming platforms" is plural, can't be sure. But the only named platform is Spotify, so maybe the answer is Spotify. Or maybe N/A? Hmm. The article doesn't specify which platform was used for bots. So N/A.

5. **Question 5:** What was the name of Drake's elementary school that his son had to leave due to safety concerns?

The article states Drake had to remove his young son from his elementary school but doesn't name the school. So N/A.

6. **Question 6:** How many security guards were injured in total during the three reported incidents at Drake's Toronto residence?

The article mentions "a shooting at the residence days after the song's release that injured a security guard" and "two other attempted trespassers in the days that followed." The first incident injured one guard, but the other two attempts don't mention injuries. So total is 1. So answer is 1.

7. **Question 7:** What date did Universal Music Group extend Kendrick Lamar's contract in 2023?

The article says Universal extended Lamar's short-term deal "late last year". The lawsuit was filed in 2024, so "last year" would be 2023. But the exact date isn't given. So N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Who was the security company that reported the attempted trespassing incidents at Drake's home to local authorities?

The article doesn't mention the name of the security company. So N/A.

9. **Question 9:** What percentage of streaming revenue did Universal Music Group earn from "Not Like Us" compared to Drake's response tracks?

No figures on revenue percentages are provided in the article. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Which radio stations did Universal allegedly pay to promote "Not Like Us" through undisclosed financial incentives?

The article says Universal offered incentives to third parties to play the song on radio, but doesn't name specific stations. So N/A.

11. **Question 11:** What legal precedent, established in the Rudolph W. Giuliani case handled by Michael J. Gottlieb, is Drake's lawsuit citing as directly applicable to the alleged defamation by Universal Music Group?

The article mentions Gottlieb previously represented the election workers falsely accused by Giuliani. The lawsuit cites this as a precedent. The precedent might be the case involving Giuliani's false accusations, but the article doesn't name a specific legal precedent or case name. So N/A.

12. **Question 12:** Given that Drake withdrew his earlier filing in New York, what specific legal strategy, previously employed by Drake in Texas, is now being pursued in the federal lawsuit against Universal Music Group, Spotify, and iHeartMedia?

The article says Drake withdrew the NY case in favor of the federal lawsuit. The strategy in Texas included pre-litigation actions and seeking documentation. The federal case now combines the claims against all parties. The article doesn't name the strategy, but since he's moving to federal court, perhaps it's a multi-district litigation or class action? But the question is about the strategy used in Texas. The article says in Texas, the case included iHeartMedia, and he's now pursuing federal. The article mentions "preserving relevant documentation" via pre-litigation, so maybe the strategy is seeking discovery or document preservation. But the question is about the legal strategy now being pursued. The answer might be "preservation of documents" but the article doesn't explicitly state the strategy's name. Alternatively, the strategy is moving to federal court to consolidate cases. Since the article states that after withdrawing NY, the federal case is now filed, which includes the Texas aspects. So the strategy is filing a federal lawsuit to handle all defendants. But the question asks what strategy was previously used in Texas that's now being pursued. Since the Texas case was part of the pre-litigation, perhaps the strategy is "pre-litigation discovery" but the article doesn't use that term. Since I can't find a specific term, maybe N/A. Wait the article says "initiated pre-litigation actions against Universal in state court in New York and Texas, naming Spotify and the radio conglomerate iHeartMedia as potential participants..." So the strategy in Texas was pre-litigation actions, and now in federal, he's proceeding with the lawsuit. The question asks what strategy from Texas is now being pursued. Since the federal case is the next step, maybe the answer is "federal lawsuit" but that's not a strategy. Since the article doesn't name the strategy, maybe N/A. Alternatively, perhaps "seeking preservation of documents" as part of pre-litigation. But the question says "specific legal strategy... previously employed in Texas". The article says he "initiated pre-litigation actions... seeking to obtain further information and preserve relevant documentation". So the strategy was pre-litigation discovery/preservation. But the question asks what is now being pursued in the federal case. The federal case is the lawsuit, so the strategy might be "filing a federal lawsuit" but that's not a legal strategy. Since the article doesn't name it, N/A. Hmm. Alternatively, the question might be referring to the fact that he's using the same legal team or similar arguments. But the answer isn't clear. Maybe N/A.

13. **Question 13:** Considering the Grammy nominations for "Not Like Us," what financial penalty, as outlined in Drake's renegotiated contract, will Universal Music Group face if the song wins Record of the Year?

The article doesn't mention any financial penalties tied to Grammy wins in Drake's contract. N/A.

14. **Question 14:** How many days after the release of "Family Matters" did the shooting incident at Drake's Toronto residence occur, prompting the removal of his son from school?

The shooting happened days after "Not Like Us" was released. "Family Matters" is another track. The timeline isn't clear. The article says the shooting was after "Not Like Us" release, not directly linked to "Family Matters". So N/A.

15. **Question 15:** What percentage of Drake's total career earnings, as cited in the lawsuit, does Universal Music Group claim to have contributed through their massive investment in his music?

The article states UMG claims they invested massively and helped him achieve success, but doesn't give a percentage. N/A.

16. **Question 16:** Besides the Super Bowl halftime show, what other major sporting event is Lamar scheduled to headline, further fueling Drake's claims of Universal's biased promotion?

The article mentions the Super Bowl halftime show but no other events. N/A.

17. **Question 17:** What was the name of Drake's romantic partner, mentioned in "Family Matters," who Lamar allegedly abused, and whose testimony is central to Drake's defamation claim?

The article says Drake alleged Lamar had "beat on" his romantic partner but doesn't name the partner. N/A.

18. **Question 18:** According to the lawsuit, what specific type of bot, identified by Drake's legal team in pre-litigation actions, was used by Universal Music Group to artificially inflate the streaming numbers of "Not Like Us" on Spotify?

The article mentions "covertly offering financial incentives to third parties to deceptively stream" but doesn't specify bot types. N/A.

19. **Question 19:** What was the dollar amount of the "covert financial incentives" Universal allegedly offered to third parties to promote "Not Like Us," as detailed in the preserved documentation sought by Drake's legal team?

No specific amount is mentioned. N/A.
