Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and follow the strict instructions. Let me start with the first question.

1. **What role at CNN did the person who protected MSNBC's anchors from outside pressure previously hold?**  
   The article mentions that Rebecca Kutler was at CNN and worked on CNN+. The part about protecting anchors is from Maddow's comment about Rashida Jones being a "heat shield." Wait, the question is about the person who protected the anchors, which is Rashida Jones, but the question asks about her role at CNN. Wait, no, Rashida Jones was at MSNBC. The person in question here is Kutler? Or the "heat shield" was Jones. The question is about the person who protected the anchors (Jones) and her previous role at CNN. But the article says Kutler was at CNN, not Jones. Wait, let me check again. The article says Rebecca Kutler came from CNN where she worked on CNN+. Rashida Jones was at the Weather Channel and MSNBC. So the answer here is CNN+ architect. Because the "heat shield" comment was about Rashida Jones, but the question is about the role at CNN of the person who protected them. Wait, maybe I got confused. The person who protected the anchors is Rashida Jones, but her prior role at CNN? Wait, no, Rashida was at Weather Channel. The question might be a trick. Wait the question says "the person who protected MSNBC's anchors from outside pressure" refers to Rashida Jones, but her previous role at CNN? But she wasn't at CNN. The article says Kutler was at CNN. The confusion here might be that the question is asking about Kutler's role at CNN, but the "heat shield" was Jones. Wait the question says "the person who protected... pressure" is Rashida Jones, but her role at CNN? Since she wasn't at CNN, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, let me recheck the article. The article states that Kutler was at CNN and worked on CNN+. The part about the "heat shield" is from Maddow referring to Rashida Jones. So the person who protected the anchors is Rashida Jones, but her prior role at CNN? She didn't have one. The question might be mixing up. Wait maybe the question is asking about Kutler's role at CNN, but the first part refers to the protector being Rashida. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait the question is phrased as "the person who protected... pressure" (which is Jones) previously held what role at CNN? Since Jones wasn't at CNN, the answer is N/A. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me read the question again carefully. The question says: "What role at CNN did the person who protected MSNBC's anchors from outside pressure previously hold?" The person who protected the anchors is Rashida Jones. The question is asking what role she had at CNN. But the article says Rashida Jones had been at the Weather Channel as director of live programming. So she didn't have a role at CNN. Therefore, the answer should be N/A. Wait, but maybe the person in question is Kutler? Wait, no, the "heat shield" comment was about Rashida. So the correct answer is N/A for question 1.

2. **How many digital-only subscribers did MSNBC's parent company add in the last quarter?**  
   The article mentions The New York Times added 350k digital-only subscribers. The parent company here is Comcast, but the subscriber number refers to NYT, not MSNBC's parent. So the answer is N/A, because the question is about MSNBC's parent (Comcast) but the article says NYT added those subscribers. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

3. **Following the spinoff, who will chair the board of the new company overseeing the entity that hired Ronna McDaniel?**  
   The entity that hired Ronna McDaniel is MSNBC. The spinoff creates a new company under Mark Lazarus, who is the chairman of NBCUniversal Media Group. The article says Lazarus will oversee the new company. So the chair would be Mark Lazarus. Answer: Mark Lazarus.

4. **What programming change did the former director of live programming for the Weather Channel implement concerning Rachel Maddow's show?**  
   Rashida Jones was the former director of live programming at Weather Channel. The programming changes she made include extending "Morning Joe" and appointing Alex Wagner to replace Maddow. The question is about a change concerning Maddow's show. The article says Maddow will return to her 9 PM slot. Previously, Alex Wagner was appointed to take over 4 days a week. So the change regarding Maddow's show was reducing her 9 PM slot to four days a week, with Wagner taking over four days. The answer would be "appointed Alex Wagner to succeed Rachel Maddow as host of its 9 p.m. hour four days a week". But the question asks for the programming change implemented by Rashida Jones (since she was the Weather Channel director). The answer is "appointed Alex Wagner to succeed Maddow four days a week".

5. **What was the name of the streaming service that was shut down after the person who extended "Morning Joe" to a fourth hour left CNN?**  
   The person who extended "Morning Joe" is Rashida Jones. Wait, no. Wait, the person who extended Morning Joe was Rashida Jones during her tenure. But the question is about the person who left CNN. Rebecca Kutler left CNN to join MSNBC, and she worked on CNN+. The article says Kutler was an architect of CNN+ which was shut down. The person who extended Morning Joe is Rashida, but the question is about the person who left CNN (Kutler) and the streaming service she was involved with. So the answer is CNN+.

6. **What position did the person who appointed Alex Wagner to succeed Rachel Maddow four days a week previously hold at the Weather Channel?**  
   The person who appointed Wagner is Rashida Jones. The article states that Rashida Jones previously served as a director of live programming for the Weather Channel. So the answer is "director of live programming".

7. **What is the name of Lara Trump's new show that will air during the time slot previously occupied by Mehdi Hasan?**  
   The article mentions Lara Trump's new show on Fox News but doesn't name it. The time slot of Mehdi Hasan's canceled show (Sunday night) but the question is about Lara's show's name. Since it's not mentioned, answer N/A.

8. **What financial product will the company spun off from Comcast offer to its viewers, mirroring Trump Media's strategy?**  
   Trump Media is moving to financial services with investment products for the "patriotic economy". The spun-off company (MSNBC's new entity) isn't mentioned to offer such products. So answer N/A.

9. **Which former RNC chairwoman was hired by the network where Rebecca Kutler previously worked, prompting an on-air revolt?**  
   Ronna McDaniel was hired by MSNBC (where Kutler is now, but Kutler was at CNN before). The network that hired her is MSNBC. The answer is Ronna McDaniel.

10. **During what time slot will the show hosted by the person who expressed chagrin over Ronna McDaniel's hiring air for the first 100 days of Trump's second term?**  
    The person who expressed chagrin is Rachel Maddow. The article says she'll return to her 9 Eastern hour every weeknight for Trump's first 100 days. The time slot is 9 p.m. Eastern. Answer: 9 p.m. Eastern.

11. **What streaming service initiative that Rebecca Kutler previously worked on at CNN is being considered for revival under her interim leadership at MSNBC following the network's separation from NBC News?**  
    Kutler worked on CNN+, which was shut down. The article mentions MSNBC might seek to revive something she worked on. The answer is CNN+.

12. **How many hours per week did Rachel Maddow agree to increase her show's broadcast schedule during the transition period mentioned in the article?**  
    Maddow's show was extended from maybe 4 days to 5 days? The article says she'll return to broadcasting every weeknight (5 days) at 9 PM for Trump's first 100 days. Previously, she was only on 4 days because Wagner took over 4 days. So increasing from 4 to 5 days per week, so +1 hour per week (since each episode is 1 hour). Answer: 5 (but the question is about the increase. Wait, the question is how many hours she increased. Originally she was on 4 days (since Wagner took 4 days), so increasing to 5 days adds 1 hour per week. So the answer is 1. Wait but the article says "return to broadcasting her one-hour show every weeknight" meaning 5 days, so the increase from previous 4 days (since Wagner was on 4 days) would be +1 hour. So answer: 1. But the question says "how many hours per week did she agree to increase". So the increase is 1 hour per week. But the question might be phrased as total hours, but the article says she's returning to 5 days, so the increase is 1. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the total new hours, which would be 5, but the question is about the increase. Need to check wording: "increase her show's broadcast schedule". The previous schedule was 4 days (since Wagner took over 4 days), so increasing to 5 days adds 1 hour. Answer: 1.

13. **Which Republican figure's hiring directly led to internal backlash at MSNBC during Rashida Jones' tenure, resulting in their contract being terminated within a week?**  
    Ronna McDaniel, the former RNC chair, was hired and then cut loose after backlash.

14. **What financial metric did Comcast executives cite as justification for spinning off MSNBC into a separate entity while retaining its branding under Mark Lazarus' oversight?**  
    The article mentions ratings pressure and the spinoff to sever from NBC News. The exact metric cited? The executives said the post-election ratings dip is normal and expect a rebound. But the justification for spinoff isn't explicitly a financial metric. The article says MSNBC is part of a bundle spun off, but the reason isn't stated as a metric. So N/A.

15. **Which discontinued MSNBC weekend program hosted by a British journalist was explicitly named as a casualty of programming changes implemented before the 2024 election cycle?**  
    The canceled show was Mehdi Hasan's Sunday night show. Mehdi is British? The article says "Mehdi Hasan, the anchor of a Sunday night show that was canceled." So the name is Mehdi Hasan's show, but the article doesn't give its name. So N/A.

16. **What critical operational function will MSNBC lose access to after the Comcast spinoff that was previously shared with NBC News, according to the network's internal announcements?**  
    The article says MSNBC will seek new heads of news gathering and talent, implying they lose access to NBC News' news gathering. So the function is news gathering.

17. **How many consecutive quarters of declining viewership does the article imply MSNBC experienced prior to Rashida Jones' departure, based on the Nielsen statistics referenced?**  
    The article states viewership was cut in half since Election Day (Trump's election in November, so assuming the article is written in 2025, but the exact quarters aren't specified. The article doesn't mention quarters, so N/A.

18. **Which media organization's subscription growth numbers are incorrectly attributed to MSNBC's strategy in the final paragraphs of the article?**  
    The final paragraphs mention The New York Times added 350k digital subscribers. The article might have someone else's numbers, but the question says which org's numbers are incorrectly attributed to MSNBC. Since NYT's numbers are mentioned, if someone thought MSNBC did that, but it's NYT. So the answer is The New York Times.

19. **What technical role did Rashida Jones hold at the Weather Channel that the article suggests directly influenced her approach to crisis management during the McDaniel controversy?**  
    She was director of live programming, which might relate to handling crises like the McDaniel backlash. So the answer is director of live programming.

20. **Which presidential administration's communications team is falsely implied to have negotiated Rachel Maddow's temporary expanded broadcasting schedule through a direct partnership with MSNBC?**  
    The article says Maddow's expanded schedule is for Trump's first 100 days. The question asks which admin's team is falsely implied to have negotiated this. The article doesn't mention any admin's involvement, so N/A. But maybe the question refers to the article's final paragraphs mentioning Trump's claims about paying Politico, but the question is about Maddow's schedule. Since there's no mention, answer N/A.
