Okay, let me start by going through each question one by one, making sure I only use the information provided in the article. 

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks how many parcels the consignment auction house typically received per month from customers. The article mentions that customers send parcels to the company's post office box, but there's no specific number given. So I should answer N/A.

2. **Question 2**: The 1991 Michael Jordan card's grading. The article says some of the Jordan cards were graded for their condition, but it doesn't specify the grade of the 1991 card. So N/A again.

3. **Question 3**: The denomination of currency for restitution. The article states the amount is $108,692.49, so the currency is USD. Answer: US Dollars.

4. **Question 4**: Other NYC borough besides the Bronx where Dozier sold items. The text mentions the Bronx, but the article doesn't name another borough. Wait, the question refers to text messages he sent. The article says he sent messages showing 40 cards, but doesn't mention another borough. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The public defender's name. The article says a public defender was listed but didn't respond, but their name isn't provided. Answer N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The trophy's handle Rafael Nadal is biting. The article describes the photo as Nadal hugging a trophy and biting its handle. It doesn't specify the type, so N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The animated series related to Pokemon. The article mentions "Pokemon" as part of the stolen cards, which are related to the game, film, and animated series. The title of the series is just Pokemon, so answer: Pokémon.

8. **Question 8**: Exact date in October 2022 for calls. The article says "early October 2022" but no specific date. Answer N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Total value of the two dozen Jordan cards. The article mentions some were worth thousands each but doesn't total them. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Diaz's previous employer. The article states he's a reporter for The Times, but no prior employer is mentioned. N/A.

11. **Question 11**: Combined value of the two Jordan and Mantle cards. The article states $4,500 for those three items. Answer: $4,500.

12. **Question 12**: Number of employees during the day shift. The article says Dozier was one of four to eight clerks. So between 4-8. Since the question asks how many worked alongside him, subtract one: 3-7. But the exact number isn't given. Wait, the question is "how many postal employees worked alongside..." The article says "one of four to eight clerks", so the total was 4-8. So the number working alongside would be 3-7. But since the exact number isn't specified, answer N/A.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the total number of employees on the shift, not excluding Dozier. Let me check again. The article says "one of four to eight clerks who sorted mail and packages on the day shift." So the total was between four and eight. The question asks "how many postal employees worked alongside..." so the number could be 3-7, but since it's a range, the exact number isn't given. So N/A.

13. **Question 13**: Current NBA players' cards besides Jordan and Mantle. The article mentions "several trading cards featuring current NBA players" but doesn't name specific players. So N/A.

14. **Question 14**: Month Dozier first contacted the Manhattan store. The article mentions calls to a Bronx store in October. There's no mention of Manhattan or the first contact's month. Answer N/A.

15. **Question 15**: Action linking Dozier to the 1991 card. The article says investigators used phone/sales records matched to missing dates. Answer: Matching phone and sales records to missing dates.

16. **Question 16**: Autographed item related to Babe Ruth. The stolen items include Hank Greenberg's photo, not Babe Ruth. So N/A.

17. **Question 17**: Number of LeBron James parcels missing. The article mentions current NBA players but doesn't specify LeBron. N/A.

18. **Question 18**: Other NYC borough besides Bronx where he sold. The article only mentions the Bronx. So N/A.
