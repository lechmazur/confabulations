Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict instructions. Let's start with the first question.

1. The first question asks what percentage of Kazakhstan's total oil production capacity the Tengiz expansion will represent in 2026. The article mentions that Tengiz's expansion will allow pumping one million barrels a day, but it doesn't compare this to Kazakhstan's total production. The only percentage given is about global supplies (approaching 1%), not Kazakhstan's total. So I should answer N/A here.

2. The second question is about how many local workers from Kazakhstan were employed during the peak construction phase. The article states that at peak, around 90,000 people were involved. However, it doesn't specify how many were local Kazakhstani workers. The question specifies "local workers from Kazakhstan," so without that detail, it's N/A.

3. Third question asks which European countries are primary recipients of oil from Novorossiysk. The text mentions the oil is sent via pipeline to Novorossiysk for export, but doesn't name any European countries. So N/A again.

4. Fourth question: total hydrogen sulfide gas removed last fiscal year. The article says lethal hydrogen sulfide must be removed but doesn't provide any figures on volume. So N/A.

5. Fifth question: number of alternative pipeline routes considered before choosing the Russian route. The article doesn't mention anything about considering other routes. Only states that most oil goes through Russia. So N/A.

6. Sixth question: annual maintenance costs projected for 2025-2026. The article gives free cash flow projections ($4B and $5B), but not maintenance costs. So N/A.

7. Seventh question: barrels per day in first year 30 years ago. The article says Tengiz has been producing for 30 years but doesn't mention initial production numbers. N/A.

8. Eighth question: percentage of Chevron's global production that Tengiz will represent post-expansion. The article doesn't give Chevron's total global production numbers, so can't calculate the percentage. N/A.

9. Ninth question: number of wild horses relocated. The article mentions wild horses roam the area but doesn't say any were relocated. So N/A.

10. Tenth question: added oil storage capacity in the expansion. The article talks about a new harbor and expansion costs but doesn't mention storage capacity. N/A.

11. Eleventh question: type of gas extracted at DeepSeek facility. Wait, the article says Tengiz's oil has lethal hydrogen sulfide. The question mentions "DeepSeek facility near Tengiz," but DeepSeek is an AI firm mentioned in a different context (probably a separate section). The article's main topic is Tengiz, so the gas there is hydrogen sulfide. But the question is about DeepSeek, which isn't related. So maybe it's a trick. Since the article doesn't mention a DeepSeek facility near Tengiz, answer N/A. But the article does mention hydrogen sulfide at Tengiz. Wait, the question might be mixing up DeepSeek with Tengiz. Since the article doesn't link DeepSeek to Tengiz, the answer is N/A.
