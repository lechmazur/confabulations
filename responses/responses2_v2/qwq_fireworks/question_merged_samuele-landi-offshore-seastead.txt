Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not assume anything beyond what's written.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which Swiss bank Landi used for transferring proceeds from his carbon offset venture to fund the Liberian hospital. The article mentions that Landi had a Swiss bank account at Julius Baer, which settled with the U.S. for tax evasion. But the carbon offset venture with the sheikh isn't linked to a specific bank in the text. The answer here is N/A because the article doesn't specify the bank used for that particular transfer.

2. **Question 2:** The article states Landi helped repatriate "over dozens" of Liberian workers. Since "dozens" is vague and not a specific number, the exact count isn't given. So, N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The monthly cost of the desalination system isn't mentioned anywhere in the article. The system is noted as solar-powered but no figures are provided. N/A again.

4. **Question 4:** The text doesn't mention any family member suggesting the diplomatic passport strategy. It says Landi found accomplices in Liberia but no specific family member. N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The article says Landi accepted crypto payments through Kryptotel but doesn't name the platform. So, N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The Gatling gun specs mention it fires 1,000 rounds per minute, but the total ammunition stockpile isn't stated. The question asks for rounds stockpiled, which isn't in the text. N/A.

7. **Question 7:** The UBS Monaco account's total frozen assets aren't specified. The article mentions UBS was involved but doesn't give a figure. N/A.

8. **Question 8:** The question about the former Eutelia employee who testified leading to Landi's sentence isn't addressed in the article. No specific name or testimony mentioned here. N/A.

9. **Question 9:** The architect's design for the floating city's population isn't stated. The article talks about plans but not the capacity number. N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The two survivors clung to wood for a day before rescue. The article says they were rescued the next day after the wave hit. Assuming "the next day" implies overnight, but exact hours aren't given. Since it's not precise, N/A.

11. **Question 11:** Julius Baer is mentioned as the Swiss bank that settled with the U.S. in 2016. That's clear here. Answer is Julius Baer.

12. **Question 12:** The crew had 3 sailors, a cook, and 5 cats. When the barge sank, two survived. The total crew members (humans) would be 3+1=4, plus 5 cats. But the question asks for total crew members including non-human occupants rescued. The cats were rescued? The article says two crew survived, the others died, but the cats' fate isn't clear. The exact number might be 3 sailors + cook = 4 humans, plus 5 cats. But the question says "including both human casualties and non-human occupants rescued". The cats might have been rescued, but the text says "two members of Landi's crew survived" and "the two remaining seafarers were not so lucky". Wait, the initial count: "three sailors, a cook and five cats" were on board. The two survivors are part of the crew (the sailors and cook?), but the cats? The article says "five cats" were on board. The answer might be total crew members (humans: 3+1=4 plus 5 cats = 9 total? But the question is about how many were aboard when it sank. The article says "two members of Landi's crew survived" implying the crew is the humans. So total crew (humans) was 4 (3 sailors + cook), plus 5 cats. But the question counts "total crew members including both human casualties and non-human occupants rescued". The cats are non-human occupants. The two survivors are human. The two remaining seafarers died, so maybe total human crew was 4 (3 sailors + cook), so 4 humans total. The five cats: the article says "five cats" were on board. The survivors: two crew (humans) survived, the other two humans died. The cats' fate? The article says "five cats" were on board initially. After the sinking, the body of Landi was found, but the cats aren't mentioned. The question asks how many were aboard including non-human occupants. So total would be 4 humans +5 cats =9. But the question says "including both human casualties and non-human occupants rescued". Wait, "non-human occupants rescued" – maybe the cats were rescued? The article says "two members of Landi's crew survived by clinging onto pieces of wood" – crew refers to humans. The cats aren't mentioned as rescued. So maybe the answer is N/A because the cats' survival isn't stated. Alternatively, the question might be tricking me. Let me recheck the text. The article says "five cats" were on board. The crew included three sailors, a cook, and Landi. Wait, Landi was the captain. The article says "on board the vessel were its residents of more than a year: a 58-year-old Italian businessman named Samuele Landi, three sailors, a cook and five cats." So total humans: Landi (captain), 3 sailors, 1 cook =5 humans. The cats are 5. Total occupants: 5+5=10. When the barge sank, two crew (humans) survived. The other three humans (Landi and two others) died. The cats: it's unclear if any were rescued. The article says "two members of Landi's crew survived" and "the two remaining seafarers were not so lucky." Wait, maybe the crew is the sailors and cook, not counting Landi? The article might consider Landi as the captain separate. Let me parse the exact wording: "two members of Landi's crew survived by clinging onto pieces of wood until a passing vessel rescued them the next day. Landi and the two remaining seafarers were not so lucky." So crew includes the three sailors and the cook. Landi is the captain. So total crew (excluding Landi?) 4 (3 sailors + cook). Landi is a separate resident. So total humans: Landi + 4 crew =5. The cats are 5. Total occupants 10. When the barge sank, two crew members (from the 4) survived. Landi and the other two crew died. The cats: the article doesn't mention their survival. So the total aboard would be 10 (5 humans +5 cats). The question asks for the total crew members (including humans and non-human occupants). The wording is "total crew members aboard the Aisland 1 when it sank, including both human casualties and non-human occupants rescued during the incident?" Wait, the non-human occupants rescued: maybe the cats weren't rescued, but the question says "including both human casualties and non-human occupants rescued". The rescued non-human would be the cats if they were rescued. Since it's not stated, the exact number isn't given. The question might be expecting 5 humans (including Landi) +5 cats=10 total. But the answer is in the text? The article says "three sailors, a cook and five cats" plus Landi. So total 5+5=10. So the answer would be 10. But the question specifies "including both human casualties and non-human occupants rescued". Since the cats' rescue isn't mentioned, but they were on board, maybe the total is 10. The article doesn't mention any animals being rescued, but the question counts all occupants. So the answer is 10? Let me check again. The article says "five cats" were on board. The crew (humans) were three sailors, a cook, and Landi (captain). Total humans: 5. Total occupants:5+5=10. So the answer is 10. But the question might be tricky, but the text clearly states the numbers. So answer is 10.

13. **Question 13:** The Italian financial police audited Eutelia. The article says "Italian financial police began auditing Eutelia's books". The specific regulatory body isn't named beyond "Italian financial police". N/A unless the police are considered the body. Maybe "Italian financial police" is the answer, but the question asks for the name of the body. Since it's not named beyond that, N/A.

14. **Question 14:** The article says Landi accepted crypto but doesn't specify which one. So N/A.
