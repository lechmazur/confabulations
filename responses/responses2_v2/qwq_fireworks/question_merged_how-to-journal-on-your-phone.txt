Okay, let me start by going through each question one by one and see what the article says. 

1. The first question asks for another premium, cross-platform app besides Day One, Diarium, and Reflectary that offers automatic weather integration. The article mentions those three and says "if you want a journal app with additional features (like automatically adding the day's weather conditions), you have plenty of other choices, but you'll probably need to pay for the premium product. Among the many apps..." Wait, but the apps listed after are exactly those three. The article doesn't name another one. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question is asking besides those three, but the article doesn't mention another. Hmm, so maybe N/A.

2. The second question is about Google's introduction in the iOS 18 update to compete with Apple's Journal. The article says "Apple released its Journal app in December 2023 and added new features last year in its iOS 18 update..." Then for Google Keep, it says "Google has yet to release a similar dedicated journaling app, but its 12-year-old Google Keep can do the job... unlike Apple's Journal, can't pepper you with suggestions..." Wait, but the question is about what Google introduced in iOS 18. The article doesn't mention any iOS 18 updates for Google Keep. So maybe N/A?

3. Samsung Notes is mentioned as offering pen-to-paper on pen-based tablets. Google Keep's feature that allows mimicking that? The article says Google Keep can add drawings, so maybe "drawing" is the feature? The question is about a built-in feature of Keep that allows pen-to-paper. The article says "Keep can do the job, organizing notes, audio clips, web pages, photos and drawings." So the feature is drawings. But the question is about mimicking pen-to-paper experience on iPad. So answer is "drawings".

4. The aspect of social media that journal apps avoid is the "performative aspect". The article says "Journal apps make it easier to write about your life without the performative aspect of social media."

5. The author's scrapbook from the 80s is a ticket-stub scrapbook. Google Keep can include photos, audio, etc., so the answer is "ticket-stub scrapbook".

6. Beyond dictation and keyboards, the article mentions "shortcuts, small external keyboards and even improved (and free) dictation software..." but the question is about a specific software improvement that allows background colors and photos in Google Keep. Wait, in the part about Google Keep, it says "using the icons at the bottom of the text-entry screen allows you to do things like add a photo or give the entry a background color." So the feature is the ability to add background colors and photos via the icons. But the question asks for the specific software improvement mentioned alongside shortcuts. Wait, the article says "To make typing easier on the phone there are shortcuts, small external keyboards and even improved (and free) dictation software..." but that's a general statement, not specifically about Google Keep. Wait, maybe the answer is the "improved dictation software" but that's for typing. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "Google's Gemini or your favorite AI assistant" for topic suggestions, but the question is about background colors and photos. The article says in the Google Keep section that adding background color is done via the icons. But the question is asking for the software improvement mentioned alongside shortcuts. Wait, perhaps the answer is N/A? Or maybe the feature is "background colors and photos" but the question wants the name of the feature or the improvement. Hmm, maybe the answer is "background colors" but I'm confused here. Wait, the question says "specific software improvement, mentioned alongside shortcuts for easier typing, also allows users to add background colors and photos..." The article's part about typing improvements says "To make typing easier on the phone there are shortcuts, small external keyboards and even improved (and free) dictation software that can make long sessions of text input much simpler." But the adding background colors is part of Google Keep's features. The question might be looking for "improved dictation software", but that's for typing. Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A because the software improvement for background colors isn't mentioned in that context. Hmm, perhaps I need to check again. The question says "beyond dictation and external keyboards, what specific software improvement... allows users to add background colors and photos..." The article says in Google Keep's entry, you can add photos and background colors via the icons. The software improvement mentioned in the last paragraph is "improved (and free) dictation software", but that's separate. Since the question is asking for the software improvement mentioned alongside shortcuts, perhaps the answer is N/A because the background colors and photos are part of the app's features, not a software improvement for typing. So maybe N/A?

7. The Samsung Galaxy app that offers pen-to-paper and topic suggestions similar to Apple's Journal. The article says Samsung Notes is the app for pen-to-paper, but does it have topic suggestions? The article says Apple's Journal has topic suggestions based on photos, locations, etc. Samsung Notes isn't mentioned as having that. The question says "similar to those found in Apple's Journal app", but Samsung Notes isn't noted as having that. So the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says "Samsung Galaxy users have the Samsung Notes app as another diary option, and keeping a journal on one of the company's pen-based tablets recreates the pen-to-paper vibe..." There's no mention of topic suggestions in Samsung Notes. So the answer is N/A.

8. The app with a curated list of topics from user's photos, locations, etc. The article says Apple's Journal "with your permission, the app shows you a list of topic suggestions drawn from your photos, locations and activities." So the answer is "Apple's Journal".

9. The app that integrates mood-sharing with Health app. The article mentions in Apple's Journal: "You can describe your current mood with the State of Mind screen, which can be shared with the Health app (if you allow it)." So the answer is "Journal (Apple's)".

10. To disable the topic suggestions based on activities, the user needs to adjust iPhone settings for Journal. The article says "you can turn off the suggestions by opening the iPhone's Settings icon, selecting Apps, choosing Journal and tapping the button next to Skip Journaling Suggestions." So the configuration is "Skip Journaling Suggestions".

11. The app released in late 2023 and updated to allow printing. The article says "Apple released its Journal app in December 2023 and added new features last year in its iOS 18 update, including the ability to print entries." So the app is "Journal".

12. The physical accessory for easier typing is "small external keyboards" as mentioned in the last paragraph.

13. The AI-powered app at $7/month is "Reflectary".

14. Biometric protection mentioned is "Face ID, Touch ID or a passcode" in the Journal app's settings.

15. The app with iCloud backup is Apple's Journal, since the article says "backing up your entries online to iCloud" under Journal's settings.

16. The app introduced in late 2023 and enhanced is Apple's Journal, same as question 11.

17. The app that uses external AI for topic suggestions and can add multimedia is Google Keep. The article says "you can ask Google's Gemini or your favorite artificial intelligence assistant for topic ideas" and mentions it can add audio, photos, drawings.

Let me go through each again to confirm:

1. The article lists three premium apps with weather: Day One, Diarium, Reflectary. The question asks for another one besides these. The article doesn't mention any other, so N/A.

2. Google's iOS 18 update feature? The article doesn't mention Google Keep getting iOS 18 features. So N/A.

3. Google Keep's feature for pen-to-paper: drawing. The article says Keep can do drawings, so answer is "drawings".

4. The aspect is "performative aspect".

5. Ticket-stub scrapbook.

6. The question is tricky. The article's last paragraph mentions "improved dictation software" but that's for typing. The feature for background colors is part of Google Keep's standard features. Since the question says "specific software improvement mentioned alongside shortcuts...", maybe the answer is N/A because the software improvement mentioned isn't linked to background colors. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "background colors and photos" but the question asks for the name of the improvement. Since it's not named, maybe N/A. Hmm, but the article says in Google Keep's section, you can add background colors via the icons. The software improvement mentioned in the last paragraph is dictation, but the question is about the feature in Keep. The answer might be N/A here.

Wait, the question says "specific software improvement, mentioned alongside shortcuts for easier typing, also allows users to add background colors and photos..." The "shortcuts" are part of the typing aids, but the background colors are part of Google Keep's features. Since the article doesn't mention a software improvement for that, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "Google Keep's interface icons" but that's not a software improvement. So N/A.

7. Samsung Notes doesn't have topic suggestions, so N/A.

8. Apple's Journal.

9. Journal (Apple's).

10. Skip Journaling Suggestions.

11. Journal.

12. Small external keyboards.

13. Reflectary.

14. Face ID/Touch ID/passcode.

15. Journal (Apple's) because of iCloud.

16. Journal.

17. Google Keep.

So I think that's all. Let me make sure each question has an answer.
