Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. 

Starting with question 1: It asks how many generations of uninterrupted female lineage were documented before the first male descendant. The article mentions an adult woman, her daughter, granddaughters, and a likely great-grandson. So that's four generations (woman, daughter, granddaughters, then the great-grandson is the first male). Wait, the great-grandson is male, so the female line goes up to the granddaughters, which would be three generations (mother, daughter, granddaughters). The great-grandson is the fourth generation but male. The question is about generations before the first male. So the answer might be 3 generations. Hmm, need to check again. The text says "an adult woman, her daughter, her adult granddaughters and a likely great-grandson." So the great-grandson is the first male in that line. The generations are woman (1), daughter (2), granddaughters (3), and then the great-grandson (4th generation but male). So the uninterrupted female line is up to the granddaughters, so three generations before the first male. So the answer is 3? But I need to confirm.

Question 2: The percentage of Celtic men in the study who traveled over 100 miles. The article says "some of whom presumably married into the community" but there's no specific percentage given. So N/A.

Question 3: Which Roman historian's accounts were contradicted. The text says Roman writers were scandalized by reports of sexual freedoms, but the DNA evidence supports that women had status. However, it doesn't name any specific historian. So N/A.

Question 4: Number of types of luxury grave goods. The article mentions "luxurious grave goods, like jewelry and mirrors." That's two types. So answer is 2.

Question 5: Average age at marriage for Durotrigan women. The article doesn't mention age, so N/A.

Question 6: Which queen's matrilineal descent matched the DNA. The article names Boudica and Cartimandua. The study's DNA shows matrilineal patterns, but there's no direct link to a specific queen's lineage. So N/A.

Question 7: Number of village chiefs elected via female influence. The text says men tend to be chiefs but with influence from women. But no specific number is given. N/A.

Question 8: Rituals for non-local men joining. The article doesn't mention specific rituals. N/A.

Question 9: Month of marriage migrations. The article doesn't specify a month. N/A.

Question 10: Primary trade good brought by immigrants. No mention of trade goods. N/A.

Question 11: The tribe's name. The Durotriges. The article states that the genetic analysis of the Durotriges showed matrilocality. So answer is Durotriges.

Question 12: Lead researcher at Trinity College Dublin. Lara Cassidy. The article says she led the study.

Question 13: Gender with non-local markers. The study found that individuals with unrelated ancestry were mostly men. So the answer is males.

Question 14: Descent system observed across sites. The article mentions "similar patterns of female-line descent," so matrilineal descent.

Question 15: Famous female leader who commanded an army. Boudica and Cartimandua are both mentioned. The question asks for one highlighted. The text says "Boudica and Cartimandua, early female leaders in Britain, demonstrated that women could reach the highest levels of power, commanding armies..." So both are mentioned, but the question asks which one is highlighted. Since both are listed, perhaps the answer is Boudica, but maybe the article just lists them together. The question might require both? Wait, the question says "which one is highlighted", but the article doesn't specify one over the other. Hmm. The article says "Boudica and Cartimandua, early female leaders in Britain, demonstrated that women could reach the highest levels of power, commanding armies and heading tribes." So both are mentioned as examples. Since the question asks for one, perhaps the answer is either, but since they are both mentioned together, maybe the answer includes both? But the instructions say if the question asks for two people and the article lists one, it's N/A. Wait, the question says "which one" so perhaps the answer is either, but since both are mentioned, maybe the answer is Boudica? Let me check again. The question is "which one is highlighted as having commanded an army?" Since both are mentioned in the same sentence as commanding armies, perhaps the answer is both. But the question asks for one. Since the options are either/or, but the text doesn't single one out, so maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "which one" but the text lists both. The user's instructions say if the question asks for two people and only one is listed, answer N/A. Here, the question asks for one, but the text gives two. So perhaps the answer is either, but since it's a single answer field, maybe it's N/A? Alternatively, the question might accept either. But the article says "Cartimandua and Boudica", so maybe the answer is Boudica, as she's more well-known? Wait, the instructions say to answer based on the article's exact wording. Since both are mentioned, perhaps the answer is either, but the question expects one. Since the question is phrased as "which one", but the article lists both, so maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, this is tricky. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "Boudica", as she is mentioned second, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects both, but since the user wants a single answer, maybe it's N/A. Wait, looking back: the article says "Cartimandua and Boudica, early female leaders in Britain, demonstrated that women could reach the highest levels of power, commanding armies and heading tribes." So both are examples. Since the question asks for "which one", perhaps the answer is either, but the user wants one. Since the question is part of a multiple-choice setup, but here it's open, maybe the answer should list both. But the user's instructions say "prefer to respond in a sentence fragment or words, not full sentences". Since the question asks for one, but two are mentioned, maybe N/A? Or perhaps the answer is "Cartimandua and Boudica". But the instructions say if the question asks to list two and only one is given, answer N/A. Here, the question asks for one, but two are given. So perhaps the answer is either, but since the user wants a single answer, perhaps N/A? Hmm, maybe I should check again. Alternatively, the answer is Boudica because she's mentioned in the article's title? The title mentions "Boudica" but not Cartimandua. Wait no, the title doesn't have that. The article's title is "TRILOBITES An ancient cemetery reveals a Celtic tribe that lived in England 2,000 years ago..." So maybe the answer is both? But the question says "which one", so perhaps N/A? Alternatively, maybe the user expects one, so I'll pick Boudica as the more commonly known one. But the article mentions both, so perhaps the answer is Boudica or Cartimandua. Since the question is in the article's text, maybe the answer is "Boudica" because she's mentioned first? Wait, the order is Cartimandua and Boudica. The first is Cartimandua, then Boudica. So maybe the answer is Cartimandua? Hmm. Alternatively, since the question is "which one is highlighted", perhaps both are acceptable, but since the user wants one, perhaps the answer is N/A. I'm confused here. Let me proceed and see if I can come back.

Question 16: The residence system is matrilocality, which the article says was identified in the Durotriges.

Question 17: The town near the excavation site is Winterborne Kingston, as stated in the article.

Question 18: The artifact associated with hallucinogens is the Egyptian mug mentioned in the additional finds.

Question 19: The Roman artifact is the copper knife handle showing gladiator celebrity status.

Question 20: The researcher who warned that formal leadership was male-dominated is Lara Cassidy, who said men tend to be chiefs but with influence from women.

Now, going back to question 15. The article explicitly lists both Cartimandua and Boudica as examples of female leaders who commanded armies. Since the question asks for "which one" but there are two, the answer might be either, but since the user requires a single answer, perhaps it's N/A? Wait, but the question is "which one is highlighted as having commanded an army?" Since both are mentioned together, maybe the answer is both. But the answer format requires a single answer. Alternatively, the question might accept either. Since the user wants a direct answer, maybe the correct answer is "Boudica" because she is more commonly known, but the article doesn't single her out. The article says "Cartimandua and Boudica" so perhaps the answer is both, but since the question asks for one, maybe N/A. Alternatively, the user might accept either. Let me check the exact wording again. The question says "which one is highlighted as having commanded an army?" The article says "demonstrated that women could reach the highest levels of power, commanding armies and heading tribes." So both are examples. Since the question asks for one, but there are two, the answer should be N/A because the question requires a single answer but two are provided. Hence, N/A.

Now, going back to question 1: The generations. The text says "an adult woman, her daughter, her adult granddaughters and a likely great-grandson." So the generations in the matriline are: woman (1), daughter (2), granddaughters (3). The great-grandson is the 4th generation but male. The question is how many generations of uninterrupted female lineage before the first male. The first male is the great-grandson, so before him, the female line went up to the granddaughters (3 generations). So the answer is 3. So I'll put 3 there.

Question 14: The descent system observed across sites was "female-line descent", which is matrilineal. The question asks for the type, so "matrilineal descent" or "matrilineal".

Alright, proceeding with these answers.
