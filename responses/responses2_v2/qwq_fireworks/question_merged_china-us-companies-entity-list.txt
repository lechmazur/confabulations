Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked and not infer beyond the text.

1. The first question asks which U.S. defense contractor was both added to China's export control list and banned from all business operations in China due to Taiwan arms sales. The article mentions companies added to the export control list and the unreliable entities list (which includes the ban on business and entry). The unreliable entities list was for Taiwan arms sales. The companies listed under that include Raytheon, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. But the question specifies a company that's on both lists. The article says "added 28 companies to an export control list" and "placed 10 companies on an unreliable entities list related to the sale of arms to Taiwan". So the companies on the unreliable list are separate. The question is asking for a company that's on both. Wait, the article says "the companies called out by China were leading defense makers like Raytheon Missile Systems, Boeing Defense, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control." The unreliable list is related to Taiwan arms sales. So the companies on the unreliable list (10) would include those involved in Taiwan arms sales. But the question says "both added to export control and banned from all business". The export control list is separate from the unreliable list. So maybe no company is on both. Hmm. Wait, the question says "added to export control list and banned from all business". The unreliable list's companies are banned from doing business. So if a company was on both lists, they'd be on export control and also on unreliable, hence banned. But the article says the 28 were added to export control, and 10 to unreliable. The article doesn't explicitly state that any company is on both. The example companies listed (Raytheon, Boeing, Lockheed) are part of the defense companies mentioned in the unreliable list? Let me check the text again. 

The article states: "placed 10 companies on what it calls an 'unreliable entities list' related to the sale of arms to Taiwan, preventing them from doing any business in China and prohibiting their executives from entering or living in the country." Then later, "Among the companies called out by China were the leading American makers of defense systems, including Raytheon Missile Systems, Boeing Defense, Space and Security and Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control." The "called out by China" refers to both lists? The article says the 28 are on export control, and 10 on unreliable. The defense companies listed are part of the 10 on unreliable? Or are they part of the 28? The exact wording is a bit ambiguous. The article says "the companies called out by China were leading defense makers..." which might be part of the unreliable list (since that's about Taiwan arms sales). So if the question is asking which company is on both lists, but the article doesn't specify overlap, so maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "added to export control list and banned from all business". The banned from business is part of the unreliable list. So perhaps the company is on the unreliable list, which is the ban, but not necessarily on the export control list. Since the question requires both, but the article doesn't say any company is on both, the answer would be N/A. Hmm, but maybe the companies on the unreliable list are also on the export control? The article says "added to export control list to 'safeguard national security and interests.' It also banned the export of dual-use items to those companies." Then the unreliable list is a separate action. The question is about a company that's both on export control and unreliable. Since the article doesn't state that any company is on both lists, the answer would be N/A. But maybe the question is a trick, and the companies on the unreliable list are also part of the 28 on export control. Wait the article says "added 28 companies to an export control list... placed 10 companies on unreliable entities list related to Taiwan arms sales". So the 10 are separate from the 28. So the answer is N/A because the question asks for a company that is both on the export control and the unreliable list, but the article doesn't mention any overlap. So the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe the question is not about being on both lists, but added to export control and banned from business (which is the unreliable list's consequence). The question's phrasing is a bit tricky. The first part: "added to China's export control list" and "banned from all business operations in China due to involvement in Taiwan arms sales". The ban from business is part of the unreliable list's consequence. So the company must be on the unreliable list (due to Taiwan arms sales) and also added to the export control list. But the article doesn't say any company is on both lists. So the answer is N/A.

2. The second question asks for the specific rare minerals banned from export. The article mentions "banned the export of rare minerals to the United States", but doesn't name which ones. So answer N/A.

3. The third question: total companies affected by export control list (28) plus unreliable entities (10) = 38. The article says "added 28 companies... placed 10 companies". So total 38. But the question says "in response to U.S. drone restrictions". Wait, the article mentions "The steps are part of an economic tit-for-tat that has escalated in recent months. It began during Mr. Trump's first term... The Biden administration has also expanded its restrictions... recently targeting 140 Chinese companies. On Thursday, the administration said it was considering a new rule that could restrict or ban Chinese drones in the United States." So the latest measures (the 28+10) were in response to the drone restrictions? The article says "the steps are part of an economic tit-for-tat". The question's phrasing is "announced in response to U.S. drone restrictions". The drone restriction by Biden was mentioned as the latest (Thursday's action). The Chinese measures (the 28+10) were announced on Thursday, same day as Biden's drone consideration? The article says "on Thursday, the administration said it was considering a new rule that could restrict or ban Chinese drones in the US." So the Chinese actions (the 28+10) are part of the tit-for-tat, but the question is whether they were in response to the drone restriction. Since the article says the Chinese measures were taken on Thursday, and the Biden drone consideration was also on Thursday, perhaps they are linked. The question is asking for the total companies affected by the two lists announced in response to that. So the answer would be 28+10=38. But need to confirm the exact context. The article says "China's Ministry of Commerce said it added 28 companies to an export control list... placed 10 companies on an unreliable entities list related to the sale of arms to Taiwan." So those actions were part of the latest measures, which are part of the tit-for-tat. The answer is 38.

4. The fourth question: which U.S. administration first imposed tariffs leading to Beijing's unreliable entities list. The article says "The steps are part of an economic tit-for-tat that has escalated in recent months. It began during Mr. Trump's first term, after he took aim at China with tariffs and restrictions on trade. At that time, Beijing took mostly symbolic and measured responses in retaliation. Since then, the Biden administration has also expanded its restrictions..." The unreliable entities list was created by China in response to the initial tariffs. The article mentions that the unreliable list is part of the response. The first administration to impose tariffs was Trump's first term. So the answer is Trump's first administration.

5. Fifth question: specific dual-use item from Lockheed Martin that triggered inclusion on unreliable list. The article says the unreliable list is related to arms sales to Taiwan, but doesn't mention specific items. The question asks which item was the trigger. Since the article doesn't name any specific item, answer N/A.

6. Sixth question: number of American companies prohibited by Biden's expanded restrictions. The article states "the Biden administration has also expanded its restrictions on Chinese companies and imposed bans on dual-use products, recently targeting 140 Chinese companies." Wait, that's Chinese companies. The question is about American companies. The article says "the administration said it was considering a new rule that could restrict or ban Chinese drones in the United States." But the question is about Biden's expanded restrictions referenced in the text that targeted American companies? Wait, the article says "the Biden administration has also expanded its restrictions on Chinese companies and imposed bans on dual-use products, recently targeting 140 Chinese companies." So the 140 are Chinese companies. The question is about American companies prohibited by Biden's rules. The article doesn't mention American companies being restricted by Biden in this context. So answer N/A.

7. Seventh question: which U.S. state or city's politicians were targeted by panda diplomacy. The article mentions "Panda Politics: Records and interviews show that Chinese officials have sought to use pandas as leverage to cultivate relationships with local U.S. politicians, shape policy on Taiwan and soften China's image abroad." It doesn't specify a particular state or city. So answer N/A.

8. Eighth question: numerical threshold used by Biden to determine the 140 companies. The article says "targeting 140 Chinese companies" but doesn't mention any threshold (like revenue or something). So N/A.

9. Ninth question: which Boeing executive was barred. The article mentions "preventing them from doing any business in China and prohibiting their executives from entering or living in the country." But no names are given. So N/A.

10. Tenth question: number added to export control list. The article says 28 companies. So answer 28.

11. Eleventh question: number on unreliable entities list for Taiwan arms. The article states 10 companies on unreliable entities related to Taiwan arms sales. So 10.

12. Twelfth question: firm noted for missile systems division mentioned. The article lists Raytheon Missile Systems, Boeing Defense, and Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control. The question asks for one specifically noted. The example mentions all three, but the question asks for "which firm—specifically noted for its missile systems division". The answer would be Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, or Raytheon Missile Systems. The article says "Among the companies called out by China were the leading American makers of defense systems, including Raytheon Missile Systems, Boeing Defense, Space and Security and Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control." So any of these. Since the question asks for one, but maybe all are possible. But the question says "specifically noted", so perhaps all three are correct, but the answer expects one. The first one mentioned is Raytheon, but the question says "specifically noted for its missile systems division". The example includes "Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control", so maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, the question might accept any of them. The article says "Raytheon Missile Systems, Boeing Defense, Space and Security and Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control". The exact phrase for Lockheed is "Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control" which is a division. So the answer is Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control. Alternatively, Raytheon Missile Systems. The question says "which firm—specifically noted for its missile systems division", so either is correct, but the question might expect the first one. Wait, the article says "including Raytheon Missile Systems, Boeing Defense, Space and Security and Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control." So the three are listed. The question is asking for which firm was mentioned, so any of them. But perhaps the answer is one of them. Since the question is phrased as "which firm", maybe the first one is acceptable. However, the answer should be exact. The article mentions all three, so perhaps any is correct. But the answer must be exact. Since the question says "specifically noted for its missile systems division", the correct answer would be either Raytheon Missile Systems or Lockheed Martin's division. Since both are mentioned. But the question asks for "which firm", so the company name. So Lockheed Martin's division is part of Lockheed Martin, but the name given is "Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control". The question might accept "Lockheed Martin" but the exact term in the article is the division. Hmm. The question is tricky. Let me check the exact wording again. The article says "Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control". So the correct answer is that division's name. But the question asks for the firm (company), so the parent company is Lockheed Martin. Alternatively, the division is part of the firm. The question says "firm—specifically noted for its missile systems division", so the answer is Lockheed Martin, as the division is part of it. But the article lists the division's name. The question might expect the full name as in the text. The options are the three mentioned. Since the question is asking for one, perhaps the first one listed. Alternatively, maybe all three are acceptable. But the instructions say to answer exactly as per the text. Since the question is "which firm", the answer would be the company name. So for example, Raytheon, Boeing, or Lockheed Martin. The division names are part of the companies. The answer should be the company name. The article says "Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control" so the company is Lockheed Martin. So the answer is Lockheed Martin. Alternatively, the exact phrase "Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control" is the answer. But the question says "firm"—company. So the firm is Lockheed Martin. But the article lists the division's name, so perhaps the answer is that division's name. The question might be expecting that. Since the question specifies "missile systems division", the example includes that in the division name. So the answer is Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control. Let me check the article again: "Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control". So that's the exact phrase. So the answer is that full name. 

13. Thirteenth question: which category of companies remain unaffected. The article says "Mr. Hart said that Chinese authorities have generally been careful not to take action that directly affected the business of companies on the ground. 'Normally the actions China takes do not impact companies who are benefiting China's economy,' Mr. Hart said." So the category is companies benefiting China's economy. So the answer is companies benefiting China's economy.

14. Fourteenth question: which tech firm was under scrutiny. The article mentions "Chinese regulators have announced an investigation into the American computer chip company Nvidia". So Nvidia.

15. Fifteenth question: incoming leader who planned tariffs before assuming office. The article says "With weeks to go before President-elect Donald J. Trump takes the office with a promise to impose new tariffs and sanctions on China". So Trump.

16. Sixteenth question: measure Biden was considering to limit Chinese tech product. The article says "the administration said it was considering a new rule that could restrict or ban Chinese drones in the United States." So restricting or banning Chinese drones.

17. Seventeenth question: natural resource banned besides dual-use items. The article mentions "banned the export of rare minerals to the United States". So rare minerals.

18. Eighteenth question: during which presidential term did the retaliatory tariffs begin. The article states "It began during Mr. Trump's first term". So Trump's first term.

19. Nineteenth question: journalist's name. The article ends with "Alexandra Stevenson is the Shanghai bureau chief for The Times, reporting on China's economy and society. More about Alexandra Stevenson" and the byline starts with "By Alexandra Stevenson Reporting from Hong Kong". So the answer is Alexandra Stevenson.
