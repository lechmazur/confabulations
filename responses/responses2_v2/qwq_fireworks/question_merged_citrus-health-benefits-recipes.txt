Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. Let me start by reading through the questions and then cross-referencing each with the article to find the answers.

1. The first question is about the dosage of vitamin C in a 2013 meta-analysis that reduced cold duration by about one-tenth. The article mentions that consuming at least 200 mg daily helped people recover 8% faster. Since one-tenth is 10%, but the article says 8%, maybe the answer is 200 mg. The question specifies supplements, which the article does mention, so that's the threshold.

2. The second question asks which micronutrient is lost when making the Citrus and Herb Tonic. The recipe uses citrus fruits, but when juicing, you lose fiber. Wait, but the question mentions a micronutrient. Wait, the article says when you juice, you lose fiber (which is a macronutrient, but maybe they consider micronutrients? Wait, the article says "other nutritional benefits -- think gut-friendly fiber, hydrating water and other micronutrients -- that you won't find in powders..." So when making juice, you lose fiber and other micronutrients. The question is asking which micronutrient is lost. But the specific recipe is the Citrus and Herb Tonic, which uses the whole fruits? Wait, no. The recipe uses citrus fruits, but the article says when you juice, you lose fiber and other micronutrients. Wait, the question says "when preparing the Citrus and Herb Tonic recipe" – does that recipe involve juicing? The recipe description says "combines lemons, limes, oranges, turmeric and ginger." The article's section about juice says "Choose oranges over O.J." implying that the whole fruit is better. The Tonic recipe might be using whole fruits? The article doesn't specify, but the question is about a micronutrient lost when preparing the Tonic. Hmm, maybe the answer is fiber, but it's a macronutrient. Wait, the question says "micronutrient", so maybe vitamin C? No, because if you're using the whole fruit, you get vitamin C. Maybe the answer is the other micronutrients mentioned. But the question is tricky. Wait, maybe the question is a trick, because the Tonic might involve juicing, so the lost micronutrient is the ones in the fiber? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the article says when you juice, you lose fiber and other micronutrients, so the answer would be "other micronutrients", but the question wants a specific one. Wait, the article mentions carotenoids as another compound in citrus. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "fiber", but it's a macronutrient. Wait the question says "micronutrient", so maybe not. Maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "you're also getting other nutritional benefits -- think gut-friendly fiber, hydrating water and other micronutrients -- that you won't find in powders..." So when juicing, you lose those. But the question is about the Tonic recipe. If the Tonic uses whole fruits, then maybe they aren't lost. But if the recipe involves juice, then the lost micronutrients would be the ones from the fiber? Or maybe the question is referring to the fiber being lost, even though it's a macronutrient. The question is phrased as "which micronutrient", so perhaps the answer is N/A, but maybe the article mentions a specific one. Wait, the article mentions carotenoids as another antioxidant. Maybe carotenoids are lost? Not sure. Wait the question says "lost when preparing the Citrus and Herb Tonic". The recipe might use the whole fruits, so maybe no micronutrient is lost. Hmm, maybe I need to look again. The article says "When you juice a citrus fruit, you end up losing much of its beneficial fiber, Dr. Meireles said. And because it takes several fruits to produce a glass of juice, you typically consume more sugar and calories when you drink it." The Tonic recipe uses "lemons, limes, oranges, turmeric and ginger" – maybe they are using the whole fruits (like peels?), but if it's a juice, then the answer would be fiber (but that's not a micronutrient). Since the question specifies a micronutrient, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but the article also mentions that juice lacks other micronutrients. Wait, maybe the answer is "vitamin C" but that's not lost. Hmm. Maybe the answer is N/A because the article doesn't specify which micronutrient is lost. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick and the answer is "fiber", even though it's a macronutrient. But the question says micronutrient. Hmm. I'll have to think again. Maybe the correct answer is "N/A".

Wait, the question says "which micronutrient... is lost when preparing the Citrus and Herb Tonic recipe". If the recipe uses whole fruits, then nothing is lost, so the answer would be N/A. But if the recipe uses juice, then the answer would be the micronutrients lost when juicing. Since the article says "Choose oranges over O.J." implying that the whole fruit is better, maybe the Tonic is using whole fruits, so no loss. Hence, answer N/A. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the article's example of the Tonic is using juice. The recipe's description says "warm, restorative drink" which could be made with juice. In that case, the lost micronutrient would be fiber (not a micronutrient), so the answer is N/A. Hmm. Maybe I should skip and come back.

3. The third question asks which enzyme is activated by grapefruit leading to decreased concentration of medication. Wait the article says grapefruit can interfere by blocking an enzyme that helps metabolize certain drugs. So blocking the enzyme would mean more drug in bloodstream. But the question says "activated by grapefruit, leading to decreased concentration" – that's the opposite. Wait, the article says "grapefruit can interfere with some medicines by blocking an enzyme that helps metabolize certain drugs. As a result, more of the drug enters your bloodstream, increasing the risk of side effects." So the enzyme is blocked, leading to less metabolism, so more drug. But the question says "activated... leading to decreased concentration" – so that's incorrect. Maybe the question has a mistake, but I have to answer based on the text. The enzyme is blocked, so the correct answer is the enzyme's name. The article doesn't name the enzyme, just says "an enzyme". So the answer is N/A.

4. The fourth question: the specific type of iron in green olives that is better absorbed with vitamin C. The article mentions non-heme iron from plant-based foods like lentils and spinach. The olives are in the Citrus Salad recipe. The question asks about the iron in the olives. Since olives are plant-based, their iron is non-heme. So the answer is "non-heme iron".

5. Fifth question: besides carotenoids, what other compound in tangerine zest contributes to anti-inflammatory benefits? The article mentions that citrus oils in the peel's outer layer contain antioxidants. The specific compound is "citrus oils" or maybe another term. Wait, the article says "citrus oils in the peel's outer layer contain their own antioxidants". But the question asks for a specific compound besides carotenoids. The article doesn't mention another specific compound, so maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the citrus oils themselves are the compound, but that's not a specific compound. Hmm. The article doesn't name another specific compound besides carotenoids, so N/A.

6. Sixth question: the percentage reduction in flu duration from 200 mg vitamin C. The article says the meta-analysis found 200 mg helped common cold duration 8% faster. The question says "flu" instead of cold. Since the article mentions common cold, not flu, the answer would be N/A. But maybe they confused cold and flu, so the answer is 8% but the question is wrong. Since the article doesn't mention flu, answer N/A.

7. Seventh question: which health condition linked to chronic inflammation is combated by citrus oils in the shrimp recipe. The article says chronic inflammation raises risk of cancer, heart disease, diabetes. The citrus oils (in the peel) help with anti-inflammatory benefits. The question asks which condition is directly combated. The article doesn't link a specific condition to the citrus oils in that recipe, just mentions the general anti-inflammatory benefits. So the answer is one of the three: cancer, heart disease, diabetes. The question says "specific", so maybe one of them. Since the shrimp recipe is mentioned, but the article doesn't specify which condition, so answer N/A.

8. Eighth question: what savory ingredient in the Citrus Salad With Fennel and Olives is rich in non-heme iron. The recipe includes green olives. The article says non-heme iron is from plant-based foods like lentils and spinach, but olives are also plant-based. So the answer is "green olives".

9. Ninth question: which cellular process is impacted by grapefruit's interaction with thyroid meds. The article says grapefruit can block absorption of thyroid meds. The process affected would be drug absorption or metabolism. The question says "cellular process supported by vitamin C". The article mentions that vitamin C helps form immune cells. But the interaction with meds might affect how the drug is metabolized. The question is about the cellular process that's negatively impacted. Since the thyroid meds aren't absorbed, the cellular process related to their function (like hormone regulation) is affected. But the article doesn't specify the cellular process, so maybe N/A. Alternatively, the cellular process supported by vitamin C that's negatively impacted? The article says grapefruit can block the drug's absorption, which might affect how the drug works, but the question links it to vitamin C's role. Maybe the answer is "immune cell formation" because the drug's absorption is blocked, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, the process is the drug's metabolism, but not a cellular process supported by vitamin C. Hmm, maybe N/A.

10. Tenth question: what age-related disease is potentially mitigated by the same antioxidants as citrus, mentioned in off-label use of Rapamycin. The article's last paragraphs mention Rapamycin being used off-label for aging and age-related diseases. The question asks which specific disease, but the article says "age-related diseases" generally. So the answer would be N/A as it's plural, but maybe "aging" isn't a disease. The question might expect "aging" but that's not a disease. Alternatively, maybe "age-related diseases" but the question wants one. Since the article doesn't specify, answer N/A.

11. Eleventh question: if someone adds zest, which compound did they miss? Wait, the question says they added zest but missed a compound. Wait, the article says the zest has antioxidants. The question says "missed out on by not staying with whole fruits as recommended". Wait, the article recommends using zest. If they added zest, they didn't miss it. Wait the question says "mistakenly added citrus zest from the peel, which expert-added antioxidant compound did they miss out on by not staying with whole fruits". Wait, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly. If they added zest, they got the zest's antioxidants, but maybe there's another compound. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking which compound they would have missed if they didn't use zest. The question is confusing. The article says zest contains antioxidants (citrus oils), so if they added zest, they didn't miss them. Maybe the question intended to say they didn't use zest, so the answer is "citrus oils". But the question says they added zest, so maybe N/A. Hmm, perhaps the question is a trick, but I think it's a mistake. The correct answer would be the zest's antioxidants, but they added it, so maybe N/A. Alternatively, the question is phrased wrong and the answer is "citrus oils".

12. Twelfth question: how many more mg does a navel orange provide over half grapefruit? The article says one navel has 83 mg, half grapefruit 46. 83-46=37. So answer is 37.

13. Thirteenth question: which fruit affects thyroid meds? Grapefruit, as per the article.

14. Fourteenth question: what natural source provides vitamin C plus fiber, water, etc. The article says whole fruits are better than supplements because they have fiber, water, and other micronutrients. So the answer is "whole citrus fruits".

15. Fifteenth question: which nutrient supports immune cell formation and tissue repair. The article says vitamin C plays role in immune system and aids in wound healing and tissue growth. So the answer is "vitamin C".

16. Sixteenth question: primary substance in the discarded peel. The article mentions citrus oils in the peel's outer layer. So "citrus oils".

17. Seventeenth question: what's lost when replacing fruits with juice. The article says losing beneficial fiber. So "fiber".

18. Eighteenth question: which compound limits inflammation. The article says vitamin C and carotenoids (antioxidants) help limit inflammation. The question asks for the compound besides carotenoids, so "vitamin C".

Wait the question says "linking nutritional benefits with chronic inflammation reduction, which compound in citrus fruits is credited with helping to limit inflammation..." The article says "The vitamin C in citrus is an antioxidant that helps limit this inflammation... citrus also contain other compounds, like carotenoids, that may act as antioxidants." So the main compounds are vitamin C and carotenoids. The question asks for "the compound", so maybe vitamin C. Since the question is about the compound linked to reducing inflammation, the primary one is vitamin C. So answer "vitamin C".

19. Nineteenth question: which citrus fruit's consumption needs doctor approval due to enzyme effects. Grapefruit, as per the article.

20. Twentieth question: the percentage reduction in cold duration from 200 mg vitamin C. The article says 8%.

Now I'll go through each question again to confirm:

1. 200 mg (correct)
2. N/A (since the recipe might not involve juicing, so no micronutrient lost; or maybe "fiber" but it's not micronutrient)
Wait, maybe the answer is "fiber" even though it's a macronutrient. The question says micronutrient, but maybe the article mentions "other micronutrients" lost when juicing. The Tonic recipe uses whole fruits (since it's a NYT recipe and the article recommends whole fruits over juice), so maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, if the Tonic uses juice, then the answer would be "fiber is a macronutrient, but the question asks micronutrient, so N/A".

3. N/A (no enzyme named)
4. non-heme iron
5. N/A (no other specific compound mentioned besides carotenoids and oils)
6. N/A (flu vs cold)
7. N/A (no specific condition named for the shrimp recipe)
8. green olives
9. N/A (process not specified)
10. N/A (off-label for aging, but not a disease)
11. N/A or "citrus oils" but the question is confusing. If they added zest, they didn't miss it. Maybe the question meant not using zest? The article says to use zest to get the oils. If they added zest, they got the oils. So maybe N/A. Or perhaps the question is a mistake and the answer is "citrus oils".
12. 37
13. grapefruit
14. whole citrus fruits
15. vitamin C
16. citrus oils
17. fiber
18. vitamin C
19. grapefruit
20. 8%
