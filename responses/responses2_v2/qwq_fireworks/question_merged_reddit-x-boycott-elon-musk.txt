Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. 

1. **Question 1**: Which subreddit moderator first proposed the X boycott? The article mentions a moderator from the Formula 1 subreddit and Jarrod Maynard from another group. But it doesn't specify who was first. The text says "a moderator of a subreddit devoted to Formula 1 racing" proposed the ban, and later mentions Jarrod Maynard as a moderator in one of the groups. Since the Formula 1 mod is mentioned first in the text, maybe they were the first? But the question asks who "first proposed" leading to the spread. The article says "by Tuesday, a proposal had emerged in dozens of Reddit groups... including a Formula 1 moderator." It doesn't say they were the first, just that they were among the first. The article doesn't name the first one explicitly. So maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "leading to its rapid spread". The Formula 1 mod's action is mentioned as an example, but maybe the answer is N/A since the article doesn't specify who was first.

2. **Question 2**: Hours between Musk's gesture and first ban. The gesture happened Monday at the inauguration. The first ban was by Formula 1 on Tuesday. The article says "By Tuesday, a proposal had emerged..." So the gesture was Monday, and the first implementation was Tuesday. Assuming the gesture was on Monday, the next day (Tuesday) would be 24 hours later. But the exact time isn't given. The article doesn't specify hours, just days. So answer N/A.

3. **Question 3**: Percentage of Reddit users supporting the boycott in the board games survey. The article mentions the board games group were discussing or surveying members but doesn't give a percentage. So N/A.

4. **Question 4**: Former Reddit CEO who criticized the platform's response. The article mentions Steve Huffman as current CEO, and compares him to Musk and Zuckerberg. It doesn't mention any former CEO criticizing. So N/A.

5. **Question 5**: Reddit's ad revenue change after the ban. The article says Reddit's rep stated that communities can set their own rules, and links are still up. No data on revenue change. N/A.

6. **Question 6**: Total subreddits with X ban by Wednesday. The article says "organizers of groups with vast audiences... were discussing or surveying..." but doesn't give a number. So N/A.

7. **Question 7**: Tech leader defending Musk's gesture. The article says Musk himself dismissed the salute as part of a "dirty tricks campaign" and called the "everyone is Hitler" attack tired. So he defended himself, but the question asks for another prominent leader. The article doesn't mention anyone else defending him. N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Criteria for lifting Formula 1's ban. The Formula 1 mod said it was a "trial period" but the article doesn't state specific criteria. N/A.

9. **Question 9**: Number of members in the largest subreddit with the ban. The article doesn't provide membership numbers for any subreddits. N/A.

10. **Question 10**: Alternative platform proposed. The article doesn't mention any alternative platform suggested by users. N/A.
