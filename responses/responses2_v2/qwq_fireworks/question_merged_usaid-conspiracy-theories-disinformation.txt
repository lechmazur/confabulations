Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by going through each question and cross-referencing the article.

1. **Celebrity falsely accused of $15M and involved in bio labs conspiracy:** The article mentions Ben Stiller refuting the claim. Also, there's a food service worker and Army National Guard veteran linked to the bio weapons theory. Wait, the question asks for a celebrity involved in that separate controversy. The article says a veteran was blamed for starting the bio labs conspiracy. The celebrity is Ben Stiller, but he's not linked to that other controversy. Wait, looking again: "a food service worker and Army National Guard veteran who was blamed in 2022 for starting a conspiracy theory about American biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine. In attacking USAID, he wrote..." So the person is the veteran, not a celebrity. The celebrity here is Ben Stiller. The question is asking for a celebrity who was also involved in the bio labs controversy. Hmm, maybe I missed that. The article says the veteran started the bio labs conspiracy, but the celebrity (Ben Stiller) is separate. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait the question says "celebrity... involved in a separate controversy about biological weapons...". Since Ben Stiller is the only celebrity mentioned in the Ukraine trip, but the bio labs person is the veteran, not a celebrity. So answer N/A? Wait, the article says "a food service worker and Army National Guard veteran who was blamed in 2022 for starting a conspiracy theory about American biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine. In attacking USAID, he wrote..." So the veteran isn't a celebrity. The question asks for a celebrity involved in that. So no such person is mentioned. So answer is N/A? Wait, maybe I misread. The question is asking which celebrity accused of the $15M was also involved in the bio labs thing. Ben Stiller was accused of $4M (as per his own denial), so maybe the $15M is another celebrity? Wait the fake video mentions Ben Stiller as getting $4 million, Angelina Jolie $20M, etc. The question says "falsely accused of receiving $15 million"â€”so perhaps none of the named celebrities had $15M, but maybe the question is wrong? The article says the video claimed Ben Stiller got $4 million, Angelina Jolie $20M, Orlando Bloom $8M, Sean Penn $5M. So $15M isn't listed. So maybe the question has an error, so answer N/A?

Wait the question might be a trick. Let me check again. The article says the false video "said to have been paid $4 million for a visit to Ukraine" (Ben Stiller). The others had higher figures. The question is about a celebrity falsely accused of $15M. Since none of the celebrities mentioned have that exact amount, the answer is N/A. But the question also mentions the bio labs person. Since the bio labs person is the veteran, not a celebrity, the answer is N/A.

Wait, maybe the question is combining two parts. The celebrity in question is the one involved in the bio labs controversy. But that's the veteran, not a celebrity. So answer N/A.

2. **Total USAID grants to NYU's climate division per viral claims:** The article says the claim about NYT was based on a search that included grants to unrelated groups like NYU. The viral claims said USAID gave money to NYT, but the article clarifies that it was actually grants to NYU or similar-sounding groups. The question is asking for the total amount allocated to NYU's climate research according to the viral claims. The article doesn't specify the amount claimed for NYU. The viral claims about NYT were based on grants to NYU. The $8 million mentioned was for subscriptions, but the article says "more than $8 million in subscription revenue from a variety of agencies, including the Department of Energy." Wait, the question is about NYU's climate research division. The article says the viral claim about NYT was due to grants to NYU, but the amount isn't specified. So the answer is N/A.

3. **Russian influence operation linked to NATO expansion responsible for the fake E! video:** The article mentions the operation is called "Operation Overload" or "Matryoshka," linked to a Kremlin-connected company. The article states: "The video appeared to be the work of an influence campaign known as Operation Overload or Matryoshka, after the Russian nesting dolls, according to Clemson's Media Forensics Hub." The question asks which operation was previously linked to NATO expansion narratives. The article doesn't mention NATO expansion in this context, but the name is given. So the answer is "Operation Overload" or "Matryoshka." Since the options are either/or, but the question asks for the name, so either is acceptable. The article uses both names, so perhaps "Operation Overload" or "Matryoshka." The question might accept either, but I'll pick the one mentioned first: "Operation Overload".

4. **Number of DoE employees implicated in Politico subscriptions:** The article mentions the $8 million was from various agencies including DoE. But the question is about how many employees were implicated. The article doesn't mention any employees being implicated, just the subscriptions. So N/A.

5. **U.S. state's National Guard veteran linked to 2014 Ukraine protests:** The article mentions "a food service worker and Army National Guard veteran" who was blamed for the bio labs conspiracy. The Army National Guard is part of state guards. The article doesn't specify which state, so N/A.

6. **Percentage of $8M from DoD's public affairs budget:** The article says the $8M included DoE and others. It says "more than $8 million in subscription revenue from a variety of agencies, including the Department of Energy." The exact percentage isn't given. So N/A.

7. **Chinese journalist claiming BBC reporters were MI6 employees:** The article mentions Chen Weihua from China Daily, who wrote that BBC reporters were "all bought" by CIA and MI6. So the answer is Chen Weihua.

8. **Year Musk proposed merging USAID with CIA's covert ops:** The article doesn't mention Musk proposing such a merger. It says he called USAID a criminal organization. So N/A.

9. **Discontinued USAID program in Egypt cited by Zakharova:** The article says Maria Zakharova cited protests in Egypt 2011, Ukraine 2014, etc. The program's name isn't given. So N/A.

10. **Migrant detention facilities at Guantanamo repurposed for USAID-linked individuals:** The article mentions 10 migrants held there, but no info on how many facilities were repurposed. So N/A.

11. **Disinformation researcher warning about public ignorance:** The article says Mike Rothschild, author of "Jewish Space Lasers," warned about Musk exploiting ignorance. So the answer is Mike Rothschild.

12. **Clarified payment to Politico for 2024 subscriptions:** The article states "an independent journalist clarifies that USAID had paid Politico only $24,000 for 2024." So $24,000.

13. **Platform first circulating the celebrity video:** The article says the video first appeared on X (formerly Twitter). So X.

14. **Guidance giving green light to USAID takeover:** The article says "with Trump's blessing as the head of a government efficiency campaign." So Donald Trump.

15. **European leader amplifying claims about Hungarian media:** Viktor Orban is mentioned. He is the Hungarian PM.

16. **News org subject to misleading claims prompting cancellations:** The article says Politico's subscriptions were canceled by the Agriculture Department after claims. So Politico.

17. **Actor refuting allegations:** Ben Stiller.

18. **Chinese columnist from China Daily:** Chen Weihua.

19. **Social media figure calling USAID "criminal":** Elon Musk.

20. **False payment figure of $20M:** The article says Angelina Jolie was claimed to have received $20M. So $20 million.
