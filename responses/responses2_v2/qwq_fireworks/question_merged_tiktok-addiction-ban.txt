Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and follow the strict instructions. 

1. **First question**: The reward pathway activation by Dr. Potenza is mentioned in relation to TikTok's effects. The question asks what percentage of Ms. Kalata's daily TikTok usage occurs while she's not sleeping. The article says Ms. Kalata spends about 2.5 hours a day on TikTok. She uses it while eating, on the treadmill, and in bed before sleep. The time in bed before sleep is part of her usage. To find the percentage not during sleeping, we need to know how much she uses while sleeping. The text doesn't mention her using it while asleep, so the 2.5 hours are all outside of sleeping. Thus, 100% of her usage is outside sleeping. But wait, the question might be tricky. The article says she uses it "in bed before sleep"â€”so maybe that's part of non-sleeping time. Since she's awake then, all 2.5 hours are non-sleep. So the answer is 100%.

2. **Second question**: Dr. Tsappis mentions ADHD and overindulgence. Dr. Vaghefi's features include the endless feed, short videos, and the For You algorithm. Lisi German has ADHD and struggles with time management. The feature that exacerbates this would likely be the endless feed, as it keeps her scrolling longer than intended. The article says she thinks she's been on 10 minutes but it's an hour. The endless feed contributes to that. So the answer is the never-ending feed.

3. **Third question**: Dr. Lembke says losing access could cause anxiety or irritability. The user captions had reactions like "I WONT SURVIVE" and "how will I laugh again." So Brandon would likely feel anxiety or irritability. The answer should be "anxiety/irritability" or similar. The question says "mirroring the general sentiment," so the answer is probably anxiety or irritability.

4. **Fourth question**: The Supreme Court banned TikTok, so Ms. Kalata might consider another platform. The article doesn't mention any specific alternative. The question asks for a platform not mentioned. Since the article doesn't list any, the answer is N/A because we can't infer an alternative from the text.

5. **Fifth question**: Dr. Potenza's criteria include prioritizing the app over eating, sleeping, or working. Ms. Kalata says she feels she can't control her usage. The question asks what she prioritizes over TikTok. The answer would be one of those three. The article states she has trouble managing time and homework. So she might prioritize TikTok over homework or work. But the question is asking what she prioritizes *over* TikTok, meaning something more important. The answer would be either eating, sleeping, or working. The article doesn't explicitly say she prioritizes anything over TikTok, but since Dr. Potenza's criteria list those as things you prioritize over the app, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "based on the described behaviors of Ms. Kalata and Mr. Gapultos." Ms. Kalata says it's a habit hard to break, so maybe she doesn't prioritize anything over it. So perhaps the answer is N/A because there's no info on her prioritizing something else over it. Hmm.

6. **Sixth question**: The specific Times Fellowship class Katie Mogg is in. The article says "member of the 2024-25 Times Fellowship class." So the answer is "2024-25."

7. **Seventh question**: If the For You algorithm is removed, Dr. Tsappis mentions loss of control. Lisi German's time management issues are linked to the algorithm's effectiveness. Without it, maybe she'd spend less time. The article says she spends at least 1.5 hours daily. If the algorithm isn't pushing content, perhaps she uses less. But how much? The article doesn't give a number. So it's an inference. Since the For You algorithm is a key factor, removing it might reduce time. But the question asks for the number of hours per week. If she currently does 1.5 hours/day, that's 10.5 hours a week. Without the algorithm, maybe she halves it? But the article doesn't specify, so we can't know. Thus, N/A.

8. **Eighth question**: Beyond day-in-the-life posts, what content does Brandon like? The article says he watches day-in-the-life posts about others' work lives. The question asks for another type. The article doesn't mention other content types he prefers. So N/A.

9. **Ninth question**: Screen time limits. TikTok offers daily limits. Ms. Kalata uses 2.5 hours daily but maybe she set a limit. The article doesn't state her specific limit. So N/A.

10. **Tenth question**: Brandon's career. The article says he's an accountant in Glendora, CA. So the answer is "accountant."

Now, double-check each question:

1. Kalata uses 2.5 hours, all while awake. 100% is correct.

2. The never-ending feed is the feature exacerbating ADHD.

3. Anxiety/irritability.

4. Not mentioned, so N/A.

5. The question is tricky. Dr. Potenza's criteria say if you prioritize app over those activities, but the question asks what she prioritizes over the app. The article doesn't say she does, so N/A.

6. 2024-25.

7. N/A because no data on reduced time without algorithm.

8. N/A.

9. N/A.

10. Accountant.
