Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one. I need to be careful and make sure each answer is directly from the article. Let's start with question 1. The first question asks how many historical societies similar to California's, lacking regular state funding, were mentioned as facing dissolution. The article says that the California Historical Society received no regular state funding, unlike others. The text mentions "unusually among state historical societies, it received no regular state funding." But does it say how many others? The answer might be N/A because the article doesn't specify a number of similar societies facing dissolution, only that California's is unique in not having state funding.

Question 2: The amount the legislature approved after modifying the request. The article says the society requested a $12M grant for a partnership with UC Riverside, but the request was rejected. The question is about the amount approved after modification. Since the request was rejected, maybe the answer is N/A because there was no approval.

Question 3: Besides the Old Mint, another SF landmark that survived the 1906 earthquake considered for restoration. The article mentions the Old Mint, but I don't recall another one. The text says "one of the few structures to survive the 1906 earthquake and fire." Since it's the Old Mint, maybe there's no other mentioned here. So answer N/A?

Question 4: The building near Union Square sold was previously a hardware store. The question asks what it was before that. The article says it was a former hardware store. So the answer is N/A unless there's more info. Wait, the building was a former hardware store, so the previous use was a hardware store. But the question says "before it became a hardware store?" The article only mentions it was a former hardware store. So maybe the answer is N/A because there's no prior use mentioned before being a hardware store.

Question 5: Year the society secured a loan coinciding with the 2020 strategic plan. The article mentions in 2020 they announced a plan to sell the building, and they took a $5M loan. The loan was taken in 2022? Wait, let me check. The article says "In 2022, the group requested a one-time grant...". Then "The group took out a $5 million loan against its building, to help cover its budget, which Jen Whitley... said was about $3.5 million." The loan was taken after the 2020 plan, but when exactly? The article says "took out a $5M loan" but the timing isn't clear. The strategic plan was in early 2020, so maybe the loan was in 2020? Or 2022? The text says "In 2020, the group announced a new strategic plan that involved selling... But that effort was thwarted by the pandemic... The group took out a $5 million loan..." So perhaps the loan was taken in 2020, so the answer would be 2020?

Question 6: Juana Briones' primary occupation before healing. The article says she was a businesswoman and healer. So the primary occupation before healing? Wait, it says "businesswoman and healer". Maybe "businesswoman" is the primary. The answer is businesswoman.

Question 7: Revised square footage after sale. The original plan was to sell the 20k sq ft building. The question is about the new target after sale. The article says they sold the building, but the new target isn't mentioned. The answer is N/A.

Question 8: Kemble Collections focused on what aspect of early CA history. The article says the Kemble Collections on Western Printing and Publishing features items produced in the American West from 1802-2001. So the aspect is Western Printing and Publishing. The answer is Western Printing and Publishing.

Question 9: Alternative funding source besides donations. The society pursued a loan, but the question is about alternative funding before the loan. The article mentions they requested a grant from legislature ($12M) which was denied. So the alternative was the grant request. The answer is a one-time grant from the legislature.

Question 10: Executive director before Alicia who started the Old Mint partnership. The article mentions Alicia Goehring was the director until her death in 2022. The Old Mint partnership was in 2016. The current executive director mentioned later is Jen Whitley, interim. The article says Alicia Goehring helped formulate the 2020 plan. So maybe Alicia was the director during the 2016 partnership? The article says "In 2016, it was tapped by the city... Alicia L. Goehring, the executive director and CEO who helped formulate the plan." Wait, the 2016 partnership was led by Alicia? The question asks who preceded her. The article doesn't mention anyone else, so maybe N/A?

Question 11: Institution entrusted with the collection. The answer is Stanford University.

Question 12: Building proposed for restoration in 2016 collaboration. The Old United States Mint.

Question 13: Entity founded by Japanese flower merchants in 1912. The California Flower Market, Inc.

Question 14: Annual budget mentioned by interim director. Jen Whitley said the budget was about $3.5M.

Question 15: Example of unsung hero. Juana Briones.

Question 16: Proportion of casualties as children in the People's Temple event. The article states "leading to the death of more than 900 people, a third of them children." So 1/3.

Question 17: Collection with pamphlets, catalogs, etc. The Kemble Collections on Western Printing and Publishing.

Question 18: Governing body that declined the grant request. The California legislature.

Question 19: Person who died in 2022. Alicia L. Goehring.

Question 20: Sale price of the building. $6.7 million.

Wait, let me check each again:

1. The article says "unusually among state historical societies, it received no regular state funding". So it's unusual, implying others do. But the question is how many similar (lacking funding) were mentioned as facing dissolution? Only California's society is mentioned facing dissolution. So answer is 0? Or N/A because the article doesn't mention others facing dissolution. The question is about how many similar societies (lacking state funding) were mentioned as facing dissolution. Since only California's is mentioned, the answer is 1? Wait, but the question is "how many historical societies similar to California's, lacking regular state funding, were mentioned as facing dissolution?" Since California's is the only one mentioned, the answer is 1? But the question is phrased as "similar to California's", so maybe the answer is 1. Wait, the question is tricky. The society itself is one, but the question is asking how many similar (in that they lack state funding) were mentioned as facing dissolution. The article only mentions the California one, so answer is 1? Or is it 0 because others aren't mentioned? The question is about "similar to California's", so the answer is 1. Wait, the California society is the one that's dissolving. So the count is 1. Hmm, the user might consider that the answer is 1. But maybe the question is a trick because it's only the California one. Alternatively, the article doesn't mention any others facing dissolution, so the answer would be N/A. The exact wording is "how many... were mentioned as facing dissolution?" Since only the California society is mentioned, the answer is 1. But the question might be expecting N/A because it's not stated how many others. Wait, the society is the only one mentioned as facing dissolution, so the answer is 1. But the question says "similar to California's, lacking regular state funding"â€”so the California society is the only one mentioned, so the answer is 1. But maybe the user expects N/A because the question is about how many others? Hmm, maybe I need to recheck.

The first question: "How many historical societies similar to California's, lacking regular state funding, were mentioned as facing dissolution?" The article states that the California Historical Society is "unusually among state historical societies, it received no regular state funding". The dissolution is only about the California society. So the number is 1. But the question says "similar to California's", so the answer is 1. But maybe the question is trying to trick me into thinking that others are mentioned but not. So answer 1?

Wait, maybe the answer is N/A because the article doesn't mention other societies facing dissolution. The question is how many similar societies (to CA's, which lack state funding) were mentioned as facing dissolution. Since only CA's is mentioned, the answer is 1. But the question says "similar to California's", which would include CA's. So the answer is 1. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking how many others besides CA, but that's not stated. The wording is ambiguous. Since the question is phrased as "similar to California's", which includes CA's own case, then the answer is 1. But maybe the user intended others, but since there are none, the answer would be 1. I'll go with 1.

But let me check the article again. The article says the society decided to dissolve. No other societies are mentioned as facing dissolution. So the answer is 1.

2. The question is about the amount the legislature approved after modifying the request. The original request was $12M, but it was rejected. The question says after modifying to focus on preservation. The article doesn't mention any modification or approval, only that the request was rejected. So answer N/A.

3. The other landmark besides the Old Mint? The article only mentions the Old Mint as the structure they were involved with. So N/A.

4. The building was a former hardware store. The question asks what it was before that. The article doesn't mention prior use before being a hardware store. So N/A.

5. The loan was taken in 2022? The article says "In 2020, the group announced a new strategic plan... But that effort was thwarted... The group took out a $5 million loan..." So the loan was taken after the 2020 plan, but the exact year isn't specified. The article says "took out a $5M loan" but when? The next paragraph mentions 2022: "In 2022, the group requested a one-time grant of $12 million..." So maybe the loan was in 2022? The interim director is Jen Whitley, who is mentioned after Alicia's death in 2022. So the loan might have been in 2022. But the article isn't explicit. The question says "coinciding with the initial strategic plan to sell the property?" The strategic plan was 2020, so maybe the loan was in 2020. The article says "the group took out a $5M loan against its building, to help cover its budget, which Jen Whitley, the group's interim executive director, said was about $3.5 million." Since Whitley became interim after Alicia's 2022 death, the loan might be after 2022. But the timeline is unclear. The article mentions the loan in the same paragraph as the 2020 plan being thwarted, so perhaps 2020. But not sure. Since the article doesn't specify the year, the answer is N/A? Or maybe 2020? Hmm. The question is tricky. Since the loan was taken when the strategic plan was in place (2020), but the article doesn't state the year, answer N/A.

6. Juana Briones was a businesswoman and healer. The primary occupation before healing is businesswoman. The answer is businesswoman.

7. The revised square footage after sale? The original plan was to sell the 20k sq ft building, but after selling, they don't mention a new target. The answer is N/A.

8. Kemble Collections focused on Western Printing and Publishing. The answer is Western Printing and Publishing.

9. Alternative funding besides donations: the grant request to legislature. The answer is a one-time grant from the California legislature.

10. The executive director before Alicia who started the Old Mint partnership in 2016? The article says in 2016, the society was tapped by the city as lead partner, and Alicia Goehring was the executive director who helped formulate the 2020 plan. The 2016 partnership might have been under her as well. The article doesn't mention another director before her, so N/A.

11. Stanford University.

12. The Old United States Mint.

13. California Flower Market, Inc.

14. $3.5 million.

15. Juana Briones.

16. A third (1/3).

17. Kemble Collections on Western Printing and Publishing.

18. California legislature.

19. Alicia L. Goehring.

20. $6.7 million.

So now I'll format the answers accordingly.
