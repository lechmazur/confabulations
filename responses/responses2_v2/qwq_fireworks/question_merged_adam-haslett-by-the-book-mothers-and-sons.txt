Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by reading through the questions again and cross-referencing each with the article.

1. **Question 1:** The element linked to the protagonist's profession in the asylum case novel. The article mentions lithium as present at the universe's birth and used in treating manic depression. The protagonist is a lawyer, but the question asks for an element thematically linked. Since lithium is used in mental health treatment, but the protagonist's case is legal. Wait, the novel's title is "Mothers and Sons" dealing with asylum cases. The element lithium is mentioned in a fact learned from a book. Since the protagonist is a lawyer handling asylum, maybe the element's presence in the universe isn't directly linked to his profession, but the question might be pointing to lithium as it's part of the theme of mental health? Hmm, maybe the answer is lithium.

2. **Question 2:** A 12th-century text on the nightstand with a systematic progression. The article lists "Ornament of Precious Liberation" by Gampopa, a monastic handbook on stages of Buddhist doctrine. The novel's narrative structure might mirror this systematic progression, so the answer is that book's title.

3. **Question 3:** The novel given as a gift during the AIDS pandemic with a protagonist the same age as Rusty Sabich in Turow's new book. The article mentions "A Home at the End of the World" given when the author was 20, and the protagonist is a gay boy. Rusty Sabich is 77, so the protagonist's age isn't 77. Wait, the question says the protagonist's age mirrors Rusty's in the latest book. The latest book's Rusty is 77, but the gift novel's protagonist is a young gay boy (age around 20?), so this might be a mismatch. But the question says the author was 20 when receiving it, and the novel's protagonist's age mirrors Rusty's 77? That doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the answer is "A Home at the End of the World" since that's the gift mentioned, even if the age doesn't exactly match. The question might be a trick, but the article says the gift was given when the author was 20, and the novel's first sections are about a gay boy and his brother. Since the question asks for the protagonist's age mirroring Rusty's current age (77), perhaps it's N/A, but maybe the answer is that book, assuming the protagonist's age isn't the focus but the theme. Hmm, maybe the answer is "A Home at the End of the World".

4. **Question 4:** Profession compared to legal education in character development. The article says law school is like learning a new language, and mentions doctors as an example. So the profession is doctors.

5. **Question 5:** Country's political history tied to the asylum case. The article mentions research on Albania for the asylum case. So Albania.

6. **Question 6:** Literary work's title the author rejected as inspiration. The author mentions Turgenev's "Fathers and Sons" as the inspiration for the title. Wait, the question asks which work he *explicitly rejects*. The article says he chose the title after Turgenev's, so maybe he's rejecting another? Wait, the article states "the echo I had in mind in choosing the title was with Turgenev's..." so perhaps he's not rejecting any, but maybe the question is a trick. Alternatively, maybe the author is comparing to Turgenev, so he didn't reject another. Wait, the question says "explicitly reject as a direct thematic reference". The article says the title is after Turgenev's, so maybe he's not rejecting any other, so N/A? Or perhaps the question refers to another work. Wait, the article says "the theme of incomprehension between generations in that book (Turgenev's)", so maybe he's not rejecting any other title. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A? Or perhaps the question is asking which work he didn't reference but others might think? Not sure. Wait, the article says the title is inspired by Turgenev's, so maybe the answer is N/A because he didn't reject any. Alternatively, maybe he rejected "Mothers and Sons" as a direct reference, but that's his own title. No, the question must be about another work. Maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "he says, 'given the theme of incomprehension between generations in that book.' Credit...Rebecca Clarke Supported by A gay lawyer..." so perhaps he's not rejecting any, so answer N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Scientific field linked to cosmic origins and mental health. The article mentions lithium's presence at the universe's birth and its use in treating manic depression. The field is physics (since it's about the universe's origins) and psychiatry? Or the question is asking for the field discussed in the book fact, which is physics (relativity, quantum, string theory) but the lithium fact is from a book. The answer might be "cosmic origins and mental health treatment" but the question asks for the scientific field associated with both. The fact learned is from a book about cosmic origins and mental health (lithium's role). The field is physics, as the book is Brian Greene's on relativity etc. But the question is about the field associated with both, so maybe "physics" or "astrophysics"? Or "cosmology"? The article says "what relativity, quantum physics and string theory have to say about physical reality" so the field is physics.

8. **Question 8:** Which writer's biography is cited for missed intellectual exchange. The article mentions Ray Monk's biography of Wittgenstein and his meeting with Woolf at Keynes's party. So the answer is Wittgenstein's biography, but the question asks for the writer's name. The writer whose biography is cited is Wittgenstein, but the question is about the writer (biographer?) or the subject. The question says "which writer's biography"â€”the subject is Wittgenstein, but the author is Ray Monk. Wait, the question is which writer's biography does the author cite. The author cites Ray Monk's biography of Wittgenstein, so the answer is Wittgenstein. The question is asking for the subject of the biography, which is Wittgenstein.

9. **Question 9:** Pulitzer finalist work causing challenges despite being a blessing. The author was a Pulitzer finalist for his first book, which the reviewer called "desolation". The question asks which work caused challenges. The author says it was a blessing, so the answer is the first book, but the question's answer must be the title. The article doesn't name the first book, but in the questions, the new novel is "Mothers and Sons", so the first book might be the one referenced when the reviewer said "His prose exudes a desolation..." The title isn't given here. Since the question asks for the title, but the article doesn't name it, so answer N/A? Or maybe the first book is the one that was a finalist. The question implies that the Pulitzer finalist work caused challenges, but the author says it was a blessing, so the answer is the first book's title, which isn't provided here. So N/A.

Wait, the article says "In hindsight, was being a Pulitzer Prize finalist for that book a blessing or a curse? A blessing for sure." The "that book" refers to his first book. Since the article doesn't name the first book, the answer is N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The 19th-century work indirectly cited as title inspiration. The author mentions Turgenev's "Fathers and Sons" as the inspiration for the title "Mothers and Sons". Turgenev is 19th century, so the answer is "Fathers and Sons".

11. **Question 11:** Element used as salt for manic depression present at universe's birth. The article states lithium is present at the birth and used in lithium salt for treatment. Answer is lithium.

12. **Question 12:** Institutional experience aiding asylum language decoding. The author mentions his law degree helped in exploring the legal asylum system, so the institution is law school.

13. **Question 13:** 77-year-old retired prosecutor in new case. The article says Rusty Sabich is 77 and taking a new case in "Presumed Guilty". Answer is Rusty Sabich.

14. **Question 14:** Book on nightstand with relativity, quantum physics, etc. The article lists "The Fabric of the Cosmos" by Brian Greene as that book.

15. **Question 15:** Novel given at Christmas during AIDS pandemic. The answer is "A Home at the End of the World" by Michael Cunningham.

16. **Question 16:** Writer with sentences that bring smiles, paired with Naples wartime novel. The article mentions Joy Williams' "Harrow" makes him smile, and "The Gallery" by John Horne Burns has a smoky, boozy Naples vision. The question asks which writer is highlighted for the sentences, so Joy Williams.

17. **Question 17:** Surprising genre on shelves besides Kant and poetry. The article says "a lot of books on drug trafficking". So the genre is drug trafficking.

18. **Question 18:** Existential theme authors should explore beyond politics. The author wishes more on "how people experience the jobs they do; how, where, when and why people experience wonder and awe; and also politics... but so needed. We fight politically in two dimensions, but live in at least four." The question asks for the existential theme beyond occupational and electoral, so "wonder and awe".

19. **Question 19:** Thinker portrayed as rigid at the dinner party. The author wants to sit between Wittgenstein and Woolf, mentions Wittgenstein was stiff or rude. So Wittgenstein is the rigid one.

Let me check each again:

1. Lithium (element present at birth linked to mental health, and protagonist is a lawyer, but the question links the element to his profession? Maybe the element's use in mental health treatment is the link, so yes, lithium.

2. Ornament of Precious Liberation.

3. A Home... but the age? The author was 20 when received, the protagonist is a gay boy, so maybe the protagonist's age isn't 77. But the question says the protagonist's age "mirrors Rusty Sabich's in Scott Turow's latest book". Rusty is 77 in the latest, so the protagonist in the gift novel isn't 77. But maybe the answer is that book because it's the only one mentioned given as a gift. The question might be a trick, but the article says the gift is "A Home...", so answer that.

4. Doctors (as per the example given in the article).

5. Albania.

6. The question says "explicitly reject as a direct thematic reference". The author chose Turgenev's title, so perhaps he rejected another? The article doesn't mention rejecting any other, so N/A.

Wait, the article says the author chose Turgenev's as the inspiration, so maybe he didn't reject any. The question might be a trick, but maybe the answer is N/A.

7. Physics (since the book's about relativity etc., and lithium's part of cosmic origin and mental health).

8. Wittgenstein's biography (the subject is Wittgenstein).

9. N/A (title not given).

10. Fathers and Sons.

11. Lithium.

12. Law school.

13. Rusty Sabich.

14. The Fabric of the Cosmos.

15. A Home at the End of the World.

16. Joy Williams.

17. Drug trafficking.

18. Wonder and awe.

19. Wittgenstein.
