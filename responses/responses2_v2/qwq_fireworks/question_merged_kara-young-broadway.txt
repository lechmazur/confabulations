Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not anything else. Let's start with the first question.

1. Which Broadway show did Kara Young perform in immediately after completing her mime training at the 92nd Street Y?

The article mentions that she went to the 92nd Street Y where her brother was in a mime class, which sparked her interest. It then says she made her Broadway debut in 2021 in "Purlie Victorious".
