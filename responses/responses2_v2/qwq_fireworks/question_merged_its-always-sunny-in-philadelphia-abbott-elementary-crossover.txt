Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article and answer each question precisely. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks which member of the Sunny crew avoids participating in school repair duties because of the documentary cameras. The article mentions Dennis (Glenn Howerton) as the one who disappears early because he wants to avoid the cameras. So the answer should be Dennis.

2. The next question is about who was assigned as the personal assistant by the devious administrator. The article says Ava drafts Mac to be her personal assistant. So Mac is the answer here.

3. The third question refers to a character known for eccentric behavior commenting on dirt's taste. Frank is the one who eats dirt after warning about chili powder and garlic making the dirt taste good. So Frank.

4. The teacher who mentions giving everyone an A for effort is Janine Teagues, as stated in the article. So Janine.

5. The Ivy League institution referenced is the University of Pennsylvania, since Dee and Janine both went there. So UPenn.

6. The team's game mentioned for fights is the Eagles. The article says "how many of these characters have gotten into a fight at an Eagles game," so Eagles.

7. The Sunny character redirected to the library is Charlie. The article says Charlie is sent to the library by teachers after Jacob can't handle his illiteracy. So Charlie.

8. The administrator exploiting the Sunny cast is Ava Coleman, the principal. The article mentions Ava exploits Mac and wants to keep the free labor. So Ava.

9. The show with edges softened is "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia," as their characters are adjusted for Abbott's tone. The article says the Sunny characters have their rough edges sanded off. So "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia."

10. The next crossover has Abbott cast appearing on Sunny. The article ends by saying the Abbott cast will be in an upcoming Sunny episode. So "Abbott Elementary."

Let me check each again to ensure accuracy. All answers are directly from the text, no inferences beyond what's stated. Some might be tricky, like question 9, but the article clearly states that the Sunny characters are adjusted. Alright, that should cover all.
