Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article provided. I need to make sure I don't bring in any outside knowledge, so I'll go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about Greg McBride's anticipated percentage point decrease in mortgage rates by the end of the next presidential election year, considering Trump's policies. The article mentions Greg McBride expects mortgage rates to end 2025 around 6.5 percent. The current rate in the article is 6.93%. The difference is 0.43 percentage points. But the question is about a decrease. Since 6.5 is lower than 6.93, the decrease would be 0.43. However, the question specifies the next presidential election year. The article doesn't mention the election year, but since the article is from 2025 (as per "end 2025"), the next election would be 2024? Wait, the article mentions "2025" in the context of rates, so maybe the election is in 2024. But the question is about the end of the next presidential election year. If the article is written in 2025, then the next election would be 2024, so the end would be 2024. But the answer given is for 2025. Since the article states he expects 6.5% by end of 2025, that's the answer. The question might be mixing up the years, but since the article says 2025, the answer is 6.5, so the decrease from current (6.93) would be 0.43, but the question asks for the decrease. Wait, the question is phrased as "percentage point decrease". The current rate is 6.93%, and he expects 6.5% by end of 2025. So the decrease is 6.93 - 6.5 = 0.43. But the question says "percentage point decrease", so 0.43. But the question says "considering the current trajectory influenced by Trump's proposed policies". The article does mention that Trump's policies are a factor. So the answer is 0.43? But the question is phrased as "percentage point decrease", so 0.43. But maybe I should just take the 6.5 as the expected rate, and the question is about the decrease from what? The current rate in the article is 6.93. So the answer would be 0.43. But the question says "percentage point decrease", so that's correct. However, the question is a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the decrease from the peak? The peak mentioned is 8% in 2022/2023. But the question specifies the trajectory influenced by Trump's policies, so maybe the answer is 6.5 as the end rate, but the decrease from current? The answer is 0.43. But the question says "percentage point decrease". The answer would be 0.43. Wait, but the question says "percentage point decrease", so the answer is 0.43. However, the article says "he expects mortgage rates to end 2025 around 6.5 percent". The current rate in the article is 6.93, so the decrease from that would be 0.43. So answer is 0.43. But the question says "percentage point decrease", so yes, that's correct. But the question's wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me check again. The question is: "What percentage point decrease in mortgage rates does Greg McBride anticipate by the close of the next presidential election year, considering the current trajectory influenced by Trump's proposed policies?" The answer is 6.5% expected, so decrease from current (6.93) would be 0.43. So 0.43. But the article says "end of 2025", so the next election after 2025 would be 2024? Wait, maybe the article is written in 2025. The article mentions "2025" in the context of the Fed's actions last year (so last year would be 2024). Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The answer is 0.43, so 0.43 percentage points. But the question asks for the decrease, so that's correct. However, maybe the answer is N/A because the question is about the decrease, but the article only states the projected rate, not the decrease from current. Wait, the question is phrased as "percentage point decrease", so if the expected rate is 6.5 and current is 6.93, then yes, the decrease is 0.43. So I think the answer is 0.43. But let me check the exact wording again. The article says "He expects mortgage rates to end 2025 around 6.5 percent." So the decrease from current (6.93) is 0.43. So answer is 0.43.

2. **Question 2**: The second question asks, given the December services sector data, what specific month had the peak 10-year Treasury yield according to the Columbia professor's analysis. The article mentions the Columbia professor (Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh) but does he mention the peak month? The article says "the 10-year Treasury yield briefly rose above 4.7 percent, hitting its highest level since April." So the peak was in April. But the question is about the analysis by the professor. Wait, the professor's quote is about the economy and inflation, but the peak is mentioned in the article as April. The question specifies the professor's analysis, but the article doesn't attribute the April peak to him. The peak is stated as hitting highest since April, so April is the peak. But the question says "according to the Columbia University professor's analysis". Since the professor's quote doesn't mention the peak month, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "the 10-year Treasury yield briefly rose above 4.7 percent, hitting its highest level since April." The peak since April implies the last peak was April. But the question is about the peak in the current context. Wait, the highest level since April would mean the peak was in April, and now it's reaching that level again. So the peak month would be April. But the question is asking for the peak according to the professor's analysis. Since the professor's quote doesn't mention the peak, maybe it's N/A. Alternatively, the article's own data says the peak was April, so the answer is April. The question is phrased as "according to the Columbia University professor's analysis", but the article doesn't attribute the April peak to him. So maybe N/A. Hmm. The article says "hitting its highest level since April." So the peak was in April. The question asks "specific month saw the peak in the 10-year Treasury yield, according to the Columbia University professor's analysis?" Since the professor didn't mention April, the answer is N/A. Because the article states the peak was in April, but not via the professor's analysis. Therefore, N/A.

3. **Question 3**: The average rate during the early pandemic when homeowners secured loans, as referenced by the Redfin agent. The article says "when the average 30-year rate was around 3 percent". The Redfin agent is Heather Mahmood-Corley. The question says "as referenced by the Redfin agent in Phoenix". The article says "Many homeowners have felt trapped by the low rates they secured early in the pandemic, when the average 30-year rate was around 3 percent". The sentence doesn't attribute this to the Redfin agent's statement, but the Redfin agent's quote is later. Wait, the exact sentence: "Many homeowners have felt trapped by the low rates they secured early in the pandemic, when the average 30-year rate was around 3 percent". This is part of the article's narration, not the agent's quote. The agent's quote is about buyers realizing rates won't drop. So the question is asking for the rate as referenced by the Redfin agent. Since the agent didn't mention the 3%, maybe it's N/A. Wait, the article says "Many homeowners have felt trapped by the low rates they secured early in the pandemic, when the average 30-year rate was around 3 percent". This is part of the article's explanation, not the agent's direct statement. Therefore, the agent didn't reference that rate, so the answer is N/A. But maybe the agent's statement is part of the same context? Let me check again. The paragraph starts with "The lack of supply has kept prices high..." and then mentions the 3% rate. Then later the agent's quote is about buyers. So the 3% is from the article's text, not the agent. So the answer is N/A because the Redfin agent didn't reference that rate. So answer N/A.

4. **Question 4**: If the trend from late September to now continues at the same pace, what % will the 30-year rate reach by end of next quarter. The article mentions in late September, rates were declining, but now (this week) they are at 6.93%. The question requires calculating the rate increase from late September to now, then projecting that rate of increase to the next quarter. However, the article doesn't provide the rate in late September. The first sentence says "there was a moment in late September when mortgage rates, after a monthslong decline, appeared poised to drop low enough..." but doesn't give the actual rate then. So without knowing the starting point (late September's rate), we can't compute the trend. Hence, answer N/A.

5. **Question 5**: The precise level of the 10-year yield on the day the article mentions services sector expansion (December data). The article says "On Wednesday, the 10-yield briefly rose above 4.7 percent, hitting its highest level since April." That day is when the services sector data came out? The paragraph says "This week, the 10-year Treasury yield extended its monthslong rise, fueled by a range of factors including data showing the U.S. services sector expanded in December and President-elect Donald J. Trump's reasserting his plans for tariffs..." So the 10-year yield's rise was fueled by the December services data and the tariffs. The 10-year yield hit above 4.7% on Wednesday (the day of the report?), so the precise level was 4.7% (since it briefly rose above). The question asks for the precise level that triggered further increases. The article says it "briefly rose above 4.7 percent", so the level was just above 4.7%. But the question wants the precise level. Since it's stated as "above 4.7 percent", the exact number isn't given, so maybe 4.7% is the threshold, but the precise level isn't specified. Hence, N/A. Or perhaps the exact peak was mentioned as 4.7, but the article says "above 4.7". So the answer is N/A because the precise level isn't given, only that it went above 4.7. So N/A.

6. **Question 6**: The lowest average rate during the monthslong decline before late September. The article says "there was a moment in late September when mortgage rates, after a monthslong decline, appeared poised to drop low enough..." but doesn't state the lowest rate achieved. The only specific rate mentioned is the 3% during the pandemic, but that's not the decline period before late September. The current rate in late September was declining, but the lowest point isn't given. Hence, N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The inflationary impact in percentage points economists attributed to Trump's tariff plans. The article states "President-elect Donald J. Trump's reasserting his plans for tariffs on a broad range of imported goods, which many economists said would be inflationary." But it doesn't specify the percentage points. So N/A.

8. **Question 8**: The peak mortgage rate in the year immediately preceding the Fed's rate cuts. The Fed began cutting rates last year. The article says "Last year, the Fed began to cut interest rates from the decades-long highs they reached as officials tried to rein in stubborn inflation." The year before the Fed's cuts would be the year they reached the highs. The peak mortgage rate in that year (the year before Fed cuts) is mentioned as "peaking close to 8 percent" in 2022 and 2023. Since the Fed started cutting last year (assuming "last year" is 2024?), but the peak was in 2022/2023. The question asks for the year immediately preceding the Fed's initiation of cuts. If Fed started cuts in 2023, then the peak would be in 2022. The article says "mortgage rates rose rapidly in 2022 and 2023, peaking close to 8 percent". The peak was close to 8%, so the answer is 8%.

9. **Question 9**: The Columbia professor's projection for 2025 mortgage rate. The professor mentioned is Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh. The article doesn't state his projection for 2025. Greg McBride is the one who said 6.5%. So the professor's projection isn't mentioned. Therefore, N/A.

10. **Question 10**: If the Fed had done 3 cuts instead of 2 this year, what would the 2025 rate be according to Bankrate's analyst. The article says the Fed "signaled only two reductions this year". The analyst's expectation is 6.5%, but the question is a hypothetical. The article doesn't discuss scenarios with more cuts, so N/A.
