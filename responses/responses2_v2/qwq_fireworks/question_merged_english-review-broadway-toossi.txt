Okay, I need to tackle these questions based on the provided article. Let me go through each one carefully.

1. The question asks which character's acceptance into an American medical school depends on the Toefl score. The article mentions Elham needing a good Toefl score for her acceptance to an Australian medical school. Wait, the question says "American" but the text says Australia. Hmm, maybe a mistake? The exact quote is: "Her acceptance to a medical school in Australia is conditioned on achieving a good Toefl score." Since the question specifies "American," but the article says Australia, so the answer would be N/A? Wait, but maybe I misread. Let me check again. The article says Australia, so the answer would be N/A? Or is there another character? No, Elham is the one. Since the question mentions American but the article says Australia, the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me confirm again. The article says "medical school in Australia", so the question's premise is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

Wait, the first question says "American medical school" but the article says Australia. So the correct answer should be N/A. But maybe I misread. Let me check again. The article says Elham's acceptance to a medical school in Australia is dependent on Toefl. So the question's "American" is wrong. Therefore, the answer is N/A. But the user might have made a mistake. However, per instructions, I must follow the article exactly. So answer is N/A? Wait, no, the question is asking which character's acceptance is into an American medical school, but the article says Australia. So the answer is N/A.

Wait, but maybe the question is wrong. Since the user's instructions say if the question has an incorrect premise, answer N/A. So yes, answer N/A for question 1. Wait, but the user's first question might have a typo? Let me check again. The article states: "Elham (Tala Ashe) has the hardest time achieving proficiency, despite needing it most. (Her acceptance to a medical school in Australia is conditioned on achieving a good Toefl score.)" So the answer would be Elham, but since the question specifies American, not Australia, then N/A. Hmm, tricky. But per instructions, I must answer based on the text. Since the text says Australia, but the question asks about American, the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake, but I have to follow the article. So answer 1 is N/A?

Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check the exact question again: "Which character's acceptance into an American medical school hinges on achieving a high score on the Toefl exam?" The article says Australia. Therefore, the answer is N/A. But maybe I missed another character? No, the only one mentioned is Elham for Australia. So 1: N/A.

2. The teacher, Marjan, returned from England after nine years. The question asks how many years she studied in Australia. Wait, the text says she was in England, not Australia. The article says: "Having returned to Iran after nine years in England". So the answer is N/A because the question is about Australia. So answer 2: N/A.

3. The Julia Roberts movie isn't named. The article says she watches Julia Roberts rom-coms, but doesn't specify which one. So answer is N/A.

4. The question asks which student used Shakira's song. The article mentions that in the Broadway version, Goli now plays Ricky Martin's "She Bangs" instead of Shakira's "Whenever, Wherever". So originally, Goli used Shakira's song, but in the Broadway version it's changed. The question is about the original? Wait, the article says "In Show and Tell, she plays a CD of Ricky Martin's 'She Bangs' on her boombox. The other students find the burden of imperfect English heavy." Wait, the article says in the current version (Broadway) she plays Ricky Martin. But the original Off-Broadway version might have used Shakira. The question says "which student demonstrated... Shakira's Whenever, Wherever". Since the article states that the Broadway version changed it from Shakira to Ricky Martin, so the original was Shakira, so the student is Goli. Therefore, the answer is Goli. Because in the article's description, it's noted that "She Bangs" is a replacement for "Whenever, Wherever". So the answer is Goli.

5. The article doesn't mention any specific percentage improvement. The question asks for a percentage, which isn't provided. So N/A.

6. The character is Roya. Her son doesn't allow his daughter to be influenced by her Farsi accent, so the daughter refuses to speak Farsi. The article says: "Roya (Pooya Mohseni) wants to master the language so she can live with her neglectful son in Canada. (He will not allow his Canadian-born daughter to be influenced by Roya's thick accent.)" So the daughter is the one refusing, so the answer is Roya's daughter. So the question asks "which character's daughter refused...", so the answer is Roya.

7. The minimum required Toefl score isn't given. The article just mentions a "good Toefl score" but no specific number. So N/A.

8. The article doesn't mention the class meeting hours per week. It says "six weeks" but not the frequency. So N/A.

9. The article mentions that the political context is only "glancingly suggested" with visa difficulties. No specific event in 2008 Iran is named. So N/A.

10. The teacher Marjan returned from England, not Oxford. The article doesn't say she studied at Oxford. So the answer is N/A.

11. The Broadway version uses Ricky Martin's "She Bangs" instead of Shakira's song. So the answer is Ricky Martin.

12. The play has 21 scenes plus a prologue. The number of acts isn't specified. The article doesn't mention acts, just scenes. So N/A.

13. The article says Marjan watches Julia Roberts' rom-coms. No mention of someone else watching Tom Hanks. So N/A.

14. The Off-Broadway debut was 2022, and the Pulitzer was 2023. The Broadway transfer opened in the present (article published in 2023?), but the exact year isn't given. The article says "the Broadway transfer... opened on Thursday" but doesn't specify the year. However, the Pulitzer was awarded in 2023, so the transfer would be after that, but the article's current year isn't stated. So N/A.

Wait, the article says "the Broadway transfer of Sanaz Toossi's 'English,' which opened on Thursday at the Todd Haimes Theater. Even more so than when it debuted Off Broadway in 2022, and won the Pulitzer Prize in Drama in 2023..." So the transfer opened after 2023. But the question is asking what year did it transfer to Broadway after its 2022 Off-Broadway debut and 2023 Pulitzer. Since the Pulitzer was in 2023, the transfer would be in 2023 or later. But the article says it "opened on Thursday" but doesn't give the year. Since the article is written when the play is current, maybe the year is 2023. But without explicit info, perhaps N/A? Hmm. The question might expect 2023, but since the article says "opened on Thursday" without the year, maybe it's the same year as the Pulitzer, 2023. But I'm not sure. The article mentions the Pulitzer in 2023, so maybe the Broadway transfer is in 2023. But since the article doesn't explicitly state the year of the transfer, it's N/A. So answer 14: N/A.

15. The article doesn't mention any character fabricating their reason. The only mention is Omid who sounds American but feels otherwise. No fabrication stated. So N/A.

16. The article says Roya's son won't let her see his daughter due to her accent, but the visa requirement isn't specified. The question asks about a visa type in the Broadway version's revised plot. The original text says "the difficulty of obtaining visas" but not the type. So N/A.

17. The set designer is Marsha Ginsberg, mentioned as creating the rotating box. The Broadway version's set is bigger but same designer? The article says "the rotating box of a set by Marsha Ginsberg" so same designer. The question asks who created sliding panels replacing rotating box? The article doesn't mention sliding panels replacing; it says "rotating box" in both versions. So maybe N/A.

Wait, the article says "the rotating box of a set by Marsha Ginsberg" for the Broadway version. So no sliding panels mentioned. So N/A.

18. The article mentions visa struggles but no specific historical event. No news audio clips mentioned. So N/A.

19. The article mentions a possible romance but doesn't specify which characters. The only possible is between Elham and someone? Or Marjan and Omid? The article says "Does someone fall in love? Maybe." No specific characters named. So N/A.
