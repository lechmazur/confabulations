<other>While the article provides details about Netrebko's performance at the Palm Beach Opera gala, including that she wore a flamingo-pink gown and performed for about an hour before an audience of 450 people, it does not provide specific information to directly answer any of these questions. The article mentions Russian composers (Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, and Rimsky-Korsakov) but doesn't specify dedications, doesn't mention ticket prices, doesn't detail costume changes, and doesn't provide specific information about audience composition or detailed timing of performances.</other>
