<other>All questions require information that is not directly stated in the article. While the article mentions various aspects of Kara Young's life and career, it doesn't provide specific details about any of these particular questions. For example, while we know she took mime classes at 92nd Street Y as a child and later won a Tony Award for "Purlie Victorious," we don't have information about what shows came immediately after her mime training. Similarly, while we know she worked at a cigar bar, we don't know her hours, and while her father cooks Belizean food, we don't know what specific dishes he taught her.</other>
