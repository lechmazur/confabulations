<other>Many questions required "N/A" as the article either didn't provide specific details asked for or only provided partial information that didn't fully answer the exact question. For example, while the article mentioned that Musk backed a German party with neo-Nazi ties, it didn't name the party. Similarly, while the article mentioned Guantanamo Bay prison, it didn't specify its name.</other>
