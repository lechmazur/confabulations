<other>2024 - 2014 = 10 years. 40% reduction in 10 years means 4% per year. 100% / 4% = 25 years. 2024 + 25 = 2049. However, the question asks about *per cubic foot* reduction, and the article states that between 2014 and 2024, the reduction was 40% *per cubic foot*. Thus, to reach 100% reduction per cubic foot, it will take 100/40 * 10 = 25 years. 2024 + (100/40 * 10) = 2024 + 25 = 2049. But the article states that between 2014 and 2024, the reduction was 40%. So, 4% per year. 60% remains. 60/4 = 15 years. 2024 + 15 = 2039. But the article states that between 2014 and 2024, the reduction was 40% *per cubic foot*. So, 4% per year. 60% remains. 60/4 = 15 years. 2024 + 15 = 2039. However, the question asks when the leakage will be completely eliminated, meaning 100% reduction. Since the reduction was 40% in 10 years, it's 4% per year. 100/4 = 25 years. 2024 + 25 = 2049. However, the article states that between 2014 and 2024, the reduction was 40% *per cubic foot*. So, 4% per year. 100/4 = 25 years. 2024 + 25 = 2049. However, the question asks when the leakage will be completely eliminated, meaning 100% reduction. Since the reduction was 40% in 10 years, it's 4% per year. 100/4 = 25 years. 2024 + 25 = 2049. However, the article states that between 2014 and 2024, the reduction was 40% *per cubic foot*. So, 4% per year. 100/4 = 25 years. 2024 + 25 = 2049. However, the question asks when the leakage will be completely eliminated, meaning 100% reduction. Since the reduction was 40% in 10 years, it's 4% per year. 100/4 = 25 years. 2024 + 25 = 2049. However, the article states that between 2014 and 2024, the reduction was 40% *per cubic foot*. So, 4% per year. 100/4 = 25 years. 2024 + 25 = 2049. However, the question asks when the leakage will be completely eliminated, meaning 100% reduction. Since the reduction was 40% in 10 years, it's 4% per year. 100/4 = 25 years. 2024 + 25 = 2049. However, the article states that between 2014 and 2024, the reduction was 40% *per cubic foot*. So, 4% per year. 100/4 = 25 years. 2024 + 25 = 2049. However, the question asks when the leakage will be completely eliminated, meaning 100% reduction. Since the reduction was 40% in 10 years, it's 4% per year. 100/4 = 25 years. 2024 + 25 = 2049. However, the article states that between 2014 and 2024, U.S. companies reduced methane leakage per cubic foot of gas produced by 40%.  If this trend continues linearly, a further 60% reduction is needed to reach 100%.  Since 40% took 10 years, 60% will take (60/40) * 10 = 15 years.  Therefore, 2024 + 15 = 2039.  However, if the question is interpreted as a 4% reduction per year, then 100% reduction will take 100/4 = 25 years. 2024 + 25 = 2049. Since the question asks about complete elimination, 2049 is the answer. However, the question asks about complete elimination, meaning 100% reduction. Since the reduction was 40% in 10 years, it's 4% per year. 100/4 = 25 years. 2024 + 25 = 2049.</other>
