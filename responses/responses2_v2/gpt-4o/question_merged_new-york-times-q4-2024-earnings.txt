<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>26.5%</answer>
<other>Digital advertising revenue increased by 9.5%, and print advertising revenue decreased by 16.4%. The total advertising revenue was $165.1 million. To find the percentage attributed to print advertising before the decline, we calculate the initial print revenue as a percentage of the total. Let x be the initial print revenue. Then, x - 0.164x = print revenue after decline. The digital revenue is 9.5% higher than the previous year, so the total revenue is the sum of the increased digital and decreased print revenues. Solving for x gives us the percentage of total revenue attributed to print before the decline.</other>
