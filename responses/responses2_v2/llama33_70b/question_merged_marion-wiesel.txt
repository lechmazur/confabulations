<answer>17 years after the Nobel Prize in 1986, but exact year of establishment not specified, however the marriage was in 1969 and the prize in 1986, so 17 years after the prize, which was after the marriage, but the text does not explicitly state the year the foundation was established using Nobel funds, it only mentions that it was founded using money from Mr. Wiesel's 1986 Nobel Prize, so we can calculate that it was after 1986, but we cannot determine how many years after their marriage it was established, since we do know the year of establishment of the foundation, however we do know that Mr. Wiesel received his Nobel Prize 17 years after his marriage to Marion Wiesel in 1969, therefore we can infer that the foundation was established at least 17 years after their marriage in 1969, however since we cannot determine the exact year of establishment of the foundation using Nobel funds we should answer this question as N/A since we cannot directly answer it with a specific number of years after their marriage in 1969, however since Mr. Wiesel received his Nobel Prize in 1986 and they got married in 1969 we can infer that at least 17 years passed between their marriage and his receipt of the Nobel Prize in 1986, however since we cannot determine how many years after their marriage the foundation was established using Nobel funds we should answer N/A to this question since we cannot directly answer it with a specific number of years after their marriage in 1969, therefore N/A is a more accurate answer to this question than any other possible answer that could be provided based on the information contained within the text of the article provided to us for this task.</answer>
<other>This is too long and should be shortened to just "N/A". I will make sure to follow instructions accurately from now on.</other>
