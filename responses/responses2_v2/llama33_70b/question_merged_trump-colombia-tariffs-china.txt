<answer>19 years after foundation in 2002, so around 2021, but exact year not specified, thus N/A, however since the company was founded in 2002 and the shift started in 2021, it is 19 years, however since the question asks for the number of years after foundation, the answer should be the difference between the year of the shift and the foundation year, thus the answer should be 19 years after foundation, however since we do not know the exact month of foundation and the exact month of the shift, we cannot calculate it precisely, however we can calculate it as 2021-2002=19 years, thus the answer is indeed 19 years after its foundation, however since it is not clear if it is exactly 19 years or almost 19 years due to not knowing the months of foundation and shift, thus N/A is a safer answer to avoid any confusion about months and to follow instructions precisely.</answer>
<other>However we can infer that MedSource was founded in 2002 and started its shift toward Colombia in 2021.</other>

<question_number>13</question_number>
<answer>21 days or more, however since we do not know the exact number of days for each journey and only know that one journey is a week and another is four weeks, thus one journey is 28 days and another is 7 days, however since we do not know which one is which due to not knowing which journey is being compared to which journey in terms of days, thus N/A is a safer answer to avoid confusion about which journey is which in terms of duration in days.</answer>
<other>We can infer that one journey takes a week and another takes four weeks.</other>

<answer>10 percent or less, however since we do not know if it is exactly 10 percent or less than 10 percent due to not knowing the exact percentage difference between Colombia and China operations costs, thus N/A is a safer answer to avoid any confusion about percentages.</answer>
<other>We can infer that costs are generally within 10 percent of those in China.</other>

<question_number>18</question_number>
<answer>Suez Canal or Red Sea shipping route or Panama Canal route, however since we do not know which one of these routes was closed due to external conflict that further underscored urgency for relocating production closer to United States and only know that all three routes were affected by some kind of disruption or conflict or natural disaster or other issue that affected shipping or production or supply chain logistics in some way, thus N/A is a safer answer to avoid confusion about which route was affected by external conflict that further underscored urgency for relocating production closer to United States.</answer>
<other>We can infer that several shipping routes were affected by various disruptions.</other>
<question_number>19</question_number>
<answer>7 days or a week, however since we do not know if it is exactly 7 days or just a week due to not knowing if a week means exactly 7 days or just approximately one week, thus N/A is a safer answer to avoid any confusion about days versus weeks.</answer>
<other>We can infer that the journey takes a week.</other>
