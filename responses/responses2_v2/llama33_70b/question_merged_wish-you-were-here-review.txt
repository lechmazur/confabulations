<question_number>28</question_number>
<answer>Renee Carlino as the author of the novel and co-writer of the screenplay with Julia Stiles is not accurate, only Renee Carlino is mentioned as the author of the novel on which the movie is based and co-writer of the screenplay with Julia Stiles, so answer should be Renee Carlino as co-writer and author of the novel on which the film is based, but since it specifically asks for "which individual is credited with both co-writing the screenplay and authoring the novel on which the film is based" it should be: Renee Carlino as the author and co-writer of the screenplay with Julia Stiles for this film, however since it asks for an individual that did both, it should be: N/A, because it was a collaboration between two people for the screenplay, however only one person wrote the novel, so answer should be N/A because it was not one person who did both.</answer>
