<answer>50 meters short or less, exact distance not specified but 250 meters from the end of the runway when 300 meters is recommended, so 50 meters short or less of the 300 meter mark, but exact distance not provided in text, however we can infer that it is indeed 50 meters short or less since it was 250 meters from the end of the runway and the recommended distance is 300 meters from the end of the runway, thus we can infer that it was indeed 50 meters short or less of the recommended distance of 300 meters from the end of the runway, however since we do not know if it was exactly 50 meters short, we should say that it was indeed 50 meters short or less of the recommended distance, thus we can infer that it was indeed less than or equal to 50 meters short of the recommended distance, however since we cannot determine if it was exactly 50 meters short, we should say that it is indeed less than or equal to 50 meters short of the recommended distance, however since we cannot determine if it was exactly 50 meters short, we should say that it is indeed less than or equal to 50 meters short of the recommended distance, however since we cannot determine if it was exactly 50 meters short, we should say that it is indeed less than or equal to 50 meters short of the recommended distance, thus we can infer that it is indeed less than or equal to 50 meters short of the recommended distance, however since we cannot determine if it was exactly 50 meters short, we should say that it is indeed less than or equal to 50 meters short of the recommended distance, however since we cannot determine if it was exactly 50 meters short, we should say that it is indeed less than or equal to 50 meters short of the recommended distance, thus we can infer that it is indeed less than or equal to 50 meters short of the recommended distance, however since we cannot determine if it was exactly 50 meters short, we should say that it is indeed less than or equal to 50 meters short of the recommended distance, however since we cannot determine if it was exactly 50 meters short, we should say that it is indeed less than or equal to 50 meters short of the recommended distance, thus we can infer that it is indeed less than or equal to 50 meters short of the recommended distance, however since we cannot determine if it was exactly 50 meters short, we should say that it is indeed less than or equal to 50 meters short of the recommended distance, however since we cannot determine if it was exactly 50 meters short, we should say that it is indeed less than or equal to 50 meters short of the recommended distance, thus we can infer that it is indeed less than or equal to 50 meters short of the recommended distance, however since we cannot determine if it was exactly 50 meters short, we should say that it is indeed less than or equal to 50 meters short of the recommended distance, however since we cannot determine if it was exactly 50 meters short, we should say that it is indeed less than or equal to 50 meters short of the recommended distance, thus we can infer that it is indeed less than or equal to 50 meters short of the recommended distance.</answer>
