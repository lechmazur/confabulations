<answer>raining or rainy conditions, but exact condition not specified for the fire escape fall, however it is mentioned that Avon Pailthorpe's car accident occurred on a rainy day, and Ash Wu's fall from the fire escape is mentioned in the context of her housewarming party, with no direct mention of weather conditions for the fall itself, however the text does mention "the pale pink of sunset" as part of Ash Wu's out-of-body experience, implying it was near sunset when she fell, but does not directly state the weather condition at that time, only mentions rain in relation to Avon Pailthorpe's accident, thus the direct answer to this question would be based on information not provided about Ash Wu's fall weather conditions, hence it should be answered as N/A due to lack of direct information about weather at the time of Ash Wu's fall from the fire escape.</answer>
