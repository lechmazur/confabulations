merged_tiktok-sale-who-could-buy.txt
<other>Reasoning: 
1) The article specifically states Mr. Trump suggested “buy it and give half to the United States of America.”
2) The law requires a “qualified divestiture” of TikTok from ByteDance.
3) The only stated valuation without the algorithm is from McCourt’s bankers ($20 billion), but that is not from the Roblox CEO’s consortium, so N/A.
4) The article states Trump directly called for the closure of U.S.A.I.D.
5) The article mentions a prison in Guantanamo Bay but does not name it, so N/A.
6) There is no mention of a First Amendment case for TikTok specifically, so N/A.
7) The article mentions a 20% cap for people in China, not Canada, so N/A.
8) West Point ended a dozen student clubs.
9) The question conflates two different groups; the payroll firm is Employer.com, but there is no mention of a “Shark Tank” star in that consortium, so N/A.
