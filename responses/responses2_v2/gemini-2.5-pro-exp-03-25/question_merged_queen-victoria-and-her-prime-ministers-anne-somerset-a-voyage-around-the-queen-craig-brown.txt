<other>Analyzing Question 1: The question asks about a political ideology of Prince Albert that mirrored Benjamin Franklin's sentiments.

It doesn't connect these specific sympathies to Franklin's general observation about monarchy. Therefore, the article doesn't state an ideology of Albert's that mirrors Franklin's specific quote.</other>

<other>Analyzing Question 5: The question asks which prime minister's "camp sycophancy" was most similar to Lord Melbourne's initial influence. The article describes Victoria being "smitten" with Melbourne and "deeply dependent". It then states Disraeli "won her heart with what the biographer Jane Ridley has unimprovably called his 'camp sycophancy'". Both Melbourne's influence and Disraeli's sycophancy resulted in Victoria's strong positive feelings towards them, suggesting a similarity in effect, achieved through different means perhaps, but Disraeli's method is explicitly labelled sycophancy.</other>

<other>Analyzing Question 7: The question asks about a literary device used by Sylvia Plath, exemplified by Brown's description of his grandmother's meeting. The article mentions Brown's description of his grandmother's meeting and Plath's quote ("The queen looked quietly radiant") as examples of how people responded to the queen, often using similar phrases, fitting into the concept of "reception history". It doesn't identify a specific shared literary device between Plath's account and Brown's description of his grandmother's meeting.</other>

<other>Analyzing Question 9: The question asks what aspect of deconstruction theory, as understood by Prince Philip, was reflected in the actions of Idi Amin and Nicolae Ceausescu.
