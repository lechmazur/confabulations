<answer>DeepSeek's legal use of Nvidia chips purchased before new export controls were enforced contradicts U.S. export policy by showing that companies can still develop advanced A.I. technology with chips acquired before the restrictions were fully implemented.</answer>

<question_number>12</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that despite DeepSeek’s ability to train its model on fewer chips and the reported surplus of restricted chips in the Chinese market, the U.S. still maintains a lead in hardware superiority.</answer>

<question_number>13</question_number>
<answer>The article leads to the economic inference that the future cost of building advanced A.I. models globally could decrease due to DeepSeek’s chip efficiency and the drop in Nvidia’s share price.</answer>

<question_number>14</question_number>
<answer>The key factor responsible for DeepSeek's ability to develop competitive A.I. technology despite recent U.S. restrictions is the company's multi-year accumulation of high-end Nvidia models before the chip bans were enforced.</answer>

<question_number>15</question_number>
<answer>The technical limitation that continues to constrain Chinese A.I. innovation compared to U.S. companies is the inability to produce advanced A.I. chips that rival Nvidia's, as well as the lack of access to the complex machinery needed to make those chips.</answer>

<question_number>16</question_number>
<answer>The article implies that the large-scale chip smuggling in Shenzhen and the U.S. regulatory response had a negative impact on Nvidia and its investors, as evidenced by the sharp drop in Nvidia's share price due to fears of reduced demand for their high-cost chips.</answer>

<question_number>17</question_number>
<answer>The article portrays a contradiction between the U.S. export control measures implemented under the Biden administration, which aimed to restrict advanced A.I. technology, and the review initiatives ordered by the Trump administration, which sought to identify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls, highlighting a disconnect in policy effectiveness and implementation.</answer>

<question_number>18</question_number>
<answer>The single operational strategy suggested by the article as crucial for achieving advanced A.I. performance with lower compute resources is the efficient use of a smaller number of chips, as demonstrated by DeepSeek using only about 2,000 Nvidia chips compared to the 16,000 or more used by top American companies.</answer>

<question_number>19</question_number>
<answer>The timing-related factor credited by the article as enabling DeepSeek's competitive entry into the A.I. market is the company's ability to purchase Nvidia chips before the U.S. export controls were fully enforced.</answer>

<question_number>20</question_number>
<answer>The overarching theme about global A.I. leadership competition that emerges from the article’s analysis is the ongoing struggle between the U.S. and China, with U.S. export restrictions and Chinese strategic stockpiling highlighting the intense competition for technological superiority in A.I.</answer>
