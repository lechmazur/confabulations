<other>This question is tricky because it asks about a shared interest in pencils, but the text actually states that Sarah Hoover hates pencils.</other>
<other>This is a case where the question contains an incorrect premise.</other>
<other>I will answer "N/A" because the question is not accurate.</other>
<other>The text does mention that Stephanie Danler shares Sarah Hoover's love for murderous women in Gothic literature, reflecting a shared interest in hyperfemininity.</other>
<other>However, I will not provide this information as the answer because the question also mentions pencils.</other>
<other>I will follow the instructions and answer "N/A" instead.</other>
