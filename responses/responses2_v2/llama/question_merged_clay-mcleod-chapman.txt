<answer>Come Closer by Sara Gran, A Head Full of Ghosts by Paul Tremblay, and Pontypool by Tony Burgess are all mentioned, but the question asks for one work, so the answer is: Come Closer by Sara Gran (though this is not a perfect answer)</answer>

<other>This answer is not perfect because the question asks for one work, but the text mentions three works.</other>

<answer>George Romero's (also known as Papa George)</answer>

<other>This answer is not perfect because the question asks for whose "cinematic legacy" is invoked, but the text does not explicitly mention "cinematic legacy". However, it does mention "Papa George gave us a template that's going to be durable for decades."</other>

<other>This question is tricky because it asks which medium is notably absent despite its common association with horror narratives. The text mentions film, comic books, podcasts, and theater. It does not mention video games or novels (though it does mention that Chapman has written 12 novels). However, it is unclear which medium is "notably absent" or "commonly associated" with horror narratives.</other>
 
 <other>This question cannot be answered perfectly because it requires an external understanding of which mediums are commonly associated with horror narratives.</other>

 <answer>a half-hour before leaving from the holidays (also two weeks ago)</answer>

 <other>This answer is not perfect because the question asks for a duration mentioned in the text. The text mentions "two weeks ago" and also mentions "a half-hour to go before leaving from the holidays". It is unclear which one is the correct answer.</other>
