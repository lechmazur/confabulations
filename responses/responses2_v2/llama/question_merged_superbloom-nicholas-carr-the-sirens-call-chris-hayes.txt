<other>This question is about what form of energy is analogous to attention in the way it fuels modern capitalism.</other>
<other>According to the text, Chris Hayes maintains that "attention isn't a resource like coal or oil, which exist outside us; attention is what makes us human."</other>

<other>Fracking is typically associated with oil and gas extraction.</other>
<other>So, while Hayes does not explicitly state that attention is analogous to oil, he does use a metaphor associated with oil extraction to describe the extraction of attention.</other>
