<other>The article states that the album was released seven years after a long hiatus, but it does not specify the exact timing of the recording session.</other>
<other>The article does state that the musician is now 90 years old.</other>
<other>The album was released on January 31, but the year is not specified in this context.</other>
<other>The article does state that the album will be released on January 31, and earlier it is mentioned that this will be the first album in seven years by Taylor, who is now 90.</other>
<other>This implies that the album was recorded when Taylor was 90 years old minus some time before January 31, but after his previous album, which was released seven years prior to the upcoming release date.</other>
 <other>Taylor's previous album was released in 2015 or later since he re-emerged with an album in 2010 and released another one seven years prior to the release date mentioned in the article (January 31).</other>
 <other>This would mean that Taylor was at least 83 years old when his previous album was released (90 - 7 = 83), but this information cannot be used to determine his age at the time of recording for his latest album.</other>
 <other>Taylor re-emerged with an album in 2010 and then there was a seven-year gap before his next album, which would place its release in 2017 or later (2010 + 7 = 2017).</other>
 <other>This would mean that Taylor was at least 87 years old when he recorded his latest album (90 - (less than 3) = more than 87), but this information cannot be used to determine his exact age at the time of recording for his latest album.</other>
 <other>Taylor's latest album will be released on January 31, but it is not clear if it was recorded in the same year or earlier.</other>
 <other>If we assume that Taylor's latest album was recorded in the same year as its release, we can estimate his age at the time of recording as follows:</other>
 <other>If Taylor's latest album was recorded in the same year as its release and if we assume that it will be released on January 31 of the upcoming year (since no year is specified), then we can estimate that Taylor's age at the time of recording is less than 90 years old.</other>
 <other>If we assume that Taylor's latest album was recorded in the previous year (before January 31), then we can estimate that Taylor's age at the time of recording is less than 89 years old (90 - (less than 1) = less than 89).</other>
 <other>In any case, based on this information alone, we cannot determine Taylor's exact age at the time of recording for his latest album.</other>
