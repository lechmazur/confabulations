<question_number>20</question_number>
<other>Burgum used a financial metaphor to portray the country's federal lands and waters.</other>
<other>This metaphor is related to the country's financial obligations.</other>
<other>The metaphor is "balance sheet". This is the term he used to describe America's public lands and waters.</other>
<other>This term is used in finance and accounting.</other>
<other>Burgum said that America's public lands and waters are part of the country's financial "balance sheet". This implies that these natural resources have a financial value that should be considered when making decisions about their use.</other>
<other>This perspective suggests that the country's natural resources are an asset that can be used to offset its financial obligations.</other>
<other>This view is consistent with Burgum's background as a businessman and his focus on the economic benefits of natural resource development.</other>
<other>The use of this metaphor also highlights the tension between economic and environmental considerations in natural resource management.</other>
<other>This tension is a recurring theme in the article, as different stakeholders have different perspectives on how to balance economic and environmental concerns.</other>
<other>The article suggests that Burgum's view is shaped by his close ties to the oil and gas industry, which has a vested interest in developing these resources.</other>
<other>This perspective is not universally accepted, as some stakeholders argue that natural resources have inherent value that cannot be reduced to a financial calculation.</other>
<other>The article highlights the controversy surrounding Burgum's appointment and the concerns of environmental groups about his approach to natural resource management.</other>
<other>The use of the "balance sheet" metaphor is a powerful rhetorical device that frames the debate about natural resource management in economic terms.</other>
<other>This framing can be influential in shaping public opinion and policy decisions, as it emphasizes the potential economic benefits of natural resource development.</other>
<other>However, it also overlooks the potential environmental costs of this development, which can have long-term consequences for ecosystems and human health.</other>
<other>The article suggests that Burgum's approach to natural resource management is likely to be shaped by his business background and his close ties to the oil and gas industry.</other>
<other>This approach may prioritize economic considerations over environmental concerns, which could have significant implications for the country's natural resources and ecosystems.</other>
