<other>This question is asking about an American figure who is indirectly referenced in the article.</other>
<other>The article mentions a philanthropic American hedge fund manager who has spent more than 25 years creating one of the world's most successful rhino repopulation programs.</other>
<other>This individual is not named in the article, but their efforts are highlighted as a key factor in the conservation project.</other>
<other>The question asks for the name of this individual, but since they are not named in the article, the answer is N/A.</other>
<other>This is because the question specifically asks for the name of the individual, and that information is not provided in the article.</other>
<other>The article only mentions that the individual is an American hedge fund manager, but does not provide any further details about their identity.</other>
<other>Therefore, the correct answer to this question is N/A.</other>

<other>This question is asking about which animal's return is celebrated throughout the article.</other>
 <other>The article mentions that one of the Big Five animals has long been absent from Hwange National Park, and that this animal is being reintroduced as part of a conservation project on community land.</other>
 <other>The article goes on to describe the efforts of Mark Butcher and others to bring this animal back to the area, and highlights the excitement and celebration surrounding its return.</other>
 <other>The animal being referred to is clearly the rhinoceros, as it is mentioned throughout the article as the focus of the conservation project.</other>
 <other>The article specifically mentions that rhinos had been poached to the brink of extinction, but thanks to conservation efforts, they are now being reintroduced to their historical habitat.</other>
 <other>The return of the rhinos is celebrated throughout the article as a major conservation success story.</other>
 <other>The correct answer to this question is therefore "rhinoceros" or simply "rhino". However, since "rhinoceros" was not among answer choices and "rhino" was not explicitly listed as an option either but it can be safely inferred from text that "rhino" would be correct answer if it was among options. Since it was not among options I will put it as an answer anyway since it can be safely inferred from text. </other><answer>Rhino </answer><other>This should answer all questions. </other>
