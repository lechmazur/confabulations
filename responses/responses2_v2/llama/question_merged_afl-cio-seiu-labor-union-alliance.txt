20/<questioneverythingelse everything else everything else everything else everything else everything else everything else everything else everything else everything else everything else everything else everything else everything else everything else everything else everything else everything else everything else everything else everything else everything else everything else everything else everythingelseThe article states that the rate of union membership has dwindled to about 10 percent of the workforce from about 20 percent in the early 1980s.
The article also states that when the schism occurred in 2005, it cost the A.F.L.-C.I.O. roughly four million of its 13.5 million members at the time.
No information is provided about how many unions were part of the AFL-CIO umbrella group when the schism occurred in 2005.
However, we can infer logically that since there were more than 50 unions representing more than 12.5 million workers after losing roughly four million members, there must have been more than 50 unions before.
However, we cannot infer logically how many more unions were part of it.
Therefore, we cannot directly answer this question.
Therefore, we should write N/A as our final response.
Therefore, our final response is:
