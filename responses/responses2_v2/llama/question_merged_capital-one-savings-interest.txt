<other>First, let's find the interest earned in a year at Wells Fargo. The interest rate offered by Wells Fargo is 0.01 percent. The median household balance is $10,000. So, the interest earned in a year is $10,000 * 0.01% = $1. Since the customer has double the median household balance, the interest earned will be double, i.e., $2.</other>

<other>First, let's find the interest earned in a year at a competitive high-yield account and at a Chase standard savings account. The article states that over the last decade, an account earning 0.01 percent annual interest would have gained just $10, compared with about $2,000 if the same money had been kept in a consistently competitive savings account. Since the time period is 10 years, we can calculate the interest earned per year as $10/10 = $1 for the Chase standard savings account and $2000/10 = $200 for the competitive high-yield account. Now, we can calculate the percentage of the median American householdâ€™s $10,000 savings balance that would remain unearned annually if held in a Chase standard savings account instead of a competitive high-yield account. The difference in interest earned per year is $200 - $1 = $199. The percentage is ($199/$10,000) * 100% = 1.99%. We can round this to 2%.</other>
