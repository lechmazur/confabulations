<other>This question requires some inference.</other>
<other>The article mentions 4 incidents in 2017 and 1 incident in December (body odor discrimination lawsuit), but it does not provide a comprehensive list of all discrimination cases against American Airlines.</other>
<other>The article also mentions the couple's lawsuit, which is another incident.</other>
<other>Therefore, the total number of discrimination cases mentioned in the article is at least 6 (4 in 2017 + 1 in December + 1 couple's lawsuit).</other>
<other>However, it is essential to note that this might not be an exhaustive list, as the article does not provide a comprehensive account of all discrimination cases against American Airlines.</other>
<other>The question asks for the total number of discrimination cases explicitly quantified in the article.</other>
<other>The article explicitly quantifies only the 4 incidents in 2017.</other>
<other>The other incidents are mentioned but not explicitly quantified as part of a larger list or total number of cases.</other>
<other>Therefore, based on the explicit information provided in the article, the answer to this question is 4.</other>
