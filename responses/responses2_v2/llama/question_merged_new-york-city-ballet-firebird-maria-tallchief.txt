But her legacy rests on what she brought to the art form in the 1940s, '50s and '60s -- a series of revelations about what ballet could be and what a ballerina could look like. Ballet in the 1930s and '40s was still regarded as a European art. Touring companies took ballet across the United States with mostly European traditions and repertory. While company ranks were filled with dancers of different nationalities, including American, the stars were mainly Russian -- even if just by stage name. (Markova was born Lilian Alicia Marks.) Audiences thought they wanted to see Russian ballerinas, until there was Tallchief. She made an impression from the start. The New York Times wrote of the 18-year-old Tallchief: "She is well off the beaten track in ballerina types, but she is a ballerina as surely as this is Sunday." The ballerina type was being transformed, and so was American ballet. In February, New York City Ballet celebrates Tallchief's centennial with a program featuring some of her most celebrated roles: "Firebird," "Sylvia: Pas de Deux" and "Scotch Symphony," which includes a pas de deux that Tallchief considered the most romantic Balanchine created for her. "I feel like I know her a little bit through her ballets," said Tiler Peck, the New York City Ballet principal who has danced many of Tallchief's parts and who will make her debut in "Sylvia: Pas de Deux," a short work bursting with classical technique, on the Tallchief program. "There must have been a lot of trust in her as a ballerina and in her technical chops because it's still hard today," Peck said in an interview. "But more than the technique was that when she was onstage she demanded your attention. You could tell that this is a real, true ballerina." SHE WAS BORN Elizabeth Marie Tall Chief in Fairfax, Okla., where the Tall Chiefs were a prominent Osage family. Her great-grandfather Chief Peter Bigheart was involved with the Osage Allotment Act that led to the sharing of mineral rights and income from the oil found beneath the tribe's land. Her grandmother Eliza Bigheart Tall Chief, a strong influence on Maria, selected her Osage name, Princess Wa-Xthe-Thon-ba (Two Standards), which appears prominently on the quarter. Elise Paschen, Tallchief's daughter, said that when her mother was young, "Eliza took her under her wing and really taught her the ways of the Osage." Tallchief's mother, of Scottish Irish descent, enrolled Maria in ballet lessons as a young girl, along with her sister Marjorie, who would also go on to an important ballet career. In 1933 the family moved to Los Angeles, where Tallchief's ballet training became more serious. (It was there that Tall Chief became Tallchief after students taunted her because of her Native American name; a few years later Betty Marie became Maria.) She studied with the great Bronislava Nijinska before joining the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo at 17 for its Canadian tour. When Balanchine began choreographing for that company in the mid-1940s, he saw Tallchief's potential and guided her through exercises and choreography that pushed her body and technique to new levels. She was there when the time was finally right for Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein to start a company, Ballet Society, which would become New York City Ballet. In 1946, Tallchief and Balanchine married: It would be the most wonderful thing, she remembered him saying in her 1997 memoir, and they could work together. The Russia-born Balanchine was enchanted by her Native American heritage, feeling it brought him closer to being American himself. When they visited her grandmother in Oklahoma, Tallchief wrote in her memoir, he was given a turquoise bracelet and put it right on his wrist. (He wore it nearly every day for over 30 years.) "When Grandma saw how happy it made him, she said she'd bead him a belt," Tallchief wrote. At the end of her Ballet Russe contract, Tallchief joined Balanchine and his new company as its leading dancer. Their marriage ended in an annulment filed in 1951, and signed on the day rehearsals began for that romantic "Scotch Symphony" pas de deux a year later. But Balanchine continued to create commanding roles for her like the Sugarplum Fairy in "The Nutcracker" and the lead in "Allegro Brillante." When she was married to Balanchine, she felt confined by how much her personal and professional lives were conjoined. "But now I was beginning to realize that there was another personage with whom my life as a woman was bound up," she wrote in her memoir. "And that figure was Maria Tallchief, prima ballerina." Helene Alexopoulos, a former New York City Ballet principal who was coached by Tallchief, said that her fame arose in an era when she was not the obvious prima ballerina. "She was so clearly American," Alexopoulos said, at a time when the best dancers came from Europe. "She broke that ceiling." But that depiction of American-ness
