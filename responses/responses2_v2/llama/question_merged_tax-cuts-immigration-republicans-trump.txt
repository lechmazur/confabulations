<other>This question is about Representative Donalds advocating for inclusion of an energy-related provision in the initial, smaller legislative package.</other>
<other>The article mentions that "Republicans have not yet publicly sketched out what that bill would look like."</other>
<other>However, it does mention that "Proponents of that strategy argue it would deliver Mr. Trump an early political victory on immigration and treat a top Republican campaign issue with the urgency it deserves."</other>
<other>"Representative Byron Donalds of Florida told reporters on Tuesday. 'The No. 1 priority is securing our border,'"</other>
 <other>"'In my opinion it's the top priority, and everything else is a close second.'" </other>
 <other>"Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the chairman of the Budget Committee who will be overseeing the reconciliation process, has also pressed for a two-bill approach."</other>
 <other>"'If you hold border security hostage to get tax cuts, you're playing Russian roulette with our national security,' he said."</other>
 <other>"Republicans have looked to Mr. Trump to intervene and set a clear direction for the party."</other>
 <other>"On Sunday, he wrote on social media that Congress should pass 'one powerful Bill,'"</other>
 <other>"an apparent victory for lawmakers like Representative Jason Smith of Missouri, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who had championed that approach."</other>
 <other>"Mr. Trump's equivocation since then, though, has left Republicans still unsure of which strategy they should pursue."</other>
 <other>"Mr. Trump's meeting with top Republican senators on Wednesday will be followed by a discussion with various House Republicans in Florida over the weekend."</other>
 <other>"In a sign of how politically complicated the tax cut discussion could get, one of the sessions is expected to focus on relaxing the $10,000 limit on the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT."</other>
 <other>"Republicans included the $10,000 limit in the 2017 tax law as a way to contain the cost of that legislation."</other>
 <other>"But the move angered House Republicans from high-tax states like New York and New Jersey, many of whom voted against the entire 2017 tax bill as a result."</other>
 <other>"Such defections are a luxury that Republican leaders can't afford this year given their narrow majority."</other>
 <other>"G.O.P. lawmakers from New York, New Jersey and California could tank a tax bill if they are unsatisfied with how the provision is handled."</other>
 <other>"They are now pushing to lift the cap as part of the party's tax bill."</other>
 <other>"Eliminating the cap entirely could add roughly $1 trillion to the price tag of the legislation."</other></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br><answer>N/A </answer>
