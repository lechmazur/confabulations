<other>This question requires some calculation. The Quadrantids are visible from Dec. 26 to Jan. 16, which is a total of 21 days. The peak occurs on Jan. 2-3, and the optimal viewing time is between midnight and sunrise, which is approximately 6 hours. To calculate the percentage of the total shower period that a viewer would miss, we need to first calculate the total number of hours in the shower period. There are 24 hours in a day, so the total number of hours is 21 days * 24 hours/day = 504 hours. The viewer would miss 504 hours - 6 hours = 498 hours. To calculate the percentage, we can divide the number of hours missed by the total number of hours and multiply by 100: (498 hours / 504 hours) * 100 = 98.8%. Therefore, the viewer would miss approximately 98.8% of the total shower period.</other>
