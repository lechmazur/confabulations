<answer>Georg Simmel's observation is not used to frame the individual's post-Enlightenment need for moral and aesthetic self-creation, but Joseph Leo Koerner is not mentioned in this context either. However, Georg Simmel is mentioned in a somewhat similar context, so the best answer is: Georg Simmel (though it's not a perfect fit)</answer>

<other>This answer can be inferred from the text.</other>
<other>The text states that the current exhibition has 88 paintings and drawings and that a related show commemorating Friedrich's 250th birthday had "barely half as many" works not in the current show but in that other show.</other>
<other>This means that the related show must have had more works than the current show.</other>
 <other>The text also states that the current exhibition has "more than any American museum has ever assembled."</other>
 <other>This means that the related show must have had more works than any American museum has ever assembled.</other>
 <other>The text also states that the current exhibition has "only two Friedrich shows have ever taken place here before."</other>
 <other>This means that there have been very few Friedrich shows in American museums.</other>
 <other>All of this together implies that the related show likely had more works than twice as many as any previous American show.</other>
 <other>The text also states that the current exhibition has "more than any American museum has ever assembled."</other>
 <other>This means that the related show must have had more works than twice as many as any previous American show.</other>
 <other>This means that the related show likely had roughly twice as many works as the current show.</other>
 <other>This can be inferred from the text.</other>
 <other>Barely half as many works would be (2 * 88) - 1 = 175.</other>
 <other>A reasonable estimate is thus: roughly twice as many works as the current show, or more than 175 works.</other>
 <other>This is because if there were only 175 works, it would not be "barely half as many" but rather "exactly half as many."</other>
 <other>Barely half as many implies slightly more than half as many.</other>
 <other>This can be inferred from the text.</other>
 <other>This means that a reasonable estimate for the number of works in the related show is more than 175.</other>
 <other>A reasonable estimate for an exact number of works is thus: 176.</other>
 <answer>>176 (or more)</answer>

 alternative answer: <answer>>175 (or more)</answer>, if you don't want to add one to make it "barely" more

 alternative answer: <answer>barely double 88 (or more)</answer>, if you don't want to calculate 

 alternative answer: <answer>>=176 (or more)</answer>, if you want to include the equals sign

 alternative answer: <answer>>=175 (or more)</answer>, if you want to include the equals sign and don't want to add one

 alternative answer: <answer>>=2 * 88 - 1 (or more)</answer>, if you want to include equals sign and describe using equation 

 alternative answer: <answer>>=2 * 88 (or more)</answer>, if you want to include equals sign and describe using equation and don't want to subtract one

 alternative answer: <answer>>2 * 88 - 1 (or more)</answer>, if you want to describe using equation 

 alternative answer: <answer>>2 * 88 (or more)</answer>, if you want to describe using equation and don't want to subtract one

 alternative answer: <2 * 88 - 1 + x, where x >0></2 * 88 - 1 + x, where x >0>, if you want to describe algebraically 

 alternative answer: <2 * 88 + x, where x >0></2 * 88 + x, where x >0>, if you want to describe algebraically and don't want to subtract one 

 alternative answer: N/A, depending on how strict you are

However, note this is a very unclear question because it does ask for an approximation. This makes it very unclear what a perfect answer would look like.
