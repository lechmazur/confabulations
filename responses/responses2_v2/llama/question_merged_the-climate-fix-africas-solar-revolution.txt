<other>This question requires a calculation.</other>
<other>China's overall investment in low-carbon technology last year was $828 billion.</other>
<other>The funding for New York State's largest solar farm was $950 million.</other>
<other>To calculate the percentage increase, we need to divide the funding for the solar farm by China's overall investment and multiply by 100.</other>
<other>(950,000,000 / 828,000,000,000) * 100 = 0.1147%</other>

<other>This question requires a calculation.</other>
<other>The average cost per electric vehicle is not explicitly stated in the article.</other>
<other>However, we can use the overall spending trend in the electrified transport sector to estimate the average cost.</other>
<other>The article states that $757 billion was spent on electrified transport last year.</other>
<other>Unfortunately, we cannot calculate the average cost per vehicle because we do not know how many vehicles were produced.</other>

<other>This question requires a calculation.</other>
<other>The article states that 60% of grid electricity in the US is derived from fossil fuels.</other>
<other>In Africa, three-quarters of grid electricity is derived from fossil fuels.</other>
<other>In Europe, more power was generated from solar than from coal for the first time.</other>
<other>However, we do not have enough information to calculate the percentage of Africa's current grid electricity that would need to be replaced to match Europe's solar-to-coal power generation ratio.</other>

<other>This question requires a calculation.</other>
<other>The article states that global investment in low-carbon technology hit a record $2.1 trillion last year, an 11% increase over the previous year.</other>
<other>China dominated spending, investing $828 billion in overall, up 23% over the previous year.</other>
<other>To calculate the total investment amount after six years, we would need to know the exact rate of increase each year.</other>
<other>Unfortunately, we do not have enough information to perform this calculation.</other>
