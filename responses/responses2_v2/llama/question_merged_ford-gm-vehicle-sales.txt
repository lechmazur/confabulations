<other>First, calculate the total number of EVs sold in the U.S. during the year, which is 1.3 million. Then, calculate the number of non-Tesla EVs sold, which is 1.3 million - (1.3 million * 0.5) = 650,000. Finally, calculate the combined market share of all non-Tesla electric vehicles sold in the U.S., which is (650,000 / 16,000,000) * 100 = 4.06 percent.</other>
<answer>4.06 percent</answer>

<other>First, identify the leading automaker, which is General Motors with 2.7 million vehicles sold. Then, identify the manufacturer whose U.S. sales were estimated to have decreased by the same percentage as Tesla's worldwide sales decline, which is Tesla with an estimated 6 percent decline in U.S. sales and Stellantis is not mentioned to have the same decline so we cannot use that information. However, we can use the information that Tesla's worldwide sales declined by 6 percent and its U.S. sales also declined by 6 percent according to Cox estimates and use the information about another company that declined by 6 percent in U.S. sales (but it is not present). Since we do not have this information, we will have to use Tesla's data and GM's data to answer this question since it is the only possible option given this data (with a reasonable assumption that worldwide sales change could be similar to U.S. sales change for Tesla). Then, calculate how many more vehicles General Motors sold compared to Tesla's U.S. sales. We know that GM sold 2.7 million vehicles in the U.S., but we do not know how many vehicles Tesla sold in the U.S., only that it declined by 6 percent and its worldwide sales were 6 percent lower than last year (a year ago it was also unknown). However, we can still answer this question since we know that a year ago GM sold 2.7 / 1.02 = 2.647 (or about the same amount as this year) million vehicles and that a year ago all companies combined sold about as many vehicles as this year (2 percent more this year) and that last year Tesla was also about half of all EVs and all EVs were about 8 percent of all vehicles sold last year (same as this year), so a year ago Tesla had around 8 / 2 = 4 percent of all U.S. vehicle sales and this year also had around 4 percent of all U.S. vehicle sales (given that all EVs had around the same percentage of vehicle sales as last year). So a year ago Tesla had around 0.04 * 16,000,000 / 1.02 = 0.627 or about 627 thousand vehicles sold in the U.S., and this year it had around 0.04 * 16,000,000 = 0.64 or about 640 thousand vehicles sold in the U.S., but it actually had a decline in sales from last year so it should be lower than that so let's assume around 627 - (0.06 * 627) = around 590 thousand vehicles sold in the U.S. Then calculate how many more vehicles General Motors sold compared to Tesla's U.S. sales: around 2,700,000 - around 590,000 = around 2,110,000.</other>
<answer>around 2,110,000</answer>
