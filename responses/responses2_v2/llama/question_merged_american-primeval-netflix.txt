<other>This is a tricky question. The text does not explicitly state the substance used to achieve the appearance of prolonged uncleanliness. However, it does mention that the makeup department used dirt and other substances to create a grungy look.</other>
<other>The text also mentions that the director, Peter Berg, wanted the actors to look like they hadn't bathed in a year, which suggests that the substance used was likely something that would create a dirty or grimy appearance.</other>
<other>Based on this information, it's possible to infer that the substance used was likely dirt or a similar substance.</other>
<other>However, without more explicit information, it's impossible to say for certain what substance was used.</other>
<other>Therefore, the best answer to this question is likely "dirt" or a similar substance, but it's important to note that this is an inference rather than a direct answer.</other>
<other>In this case, I will choose to answer "dirt" as it seems like the most plausible option based on the context of the article.</other>

<other>This question is asking about the stylistic mandate enforced by the director to immerse viewers in the character's brutal survival rather than offering romanticized vistas.</other>
<other>The text mentions that the director, Peter Berg, wanted to create a sense of realism and authenticity in the show, and that he used a number of techniques to achieve this, including using tight shots and close-ups to make the viewer feel like they are part of the action.</other>
<other>The text also mentions that Berg wanted to avoid romanticizing the violence and brutality of the time period, and instead wanted to portray it in a raw and unflinching way.</other>
<other>Based on this information, it's possible to infer that the stylistic mandate enforced by Berg was likely focused on creating a sense of realism and authenticity, and on portraying the brutality and violence of the time period in a raw and unflinching way.</other>
<other>In this case, I will choose to answer "tight shots and close-ups" as it seems like the most plausible option based on the context of the article.</other>
<answer>Tight shots and close-ups.</answer>
