<question_number>13</question_number>
<other>This question requires a careful analysis of the text.</other>
<other>The article mentions several factors affecting restaurant sales, including rising costs of food and labor, inflation-weary Americans cutting back on eating out, and the surgeon general's warnings about the link between drinking and cancer.</other>
<other>However, it does not explicitly state which element is not cited as a reason for the decline in alcohol revenue.</other>
<other>A close reading of the text reveals that insurance cost increases are mentioned as a challenge for restaurant owners, but they are not directly linked to the decline in alcohol sales.</other>
<other>Therefore, the correct answer is insurance cost increases.</other>
<answer>insurance cost increases</answer>

<other>This question requires a calculation based on the information provided in the article.</other>
<other>The article states that alcohol sales at Tracy Vaught's restaurants produced 31.5% of the company's income in 2015 and 27.5% last year.</other>
<other>To find the approximate decrease in percentage points, we need to subtract the latter from the former.</other>
<other>This gives us a decrease of 4 percentage points (31.5% - 27.5% = 4%).</other>
<answer>4 percentage points</answer>
