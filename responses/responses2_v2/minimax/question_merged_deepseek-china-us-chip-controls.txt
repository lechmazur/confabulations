<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Chinese propaganda</answer>
<other>The article mentions that researchers have documented how DeepSeek's chatbot includes Chinese propaganda, which contrasts with the concise reporting functionality of OpenAI's Deep Research tool.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>SoftBank</answer>
<other>The article mentions that OpenAI is in talks with the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an investment of up to $25 billion, which could imply interest in scaling up AI operations.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article does not specify which military application the U.S. government anticipated would be most significantly hampered by restricting China's access to Nvidia's A100 chips.</other>
<question_number>9</other>
<answer>servers containing more than 2,000 of Nvidia's most advanced chips</answer>
<other>The article mentions that a vendor in Shenzhen offered servers with more than 2,000 Nvidia chips, which are crucial for advanced chip manufacturing.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article does not specify which job title within U.S. hyperscalers is most likely to be replaced by AI bots similar to DeepSeek's.</other>
<question_number>11</question_number>
<answer>The article implies that the legal use of Nvidia chips by DeepSeek before new export controls contradicts the intent of the controls to limit China's access to advanced AI technology.</answer>
<other>This suggests a contradiction in U.S. export policy, as the controls were not implemented in time to prevent DeepSeek from acquiring the chips.</other>
<question_number>12</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that the U.S. no longer has a hardware superiority advantage over China due to DeepSeek's ability to train its model on fewer chips and the reported surplus of restricted chips in the Chinese market.</answer>
<other>This implies that the advantage in hardware has diminished despite U.S. restrictions.</other>
<question_number>13</question_number>
<answer>The article implies that the future cost of building advanced AI models globally will be lower due to DeepSeek's efficient use of chips, which caused a drop in Nvidia's share price as investors anticipate reduced demand for high-cost chips.</answer>
<other>This suggests a shift in the economic landscape of AI development.</other>
<question_number>14</question_number>
<answer>The article indicates that DeepSeek's multi-year accumulation of high-end Nvidia models before the chip bans is the key factor responsible for their ability to develop competitive AI technology despite recent U.S. restrictions.</answer>
<other>This highlights the importance of timing in stockpiling technology.</other>
<question_number>15</question_number>
<answer>The article implies that the technical limitation continuing to constrain Chinese AI innovation compared to U.S. companies is the lack of advanced AI chip manufacturing capabilities and the inability to produce machinery needed for such chips.</answer>
<other>This suggests a significant gap in manufacturing technology.</other>
<question_number>16</question_number>
<answer>The article implies that the large-scale chip smuggling activities in Shenzhen led to a market impact causing Nvidia and its investors to face uncertainty and potential losses, as the U.S. regulatory response aimed to curb these activities.</answer>
<other>This indicates a negative impact on Nvidia's market position.</other>
<question_number>17</question_number>
<answer>The article portrays a contradiction between the Biden administration's export control measures and the Trump administration's review initiatives, as the former's controls were not comprehensive enough to prevent the spread of advanced AI technologies, while the latter's review aimed to address such loopholes.</answer>
<other>This suggests a lack of cohesive policy over time.</other>
<question_number>18</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that the operational strategy of using fewer chips was crucial for achieving advanced AI performance with lower compute resources, as demonstrated by DeepSeek.</answer>
<other>This highlights the effectiveness of resource optimization.</other>
<question_number>19</question_number>
<answer>The article credits the timing of chip purchases before the enforcement of new export controls as enabling DeepSeek's competitive entry into the AI market.</answer>
<other>This underscores the importance of strategic timing in technology acquisition.</other>
<question_number>20</question_number>
