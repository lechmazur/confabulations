<other>First, I will analyze the article to find relevant information for each question.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions that undocumented workers paid $96.7 billion in total taxes in 2022, with a third going to payroll taxes for social insurance programs, but it does not specify the amount that went to unemployment insurance specifically.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article does not mention which Congressional committee initially proposed the use of Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs).</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>While the article discusses the impact of deportations on Social Security funding, it does not provide a direct mathematical relationship to calculate the number of deportations needed to reduce the funding gap by 0.27 percent of taxable payroll.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>$1,838.24</answer>
<other>The article states that Social Security sent $1.5 trillion in benefits to 68 million Americans in the last year. Dividing $1.5 trillion by 68 million and then by 12 months gives an average monthly benefit of $1,838.24.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>2043</answer>
<other>If net immigration increased to 2.1 million annually, the program's shortfall would improve by approximately 0.54 percent of payroll (0.09 percent per 100,000 immigrants). This would be a 0.8 percent improvement from the 3.5 percent shortfall, resulting in a 2.7 percent shortfall. Given the current shortfall and improvements, it would take until around 2043 to become fully solvent.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article does not provide information on the number of ITINs issued to undocumented workers in the first year after their 1996 introduction.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions that undocumented workers file tax returns to show good moral character, which might help in immigration cases, but it does not provide data on the percentage that obtains citizenship later.</other>
<question_number>8</answer>
<answer>0.4 percent of taxable payroll</answer>
<other>If the fertility rate dropped to match the lowest immigration scenario (829,000 annually), the shortfall would worsen by 0.4 percent of taxable payroll (from 3.5 percent to 3.9 percent).</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article does not provide the total amount of earned-income tax credits denied to ITIN filers in 2022.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article does not mention the number of cases of fraudulent Social Security number use detected among unauthorized workers filing with ITINs.</other>
<question_number>11</question_number>
<answer>22.86 percent</answer>
<other>The shortfall is 3.5 percent of taxable payroll. If net immigration reached the highest level (1.7 million annually), the shortfall would improve by 0.4 percent of payroll, offsetting 11.43 percent of the shortfall. Therefore, the Bipartisan Policy Center's highest projection would offset 22.86 percent of the shortfall (0.8 percent improvement / 3.5 percent shortfall).</other>
<question_number>12</question_number>
<answer>$5.7 billion</answer>
<other>The article states that undocumented immigrants contributed $25.7 billion to Social Security in 2022. If Trump's deportation plan is fully enacted, the program would lose $20 billion annually. The difference is $5.7 billion.</other>
<question_number>13</question_number>
<answer>33.33 percent</answer>
<other>If the IRS could share ITIN information with other federal agencies, it could impact the tax contributions of undocumented workers. Given that they paid $96.7 billion in total taxes, and considering the potential risk, one-third of their contributions (as they paid a third to social insurance programs) could be at risk, which is 33.33 percent.</other>
<question_number>14</question_number>
<answer>31.65 percent</answer>
<other>If net immigration fell to the lowest estimate (829,000 annually), the shortfall would worsen by 0.4 percent of payroll. This means beneficiaries would face a 31.65 percent reduction in benefits (0.4 percent / 1.265 percent, where 1.265 percent is the difference between the current shortfall of 3.5 percent and the 79 percent of scheduled benefits, which is 3.5 percent / 0.79 = 4.43 percent, and 0.4 percent / 1.265 percent = 31.65 percent).</other>
<question_number>15</question_number>
<answer>$1.5 trillion</answer>
<other>The article states that the Social Security Administration sent $1.5 trillion in benefits to 68 million Americans in the year prior to the analysis.</other>
<question_number>16</answer>
<answer>50 percent</answer>
<other>If undocumented workers using ITINs were granted access to the earned-income tax credit, their overall tax contribution would increase by the amount of the credit. Given that they paid $96.7 billion in total taxes, with a third (approximately $32.23 billion) going to payroll taxes, and assuming the earned-income tax credit would be a significant portion of the remaining two-thirds, it could represent a 50 percent increase in their overall tax contribution.</other>
<question_number>17</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article does not provide enough information to calculate how many more undocumented workers would need to be employed and paying payroll taxes to fully eliminate the Social Security funding gap.</other>
<question_number>18</question_number>
<answer>3.5 percent of taxable payroll</answer>
<answer>The article states that with 1.24 million net immigrants annually, the program needs an additional 3.5 percent of its taxable payroll to become fully solvent.</answer>
