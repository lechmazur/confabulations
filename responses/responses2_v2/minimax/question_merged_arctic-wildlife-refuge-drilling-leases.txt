<other>First, I will analyze the article to find relevant information for each question.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>0%</answer>
<other>The article indicates that the initial 2021 auction was a failure with minimal revenue ($14.4 million), which is significantly less than the projected $2 billion over 10 years. Therefore, the percentage realized is effectively 0%.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article does not provide information on the bidding amounts per tract beyond the total of $14.4 million for the 2021 auction. Therefore, it is impossible to calculate the additional potential revenue.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>600,000 acres</answer>
<other>The original proposal was for one million acres, and the Biden administration reduced it to 400,000 acres. Therefore, 600,000 acres were deemed economically unviable by the state.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>2 bids</answer>
<other>The article states that in the 2021 auction, only nine tracts received bids out of the total offered. Assuming a linear relationship, offering one million acres (approximately 2.5 times the 400,000 acres offered) would proportionally result in around 22.5 bids. Since bids are whole numbers and based on the pattern, this rounds to 2 bids.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article does not specify the fraction of the 400,000 acres that would be excluded if the Porcupine caribou herd's migration patterns shifted. It only mentions that the leases were restricted to areas not used by the herd.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<question_number>8</other>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article does not specify what alternative acreage Governor Dunleavy would propose. It only mentions his criticism of the Biden administration's lease sale.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article does not detail specific provisions in the November environmental review that contributed to the perception of risk and complexity beyond the acreage reduction. It only mentions that the review recommended additional protections.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>$14.4 million</answer>
