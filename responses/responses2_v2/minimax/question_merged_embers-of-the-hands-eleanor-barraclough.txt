<other>First, I will analyze the article to find relevant information for each question.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Textiles</answer>
<other>The article mentions that textiles were crucial for Viking seafaring and were crafted with extensive communal effort. The Lloyds Bank Coprolite was found during the construction of a new bank branch, and it is logical to infer that textiles, being important for sails, would have been stored in bulk near such a location.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article does not provide information on what specific elements of Norse home life, such as those exemplified by loom weights, the Normans abandoned after their conquest of England. While the article mentions the Bayeux Tapestry's focus on military rather than domestic scenes, it does not explicitly state that the Normans abandoned any specific aspect of Norse home life.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Smartphone</answer>
<other>Harald Bluetooth inspired the name of a wireless technology, and Harald Fairhair swore not to comb his hair. A modern communication device analogous to rune sticks, which were used for messaging, would be a smartphone. This inference is based on the connection between communication and modern technology.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Textile-based dwellings</answer>
<other>The article highlights the importance of textiles in Norse culture and mentions that Greenland's climate warming allowed for Norse settlement. It can be inferred that textile-based dwellings, such as tents or other fabric structures, would have been susceptible to damage from a subsequent cooling trend, as they rely on the durability of textiles.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Maritime raiding</answer>
<other>The term "Viking" was a job description akin to "Navy SEAL," and the Normans were descendants of Vikings. Given their shift from seafaring to land-based conquest, it is logical to infer that the Normans likely did not specialize in maritime raiding, as this would have been a primary Viking role.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>While the article mentions that the sagas were written by Christians in Iceland and that Norse women were central to textile production, it does not specify what type of narrative focusing on the "soap opera lives" of Norse gods might have been suppressed or altered due to the influence of these women. The connection between textile workers and the content of the sagas is not explicitly detailed.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Comb</answer>
<other>Runic inscriptions included curses, jokes, and gossip, and the earliest runes were found on a comb. It is logical to infer that a comb, reflecting the Norse reputation for "excellent tresses," might also carry a hidden, salacious message, similar to those found on the waterfront in Bergen.</other>
<question_number>8</answer>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>Although the article mentions the cultural fluidity of the Norse world and the Norman influence, it does not specify what language, other than Old Norse, might have been spoken in a Norse settlement in North America. The connection between the Normans and language in North American settlements is not explicitly detailed in the text.</other>
