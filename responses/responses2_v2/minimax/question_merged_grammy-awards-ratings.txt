<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>8.7</answer>
<other>If the Grammys' viewership decline mirrored the Golden Globes' 1 million viewer drop, the viewership would be 15.4 million - 1 million = 14.4 million. However, this calculation is incorrect based on the wording of the question. Re-evaluating, if the Grammys declined by the same percentage as the Golden Globes (from 15.4 million to 9.3 million is about a 39.6% drop), the calculation would be 15.4 million * (1 - 0.396) = 9.3 million. But this doesn't make sense in the context of the question. Re-evaluating again, if the Grammys declined by the same percentage as the Golden Globes' drop from last year (which is not explicitly stated), we can infer the percentage drop is (9.3 - 10.3)/10.3 = -9.7%. Applying this to 15.4 million, the result is 15.4 * 0.903 = 13.9 million. But this is not consistent with the wording. Given the confusion, the most logical interpretation of "mirrored" is a direct 1 million viewer drop, leading to 14.4 million. However, this contradicts the previous calculation. Given the inconsistencies, the answer should be N/A as the exact percentage drop for the Golden Globes is not clearly provided.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>26.2</answer>
<other>Assuming the same growth pattern as the previous three years, the Oscars would have grown from 19.5 million by an average of (19.5 - 10.5)/3 = 3 million viewers per year. Therefore, the projected viewership would be 19.5 million + 3 million = 22.5 million. However, this calculation is based on inconsistent data, as the previous three years' growth is not explicitly detailed. Given the lack of precise data, the answer should be N/A. Re-evaluating, if we assume a constant growth rate, the growth rate is (19.5/10.5)^(1/3) = 1.22. Applying this to 19.5 million, the projected viewership would be 19.5 * 1.22 = 23.8 million. Re-evaluating again, the growth rate calculated from the given data is inconsistent, so the correct approach is to assume a constant increase of 3 million per year, leading to 22.5 million. However, this contradicts the previous calculation. Given the inconsistencies, the most logical interpretation is that the growth rate is not constant, so the answer should be N/A.</other>
