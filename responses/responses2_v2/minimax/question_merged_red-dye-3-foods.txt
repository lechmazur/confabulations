<other>The FDA first approved Red Dye No. 3 in 1907 and banned it in cosmetics in 1990, which is a period of 83 years.

The article does not provide a specific year when the FDA acknowledged carcinogenic effects in ingested drugs, but it does mention that the dye is still allowed in ingested drugs until 2028, suggesting a continued allowance despite concerns. Given the information provided, we can only calculate the time until the acknowledged ban, which is 121 years after the initial approval.</other>
