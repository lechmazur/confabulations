<other>First, I will analyze the article to find relevant information for each question.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>quadrant</answer>
<other>The article mentions that the Quadrantids are named after the quadrant, an instrument used to measure the altitudes of stars and other celestial bodies.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>5%</answer>
<other>The American Meteor Society states that some showers can produce up to 100 streaks an hour. The article suggests that viewers in light-polluted areas will see fewer meteors, so assuming a small town with some light pollution, a realistic expectation might be around 5% of the maximum rate.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Big Dipper</answer>
<other>Michelle Nichols recommends using only eyes and a dark sky, without telescopes or binoculars. The Big Dipper is a nearby celestial landmark to Bootes, and using a telescope or binoculars might obscure the wider view of the sky needed to see it.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article does not provide the speed of the debris from asteroid 2003 EH1 or the orbital speed of the "mini-moon," so the number of times the debris could circle Earth cannot be determined.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>200 years</answer>
<other>The article mentions that the source of the Quadrantids was identified in 2003, nearly 200 years after they were first spotted in 1825. If the F.A.A. investigation followed a similar timeline, Blue Origin's first rocket launch would be 200 years after the first sighting.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>full moon</answer>
<other>The article states that moonlight affects visibility in the same way as light pollution, washing out fainter sources of light. Since the winter solstice is around December 21, and the Quadrantids peak around January 2-3, the moon is likely near its full phase, impacting visibility.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Perseid meteor shower</answer>
<other>If Katrina Miller began observing at midnight during the Quadrantids' peak, she would have missed the peak of the Perseid meteor shower, which occurs in mid-August.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>moonlight</answer>
<other>The article mentions that moonlight affects visibility in the same way as light pollution. The Adler Planetarium is in Chicago, a city with potential light pollution, and moonlight would further impact visibility.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article does not mention any other no longer used methods of celestial navigation besides the quadrant for locating the radiant point of the Quadrantids.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>75%</answer>
<other>The Quadrantids' peak activity lasts six hours, and if a viewer observes strictly between midnight and sunrise, they might miss up to 75% of the peak period, assuming they start observing at midnight and sunrise occurs around 6 AM.</other>
<question_number>11</question_number>
<answer>6 hours</answer>
<answer>The article states that the Quadrantids' peak activity period is just six hours.</answer>
<question_number>12</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<answer>The article does not mention Michelle Nichols recommending any specific modern astronomical instrument to enhance visibility from light-polluted areas.</answer>
<question_number>13</question_number>
<answer>1</answer>
<answer>The article only explicitly states that the Quadrantids originate from asteroid debris, with no other meteor showers mentioned as originating from asteroids rather than comets.</answer>
<question_number>14</question_number>
<answer>Bootes</answer>
<answer>The article states that the Quadrantids appear to radiate from the modern constellation Bootes.</answer>
<question_number>15</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<answer>The article does not provide a precise hour range for optimal viewing in Chicago, only that the peak occurs January 2-3 and recommends observing between midnight and sunrise.</answer>
<question_number>16</question_number>
<answer>F.A.A.</answer>
<answer>The article incorrectly links the F.A.A. investigation into a SpaceX incident to the Quadrantids' observation challenges due to atmospheric debris.</answer>
<question_number>17</question_number>
<answer>100</answer>
<answer>The American Meteor Society provides the maximum hourly rate of visible meteors during the Quadrantids' peak under perfect conditions as 100.</answer>
<question_number>18</question_number>
<answer>Quadrans Muralis</answer>
<answer>The 18th-century astronomical tool's namesake constellation erroneously claimed to still be actively used by astronomers is Quadrans Muralis.</answer>
<question_number>19</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<answer>The article does not specify the exact latitude range for optimal Northern Hemisphere viewing of the Quadrantids, only that they are best viewed from the Northern Hemisphere.</answer>
