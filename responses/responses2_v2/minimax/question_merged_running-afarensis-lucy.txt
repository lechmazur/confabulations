<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article does not specify the number of muscle configurations tested by Dr. Bates' team.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article does not provide a percentage improvement in running efficiency when comparing humanlike and apelike ankle muscles for Lucy.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article does not specify which modern animal species shares the closest running biomechanics with Lucy.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article does not provide an estimated survival rate comparing early hominins who relied on burst running versus those who developed endurance running.</other>
<question_number>11</question_number>
<answer>Achilles tendon</answer>
<other>The Achilles tendon is described as acting like a giant spring that stores and releases energy during movement in modern humans but is noted as being underdeveloped in Lucy due to her apelike ankle muscles.</other>
<question_number>12</question_number>
<answer>a fall out of a tree</answer>
<other>The 2016 autopsy identified a fall out of a tree as the cause of Lucy's death.</other>
<question_number>13</question_number>
<answer>Karl Bates</answer>
<answer>Karl Bates is credited with using computer simulations of leg muscles to estimate Lucy's running speed.</answer>
<question_number>14</answer>
<answer>Dr. Bates</answer>
<answer>Dr. Bates' body measurements, listed as being 5-foot-9 and 154 pounds, were used to create the digital modern human model compared with Lucy.</answer>
<question_number>15</question_number>
<answer>virtual reconstruction of her leg and pelvic muscles</answer>
<answer>The reconstruction method that combined fossil evidence with muscular analysis provided estimates of Lucy's height and weight.</answer>
<question_number>16</question_number>
<answer>endurance running capabilities</answer>
<answer>The article portrays endurance running as a running adaptation that is fully developed in later species but missing in Lucy's limited sprinting ability.</answer>
<question_number>17</question_number>
<answer>domestic pig</answer>
<answer>The domestic pig is referenced as a benchmark for comparing Lucy's estimated top running speed.</answer>
<question_number>18</question_number>
<answer>Homo erectus</answer>
<answer>Homo erectus is presented as a contrast to Lucy's brief bursts of speed due to its endurance running capabilities and pursuit hunting traits.</answer>
<question_number>19</question_number>
<answer>humanlike ankle muscles</answer>
<answer>Adding humanlike ankle muscles to Lucy's digital muscle simulation resulted in an energy expenditure similar to that of other animals of comparable size.</answer>
