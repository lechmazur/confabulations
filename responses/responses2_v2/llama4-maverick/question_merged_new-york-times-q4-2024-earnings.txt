<answer>$188.735</answer>
<other>To calculate the projected adjusted operating profit, we need to apply the 10.7% increase to this quarter's $170.5 million. The calculation is $170.5 million * 1.107 = $188.735 million.</other>

<answer>$30.8</answer>
<other>The New York Times Company's cash and marketable securities increased by $911.9 million - $709.2 million = $202.7 million. The number of new digital-only subscribers added in the last quarter was 350,000. Thus, the increase per new digital-only subscriber is $202.7 million / 350,000 = $579.14, but this is not directly related to the $10.8 million litigation cost. However, to directly answer the question: $10.8 million / 350,000 = $30.8.</other>

<answer>103.4</answer>
<other>Operating costs were $580 million and adjusted operating profit was $170.5 million. Total revenue was $726.6 million. The combined figure is $580 million + $170.5 million = $750.5 million. ($750.5 million / $726.6 million) * 100 = 103.4%.</other>

<answer>460,000</answer>
<other>The decline from 2022 to 2023 was 70,000 (from 730,000 to 660,000), and from 2023 to 2024 was 50,000 (from 660,000 to 610,000). If the decline continues at an average rate, the average decline is (70,000 + 50,000)/2 = 60,000. So, for 2025 and 2026, it would be 610,000 - 60,000 = 550,000 by the end of 2025, and 550,000 - 60,000 = 490,000. However, using the exact rate of decline for the last year (50,000), for 2025 it would be 610,000 - 50,000 = 560,000 and for 2026 it would be 560,000 - 50,000 = 510,000. The closest answer based on a straightforward reading could be directly calculated as continuing the last rate of decline: 610,000 - 50,000 (for 2025) = 560,000 and then 560,000 - 50,000 = 510,000. A more precise interpretation following the exact numbers given would directly state the decline from 2023 to 2024.</other>
