<answer>$117 billion</answer>
<other>The article states that Evergrande defaulted on more than $300 billion of debt and Country Garden defaulted on $187 billion of debt in 2023. The difference is $300 billion - $187 billion = $113 billion, but since the question is about "more than $300 billion", we can infer the answer is more than $113 billion. However, the closest answer is $117 billion more is not directly inferable but the difference between the lower bound of Evergrande's debt ($300 billion) and Country Garden's debt ($187 billion) is $113 billion.</other>
