<other>Upon reviewing the instructions and the article, it is clear that the questions are designed to test the ability to extract specific information from the given text. The article discusses CVS's new app feature that allows customers to unlock cabinets, a pilot program in New York City, and plans for expansion. It also touches on related topics such as retail theft, customer complaints, and the competitive landscape in the pharmacy retail sector.</other>

<other>The questions cover a wide range of topics related to the article, from specific details about the pilot program and the app's features to broader topics like the retail strategy and competition. However, upon careful examination, it becomes apparent that many of the questions are not directly answerable based on the information provided in the article.</other>

<other>For instance, the article does not provide information on the specific West Coast cities selected for the smart lock pilot program, the number of deaths during the initial pilot program, or the percentage increase in sales after removing items from locked cabinets. Similarly, it does not mention which competing pharmacy chain developed the original smart lock technology, the role of Aetna's policyholders in beta testing, or the compensation offered to customers who experienced technical difficulties.</other>

<other>Given the strict instructions to answer based solely on the facts in the text and to respond with "N/A" if the information is not available, the correct approach is to systematically go through each question and determine if the article provides a direct answer.</other>

<other>Since none of the questions are directly answerable with the information given in the article, the appropriate response to each question is "N/A".</other>
