<answer>210</answer>
<other>Venice's fee is 10 euros, and Galapagos is $200. 7 days * 10 euros = 70 euros. 70 euros is roughly equivalent to 70 * 1.14 = 80 USD (using an approximate conversion rate, though the exact rate is not given). So, 80 + 200 = 280 USD. However, the question seems to be asking for a direct sum or a straightforward calculation based on given numbers without specifying currency conversion. The closest direct calculation is: 10 euros * 7 = 70 euros, and $200 for Galapagos. If we were to directly add or consider a similar currency, it is not directly possible. However, the text does not directly support a straightforward sum in a single currency.</other>
