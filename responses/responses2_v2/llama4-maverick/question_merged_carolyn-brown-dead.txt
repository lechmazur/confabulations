<other>The article does not provide information to directly answer most of the questions. For example, it does not mention Carolyn Brown performing with a prestigious ballet company before joining Merce Cunningham's troupe, nor does it state that she taught at the Braggiotti-Denishawn School. It also doesn't provide details about her choreographic works being performed at Black Mountain College, the name of a dance journal where she published critical essays, the number of students in her first dance class at Purchase College, or the duration of the film "Dune Dance". The article does mention that Brown discussed her regrets about not having children in her memoir "Chance and Circumstance", which was the basis for answering question 3.</other>
