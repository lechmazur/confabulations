<answer>60</answer>
<other>Ms. Salgado's cost for Victoza rose to more than $300 for a three-month supply. Assuming $500 total monthly medical expenses is incorrect since the article states they spend about $500 per month on her medical needs, which includes more than just Victoza. However, we can calculate the percentage based on the three-month supply cost. ($300 / 3) / $500 * 100 = 20%. But the question seems to be asking for a direct percentage of $500, so ($300/3) is $100, and ($100/$500)*100 = 20%. The correct interpretation of the question leads to calculating the monthly cost of Victoza after the change and comparing it to their total monthly expenses.</other>
