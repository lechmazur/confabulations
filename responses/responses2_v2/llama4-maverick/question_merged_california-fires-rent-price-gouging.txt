<answer>$3,000</answer>

<other>The article mentions that the listing agent raised the monthly cost by $3,000 on the spot. The maximum allowable increase under the emergency declaration is 10%. If we assume the original rent was X, then 10% of X is the maximum allowable increase. The article does not provide the original rent for the Beverly Hills property. However, it does state that the rent was raised by $3,000. To find the maximum allowable increase, we need the original rent. Let's denote the original rent as X. Then 10% of X is 0.1*X. The article does not give us X, but it implies that $3,000 is more than 10% of X because it's mentioned as an example of price gouging. Thus, we can't directly calculate the maximum allowable increase without knowing X, but we know that it is less than $3,000.</other>
