<other>The article does not provide information to directly answer most of the questions, so "N/A" is used where applicable. For question 1, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is identified as the member of Trump's incoming administration who cited personal experience with AA meetings. For question 12, while the article does not directly state what type of tumor would be mentioned on the label if Donald J. Trump were to implement Dr. Murthy's recommendation mirroring South Korea's approach, it does mention that South Korea has a label warning about liver cancer.</other>
