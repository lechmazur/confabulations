<other>2032-12-22 minus 2028-12-17 is 4 years, which is approximately 1461 days. However, the exact number of days is not directly calculated here; the relevant information is that radar observations will be possible during the December 17, 2028 flyby, and the impact is on December 22, 2032. The difference is 4 years, and calculating the exact days: 365.25 * 4 = 1461 days. December 22, 2032 - December 17, 2028 = 1461 days (approximately), but the exact count is: Dec 22 - Dec 17 = 5 days apart in the same month, and 4 years apart.</other>
