<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions Dr. Kevin Cheung's research showing that dead and dying cells within a tumor might create an environment that makes it easier for living tumor cells to get out and spread. However, it does not detail the primary mechanism by which this occurs.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions that getting vaccinated for HPV can reduce the risk of certain cancers. Dr. Marcel van den Brink is quoted discussing the hope for curing cancers with newer treatments like stem cell transplants and CAR T-cell therapy, but it does not specify that HPV vaccination is directly related to cancers treatable with stem cell transplants.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) has been shown to increase the risk for lung and breast cancers, according to Dr. Loretta Erhunmwunsee. It does not specifically mention colon cancer in this context.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>immune cells</answer>
<other>The article mentions that some research has suggested that immune cells might transfer their contents to tumor cells to make them more invasive.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>T cells</answer>
<other>The article discusses engineered T cells, specifically CAR T-cell therapy, as being used to treat blood cancers by taking the brakes off the immune system's fighters.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>Robert Weinberg is quoted explaining that exposures affecting cancer risk likely do so by provoking inflammation, not by directly damaging DNA.</other>

<question_number>11</question_number>
<answer>PM 2.5</answer>
<other>The article mentions that fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) has been linked to both lung and breast cancers through its role in inducing inflammation.</other>

<question_number>12</question_number>
<answer>epigenetic changes</answer>
<other>The article highlights epigenetic changes, affected by factors such as aging, diet, and environmental exposures, as a major driver of tumor growth.</other>
