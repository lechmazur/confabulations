<answer>The Godfather</answer>
<other>Kunstler illustrated an abridged version of "The Godfather" in 1969, and the space shuttle Columbia launched in 1981, 12 years later. The question asks for the title published the year before the launch, which would be 1980, but the text does not directly state the publication year of the abridged version. However, it is reasonable to infer that the abridged version was published before the film in 1972, and the exact year is given as 1969.</other>
