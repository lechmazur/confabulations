<other>I answered each question based strictly on the information in the article, using "N/A" when no specific information was available to directly answer the question. For question 2, Whitmer referenced Michigan's support for Trump once. For question 11, the three vehicle models were directly mentioned in the text as examples of how tariffs could increase production costs.</other>
