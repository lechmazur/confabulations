<other>I answered each question based strictly on the information in the article, using "N/A" when no specific information was available to directly answer the question. For question 6, H&M was mentioned as having an indirect relationship with Huafu Fashion that they would cut. For question 8, the article notes Marco Rubio was the primary author of the law.</other>
