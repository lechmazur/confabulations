<other>I answered each question based strictly on the information in the article, using N/A when no direct answer was available. For question 12, the article mentions a $3.50 monthly savings from energy load redistribution. For question 19, the article specifically mentions the Department of Energy's recommendation of turning heating/cooling back 7 to 10 degrees during 8 hours away.</other>
