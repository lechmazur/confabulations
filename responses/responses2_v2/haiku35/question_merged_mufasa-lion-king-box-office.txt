<other>Notes on reasoning:
- Question 8 was directly answerable from the text, which mentioned "Wolf Man" as an R-rated horror movie released that weekend
- All other questions either lack specific information in the article or ask about details not present in the text, thus warranting "N/A" responses
- Strictly followed the instruction to answer only based on the provided article</other>
