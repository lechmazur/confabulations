<other>The article does not provide specific numerical details to answer any of these precise questions. While the text discusses vaccines, childhood immunization, and prevention of hospitalizations and deaths, it does not give the exact statistical breakdowns requested in these questions. Each question requires a level of specificity not present in the source text, so "N/A" is the appropriate response.</other>
