<answer>Thwaites Glacier is among the fastest receding and least stable in Antarctica, making it a critical indicator for broader ice sheet stability</answer>
<other>Other info: The study used Thwaites to test ice cliff collapse scenarios relevant to West Antarctica's ice sheet</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Simulations showed ice shelf removal led to faster glacier flow, preventing cliffs from becoming unstable heights</answer>
