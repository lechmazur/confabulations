<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Greenland's melting ice infuses the North Atlantic with freshwater, disrupting the sinking of denser, saltier water that drives the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), potentially stalling it.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>As Greenland's ice sheet loses elevation, it sits at a lower, warmer altitude, exposing it to warmer air, which accelerates melting.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The infusion of freshwater from Greenland's melting ice reduces the density of seawater, disrupting the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) by hindering the sinking of denser water.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Thawing permafrost releases carbon dioxide and methane, which amplify global warming, further accelerating permafrost thaw in a self-reinforcing cycle.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>A slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) could disrupt weather patterns for billions in Europe, altering temperature and rainfall.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The shutdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) could upend tropical weather patterns, affecting rainfall and climate stability.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Greenland's melting ice sheet releases freshwater into the North Atlantic, reducing seawater density and disrupting the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), potentially causing a slowdown.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Thawing permafrost releases stored carbon as carbon dioxide and methane, enhancing global warming, which further accelerates permafrost thaw in a feedback loop.</answer>
