<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>They revealed that features and indentations can persist rather than being smoothed out by melting, challenging the previous assumption that melting processes smooth underwater ice topography</answer>
<other>Other info: The article states that scientists previously assumed melting would smooth the ice, but the new findings show complex structures like terraces and divots that persisted.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Resulted in about half of Ran's missions being completely successful</answer>
<other>Other info: The article mentions Ran completed 14 missions, but only about half were completely successful due to navigation challenges using dead reckoning.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>One theory for Ran's loss was a disorienting encounter with a curious seal</answer>
<other>Other info: Dr. Wahlin theorized Ran might have been disoriented by a seal circling it underwater, contributing to its disappearance.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Showed that features and indentations can persist despite melting, contradicting the assumption that melting smooths the topography</answer>
<other>Other info: The article explicitly states that earlier assumptions about smoothing were challenged by the discovery of persistent complex structures.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Too much sea ice blocked access to Thwaites Glacier</answer>
<other>Other info: The article directly states that excessive sea ice made Thwaites inaccessible, forcing the team to study Dotson instead.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Ran</answer>
<other>Other info: The article names the robot Ran, which was lost during a subsequent expedition after initially mapping the Dotson Ice Shelf.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Revealed that melting does not always smooth underwater ice, as complex structures like terraces and divots persist</answer>
<other>Other info: The article states that the discovery contradicts the prior assumption that melting smooths ice topography, showing features can persist.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Thwaites Glacier</answer>
<other>Other info: The article explicitly mentions Thwaites Glacier as the inaccessible glacier estimated to raise sea levels by two feet if it collapses.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Requires further study to determine how these features affect melting patterns in response to ocean warming</answer>
<other>Other info: The article states that Peter Davis noted understanding the impact of these features on melting requires additional research.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>That the ice shelf's underside might be flat and featureless</answer>
<other>Other info: The article mentions scientists were unsure if the ice would turn out flat and featureless, which would have been a letdown.</other>
