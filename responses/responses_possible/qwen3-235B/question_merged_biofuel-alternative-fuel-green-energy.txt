<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Repsol's retrofitting strategy aligns with E.U. regulations mandating increasing proportions of sustainable aviation fuel (2% by 2025, 70% by 2050) by enabling production of low-carbon fuels to meet these requirements.</answer>
<other>Other info: EU regulations drive Repsol's investment in biofuels to comply with emission targets.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Repsol claims flexibility in using various waste materials, but scarcity of feedstock like cooking oil (e.g., insufficient supply even from all Spanish restaurants) creates a paradox between asserted adaptability and practical sourcing limits.</answer>
<other>Other info: Environmentalists and analysts highlight feedstock scarcity as a key issue.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Biofuels are seen as practical due to existing infrastructure compatibility, but logistical challenges like global feedstock transportation emissions and limited availability contradict their sustainability claims.</answer>
<other>Other info: Transportation of feedstock creates emissions, and supply constraints challenge scalability.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The 70% sustainable aviation fuel target by 2050 requires scaling production, but feedstock scarcity and competition for waste materials create complexity in meeting demand.</answer>
<other>Other info: Repsol must navigate limited feedstock and regulatory pressures to expand supply chains.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Biofuels offer easy green credentials, but sourcing challenges (global feedstock competition, transportation emissions) undermine their simplicity and sustainability.</answer>
<other>Other info: Environmentalists question the net carbon benefits due to supply chain emissions.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Repsol claims cold-weather performance, but logistical challenges in securing sufficient waste feedstock could limit production scale, contradicting the practicality of widespread adoption.</answer>
<other>Other info: Performance claims do not address feedstock availability constraints.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Repsol retrofits refineries to produce greener fuels, while competitors closed traditional refineries, positioning Repsol to leverage existing infrastructure for low-carbon transition.</answer>
<other>Other info: Repsol's strategy focuses on transforming rather than abandoning refining assets.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Global competition, including cheap Chinese biodiesel imports and EU tariffs, alongside feedstock scarcity, challenges Repsol's ability to maintain profitability and market share.</answer>
<other>Other info: Shell's suspension of a biofuel plant highlights market volatility risks for Repsol.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests waste ingredient scarcity (e.g., insufficient Spanish cooking oil) could limit production scale, forcing reliance on global sources with logistical and sustainability trade-offs.</answer>
<other>Other info: Repsol acknowledges potential need to source feedstock from Asia amid limited local supply.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Repsol claims biofuels reduce emissions by 90%, but logistical challenges (feedstock scarcity, transportation emissions) contradict their feasibility as a scalable, practical solution.</answer>
<other>Other info: Critics argue sourcing complexities offset emission reduction benefits.</other>
