<answer>The 2016 study showing primate vocal tracts are "speech ready" challenges the previous assumption (held by Philip Lieberman) that apes' inability to speak was due to anatomical limitations of their vocal tract, shifting focus to potential brain-related deficiencies instead.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Fischer suggests Johnny and Renata might have combined standard chimpanzee pant-grunts, a non-speech sound, rather than intentionally uttering "mama," implying their vocalizations could be routine ape communication rewarded by humans rather than learned speech.</answer>

<answer>The 2016 study showing primate vocal tracts are "speech ready" challenges the previous assumption that apes' vocal anatomy was insufficient for speech, suggesting anatomical limitations were not the primary barrier to spoken language.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Renata and Johnny's vocalizations had a unique acoustic profile distinct from typical pant-grunts, and most volunteers identified their sounds as "mama," contradicting Dr. Fischer's claim that they were merely concatenated pant-grunts.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Viki's utterances lacked vowels and were dismissed as non-speech, while Johnny's "mama" included consonant-vowel combinations analyzed acoustically and validated by listener consensus, reflecting modern methodologies over older observational/training-based approaches.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The "speech ready" vocal tract suggests anatomical capability for sound production, but combining consonants and vowels into syllables (as humans do) is attributed to the human brain's ability to send coordinated commands, not the vocal tract alone.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Chimpanzees uttering "mama" challenges the notion by suggesting non-human apes may possess limited capacity to learn and imitate human sounds, contrary to the claim that humans are uniquely capable of vocal learning.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Renata and Johnny's ability to produce "mama" with consonant-vowel structure suggests apes may have some brain-based capacity for speech, countering the argument that their brains entirely lack the essential requirements for spoken language.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Chimpanzees producing "mama" with consonant-vowel combinations implies a rudimentary ability to coordinate jaw/throat movements, challenging the idea that only humans possess the neural capacity for such coordinated commands necessary for speech.</answer>
