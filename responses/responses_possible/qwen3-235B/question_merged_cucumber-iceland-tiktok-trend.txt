<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>social media trends can rapidly spike demand beyond local production capacity, exacerbated by Iceland's isolation and reliance on local greenhouse agriculture</answer>
<other>Article mentions TikTok trend caused nationwide shortage, Iceland's isolation complicates imports, and 99% greenhouse-grown cucumbers couldn't meet sudden demand.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>self-sustaining agriculture struggles with unexpected demand surges due to isolation limiting rapid imports and fixed production cycles</answer>
<other>Article states Iceland's geothermal greenhouses usually suffice but couldn't handle TikTok-driven demand, requiring emergency Netherlands shipments.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>external social media trends can overwhelm isolated systems' ability to adapt or import alternatives quickly</answer>
<other>Article links cucumber shortage directly to TikTok craze and notes Iceland's island geography makes restocking expensive and slow.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>geographic isolation creates logistical delays in restocking, while local production cycles can't rapidly scale to meet sudden demand</answer>
<other>Article describes Iceland needing emergency cucumber shipments from Netherlands and farmers' yield cycles being misaligned with TikTok-driven demand.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>small population (380,000) means sudden demand spikes from trends disproportionately strain supply chains</answer>
<other>Article explicitly states Iceland's small population creates "little wiggle room" for handling sudden surges in demand like the cucumber craze.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>TikTok trend coincided with a natural lull in cucumber production cycles and carbon dioxide shortages at greenhouses</answer>
<other>Article quotes Kristin Linda Sveinsdottir noting the fad hit during a yield lull and mentions CO2 shortages affecting greenhouse production.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>preference for local foods over imports reduced contingency options when domestic supply failed</answer>
<other>Article states Icelanders prioritize local produce to reduce carbon footprint, which "combined with small population" worsened the shortage.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>geothermal-powered greenhouses enable year-round production but lack flexibility to rapidly scale during unexpected demand spikes</answer>
<other>Article connects Iceland's greenhouse reliance (powered by geothermal energy) to vulnerability, as seen when TikTok demand exceeded capacity.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>forced reliance on emergency imports from Netherlands contradicted Iceland's agricultural self-sufficiency image</answer>
<other>Article explicitly states Kronan normally sources 99% locally but had to import cucumbers during shortage.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>greenhouse systems couldn't adjust to demand surge due to fixed production cycles and carbon dioxide shortages</answer>
<other>Article mentions both production cycle lulls and CO2 shortages as factors limiting greenhouse output during the TikTok-driven shortage.</other>
