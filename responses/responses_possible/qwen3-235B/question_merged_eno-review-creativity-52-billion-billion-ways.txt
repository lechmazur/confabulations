<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>the messy process of creativity</answer>
<other>The article contrasts a version focusing on U2's collaboration (fixed in both viewings) with another emphasizing creativity's messy process, which would be absent in a U2-exclusive version.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>the audience's brain fills in patterns, creating varied experiences of mood and character</answer>
<other>The article states that filmmakers usually control mood/character through fixed edits, but "Eno's" generative structure shifts this burden to the audience's brain to "cook" meaning from changing sequences.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>the use of randomness and generative processes</answer>
<other>The film's generative structure mirrors Eno's artistic approach of inviting randomness; a linear format would eliminate this core principle.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>code-based allows human-written rules creating new works, unlike AI's derivative nature</answer>
<other>The article distinguishes code-based generative art (rules by humans) from generative AI (derivative of existing works), which aligns with Eno's practice of creating new systems rather than relying on training data.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Oblique Strategies</answer>
<other>Eno's "Oblique Strategies" deck encodes arbitrary rules to disrupt creative processes, mirroring the film's algorithmic decision tree (Brain One) that generates unpredictable sequences through predefined rules.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>U2's creation of "Pride (In the Name of Love)"</answer>
<other>The article uses U2's 1984 archival sequence as a fixed example across versions, while the generative structure allows other collaborations (e.g., Devo) to emerge differently, reflecting Eno's varied creative partnerships.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>the Microsoft Windows theme jingle or Devo collaborations appearing in different versions</answer>
<other>The article notes that one version includes Eno's Windows theme, another his Devo work, demonstrating how the film's variability mirrors the diversity of his musical projects.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>the role of collaboration and randomness in creativity</answer>
<other>The fixed 1984 U2 archival sequence illustrates collaborative creativity, while the film's generative structure embodies randomness, both central to Eno's approach.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Oblique Strategies</answer>
<other>Both the film's Brain One algorithm and Eno's "Oblique Strategies" use rule-based systems to introduce controlled randomness, reflecting their shared generative art principles.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>the audience's active role in creating meaning through pattern recognition</answer>
<other>The YouTube clip scene shows Eno curating influences, paralleling how the film's generative structure forces audiences to "cook" meaning by connecting disparate sequences into coherent narratives.</other>
