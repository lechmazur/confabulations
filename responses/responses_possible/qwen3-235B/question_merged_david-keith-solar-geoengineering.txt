<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>spraying sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere to block sunlight</answer>
<other>David Keith proposes intentionally releasing sulfur dioxide into the sky to reflect sunlight and lower global temperatures, despite it being a pollutant.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Keith sees manageable risks with benefits; Pierrehumbert calls it a grave threat and dangerous to research</answer>
<other>Keith claims risks are quantitatively small compared to benefits, while Pierrehumbert argues it is unsafe to deploy and even researching it is actively dangerous.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>the 1992 paper raised questions about authorization and liability, which critics now cite as governance concerns</answer>
<other>Keith's 1992 paper questioned who would authorize geoengineering and assign liability, aligning with current fears about rogue actors, weaponization, and lack of global governance frameworks.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>observed natural cooling from Mount Pinatubo's eruption validated his approach</answer>
<other>Keith cites the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, which cooled the Northern Hemisphere by 1Â°F, as evidence that stratospheric sulfur dioxide could intentionally reduce global temperatures.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>$72 million windfall vs. $100 million program funding</answer>
<other>Keith earned $72 million from selling Carbon Engineering, while his new University of Chicago program could cost up to $100 million.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>seeing a dramatically shrunken glacier reinforced his urgency to pursue solar geoengineering</answer>
<other>During his 60th birthday hike, Keith encountered a glacier that had shrunk due to climate change, confirming his belief in the need for drastic climate intervention.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>supports ending fossil fuels but advocates solar geoengineering as a supplementary solution</answer>
<other>Keith agrees nations should stop burning fossil fuels but argues solar geoengineering could provide faster cooling while the world transitions to cleaner energy.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>dyslexia delayed reading until late 4th grade but did not prevent his career in experimental physics</answer>
<other>Despite dyslexia causing late reading development, Keith became a voracious reader and pursued experimental physics, leading to his career in climate research.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>he now prefers reduced transparency to avoid protests, unlike his initial openness</answer>
<other>After the Scopex experiment protests, Keith stated he would not be as transparent in future projects to avoid opposition.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>sudden temperature rise over 5-10 years, akin to a dinosaur-killing impact</answer>
<other>Pierrehumbert warns abrupt termination of solar geoengineering could cause a rapid temperature spike, destabilizing the climate system catastrophically.</other>
