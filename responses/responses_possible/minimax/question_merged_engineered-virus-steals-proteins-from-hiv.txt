<answer>TIPs may only require a single injection to keep H.I.V. at low levels permanently, unlike lenacapavir which requires twice-yearly shots.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The most significant long-term implication for H.I.V. transmission is that TIPs might make it harder for people to transmit H.I.V. to others.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The most critical factor is that TIPs become a permanent part of the patient's DNA, making it impossible to obtain consent from others who might be infected if the treatment spreads.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>TIPs invade cells and steal essential proteins from H.I.V., disrupting its ability to multiply, unlike protease inhibitors which target the virus's proteins directly.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The most significant challenge is the ethical concern of irreversible integration into the patient's DNA and potential side effects that cannot be reversed.</answer>
<question_number>6</answer>
<answer>The most critical factor is that TIPs are engineered to enter protein shells more effectively than H.I.V., leading to the release of three times more TIPs than H.I.V. viruses.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The most significant risk is the potential for unexpected side effects due to the permanent integration of TIPs into the patient's DNA, which cannot be removed if complications arise.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>TIPs could be considered a universal approach because they interfere with the virus's life cycle, which might be applicable to other viruses as well.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The potential for TIPs to spread to others complicates ethical considerations because doctors cannot obtain consent from those who may be inadvertently infected.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>TIPs work by invading cells and stealing proteins from H.I.V. to disrupt its replication, whereas traditional drugs like protease inhibitors directly target and inhibit specific viral proteins.</answer>
