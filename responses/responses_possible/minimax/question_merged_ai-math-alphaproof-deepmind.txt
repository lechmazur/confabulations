<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Kohli describes the A.I. system's performance as a "phase transition" because it marks a transformative change in the use of A.I. in mathematics and the ability of A.I. systems to do mathematics.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The A.I. system's ability to solve I.M.O. problems is significant in the context of reaching artificial general intelligence as it demonstrates progress in abstract, precise, and creative reasoning, which are key components of A.G.I.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The A.I. system's performance challenges traditional limitations of computers in mathematical problem-solving by showcasing its ability to tackle complex problems that were previously considered beyond the reach of computers, moving from proving simple things to proving things that humans can't.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The A.I. system's ability to solve four out of six I.M.O. problems suggests that its current level of mathematical reasoning is comparable to that of a silver medalist in the competition.</answer>
<question_number>5</answer>
<answer>The A.I. system's ability to solve I.M.O. problems without a human teacher is significant as it demonstrates the potential for A.I. to learn and solve complex problems independently, scaling indefinitely and potentially surpassing human capabilities.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The A.I. system's performance in the I.M.O. serves as a benchmark for its potential to solve research-level mathematical problems as it shows that the system can engage with complex problems, suggesting that a useful research tool is not far away.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The A.I. system's ability to solve I.M.O. problems implies that while it may not replace mathematicians entirely, it could make mathematics more accessible, speed up the research process, and potentially inspire new ideas, but it is still a long way from being able to do all research-level mathematics.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The A.I. system's performance in the I.M.O. reflects the potential for A.I. to surpass human capabilities in mathematical reasoning by showcasing its ability to rediscover knowledge independently and tackle complex problems, indicating a possible future where A.I. can solve the hardest problems that humans can solve and potentially go beyond.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The A.I. system's performance in the I.M.O. challenges the traditional role of human intuition in mathematical problem-solving by demonstrating that A.I. can identify "magic keys" to unlock problems, suggesting a new form of problem-solving that complements or even surpasses human intuition.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The AI system developed by Google DeepMind to engage with a broad range of mathematical subjects beyond geometry, and deployed alongside AlphaGeometry, is AlphaProof.</answer>
