<other>First, I will analyze the article to find relevant information for each question.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Smaller A.I. companies and academic researchers might face challenges because they rely on public data sets and cannot afford to license data directly from publishers, unlike major tech companies.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The paradoxical effect is that while changing data licenses aims to restrict data use, it primarily impacts smaller entities and researchers because major tech companies already possess extensive data and permissions.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The use of synthetic data might be insufficient because many researchers doubt that today's A.I. systems can generate enough high-quality synthetic data to replace the human-created data being lost.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The potential consequence is that A.I. companies may hit the "data wall," where all public internet data is exhausted or restricted, hindering their ability to gather new data for model improvement.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that current data restrictions disproportionately affect smaller A.I. companies and researchers because they lack the resources to establish licensing deals, unlike major tech companies that have already amassed significant data.</answer>
<question_number>6</answer>
<answer>The implication is that major tech companies retain the data they previously gathered even if licenses change, while new entrants or smaller players are the ones primarily affected by the restrictions.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The statement highlights that newer entrants in the A.I. field, such as smaller companies or researchers, are the ones primarily impacted by data restrictions, as they did not have the opportunity to gather data before the restrictions were in place.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that data restrictions may lead to a reevaluation of the relationship between A.I. companies and data creators, potentially leading to more formalized agreements or compensation structures rather than the current practice of freely scraping data.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>25 percent of high-quality data remains unrestricted in the studied datasets, assuming all identified restrictions are enforced.</answer>
