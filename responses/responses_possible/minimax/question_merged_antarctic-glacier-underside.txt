<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The formations challenged the assumption that melting smooths out underwater ice topography, revealing that features like terraces and divots can persist.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The use of dead reckoning made navigation uncertain, leading to only about half of Ran's missions being completely successful.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The seals observed in a fracture of Dotson's ice suggested a possible encounter that could have caused Ran to become disoriented and crash, contributing to the potential reason for its loss.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The findings revealed complex features like terraces and divots, contradicting the assumption that melting smooths out underwater ice topography.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The scientists were unable to survey the Thwaites Glacier because too much sea ice was in the way, making it inaccessible.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The underwater robot Ran, which was lost during a subsequent expedition, initially captured images of the enigmatic ice formations beneath the Dotson Ice Shelf.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The newly discovered topography contradicts previous assumptions by showing that complex features like terraces and divots persist, indicating that melting does not necessarily smooth out the underwater ice topography.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The inaccessible glacier that prompted the researchers to study the Dotson Ice Shelf instead was the Thwaites Glacier.</answer>
<question_number>9</answer>
<answer>The complex topography potentially impacts our understanding by suggesting that features affecting melting patterns are more intricate and persistent than previously thought, requiring further study to comprehend their influence on overall melting in response to ocean warming.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The researchers risked encountering the misconception that the underwater topography of ice shelves is flat and featureless, but were surprised to find complex structures.</answer>
