<other>First, I will analyze the article to address each question based on the provided information.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The article mentions that the ATR 72-500 turboprop's de-icing system was improved after a 1994 crash, which could mislead investigators into assuming the improvements eliminated the risk, creating a red herring in understanding the current crash's cause.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The article states the plane was traveling at roughly 325 mph before the crash, and while this speed alone was not low enough to cause a stall, it could stall at a higher speed if there was severe icing, creating a complex conditional statement about the crash's cause.</answer>
<question_number>3</answer>
<answer>The aspect of the plane's anti-icing system that challenges the primary theory is that the crash occurred in an area where the temperature was around 63 degrees, which is relatively warm and less conducive to severe icing compared to colder conditions.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The plane spun slowly as it plummeted before crashing on its belly, which contradicts standard expectations for a stall-induced crash where a more abrupt and uncontrolled descent is typically expected.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The discrepancy between the plane's last recorded speed of roughly 325 mph and the minimum speed for a stall, which is typically lower, challenges the primary theory because severe icing would be required to cause a stall at such a high speed.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The pilots did not communicate with air traffic controllers before the crash, which conflicts with standard protocol for addressing severe icing conditions, where pilots are expected to declare an emergency and seek assistance.</answer>
<question_number>7</answer>
<answer>The detail that contradicts a key assumption is the warm temperature of 63 degrees at the crash location, which undermines the expert's statement about potential severe icing conditions.</answer>
<question_number>8</answer>
<answer>The technological advancement of improved de-icing systems implemented after the 1994 crash paradoxically complicates the current investigation because it raises questions about the effectiveness of these improvements and whether they were properly utilized or malfunctioned.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The crucial detail about the aircraft's specifications is the presence of rubber tubes on the wings for the anti-icing system, which are critical when considering the icing theory because their failure or misuse could have contributed to the crash.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The precise altitude at which the plane began to fall, 17,000 feet, challenges assumptions about gradual ice accumulation because severe icing would likely have been noticed by the pilots at higher altitudes before it caused an abrupt loss of control.</answer>
