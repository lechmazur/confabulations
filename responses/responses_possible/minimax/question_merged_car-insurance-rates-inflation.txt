<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>At least 20% more than a driver with excellent credit and a clean record (one at-fault accident increases premium by 43%, but taking a safe driver course could reduce it by 10%, and improving credit score could help somewhat).</answer>
<question_number>4</answer>
<answer>Up to 89% difference (one at-fault accident increases premium by 43%, not participating in any discount programs or improving factors could result in paying the full increased amount, while implementing all strategies could lead to significant reductions).</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
