<other>First, I will analyze the article to find relevant information for each question.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Amputations on thigh injuries are more successful because the reduced hemolymph flow near the body makes it harder for bacteria to spread, lowering the risk of infection.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Florida carpenter ants have multiple muscles in their thighs that help maintain hemolymph flow, contributing to the success of amputations in preventing infection.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Wound proximity to the body counterintuitively increases the success of amputation in preventing infection, despite the higher risk of bacterial penetration closer to the body.</answer>
<question_number>4</answer>
<answer>The amputation behavior conserves colony resources by saving the lives of injured ants, reducing the need to produce new ants to compensate for losses.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The time window for successful amputation is narrower for lower leg injuries because bacteria can penetrate the body more quickly, making successful amputation less likely compared to thigh injuries.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The presence of multiple muscles in ant thighs helps maintain hemolymph flow, which reduces the spread of bacteria and increases the success of amputation in preventing infection.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Bacterial movement plays a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of amputation, as slower bacterial spread in thigh injuries allows for successful amputation, while quicker penetration in lower leg injuries reduces the chances of success.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The injured ant presents its injured leg and remains calm while another ant bites it off, and after the leg is amputated, the injured ant presents the wound for cleaning.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The correlation is that the presence of hemolymph-pumping muscles in the thighs contributes to the higher success rate of amputations for thigh injuries compared to lower leg injuries.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The high survival rate of amputee ants (90%) contributes to the colony's energy efficiency by reducing the need to produce new ants, thus conserving resources.</answer>
