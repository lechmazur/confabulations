<other>First, I will analyze the article to address each question based on the provided content.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>A.I. chatbots struggle with mathematical accuracy because they were designed to determine probabilities and generate language based on likelihood rather than performing rules-based calculations.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The paradoxical relationship is that while A.I. chatbots have been trained on vast amounts of data, including textbooks and math problems, their proficiency in mathematical tasks remains inconsistent and often incorrect despite this exposure.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The article illustrates that A.I. chatbots solve problems by predicting the most likely next word or phrase based on their training data, whereas traditional computing systems use rigid, step-by-step rules to ensure accuracy, particularly in mathematical computations within educational tools like calculators.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The article reflects a shift in the fundamental understanding of computing by highlighting the move from traditional, rules-based programming towards neural networks that learn from data, which, while excelling in language tasks, challenges the conventional view of computers as precise mathematical machines.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The article challenges the traditional definition of computing as "math on steroids" by showcasing that modern A.I. systems prioritize language prediction and probability over the precise, rule-based calculations that were previously considered the hallmark of computing power.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The unexpected teaching opportunity arising from AI chatbots' mathematical errors is that these mistakes serve as a focal point for classroom discussions, encouraging students to engage in critical thinking and evaluate the accuracy of both the AI's responses and their own solutions.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The article portrays a shift in the perceived strengths of AI systems by emphasizing their advanced language capabilities and reasoning abilities, even though their mathematical skills are not as reliable, thus challenging the traditional notion of computers as infallible calculators.</answer>
<question_number>8</answer>
<answer>The article contributes to the debate by presenting contrasting views: one side advocating for the continued development of large language models as the path to artificial general intelligence, while skeptics like Yann LeCun argue for a broader "world modeling" approach to improve logical understanding and common sense reasoning in AI systems.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The article challenges the traditional STEM/liberal arts distinction by suggesting that modern AI, despite its struggles with math, exhibits strengths more aligned with liberal arts, such as language generation and prediction, reflecting a hybrid model that blends aspects of both fields.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>David Ferrucci's perspective highlights that while AI's language skills are impressive, they do not guarantee accuracy in critical applications, underscoring the need for structured, rules-based software to ensure precision in essential systems like finance and supply chains.</answer>
