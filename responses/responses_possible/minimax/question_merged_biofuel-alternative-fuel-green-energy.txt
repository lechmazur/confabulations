<answer>Repsol's retrofitting strategy aligns with EU regulations by enabling the production of sustainable aviation fuel, which is required to have a growing proportion of non-fossil ingredients by 2050.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The paradox is that while the plant is flexible in using various waste ingredients, the scarcity of these ingredients (like used cooking oil) could limit its actual flexibility and output.</answer>
<question_number>3</answer>
<answer>The contradiction lies in the fact that while biofuels are seen as a practical solution, the logistical challenges of sourcing sufficient waste ingredients globally undermine their feasibility as a straightforward method to reduce emissions.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The EU's requirement creates a complex challenge for Repsol as it must significantly ramp up the production of sustainable aviation fuel, despite potential limitations in sourcing adequate waste ingredients and the need to meet stringent sustainability criteria.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The irony is that while biofuels offer easy green credentials, the difficulty in sourcing enough waste ingredients (like used cooking oil) globally undermines the simplicity of this solution.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The potential contradiction is that the claim of good cold-weather performance may be undermined by the logistical difficulties and potential unreliability of sourcing diverse waste ingredients worldwide.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Repsol's strategy differs from its competitors as it focuses on transforming existing refineries to produce greener fuels, while competitors have opted to close their traditional oil refineries instead of retrofitting them.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The potential challenge for Repsol is the global competition for waste ingredients, which could drive up costs and limit supply, thus threatening its competitive edge in the biofuel market.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that Repsol's biofuel production might be affected by the scarcity and high demand for waste ingredients like cooking oil, potentially limiting the scale of production and increasing costs.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The potential contradiction is that while biofuels are touted as a practical solution, the logistical challenges of securing sufficient waste ingredients globally complicate their effectiveness in reducing emissions.</answer>
