<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>They were never designed to do math, as they are fine-tuned for probabilities and language, not rules-based calculations.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>They excel with language tasks due to vast training data but struggle with math, which requires precise rules rather than probabilistic predictions.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Traditional systems follow rigid rules for accuracy, while A.I. uses data-driven predictions, leading to reliance on calculators for math in educational tools like Khanmigo.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Computing was historically defined as "math on steroids," but A.I. prioritizes language fluency over mathematical accuracy, marking a departure from past computing norms.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>A.I. chatbots are described as "liberal arts majors" rather than "numbers whizzes," contrasting with the traditional view of computing as math-focused.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Students compare bot answers to their own, fostering critical thinking by analyzing discrepancies and verifying solutions.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>AI's strengths lie in language tasks, while math remains a limitation, shifting perceptions from STEM expertise to a focus on linguistic capabilities.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The math shortcomings fuel debates between large language models (LLMs) as a path to AGI and critics advocating for "world modeling" to address logic and common sense gaps.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>A.I. is portrayed as a "liberal arts major" due to language proficiency, contrasting with traditional STEM-focused computing and blurring the distinction between fields.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Language skills are impressive, but critical applications require "painful precision," necessitating rules-based systems alongside A.I. for reliability.</answer>
