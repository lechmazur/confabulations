<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The article's mention of de-icing system improvements since 1994 might mislead by implying the system is reliable, but the crash could still involve icing.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The article's mention of the plane's speed drop and altitude changes creates a complex conditional where the crash's cause depends on severe icing and pilot response.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The crash location's temperature (63°F) challenges the icing theory because it's warm enough to prevent ice formation.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The plane's speed drop wasn't enough to cause a stall unless icing was severe, challenging the primary icing theory.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The pilots' lack of communication with air traffic controllers before the crash conflicts with standard protocol for addressing severe icing.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The crash location's temperature (63°F) contradicts the assumption of colder icing conditions.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The improved de-icing system implemented after the 1994 crash paradoxically complicates the investigation by raising questions about its functionality.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The anti-icing system's rubber tubes, a seemingly minor detail, become crucial when considering the icing theory.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The precise altitude (17,000 feet) challenges assumptions about gradual ice accumulation, as it suggests rapid ice formation.</answer>
