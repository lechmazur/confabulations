<answer>The study's focus on the Thwaites Glacier provides insights because it is a key and unstable component of the West Antarctic ice sheet, allowing researchers to model broader stability implications.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The study's focus on the ice shelf shows that its removal leads to faster glacier flow, which prevents the formation of unstable ice cliffs.</answer>

<answer>Scientists may miss critical ice collapse events and have inaccurate models of ice behavior due to insufficient observations.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The study suggests the ice cliff collapse scenario is less likely than previously thought, challenging the assumption of higher risk.</answer>
