<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The sound editor's experience with iZotope software, which made sound editing more efficient but still required human expertise, relates to current AI concerns among IATSE members as new AI programs can largely achieve what sound editors previously accomplished with minimal training, raising fears of job displacement.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Writers won a prohibition on requiring writers to use AI programs like ChatGPT for scripts or outlines, along with strict rules on minimum staffing and duration, which IATSE members hoped for but did not receive in their contract.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The contract's language on AI usage differs in that the writers' union prohibits requiring writers to use AI for scripts or outlines, while the IATSE contract allows studios to require employees to use any AI system.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The Animation Guild's membership composition, which includes not just artists and character designers but also writers and directors, potentially increases their vulnerability to AI threats as these roles can be more easily automated or outsourced.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The sound editor's description of AI's impact differs from the historical effect of iZotope software in that AI can largely achieve sound editing tasks with minimal training, whereas iZotope still required the sound editor's refined ear for efficiency and quality.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Christopher Glass's critique of the contract language relates to the writers' AI provisions by highlighting that the IATSE contract requires employees to use AI if studios choose, unlike the writers' contract which prohibits requiring AI use for scripts or outlines.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The contract's approach to AI usage requirements differs from prohibitions sought by some members in that it allows studios to require employees to use AI systems, whereas members sought prohibitions similar to those won by writers.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>IATSE leadership cited the fact that the IATSE contract covers dozens of different crafts, making sweeping AI prohibitions less practical compared to the writers' contract, which covers a more specific group.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
