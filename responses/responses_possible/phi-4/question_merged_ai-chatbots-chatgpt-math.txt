<question_number>1</question_number>  
<answer>The primary reason A.I. chatbots struggle with mathematical accuracy is that they were never designed to do math; they are fine-tuned for determining probabilities, not rules-based calculations.</answer>  

<question_number>2</question_number>  
<answer>The paradoxical relationship is that while A.I. chatbots excel when they have consumed vast quantities of relevant training data, their mathematical capabilities remain inconsistent and often inaccurate.</answer>  

<question_number>3</question_number>  
<answer>The article illustrates the difference by showing that traditional computing systems are programmed with rigid rules and excel at structured tasks, whereas A.I. chatbots learn by analyzing data and predict language, which is less effective for math word problems requiring multiple steps.</answer>  

<question_number>4</question_number>  
<answer>The evolution of A.I. technology reflects a shift from computing being defined as "math on steroids" to a focus on language and probability, indicating a break from the past where computing was primarily about fast, accurate calculations.</answer>  

<question_number>5</question_number>  
<answer>The article challenges the traditional definition by showing that A.I. chatbots, despite being advanced, struggle with math, which has long been a core strength of computing, thus redefining computing's focus from math to language and probability.</answer>  

<question_number>6</question_number>  
<answer>The occasional mathematical errors made by AI chatbots have become a teaching opportunity, prompting students to critically evaluate and compare their solutions with the chatbot's, thereby sharpening their critical thinking skills.</answer>  

<question_number>7</question_number>  
<answer>The article's portrayal reflects a shift in perceived strengths by highlighting that A.I. systems are more adept at language tasks than mathematical ones, challenging the notion that A.I. is universally superior in all computational tasks.</answer>  

<question_number>8</question_number>  
<answer>The discussion contributes to the debate by showing that while large language models have made progress, their limitations in math highlight the need for a broader approach, such as "world modeling," to achieve artificial general intelligence.</answer>  

<question_number>9</question_number>  
<answer>The portrayal challenges the traditional distinction by showing that A.I. systems, despite being advanced, are more aligned with liberal arts due to their language proficiency, rather than STEM, which requires precise mathematical reasoning.</answer>  

<question_number>10</question_number>  
<answer>David Ferrucci's perspective provides insight that while A.I.'s language skills are impressive, its accuracy in critical applications like business decision-making requires a combination of large language models and more rules-based software.</answer>
