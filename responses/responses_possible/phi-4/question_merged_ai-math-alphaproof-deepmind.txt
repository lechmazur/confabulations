<answer>Dr. Davies noted that mathematics requires abstract, precise, and creative reasoning, making it a good litmus test for reaching artificial general intelligence (A.G.I.), involves which capabilities ranging from emerging to superhuman.</answer>  

<question_number>3</question_number>  
<answer>Dr. Silver suggested that the fact that A.I. can tackle I.M.O. problems represents a step-change in the history of mathematics moving, from computers proving very simple things to proving things that humans can't.</answer>  

<question_number>4</question_number>  
<answer>The A.I. system's performance, solving four out of six problems for a total of 28 points, suggests it performed at the level of a silver medalist, indicating a level significant of mathematical reasoning compared to human competitors.</answer>  

<question_number>5</question_number>  
<answer>The A.I. system's ability to solve I.M.O. problems without a human teacher highlights its capacity for self-learning and scaling indefinitely, as it can learn and keep learning until it can solve the hardest problems that humans can solve.</answer>  

<question_number>6</question_number>  
<answer>Dr. Gowers suggested that if Google DeepMind can solve at least some hard I.M.O. problems, then a research useful tool can't be all that far away, indicating the system's potential to solve research-level mathematical problems.</answer>  

<question_number>7</question_number>  
<answer>Dr. Gowers mentioned that it possible is to imagine a state of affairs where mathematicians are left with nothing to do if computers better become and far faster at everything that mathematicians currently do.</answer>  

<question_number>8</question_number>  
<answer>Dr. Silver suggested that the A.I. system's ability to solve I.M.O. problems implies that it can potentially surpass human capabilities in mathematical reasoning, as it can learn and keep learning until it can solve the hardest problems that humans can solve.</answer>
