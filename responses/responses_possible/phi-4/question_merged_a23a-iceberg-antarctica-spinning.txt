<question_number>1</question_number>  
<answer>The formation of a stagnant cylinder of fluids above the seamount, which rotates the water counterclockwise around the bump, is crucial in preventing A23a from drifting into warmer waters.</answer>  

<question_number>2</question_number>  
<answer>The seamount, or underwater mountain, is causing the iceberg to rotate at a rate that would complete a full revolution in about 24 days.</answer>  

<question_number>3</question_number>  
<answer>Melting icebergs that originate from floating ice shelves like A23a do not significantly contribute to global sea level rise, unlike the melting of land-based Antarctic glaciers.</answer>  

<question_number>4</question_number>  
<answer>The calving of A23 from the Filchner Ice Shelf in 1986, which led to the creation of A23a, is the historical event that indirectly led to the iceberg now caught in a geophysical phenomenon near the South Orkney Islands.</answer>  

<question_number>5</question_number>  
<answer>A robotic float mentioned in a 2015 study was trapped in a Taylor column for four years, similar to the potential future of A23a being trapped in a Taylor column.</answer>  

<question_number>6</question_number>  
<answer>A23a got caught in a Taylor column over an underwater mountain approximately 100 kilometers across.</answer>  

<question_number>7</question_number>  
<answer>A robotic float got trapped in a Taylor column near A23a's current location for four years.</answer>  

<question_number>8</question_number>  
<answer>The approximate diameter of the underwater mountain that A23a is stuck over is about 100 kilometers (about 62 miles).</answer>  

<question_number>9</question_number>  
<answer>Christopher A. Shuman surmised that A23a would eventually go the way of other large icebergs and melt near the island of South Georgia in the South Atlantic.</answer>  

<question_number>10</question_number>  
<answer>The Antarctic Circumpolar Current is the current that large icebergs typically get sucked into after leaving Antarctic waters.</answer>
