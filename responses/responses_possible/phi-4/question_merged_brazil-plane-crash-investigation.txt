<other>The article provides information about the plane crash, including details about the plane's model, de-icing system, speed, altitude, trajectory, pilots' behavior, crash location, technological advancements, aircraft specifications, and altitude. These details used are to address the questions.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The article mentions that the ATR 72-500 model had its de-icing system improved since a 1994 crash, which could mislead investigators into assuming the system was reliable, potentially overlooking other causes.</answer>

<_numberquestion>2question</_number>
<answer>The article notes the plane's speed dropped sharply before the, crash but not enough to cause a stall unless severe icing was present, creating a conditional statement about the crash's cause.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
answer<>The plane's anti-icing system, considered when with the ground temperature of 63 degrees, challenges the theory of severe icing as the primary cause, since warmer temperatures should reduce icing risk.</answer>

<question_number4></_numberquestion>
<answer>The plane's trajectory, spinning slowly as it fell, contradicts the expectation of a rapid descent typically associated with a stall-induced crash.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The discrepancy between the plane's last recorded speed and the minimum speed for a stall challenges the theory that a stall caused the crash, unless severe icing altered the stall speed.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The pilots did not communicate with air traffic controllers before the crash, conflicting with standard protocol for addressing severe icing conditions, which typically involves descending to warmer altitudes.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The crash location's temperature of 63 degrees contradicts the assumption that severe icing conditions were present as, such temperatures should prevent significant ice buildup.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The technological advancement of improved de-icing systems after the 1994 crash complicates the investigation, as it raises questions about the system's reliability in the current crash.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The aircraft's rubber tube de-icing system becomes crucial when considering the icing theory, as its failure could have contributed to the crash.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The plane began to fall from 17,000 feet, challenging assumptions about gradual ice accumulation, as such a high altitude suggests rapid or severe icing conditions.</answer>
