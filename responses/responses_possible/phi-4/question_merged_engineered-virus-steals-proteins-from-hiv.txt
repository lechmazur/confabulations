<question_number>1</question_number>  
<answer>Just one shot of TIPs may keep H.I.V. at low levels -- permanently, which is more feasible than ensuring people keep up with twice-yearly shots of lenacapavir.</answer>  

<question_number>2</question_number>  
<answer>It might make it harder for people to transmit H.I.V. to others.</answer>  

<question_number>3</question_number>  
<answer>TIPs inserts themselves into the DNA of a patient's immune cells, becoming a permanent part of their bodies, which raises consent issues for others who might be infected with them.</answer>  

<question_number>4</question_number>  
<answer>TIPs invade a cell and steal essential proteins from the virus, preventing H.I.V. from multiplying, unlike protease inhibitors that prevent a protein from activating H.I.V.</answer>  

<question_number>5</question_number>  
<answer>The most significant challenge is the potential for unexpected side effects since TIPs become a permanent part of the patient's body.</answer>  

<question_number>6</question_number>  
<answer>TIPs can replicate when H.I.V. particles are added to a TIP-infected cell, leading to the release of three times more TIPs than H.I.V. viruses.</answer>  

<question_number>7</question_number>  
<answer>The most significant risk is that if TIPs have unexpected side effects, it may not be possible to remove them from the patient's body.</answer>  

<question_number>8</question_number>  
<answer>Dr. Leeks said that other viruses might also be vulnerable to the same strategy, making it a universal approach to developing antivirals.</answer>  

<question_number>9</question_number>  
<answer>People with TIPs can spread them to others, complicating consent since doctors cannot receive consent from anyone else who is infected with them.</answer>
