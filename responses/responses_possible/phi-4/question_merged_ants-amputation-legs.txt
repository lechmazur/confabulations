<question_number>1</question_number>  
<answer>Florida carpenter ants perform amputations only on thigh injuries because the flow of hemolymph is reduced when the thigh is injured, making it more difficult for bacteria to move from the wound into the body, thus lowering the chance of infection.</answer>  

<question_number>2</question_number>  
<answer>The presence of several muscles in the thighs that keep hemolymph flowing contributes to the success of thigh amputations in preventing infection.</answer>  

<question_number>3</question_number>  
<answer>The counterintuitive relationship is that amputations are more successful when the wound is closer to the body (thigh) rather than further away (lower legs).</answer>  

<question_number>4</question_number>  
<answer>The amputation behavior provides an evolutionary advantage by saving lives and curbing the spread of pathogens, which reduces the need for the colony to produce 10 to 20 percent more ants to compensate for injured ants.</answer>  

<question_number>5</question_number>  
<answer>The time window for successful amputation is narrow and the chance of success is slim for lower leg injuries, whereas thigh injuries allow for a quick amputation with a very low chance of infection.</answer>  

<question_number>6</question_number>  
<answer>The presence of multiple muscles in ant thighs helps maintain hemolymph flow, reducing bacterial movement from the wound into the body, thus making amputation an effective infection prevention method.</answer>  

<question_number>7</question_number>  
<answer>Bacterial movement is more easily prevented when the wound is closer to the body (thigh), as the reduced hemolymph flow limits bacterial penetration into the body.</answer>  

<question_number>8</question_number>  
<answer>The injured ant presents its injured leg and calmly sits while another ant gnaws it off, then presents the newly amputated wound for cleaning.</answer>  

<question_number>9</question_number>  
<answer>The presence of hemolymph-pumping muscles in the thighs correlates with a higher success rate of amputations, as these muscles help reduce bacterial movement from the wound.</answer>  

<question_number>10</question_number>  
<answer>The high survival rate of amputee ants (90 percent) allows the colony to save an enormous amount of energy by not needing to produce additional ants to replace those lost to injury.</answer>
