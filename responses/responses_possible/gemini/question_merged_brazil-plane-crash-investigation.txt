<answer>It suggests that icing might be less likely as a cause, given the improvements made to the de-icing system since the 1994 crash.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The plane's speed didn't drop low enough to cause a stall unless the icing was extremely severe, creating a scenario where icing is only a plausible cause if it was exceptionally severe.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The crash location's temperature of 63 degrees, warm enough to melt ice, challenges the idea that icing could have been severe enough to cause the crash.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The plane fell almost directly on its belly, while stall-induced crashes typically involve spinning or a more nose-down descent.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The plane's speed, while dropping, didn't fall below the typical stall speed, suggesting that icing, if present, would have had to be severe enough to cause a stall at a higher-than-usual speed.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The pilots didn't communicate with air traffic controllers before the crash, which contradicts the standard procedure of alerting controllers before descending to a lower altitude to address icing.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The crash location's ground temperature of 63 degrees contradicts the expert's suggestion that icing could have been a factor, as this temperature is warm enough to melt ice.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The improved de-icing system, while intended to prevent icing issues, makes it harder to determine if the system itself malfunctioned or if other factors contributed to the crash.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The plane's size (89 feet) becomes crucial because smaller aircraft are generally more susceptible to the effects of icing.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The plane's fall from 17,000 feet, a relatively high altitude, challenges the idea of gradual ice accumulation, as severe icing is less common at such altitudes.</answer>
