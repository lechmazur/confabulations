<answer>Wildlife, particularly wild birds, could act as vectors, transporting the virus between different farms and contributing to its wider dissemination.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that the virus might initially infect the upper respiratory tract before migrating to the mammary glands, challenging the assumption that milk is the primary site of infection and replication.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that focusing solely on milk as the primary mode of transmission might overlook the potential for spread through respiratory droplets and other bodily fluids, particularly from asymptomatic animals.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It highlights that even with strict controls on cow and equipment movement, the virus can still spread through alternative routes, such as wildlife vectors, making containment more challenging.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that wild birds could play a role in spreading the virus across long distances, potentially introducing it to new farms or wildlife populations.</answer>

<answer>Wild blackbirds</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows are more likely to have the virus in their noses and urine than in their milk.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>It demonstrates that the virus can spread beyond cows to other species, creating a more complex transmission network that extends beyond farm boundaries and requires broader control measures.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus present in their noses than cows exhibiting obvious symptoms of illness.</answer>
