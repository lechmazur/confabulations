<answer>The article highlights the experiences of attendees like Duane Zehring, who finds that Blobfest "takes you back to your childhood," and Mark Hunter, who feels a connection to the Colonial Theater from his youth. These stories illustrate how the festival taps into personal nostalgia. The article also mentions the local pride associated with the film, particularly because many Phoenixville residents have family members who were extras.

The "run out" reenactment, where attendees mimic the panicked escape of moviegoers from the Colonial Theater, is a prime example. The participation of thousands in this event, along with the presence of original extras like Catherine Brodecki, demonstrates the festival's success in keeping the film's memory alive.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The festival is 25 years old, while the gap between the film's release (1958) and its first celebration (2000) is 42 years. The festival is younger than the time it took for the film to have its first celebration.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The article mentions that Mark Hunter and his wife were unable to get tickets for the "run out," indicating the event's high demand. This contrasts with the film's initial reception, where it was met with lukewarm reviews and likely didn't experience sold-out screenings.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The film was released in 1958. The festival celebrated its 25th anniversary, meaning it began in 1958 + 25 = 1983. Attendee Duane Zehring is 65 years old, meaning he was born in 2023 - 65 = 1958. Therefore, the film's release year, the festival's founding year, and Zehring's birth year all coincide.</answer>
