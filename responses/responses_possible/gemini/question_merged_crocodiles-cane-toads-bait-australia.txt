<answer>The lithium chlorine solution induced nausea in the crocodiles, leading them to associate the unpleasant sensation with eating toads. This conditioned taste aversion caused them to avoid consuming toads, thus reducing their exposure to the deadly toxins and lowering mortality rates.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>By offering both toad carcasses and chicken necks, the researchers could determine if the crocodiles were simply losing their appetite or specifically avoiding the toads. The crocodiles' continued consumption of chicken necks demonstrated that the taste aversion was specific to the tainted toads.</answer>

<answer>The article highlights that different predators have different hunting styles, necessitating tailored aversion strategies. For instance, yellow-spotted monitors, which actively hunt live prey, required exposure to live, nonlethal "trainer toads" to develop an aversion, while the use of sausages proved ineffective.</answer>

<answer>The article quotes Dr. Johnson, who states that maintaining the conditioned taste aversion in crocodile populations will require ongoing efforts, as it is not a one-time solution. The effectiveness of the aversion may diminish over time, requiring repeated interventions.</answer>

<answer>The Grinch's aversion to further indulgence after feeling sick mirrors the crocodiles' learned aversion to consuming cane toads after experiencing nausea induced by the lithium chloride.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The use of an un-baited control river allowed the researchers to compare the mortality rates of crocodiles exposed to the tainted toad bait with those that were not. This comparison helped isolate the impact of the baiting strategy on crocodile survival rates.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>While the crocodiles initially consumed the toad carcasses readily, their consumption decreased over time as they learned to associate the toads with nausea. This initial enthusiasm did not reflect a long-term acceptance of toads as a food source.</answer>
