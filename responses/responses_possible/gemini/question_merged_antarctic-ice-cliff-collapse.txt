<answer>The Thwaites Glacier, being one of the fastest receding and least stable in Antarctica, serves as a representative case study for understanding the potential for ice cliff collapse and its broader implications for the West Antarctic ice sheet.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The ice shelf acts as a buttress, and its disappearance could expose taller ice cliffs, potentially leading to instability and collapse.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>While the study focuses on Thwaites, it provides insights into the mechanics of ice cliff collapse that could be applicable to other glaciers with similar characteristics.</answer>

<answer>Inaccurate projections of sea-level rise and inadequate preparation time for coastal communities.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that runaway ice cliff collapse, while still a concern, might be less likely than previously thought.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The glacier's ice flowed more quickly out to sea, preventing the cliffs from becoming tall enough to trigger a runaway breakdown.</answer>

<answer>Observations of how ice behaves when it fractures</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Continued high levels of emissions</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>As the glacier's ice flows more quickly to the sea, it prevents the cliffs at the end of the glacier from becoming tall enough to trigger a runaway breakdown.</answer>
