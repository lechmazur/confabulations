<answer>Florida carpenter ants may have evolved to perform amputations only on thigh injuries because thigh injuries allow for reduced hemolymph flow, which hinders bacterial movement and makes amputation a more effective treatment.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The presence of numerous muscles in their thighs that help circulate hemolymph.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Counterintuitively, wounds closer to the body (thigh) have a higher amputation success rate than wounds further away (lower leg).</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It saves the colony energy by increasing the survival rate of injured ants, reducing the need to replace them.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The time window for successful amputation is much narrower for lower leg injuries compared to thigh injuries.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The muscles in ant thighs help maintain hemolymph flow, which is crucial for preventing infection after amputation.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Faster bacterial movement, as seen in lower leg injuries, reduces amputation effectiveness, while slower movement, as in thigh injuries, increases it.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The injured ant presents its injured leg and remains still while another ant amputates it, then presents the wound for cleaning.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Amputations are more successful closer to the location of hemolymph-pumping muscles, such as those found in ant thighs.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>A higher survival rate of amputee ants means the colony expends less energy on replacing lost workers, increasing overall energy efficiency.</answer>
