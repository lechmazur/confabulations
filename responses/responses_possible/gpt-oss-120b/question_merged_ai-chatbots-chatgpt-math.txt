<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>They were never designed for math; they’re fine‑tuned for probability prediction rather than rule‑based calculation.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Despite massive exposure to math textbooks and test data, they still perform poorly on math tasks.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Traditional computers follow explicit step‑by‑step rules; AI chatbots generate language by predicting words, so educational tools like Khanmigo route math problems to a calculator program while the chatbot handles the dialogue.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The focus has shifted from rule‑based “math on steroids” computing to neural‑network language prediction that isn’t centered on mathematical computation.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>AI’s weak math ability shows computing is no longer defined solely by high‑speed calculation.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Teachers use chatbot mistakes as discussion points, comparing answers to teach critical thinking.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>AI is now portrayed as strong in language (liberal arts) and weak in math, reversing traditional expectations.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Math shortcomings fuel the debate between scaling large language models versus pursuing broader “world‑modeling” approaches.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>AI’s emphasis on language over math blurs the line between STEM and liberal‑arts domains.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Ferrucci notes AI’s language prowess is impressive, but its lack of accuracy means critical systems still need rules‑based software for precision.</answer>
