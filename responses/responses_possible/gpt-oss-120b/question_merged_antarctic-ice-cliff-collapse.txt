<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Shows that loss of the ice shelf leads to faster flow that limits cliff height, suggesting West Antarctica may be less prone to catastrophic cliff collapse</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Demonstrates that removing the ice shelf causes faster glacier flow, preventing cliffs from becoming tall enough to trigger runaway collapse</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Indicates that similar rapid flow after shelf loss could limit cliff height elsewhere, implying reduced collapse risk in other Antarctic regions</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Leads to missed rapid collapse events and uncertain sea‑level projections</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Challenges the idea that ice cliffs will inevitably trigger runaway collapse, showing faster flow may avert it</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Accelerated glacier flow after ice‑shelf removal prevented cliffs from growing tall enough for runaway breakdown</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Observations of how ice behaves when it fractures</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Assumes emissions of heat‑trapping gases continue to rise to extremely high levels</answer>

<answer>Faster glacier flow reduces ice‑cliff height, lowering the risk of runaway collapse</answer>
