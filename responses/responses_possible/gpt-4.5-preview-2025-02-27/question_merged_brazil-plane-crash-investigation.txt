<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>If icing was severe enough, the plane could stall at a higher speed than normal, making the observed speed drop significant only under extreme icing conditions.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The anti-icing system's ability to break up ice combined with the relatively warm temperature (63 degrees) at the crash location challenges the icing theory.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The plane fell spinning slowly and crashed almost directly on its belly.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The plane's last recorded speed was not low enough to cause a stall under normal conditions, suggesting icing would have to be extremely severe to cause a stall at that speed.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The pilots did not communicate any emergency or icing conditions to air traffic controllers.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The temperature at the crash location was around 63 degrees, contradicting the assumption of severe icing conditions.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Improvements to the aircraft's de-icing system after the 1994 crash complicate understanding why icing could still be a factor.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The plane's sensitivity to ice becomes crucial when considering the icing theory.</answer>
