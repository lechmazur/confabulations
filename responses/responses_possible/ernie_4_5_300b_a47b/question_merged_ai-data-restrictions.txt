<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Widespread data restrictions may pose a threat to smaller AI companies and academic researchers who rely on public data sets and can't afford to license data directly from publishers.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The primary impact is on later-arriving actors, who are typically either smaller start-ups or researchers, rather than major tech companies that already have all of the data.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The web will start shutting its doors to them.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The primary impact is on later-arriving actors, who are typically either smaller start-ups or researchers, rather than retroactively revoking permission for major tech companies that already have the data.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The primary impact of changing data licenses is on smaller start-ups or researchers who arrive later, rather than on major tech companies that already have extensive data.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>We're seeing blowback from data creators after the text, images, and videos they've shared online are used to develop commercial systems that sometimes directly threaten their livelihoods.</answer>
