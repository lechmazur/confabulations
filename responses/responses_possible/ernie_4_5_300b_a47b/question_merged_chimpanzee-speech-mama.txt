<other>First, I will extract relevant information from the article to answer each question. I will make sure to only use facts from the text and not any external knowledge.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that the primate vocal tract was already capable of producing speech-like sounds, challenging the previous assumption that vocal anatomy was the main barrier to ape speech.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that the sounds Johnny and Renata made could simply be standard chimpanzee pant-grunts combined, rather than intentional speech.</answer>

<answer>It suggests that the primate vocal tract was already capable of producing speech-like sounds, challenging the previous assumption that vocal anatomy was the main barrier to ape speech.</answer>

<answer>Philip Lieberman</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The analysis shows that their vocalizations had a unique acoustic profile resembling human speech, which is different from what would be expected if they were just combining pant-grunts.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Viki's utterances were simple and lacked vowels, while Johnny's and Renata's included both consonants and vowels, reflecting a more advanced analysis in later studies.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The "speech ready" vocal tract suggests that the anatomical capability for speech was present, but the ability to combine consonants and vowels may depend more on brain capabilities.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that chimpanzees may also have some capacity to learn and produce sounds similar to human words, challenging the notion of human uniqueness in this ability.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that apes may have some of the necessary brain capabilities for speech, as their vocalizations resemble human speech in structure.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that chimpanzees may have some of the neural capabilities needed to send coordinated commands to the jaw and throat, similar to humans.</answer>
