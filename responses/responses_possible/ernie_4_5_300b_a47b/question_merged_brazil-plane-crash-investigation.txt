<other>First, I will review the article to extract relevant details about the plane crash, focusing on the plane's model, de-icing system, speed, altitude, pilots' behavior, crash location, and expert statements. I will then use these details to answer each question directly, ensuring that each response is based solely on the information provided in the article.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The article notes that the manufacturer improved the de-icing system since the 1994 crash, which could mislead readers into assuming the system was effective, despite the possibility of failure or severe icing conditions.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The article states the plane was traveling roughly 325 miles per hour and its speed dropped sharply before the crash, but the speed did not drop far enough to cause a stall unless icing was extremely severe, creating a conditional link between icing severity and stall likelihood.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The crash location's ground temperature was around 63 degrees, which challenges the icing theory because warmer temperatures at lower altitudes should melt ice, making severe icing less likely.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The plane was described as spinning slowly as it plummeted before crashing almost directly on its belly, which contradicts the standard expectation of a nose-down dive in a stall-induced crash.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The plane's last recorded speed did not drop far enough to cause a stall unless icing was extremely severe, challenging the primary theory that icing alone caused the stall.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The pilots did not communicate with air traffic controllers just before the crash, which conflicts with standard protocol for addressing severe icing conditions, as they should have declared an emergency or requested a descent.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The crash location's ground temperature was around 63 degrees, contradicting the assumption that severe icing could occur in such warm conditions.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The improved de-icing system implemented after the 1994 incident paradoxically complicates the investigation because it raises questions about whether the system was activated, failed, or if icing was severe enough to override the improvements.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The plane's anti-icing system consisted of rubber tubes on the wings that are supposed to inflate and deflate to break up ice, which becomes crucial when considering the icing theory, as their failure could contribute to severe icing.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The plane began to fall from 17,000 feet, which challenges assumptions about gradual ice accumulation because such a high altitude could allow for rapid ice buildup, but the lack of communication and other factors complicate this assumption.</answer>
