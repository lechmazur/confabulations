<other>First, I will review the article to identify key points related to each question. The article emphasizes that AI chatbots struggle with math because they were not designed for it, focusing instead on language tasks. It also discusses how their mathematical performance is improving but remains inconsistent, and how this relates to their training data and traditional computing systems. I will use these insights to answer each question directly.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>They were never designed to do math.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The chatbots excel when they have consumed vast quantities of relevant training data, but this does not necessarily translate to mathematical accuracy.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Traditional computing systems follow step-by-step rules for calculations, while AI chatbots rely on analyzing vast amounts of data and predicting the next word or phrase, which can lead to errors in math.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The shift is from computing being defined as "math on steroids" to AI focusing on language and probability rather than rules-based calculations.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>AI chatbots, despite being advanced, often struggle with math, which contradicts the traditional view of computers as tireless, fast, and accurate calculating machines.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The errors can be a focal point of discussion, teaching students to critically evaluate answers and compare them to the chatbot's responses.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>AI systems are perceived as more adept at language tasks rather than being numbers whizzes, marking a break from traditional computing strengths.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>It highlights the debate between focusing on large language models versus adopting a broader approach that includes logic and common sense reasoning.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>AI is portrayed as more of a liberal arts major than a numbers whiz, challenging the traditional STEM focus on math and science.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>He finds AI impressive mainly for its language skills, not for its accuracy, and emphasizes the need for rules-based software for critical applications.</answer>
