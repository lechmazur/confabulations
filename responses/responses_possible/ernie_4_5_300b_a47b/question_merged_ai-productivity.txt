<other>First, I will identify key information from the article related to each question. For question 1, I note that Daron Acemoglu's paper is about the productivity paradox and AI's impact. The productivity paradox is mentioned as a phenomenon where economic growth is sluggish despite technological innovations. For question 2, I consider the implications of Acemoglu's prediction on a company like Nvidia, which is optimistic about AI's potential. For question 3, I look at Lynda Gratton's optimism and Acemoglu's perspective on AI's productivity impact. For question 4, I examine Sullivan & Cromwell's approach to evaluating student applicants and how it relates to productivity goals. For question 5, I compare concerns about Joe Biden's age with David Novak's views on CEO performance. For question 6, I identify Peter Crist's description of a successful CEO and its relation to the productivity paradox. For question 7, I analyze Tessa West's observation about employee behavior and Acemoglu's AI productivity estimates. For question 8, I consider factors that justify Warren Buffett's continued leadership and challenge Acemoglu's projections. For question 9, I apply Amy Edmondson's criteria for CEO retirement to AI companies and Sam Altman's predictions. For question 10, I think about Lauren Hirsch's contribution and its potential influence on AI development strategies.</other>
