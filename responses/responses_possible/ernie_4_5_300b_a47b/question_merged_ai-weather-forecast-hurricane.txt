<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The A.I. approach relies on learning cause-and-effect relationships from historical data, enabling rapid predictions in seconds, while traditional methods use current observations and complex calculations, taking hours.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>GraphCast learned directly from four decades of global weather observations, allowing it to identify subtle patterns and predict the hurricane's path accurately without relying on real-time data.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Paul G. Allen established the Allen Institute for A.I., where Dr. Bretherton, a team leader, noted the European center's interest in A.I., suggesting Allen's involvement supports broader A.I. adoption, including GraphCast.</answer>
