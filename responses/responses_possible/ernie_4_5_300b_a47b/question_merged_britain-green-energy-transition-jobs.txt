<other>First, I will review the article to extract relevant information for each question. The article discusses Labour Party proposals for renewable energy, job creation, cost implications, and supply chain challenges. I will answer each question based on the specific details provided.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The paradox is that Labour's proposals aim to create jobs in renewable energy but could lead to job losses in the oil and gas industry, which currently employs more people.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The potential contradiction is that building renewable energy infrastructure could push up costs, which might then be passed on to consumers, undermining the promise of lower bills.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Labour forecasts creating 650,000 jobs, but only 34,000 jobs are currently linked to renewables, while around 200,000 are linked to oil and gas.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The potential challenge is that the pace of building new renewable projects needs to be much faster to compensate for expected job losses in the oil industry.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Labour's focus on renewable energy infrastructure conflicts with the UK's current economic focus on sectors like finance and its lack of a supply chain for wind or solar development.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The proposals could lead to higher electric bills for consumers due to increased costs of building renewable energy infrastructure.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The UK lacks almost any of the supply chain for developing wind or solar, which could hinder the plan for renewable energy infrastructure.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Labour's approach could cost more jobs in the oil and gas sector than the ones created in renewable energy, as the latter currently employs far fewer people.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Higher material and labor costs could increase the costs of developing renewable energy projects, potentially making Labour's goals more expensive to achieve.</answer>
