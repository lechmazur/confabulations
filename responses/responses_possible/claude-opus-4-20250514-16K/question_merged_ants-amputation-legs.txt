<answer>Thigh injuries reduce hemolymph flow due to many muscles in the thighs, making it harder for bacteria to move from the wound into the body, giving time for successful amputation, while lower leg injuries allow bacteria to penetrate quickly with a narrow time window for success</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Many muscles in the thighs that keep hemolymph flowing</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>When the wound is further away from the body the amputations don't work, but when it's closer to the body, they do work</answer>

<answer>Colonies save an enormous amount of energy by not needing to produce 10-20% more ants to compensate for injured ants that would otherwise be lost</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Lower leg injuries have a narrow time window for successful amputation because bacteria can penetrate very quickly, while thigh injuries allow quick amputation with very low chance of infection</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>When thigh injury occurs, the flow of hemolymph is reduced, making it more difficult for bacteria to move from the wound into the body</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>In thigh injuries, reduced hemolymph flow makes it difficult for bacteria to move from wound to body; in lower leg injuries, bacteria can penetrate the body very quickly</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The ant presents its injured leg and calmly sits there while another ant gnaws it off, then presents the newly amputated wound and the other ant finishes by cleaning it</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Thighs with many hemolymph-pumping muscles have 90% amputation survival rate, while lower legs have only 20% survival rate</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The 90% survival rate of amputees saves colonies from needing to produce 10-20% more ants to compensate for losses, saving an enormous amount of energy on the colony level</answer>
