Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. 

1. **Primary reason studios are hesitant to produce more female-led films?** The article mentions that studios think "Barbie" is a one-off success due to the specific talents of Gerwig and Robbie. They don't see it as a model for broader change.# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. What is a Data Structure?

A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Different data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. The choice of data structure can affect the performance and efficiency of an algorithm.

## 1.2. Why Study Data Structures?

Understanding data structures is crucial for solving complex problems efficiently. They help in:

- Managing large datasets
- Performing efficient searches and sorts
- Handling multiple requests from users
- Optimizing memory usage
- Implementing algorithms effectively

## 1.3. Common Data Structures

Some common data structures include:

- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Trees**
- **Graphs**
- **Hash Tables**
- **Heaps**

Each of these has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the use case.

## 1.4. Basic Terminology

- **Data**: Values or set of values.
- **Data Item**: A single unit of value.
- **Group Items**: Data items divided into sub-items.
- **Elementary Items**: Data items that cannot be divided.
- **Entity**: An object with attributes.
- **Field**: A single attribute of an entity.
- **Record**: A collection of fields.
- **File**: A collection of records.

## 1.5. Operations on Data Structures

Common operations include:

- **Traversal**: Accessing each data item exactly once.
- **Search**: Finding the location of a data item.
- **Insertion**: Adding a new data item.
- **Deletion**: Removing a data item.
- **Sorting**: Arranging data items in a specific order.
- **Merging**: Combining two data structures into one.

## 1.6. Algorithm Complexity

The efficiency of an algorithm is measured in terms of time and space complexity.

- **Time Complexity**: Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run.
- **Space Complexity**: Amount of memory used by an algorithm.

These are often expressed using Big O notation, which describes the upper bound of complexity in the worst-case scenario.

## 1.7. Abstract Data Types (ADTs)

An ADT is a mathematical model for data types. It defines the type solely by the operations that can be performed on it and the mathematical constraints of these operations. Examples include:

- **List**
- **Stack**
- **Queue**
- **Tree**
- **Graph**

ADTs are defined by their behavior from the user's perspective, independent of their implementation.

## 1.8. Summary

This chapter introduced the fundamental concepts of data structures, their importance, common types, basic operations, and the concept of algorithm complexity. Understanding these basics is essential for delving deeper into more complex data structures and algorithms.
