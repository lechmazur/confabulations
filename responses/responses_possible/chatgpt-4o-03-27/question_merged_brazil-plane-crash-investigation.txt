<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The mention of improved de-icing systems since a 1994 crash may mislead by implying icing should not have caused the crash, despite possible system failure or extreme conditions.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The plane was traveling at 325 mph before a sharp speed drop, which should not cause a stall unless icing was extremely severe, suggesting a stall only if multiple conditions were met.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The ground temperature of 63 degrees in Brazil challenges the icing theory, as warmer air at lower altitudes should have melted any ice.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The plane spun slowly and crashed almost directly on its belly, which is not typical of a high-speed, nose-down stall crash.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The speed did not drop far enough to cause a stall unless icing was extremely severe, challenging the idea that icing alone caused the crash.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The pilots did not communicate with air traffic controllers or declare an emergency before the crash, contrary to standard protocol during severe icing.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The crash occurred in Brazil, not Antarctica, contradicting the assumption that icing would be extreme enough to cause a crash without pilot mitigation.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Improvements to the de-icing system after the 1994 crash complicate the investigation by suggesting the system should have prevented icing-related failure.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The ATR 72-500's rubber tube de-icing system becomes crucial in evaluating whether it was activated or failed during the icing conditions.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The plane fell from 17,000 feet, a high altitude where ice could accumulate quickly, challenging assumptions that ice builds up gradually.</answer>
