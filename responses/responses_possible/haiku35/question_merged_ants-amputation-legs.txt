<other>I will carefully analyze the article to answer each question based strictly on the text's information.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Thigh injuries reduce hemolymph flow, making it more difficult for bacteria to move into the body, thus creating a favorable condition for successful infection prevention through amputation</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Multiple muscles in thighs that keep hemolymph flowing</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Wounds closer to the body have higher amputation survival rates (90%) compared to wounds further from the body (20%)</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Saves energy by rescuing injured ants instead of producing 10-20% more ants to compensate for losses</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Lower leg injuries have a narrow time window with slim chances of successful amputation, while thigh injuries allow more time for effective amputation</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Multiple thigh muscles help maintain hemolymph flow, which reduces bacterial movement and increases amputation success</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Bacterial movement is faster and more penetrating in lower leg injuries, making amputation less effective</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The injured ant presents its injured leg and sits calmly while another ant gnaws it off, then presents the newly amputated wound for cleaning</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Muscles closer to the body that pump hemolymph correlate with higher amputation survival rates</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Rescuing injured ants through amputation allows colonies to save energy by not needing to produce additional replacement ants</answer>
