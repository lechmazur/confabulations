<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The formations revealed immense terraces with rounded, swirling edges and teardrop-shaped divots hundreds of feet across, which were sculpted by turbulent currents and described as "enigmatic" by the scientists</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Only about half of Ran's 14 undersea missions were completely successful, with missions lasting between 4-5 hours and up to 28 hours, due to the lack of GPS and reliance on motion sensors for navigation</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The researchers speculate that a curious seal might have caused Ran to become disoriented underwater, potentially leading to its loss after one of its dives</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The findings showed that the bottom of the ice shelf was far more complex than expected, with structures persisting despite melting, contrary to previous assumptions that melting would smooth out the topography</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Too much sea ice was in the way, making the Thwaites Glacier inaccessible during the researchers' expedition</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Ran, a bright orange underwater robot over 20 feet long</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The newly discovered topography revealed complex structures like terraces and divots, challenging the previous assumption that melting would create a smooth, featureless underwater surface</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Thwaites Glacier, whose total collapse could increase global sea levels by about two feet over several centuries</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The complex topography suggests that further study is needed to understand how these features affect overall melting in response to ocean warming</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The risk of finding a flat and featureless bottom of the ice shelf, which would have been a disappointment to the researchers</answer>
