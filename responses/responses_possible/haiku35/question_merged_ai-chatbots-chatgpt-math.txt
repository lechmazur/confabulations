<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>A.I. chatbots were never designed to do math, and they are fine-tuned for determining probabilities rather than performing rules-based calculations</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>A.I. chatbots excel when they have consumed vast quantities of relevant training data like textbooks and tests, which means they perform well on math problems very similar to ones they have previously analyzed</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Khan Academy's Khanmigo now sends numerical problems to a calculator program instead of having the A.I. solve them directly, demonstrating a workaround for the A.I.'s mathematical limitations</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The article highlights a significant shift from traditional computing as "math on steroids" to A.I. systems that are more language-oriented and less precise in mathematical calculations</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>A.I. chatbots challenge the traditional computing definition by being more like "liberal arts majors" than numerical experts, struggling with step-by-step mathematical reasoning</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Math teachers can use A.I. chatbot errors as a teaching opportunity to encourage students to critically analyze answers and develop critical thinking skills</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The article portrays AI's mathematical capabilities as inconsistent and imperfect, shifting the perception of AI from infallible calculators to more nuanced, language-based systems</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The article reflects a debate between those who believe neural networks are the path to progress and skeptics like Yann LeCun who argue for broader approaches like "world modeling"</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests AI's mathematical struggles challenge traditional STEM distinctions by presenting an AI system more adept at language and probabilistic reasoning than precise calculations</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Ferrucci views AI's language skills as impressive but emphasizes that for critical systems, "painful precision" requires more structured, rules-based software</answer>
