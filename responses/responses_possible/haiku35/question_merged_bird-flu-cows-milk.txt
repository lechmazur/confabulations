<answer>Genomic sequencing suggests wild birds and other wildlife may transport the virus between farms and introduce it to other wild animals</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows having more virus in their noses than sick cows suggests the infection might start in the upper respiratory tract before moving to mammary glands</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The presence of virus in nasal swabs and urine of asymptomatic cows indicates transmission routes beyond milk, complicating the narrative of milk-only spread</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Virus spread to cats and raccoons suggests controlling cow and equipment movement is insufficient to stop the outbreak</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Wild blackbirds carried virus closely matching cow infections, implying they might transport the virus between farms</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Wild blackbirds, found five to eight miles from an affected Texas farm</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have virus in their noses or urine than in milk, challenging current surveillance methods that focus primarily on milk testing</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have virus in their noses or urine than in milk, contradicting assumptions about milk-based transmission</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Genomic analysis showing virus spread to multiple species (cats, raccoons, wild birds) challenges the effectiveness of farm-focused control measures</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have virus in their noses than obviously sick cows</answer>
