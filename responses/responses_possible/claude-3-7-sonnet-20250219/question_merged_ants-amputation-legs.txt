<answer>Florida carpenter ants evolved to perform amputations only on thigh injuries because the flow of hemolymph is reduced in thigh injuries, making it more difficult for bacteria to move from the wound into the body.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The presence of many hemolymph-pumping muscles in the thighs</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Wounds closer to the body (thigh injuries) have higher amputation success rates than wounds further from the body (lower leg injuries).</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It saves energy by rescuing injured ants instead of producing 10-20% more ants to compensate for losses.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The time window for successful amputation of lower leg injuries is narrow, while thigh injuries allow for a longer window.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The multiple muscles in ant thighs reduce hemolymph flow, making it more difficult for bacteria to move from the wound into the body, increasing amputation success.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>When a lower leg is injured, bacteria can penetrate the body very quickly, but thigh injuries slow bacterial movement due to reduced hemolymph flow.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The injured ant presents its injured leg, calmly sits while another ant gnaws it off, then presents the newly amputated wound for cleaning.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Areas with more hemolymph-pumping muscles (thighs) have higher amputation success rates (90%) compared to areas with fewer such muscles.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The high survival rate (90%) of amputee ants saves the colony from having to produce 10-20% more ants, saving an enormous amount of energy at the colony level.</answer>
