<answer>Instead of relying on current readings and millions of calculations, GraphCast draws on what it has learned about cause-effect relationships governing weather; it produces in minutes or seconds what supercomputers take an hour or more to calculate</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>GraphCast was trained on four decades of global weather observations compiled by the European forecasting center, allowing it to learn directly from historical data</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<other>The article mentions Dr. Bretherton is now a team leader at the Allen Institute for A.I. (established by Paul G. Allen), and also mentions the European center's interest in A.I., but doesn't establish a direct connection between Allen and GraphCast adoption.</other>

<answer>By learning patterns from four decades of historical weather data, GraphCast might identify subtle atmospheric relationships that help predict chaotic weather systems more accurately</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>GraphCast trained on four decades of data while traditional forecasts improved from three days to ten days, suggesting AI could potentially extend prediction timeframes further</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Both traditional weather modeling requires blending data from many sources into a cohesive picture, while AI political tools similarly need to integrate diverse information sources, potentially introducing biases in both cases</answer>
