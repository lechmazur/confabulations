<answer>The Thwaites Glacier is described as "among the fastest receding and least stable in Antarctica," making it a critical case study for understanding potential ice sheet collapse mechanisms in West Antarctica.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The study simulated what would happen if the glacier's floating edge (ice shelf) completely disappeared, showing this would affect how quickly ice flows to sea and the potential for cliff collapse.</answer>

<answer>N/A</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Without sufficient observations of ice fracturing behavior, scientists may miss quick collapse events, leading to inaccurate projections of sea-level rise that could affect coastal city protection planning.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The study found that runaway ice cliff collapse appears less likely than previously thought, suggesting this particular form of ice destruction may be more remote than earlier assessments indicated.</answer>

<answer>Dr. DeConto</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The glacier's ice flowing more quickly out to sea prevented the cliffs from becoming tall enough to trigger runaway breakdown.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Observations of how ice behaves when it fractures</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>That nations' emissions of heat-trapping gases climb to extremely high levels</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Once the ice shelf was removed, the glacier's ice started flowing more quickly to sea, which prevented cliffs from becoming tall enough to trigger runaway breakdown.</answer>
