<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The article mentions improvements to the de-icing system since the 1994 crash, suggesting this known issue should have been resolved, which could mislead investigators from considering icing as a primary cause despite evidence pointing to it.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The article states the plane's speed dropped sharply but not enough to cause a stall unless "icing was extremely severe," creating a conditional where the stall would only occur if both speed drop and severe icing were present.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The temperature on the ground where the plane crashed was around 63 degrees, which is relatively warm, making severe icing less likely and prompting one expert to note "We're talking about Brazil here, not Antarctica."</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The article notes the plane was traveling around 325 mph before its speed dropped, but this drop was not enough to cause a stall under normal conditions, challenging the stall theory unless "icing was extremely severe."</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The pilots did not communicate with air traffic controllers before the crash, which conflicts with the standard protocol of alerting controllers before descending to a lower altitude to address icing.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The temperature on the ground where the plane crashed was around 63 degrees, contradicting assumptions about severe icing conditions.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The improved de-icing system implemented after the 1994 crash complicates the investigation because investigators must now determine whether the crew activated the system or if it failed despite improvements.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The rubber tubes on the wings that are supposed to inflate and deflate to break up ice become crucial when considering the icing theory.</answer>
