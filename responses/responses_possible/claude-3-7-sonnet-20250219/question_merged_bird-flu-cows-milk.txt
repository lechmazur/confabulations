<answer>Genomic sequencing suggests that infected cows passed the virus to other species, and wild birds might be involved in transporting the virus between farms or introducing it to other wild animals.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The finding suggests that infection may start in the upper respiratory tract before moving to the mammary glands, which appear to be the primary site of viral replication.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>It shows that asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk, suggesting that testing milk samples alone may not be enough to detect asymptomatic spread.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that even with strict controls on cow and equipment movement, the virus can still spread through infected wildlife, making it difficult to contain the outbreak.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Wild birds might be transporting the virus between farms or introducing it to other wild animals, as infected blackbirds were found carrying virus closely matching what was infecting cows on farms in different states.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Blackbirds</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk, suggesting milk-based testing alone is insufficient.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>It shows the virus can spread to multiple species including cats, raccoons, and wild birds, which may transport the virus to new locations beyond farm boundaries.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses than obviously sick ones.</answer>
