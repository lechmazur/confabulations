<answer>By simulating Thwaites Glacier's behavior, the study provides insights into how ice cliffs might not trigger runaway collapse, suggesting broader stability mechanisms.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It shows that even without the ice shelf, the glacier's flow speed prevents cliffs from becoming tall enough to collapse catastrophically.</answer>

<answer>Scientists might miss rapid ice collapse events, leading to incomplete data for accurate projections.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It suggests ice cliffs may not be as unstable as previously thought, reducing the likelihood of rapid collapse.</answer>
