<answer>The study's focus on the Thwaites Glacier's ice shelf is significant because it helps understand the potential for ice cliff collapse by simulating what happens when the ice shelf disappears, either immediately or in the future, and how this affects the glacier's flow and the stability of ice cliffs.</answer>

<answer>The potential consequence of not having enough observations of ice behavior when it fractures, as mentioned by Dr. Alley, is that scientists can easily miss quick ice collapses, leading to insufficient data for accurate modeling and projections.</answer>

<answer>The study's conclusion challenges previous assumptions by suggesting that the scenario of ice cliffs collapsing one after the other, leading to a runaway breakdown, is less likely than previously thought, based on computer simulations.</answer>

<answer>The unexpected factor in the simulations that prevented runaway ice cliff breakdown was the glacier's ice starting to flow more quickly out to sea once the shelf was removed, which prevented the cliffs from becoming tall enough to trigger a runaway breakdown.</answer>

<answer>The implicit assumption about fossil fuel usage underlying the "worst-case scenarios" simulated in the study is that nations' emissions of heat-trapping gases climb to extremely high levels.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The article draws a connection between ice cliff height and glacier flow speed by stating that once the ice shelf is removed, the glacier's ice starts flowing more quickly out to sea, which prevents the cliffs at the end of the glacier from becoming so tall as to trigger a runaway breakdown.</answer>
