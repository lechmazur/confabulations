<answer>The children's museum project in Old San Juan, which Brock Pierce bought and used as a space to discuss ideas, reflects both local resistance and his broader real estate strategy. Local resistance was evident with graffiti saying "Gringo go home" on the museum, indicating opposition to Pierce's presence. His broader real estate strategy involved buying properties with the intention of converting them into new ventures, but like the museum, many of these projects, including the museum itself, ended up empty and unfulfilled, showcasing his pattern of ambitious plans that did not come to fruition.</answer>
