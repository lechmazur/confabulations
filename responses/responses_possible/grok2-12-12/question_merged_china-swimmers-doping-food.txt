<answer>The World Anti-Doping Agency's decision not to appeal the Chinese decision in the 2022 case reflects a failure to act as a backstop when a country's own antidoping authorities fail to properly police its athletes, as it chose not to challenge China's decision not to impose bans on the swimmers despite skepticism from its investigators and experts.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Both the 2022 case and the case of the Chinese distance runner involved claims of unwitting ingestion of banned substances through food contamination, but the specifics differ: in the 2022 case, the swimmers allegedly consumed contaminated hamburgers, while the distance runner claimed to have accidentally drunk from a training partner's water bottle.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Both the 2022 case and the case of the 23 positive tests before the Tokyo Olympics involved China blaming food contamination for the positive tests, with the 2022 case specifically citing hamburgers and the earlier case citing low levels of the drug detected in the swimmers.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The Chinese antidoping authority's handling of the 2022 case, where it cleared the swimmers without imposing bans despite positive tests, contradicts its stated policy of 'zero tolerance' for doping, as it did not sanction the athletes as would be expected under a strict 'zero tolerance' policy.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The Chinese authorities' inability to pinpoint the source of contamination in the 2022 case implies that the contamination scenario presented by the athletes and Chinada could not be substantiated, raising doubts about the validity of the explanation and the decision to clear the swimmers.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The explanation of food contamination in the 2022 case challenges standard antidoping protocols because it relies on an unproven contamination scenario to clear athletes of doping, which goes against the principle that athletes are responsible for what is in their bodies and can only escape punishment by proving exactly how they ingested the drug unwittingly.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The World Anti-Doping Agency expressed general concern about the number of cases closed without sanction when contamination theories could not be challenged, including in the U.S., but it did not dispute the facts of the Chinese cases and ultimately did not challenge the contamination scenario presented by the athletes and Chinada.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The aspect of China's investigation into the positive tests that contradicts standard antidoping procedures for athlete responsibility is the focus on external factors like contaminated food without requiring the athletes to prove exactly how they ingested the drug unwittingly, as required under the WADA code.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The discrepancy between World Aquatics' statement and the International Testing Agency's reported stance is that World Aquatics claimed it never received any recommendation from the I.T.A. to appeal the case, while the I.T.A. believed that World Aquatics should appeal the Chinese decision to clear the athletes.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The inconsistency in China's adherence to WADA rules regarding public disclosure of contamination findings is that China did not publicly disclose its finding of food contamination in either the 2022 case or the case of the 23 swimmers before the Tokyo Olympics, as required under WADA rules.</answer>
