<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The unexpected formations, including immense terraces with rounded, swirling edges and teardrop-shaped divots, challenged the previous assumption that the melting process smoothed out the topography of underwater ice, as these structures were far more complex than expected.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The use of dead reckoning for navigation under the ice shelf, without GPS, led to a success rate where only about half of Ran's 14 undersea missions were completely successful, causing tension and uncertainty for the researchers each time Ran was deployed.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The seals observed by the researchers were significant because one of Dr. Wahlin's theories about the loss of Ran was that it had a fateful encounter with a curious seal, which could have caused the robot to become disoriented.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The researchers' findings under the Dotson Ice Shelf challenged the assumption that melting smooths out underwater ice topography by revealing complex structures and indentations that persist, contrary to the previous belief that melting would result in a flat and featureless bottom.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The primary reason the scientists were unable to survey the Thwaites Glacier was that too much sea ice was in the way, making it inaccessible.</answer>

<answer>Ran</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The newly discovered topography of the Dotson Ice Shelf's underside, with its complex structures like terraces and divots, contradicts the previous scientific assumption that melting would smooth out the underwater ice topography, showing instead that these features can persist.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Thwaites Glacier</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The newly discovered complex topography of the ice shelf's underside suggests that these features and indentations can persist, potentially affecting overall melting patterns in response to ocean warming, though further study is required to understand this impact fully.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The researchers risked encountering the misconception that the bottom of the ice shelf would be flat and featureless, which would have been a letdown and contradicted their findings of complex structures.</answer>
