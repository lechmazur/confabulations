<answer>N/A</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The temperature on the ground where the plane crashed was around 63 degrees, which challenges the primary theory of severe icing as a cause since warmer temperatures could mitigate ice accumulation.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The plane was described as spinning slowly as it plummeted, which contradicts the standard expectation of a rapid spin associated with a stall-induced crash.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The plane's last recorded speed of roughly 325 miles per hour did not drop far enough to cause a stall unless icing was extremely severe, challenging the primary theory about the crash cause.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The pilots did not communicate with air traffic controllers just before the crash, which conflicts with the standard protocol of alerting controllers before descending to a lower altitude to address severe icing conditions.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The temperature on the ground where the plane crashed was around 63 degrees, contradicting the expert's statement about potential icing conditions typically associated with colder environments.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The improvement of the de-icing system on the ATR 72-500 model since the 1994 American Eagle crash complicates the current investigation by raising questions about the system's functionality during the crash.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The presence of rubber tubes on the wings designed to inflate and deflate to break up ice becomes crucial when considering the icing theory proposed by experts.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The plane fell from 17,000 feet, challenging assumptions about gradual ice accumulation as the cause since such a high altitude suggests a sudden rather than gradual event.</answer>
