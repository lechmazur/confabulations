<answer>Dr. Sara E. Edwards' study found that although Black newborns had lower Apgar scores and were admitted to the NICU at higher rates, they did not have more abnormal umbilical cord gas values, suggesting that their lower Apgar scores did not necessarily indicate poorer health outcomes.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Removing the skin color metric from the Apgar test could potentially reduce unnecessary NICU admissions for babies of color.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Sara E. Edwards' study revealed that Black newborns had lower Apgar scores but did not have more abnormal umbilical cord gas values compared to non-Black babies.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Low Apgar scores were far more inaccurate predictors of poor outcomes for Black babies than for other babies, while Asian infants with low Apgar scores were 100 times more likely to die than Asian babies with normal scores.</answer>

<answer>3.3 percent of white infants achieved a perfect Apgar score compared to 1.2 percent of Chinese-American infants.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Black babies with low Apgar scores were only 23 times more likely to die than those with normal scores, while low-scoring white babies were 54 times more likely to die than white babies with normal scores.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The Apgar test's reliance on skin color might lead to healthy babies of color being subjected to unnecessary medical treatment, potentially sending them to intensive care units unnecessarily, which separates them from their mothers, disrupts bonding and breastfeeding, exposes them to infection risks, and can be traumatizing for parents.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Sara E. Edwards' study specifically identified the skin color component as the driver of racial discrepancies in the first Apgar tests given to babies one minute after birth.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The article mentions that finding a substitute for the skin color component in the Apgar test is challenging because umbilical cord gas analyses take time to run through a lab and cannot provide immediate results, and pulse oximetry has been found to be less accurate for Black patients.</answer>

<answer>The American Academy of Pediatrics emphasizes a quick assessment of breathing and heart rate to guide resuscitation decisions, not color, and does not emphasize the Apgar score at all.</answer>
