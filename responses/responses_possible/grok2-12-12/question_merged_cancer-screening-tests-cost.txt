<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>improved treatment for colon cancer and changing diets and exposures to other factors</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>studies repeatedly failed to show that people live longer if they are screened and screening barely lowers the death rate from the cancer being screened</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>the increase in screening did not accelerate the decline in colon cancer death rates</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>the effects of cancer screening on mortality are so small that large clinical trials are needed to observe them</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>the absolute risk of dying from colorectal cancer fell from 3 percent to 2 percent, a 33 percent drop but just one percentage point, with no change in the overall mortality rate</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>improved treatments might decrease the perceived value of screening because the effect of screening on mortality is small</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>changing diets might decrease the risk of colon cancer, contributing to the decline in death rates independent of screening</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>the paradox is that people have an outsized idea of the benefits of screening, yet studies show it barely lowers the death rate from the cancer being screened</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>the contradiction is that while cancer death rates have been plummeting, experts debate the reasons, and some argue it's a mistake to attribute the decline solely or mostly to screening</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>the decline in cancer death rates might be attributed to vastly improved treatment for colon cancer and changing diets and exposures to other factors</answer>
