<answer>The aspect of A.I. development most affected by SB 1047, potentially leading to a shift in where A.I. innovation occurs, is the requirement for safety tests for systems with development costs exceeding $100 million and trained using a certain amount of raw computing power. This could push A.I. development into other states because it might be seen as burdensome by companies, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where much of the A.I. start-up community is based.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Dario Amodei, the chief executive of Anthropic, appears to contradict his previous public statements about A.I. risks with his company's current opposition to the bill.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The bill's origins are connected to the effective altruism movement, which is concerned with preventing existential threats from A.I., through the "A.I. salons" attended by Senator Scott Wiener and input from the Center for A.I. Safety, a think tank with ties to this movement.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Dario Amodei's congressional testimony about the risks of A.I. is at odds with Anthropic's current opposition to the bill.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The aspect of the bill's requirements that could inadvertently consolidate power among a select few corporations is the safety testing requirement for systems with high development costs and computing power, as argued by Jeremy Howard, who stated that it would ensure the most powerful A.I. technologies belong solely to the biggest tech companies.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The irony in the tech industry's response to this regulatory attempt is that, despite previously urging lawmakers to set up guardrails for A.I., they are now recoiling at an attempt to do exactly that in California.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Anthropic's opposition to the bill seems inconsistent with its CEO Dario Amodei's previous warnings about A.I. risks.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>According to some critics, the aspect of the bill that could potentially exacerbate the very risks it aims to mitigate is the threat of legal action from the state attorney general, which could discourage tech giants from sharing their technology's underlying software code, limiting open-source development and innovation.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The contradiction between the bill's safety testing requirements and recent studies on A.I. technology risks is that while the bill mandates safety tests for powerful A.I. systems, studies by OpenAI and others showed that today's A.I. technologies were not significantly more dangerous than search engines.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The aspect of the bill's requirements that could inadvertently push A.I. development to other regions, despite its safety intentions, is the safety testing requirement for systems with high development costs and computing power, which critics argue could be burdensome and lead companies to move their A.I. development elsewhere.</answer>
