<answer>spraying a pollutant into the sky to block sunlight</answer>

<answer>The central figure, David Keith, believes the risks of solar geoengineering are well understood, not as severe as portrayed by critics, and dwarfed by the potential benefits. In contrast, Raymond Pierrehumbert, the Oxford atmospheric physicist, considers solar geoengineering a grave threat to human civilization, unsafe to deploy, and even researching it as dangerous.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>David Keith's 1992 paper, "A Serious Look at Geoengineering," raised questions about who should authorize the use of these technologies and who is liable if something goes wrong, which directly relate to the governance concerns critics of solar geoengineering have, such as the potential for moral hazard and the need for regulation.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The researcher, David Keith, believes that humans have already altered the planet by heating the climate with greenhouse gases, and to repair the climate and return it to a more pristine state, drastic action like solar geoengineering may be necessary. His observations of natural climate changes, such as the shrinking glacier he saw on his birthday hike, confirm his belief in the need for such interventions.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>David Keith's personal windfall from the sale of Carbon Engineering was about $72 million, while the funding for his new academic program at the University of Chicago could reach as much as $100 million.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>During his birthday hike in the Canadian Rockies, David Keith observed a glacier that had shrunk dramatically in recent years, which served as a visual reminder of global warming's impact on the natural world. This observation confirmed his belief in the necessity of solar geoengineering to repair the climate, thus increasing his motivation to pursue it.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>David Keith believes nations should stop burning coal, oil, and gas, indicating a stance against fossil fuel emissions. However, his proposed solution to climate change, solar geoengineering, involves intentionally releasing sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, which contrasts with his stance on reducing emissions as it does not address the root cause of the problem.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>David Keith's response to experiment protests, where he stated that if they do it again, they won't be open in the same way, suggests a shift towards less transparency in research due to the backlash and protests he faced.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>According to Raymond Pierrehumbert, the potential risk of termination shock if solar geoengineering is stopped abruptly is a sudden rise in temperatures, potentially causing a massive temperature rise in an unprepared world over a matter of five to 10 years, hitting the Earth's climate with something it probably hasn't seen since the dinosaur-killing impactor.</answer>
