<answer>Florida carpenter ants have evolved to perform amputations only on thigh injuries because when they sustain a thigh injury, the flow of hemolymph is reduced, making it more difficult for bacteria to move from the wound into the body, thus lowering the chance of infection if the leg is amputated quickly.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The presence of many hemolymph-pumping muscles in the thighs of Florida carpenter ants contributes to the success of thigh amputations in preventing infection.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The counterintuitive relationship is that amputations are more successful when the wound is closer to the body (thigh injuries) than when it is further away (lower leg injuries).</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The amputation behavior provides an evolutionary advantage by saving lives and curbing the spread of pathogens, allowing the colony to save energy by not needing to produce 10 to 20 percent more ants to compensate for the loss of injured ants.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The time window for successful amputation is wider for thigh injuries, allowing for a higher chance of success, while for lower leg injuries, the time window is narrow, resulting in a slim chance of successful amputation.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The presence of multiple muscles in ant thighs helps reduce the flow of hemolymph when injured, making it more difficult for bacteria to move from the wound into the body, thus increasing the success of amputation as an infection prevention method.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Bacterial movement plays a critical role in determining the effectiveness of amputation; when the wound is closer to the body (thigh injuries), the reduced hemolymph flow makes it harder for bacteria to penetrate the body, increasing the effectiveness of amputation, whereas with lower leg injuries, bacteria can penetrate the body quickly, reducing the effectiveness of amputation.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The injured ant presents its injured leg and calmly sits there while another ant gnaws it off, and as soon as the leg drops off, the ant presents the newly amputated wound for the other ant to clean.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>There is a positive correlation between the location of hemolymph-pumping muscles and the success rate of ant leg amputations; amputations are more successful when performed on thigh injuries where there are many such muscles, reducing hemolymph flow and the spread of bacteria.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The high survival rate of amputee ants (90 percent) contributes to the overall energy efficiency of the colony by saving the energy that would be required to produce 10 to 20 percent more ants to compensate for the loss of injured ants.</answer>
