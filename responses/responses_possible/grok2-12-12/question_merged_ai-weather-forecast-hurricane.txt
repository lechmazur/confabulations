<answer>The A.I. approach, as demonstrated by GraphCast, differs from traditional supercomputer methods by drawing on learned cause-and-effect relationships from historical data rather than relying on current readings and millions of calculations. GraphCast can produce a 10-day forecast in seconds, a task that takes supercomputers over an hour.</answer>

<answer>GraphCast was able to predict Hurricane Beryl's landfall in Texas more accurately than the European weather agency's forecast because it was trained on four decades of global weather observations, allowing it to learn directly from historical data and identify subtle patterns.</answer>

<answer>Paul G. Allen's involvement in AI is through his establishment of the Allen Institute for A.I., where Christopher S. Bretherton, an emeritus professor of atmospheric sciences, now works. The potential future adoption of GraphCast by the world's top weather agency, the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, is influenced by the agency's interest in AI, which Bretherton notes has the world of meteorologists looking to match this technology.</answer>

<answer>GraphCast's learning from historical data potentially overcomes the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems by identifying subtle patterns and cause-and-effect relationships that govern the planet's weather, allowing for more accurate predictions despite the inherent chaos of the atmosphere.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The contrast between GraphCast's training data timespan of four decades and the recent improvements in traditional weather forecast durations, which have extended from three days to ten days, reflects the potential for AI in long-term climate prediction by demonstrating that AI can learn from extensive historical data to make faster and more accurate forecasts.</answer>
