<answer>They are fine-tuned for determining probabilities, not doing rules-based calculations.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>A.I. chatbots excel when they have consumed vast quantities of relevant training data, yet they struggle with math despite this.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>A.I. chatbots learn by analyzing vast amounts of data and predicting likely outcomes, while traditional computing systems follow step-by-step rules and use structured databases. In educational applications, A.I. chatbots like Khanmigo use calculator programs for numerical problems, showing a reliance on traditional computing for math accuracy.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The evolution of A.I. technology reflects a shift from viewing computing as primarily about mathematical calculations to recognizing A.I.'s strengths in language and pattern recognition, which are based on neural networks that learn from data rather than following rigid rules.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>AI's struggle with math challenges the traditional definition by showing that modern A.I. systems, which are more adept at language and pattern recognition, do not excel in the mathematical calculations that have historically defined computing.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The occasional mathematical errors by AI chatbots provide a teaching opportunity for students to critically analyze and compare their solutions with the chatbot's, enhancing critical thinking skills.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The article's portrayal reflects a shift from viewing AI's strengths as primarily in mathematical calculations to recognizing their proficiency in language tasks and pattern recognition, highlighting a departure from traditional computing strengths.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The article's discussion on AI's math abilities fuels the debate by highlighting the limitations of large language models in logical and mathematical reasoning, supporting arguments for a broader approach like "world modeling" proposed by skeptics like Yann LeCun.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>AI's proficiency in language tasks and struggles with math challenge the traditional distinction by showing that AI systems can excel in areas typically associated with liberal arts while struggling in STEM-related tasks like mathematics.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>David Ferrucci's perspective highlights that while AI's language skills are impressive, its accuracy in critical applications like banking and air traffic control requires the precision of rules-based software, indicating a gap between AI's language capabilities and the accuracy needed in essential systems.</answer>
