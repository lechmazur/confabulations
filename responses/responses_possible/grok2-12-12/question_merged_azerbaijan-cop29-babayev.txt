<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Mukhtar Babayev's career background creates a potential conflict of interest because he spent most of his career rising through the middle ranks of the state oil company, while now he is tasked with leading climate talks aimed at reducing fossil fuel use.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Russia's veto power over other candidate countries, due to its invasion of Ukraine, left Azerbaijan as the last option for hosting COP29.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The European Union's energy policy plays a role in Azerbaijan's defense of natural gas production because, despite Europe barring its banks from financing fossil fuels, it has increased its demand for Azerbaijani gas, which Babayev uses to argue that gas is needed as a transitional fuel.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Donald Trump's possible re-election could negatively impact Azerbaijan's climate commitments at COP29, as he has promised to roll back clean energy laws and ramp up fossil fuel drilling, potentially undermining global climate efforts.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The irony in Azerbaijan's role as a host for COP29 is that it is a petrostate heavily dependent on fossil fuels and has barely begun transitioning to renewable energy, yet it is hosting a global climate summit focused on reducing fossil fuel use.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Russia's veto power in the selection of COP29's host country implies that geopolitical tensions, specifically related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, can significantly influence the choice of host, limiting options to countries like Azerbaijan that are not seen as hostile to Russia.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The potential for methane leaks complicates Azerbaijan's defense of natural gas as a cleaner energy source because methane, a major component of natural gas, can leak and cause short-term spikes in the greenhouse effect, undermining the argument that gas is less harmful to nature than oil and coal.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The paradox in Azerbaijan's simultaneous investment in renewable energy and increased gas exports is that while it aims to develop renewable energy at home, it also plans to increase its gas exports, which contradicts the global push to reduce fossil fuel use.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The contradiction in Western countries' climate policies, as highlighted by Azerbaijan's gas exports, is that while they advocate for moving away from fossil fuels, they have increased their demand for Azerbaijani gas, showing a reliance on fossil fuels despite their climate commitments.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Azerbaijan's hosting of COP29 reflects the complexities of global climate politics and regional geopolitics by showcasing the challenges of balancing the interests of petrostates and climate-vulnerable nations, the influence of geopolitical tensions on climate negotiations, and the contradictions in energy policies of both host and participating countries.</answer>
