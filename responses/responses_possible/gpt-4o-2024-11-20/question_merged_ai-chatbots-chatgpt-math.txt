<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The A.I. chatbots struggle with mathematical accuracy because they are fine-tuned for determining probabilities, not performing rules-based calculations.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The paradox is that while A.I. chatbots excel when they have consumed vast quantities of relevant training data, their mathematical capabilities remain inconsistent and prone to errors.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The article illustrates this difference by explaining that A.I. chatbots rely on probabilistic predictions rather than rigid rules, and in educational applications like Khan Academy's Khanmigo, numerical problems are sent to a calculator program instead of relying on the chatbot.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The evolution of A.I. technology reflects a shift from traditional computing's rigid, rules-based approach to neural networks that learn from data, which has led to strengths in language tasks but weaknesses in mathematical tasks.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The article challenges the traditional definition of computing as "math on steroids" by highlighting that modern A.I. chatbots excel in language tasks but struggle with mathematical precision.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The mathematical errors made by A.I. chatbots have become a teaching opportunity, encouraging students to critically evaluate the chatbot's answers and sharpen their critical thinking skills.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The portrayal reflects a shift in perceived strengths, showing that A.I. systems are more proficient in language and probabilistic tasks than in precise mathematical calculations.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The discussion contributes to the debate by highlighting the limitations of large language models in logic and reasoning, suggesting the need for broader approaches like "world modeling."</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The portrayal challenges the distinction by showing that A.I. chatbots, despite being advanced technology, perform more like liberal arts majors than STEM experts in mathematical tasks.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>David Ferrucci's perspective highlights that while A.I.'s language skills are impressive, its lack of accuracy in critical applications necessitates the use of structured, rules-based software for tasks requiring precision.</answer>
