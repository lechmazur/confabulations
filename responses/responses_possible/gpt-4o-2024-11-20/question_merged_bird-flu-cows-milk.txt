<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Genomic sequencing suggests that wildlife, such as wild birds, may play a role in disseminating H5N1 between farms by transporting the virus.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The finding challenges the understanding by suggesting that the infection may start in the upper respiratory tract of asymptomatic cows before moving to the mammary glands, contradicting assumptions about symptom progression.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The evidence complicates the narrative by showing that asymptomatic cows shed the virus in their noses and urine, indicating that milk is not the sole medium of transmission.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The spread to cats and raccoons shows that controlling cow and equipment movement alone is insufficient, as the virus can infect and spread through other species.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The study implies that wild birds, such as blackbirds, may play a role in spreading H5N1 due to genomic similarities between viruses found in these birds and those on affected farms.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Blackbirds</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk, challenging the effectiveness of milk-focused surveillance methods.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows shed the virus in their noses and urine more frequently than in milk, contradicting assumptions about milk-based transmission.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The genomic analysis shows that the virus spreads to multiple species, such as cats, raccoons, and wild birds, challenging the effectiveness of farm-focused control measures.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses than sick cows, an unexpected correlation.</answer>
