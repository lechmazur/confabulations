<other>Analyzing the article to answer the questions based solely on the provided information.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The mention of the plane's model and its de-icing system improvements since 1994 creates a potential red herring by suggesting that icing might not be a significant factor due to these improvements, even though icing is still considered a leading theory.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The article's mention of the plane's speed dropping sharply but not far enough to cause a stall unless icing was extremely severe creates a complex conditional statement about the crash's cause, as it ties the stall to the severity of icing and its impact on the wing's shape.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The plane's anti-icing system's potential failure, combined with the crash location's ground temperature of 63 degrees, challenges the primary theory by suggesting that pilots could have descended to warmer altitudes to melt the ice.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The plane's trajectory, spinning slowly and crashing almost directly on its belly, contradicts standard expectations for a stall-induced crash, which typically involves a nose-down descent.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The discrepancy between the plane's last recorded speed of roughly 325 miles per hour and the minimum speed for a stall challenges the primary theory by implying that the stall could only occur if icing was severe enough to alter the wing's shape significantly.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The pilots' lack of communication with air traffic controllers immediately preceding the crash conflicts with standard protocol for addressing severe icing conditions, which typically involves alerting controllers and descending to a lower altitude.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The crash location's ground temperature of 63 degrees contradicts the assumption that icing conditions were unavoidable, as warmer air at lower altitudes could have mitigated the icing.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The technological advancement of improved de-icing systems after the 1994 crash paradoxically complicates the current investigation by raising questions about whether the system was activated or failed despite these improvements.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The aircraft's specifications, specifically the rubber tubes on the wings designed to break up ice, become crucial when considering the icing theory, as their activation or failure directly impacts the plane's ability to prevent icing-related stalls.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The precise altitude of 17,000 feet at which the plane began to fall challenges assumptions about gradual ice accumulation, as icing typically worsens over time and altitude, yet the crash occurred suddenly.</answer>
