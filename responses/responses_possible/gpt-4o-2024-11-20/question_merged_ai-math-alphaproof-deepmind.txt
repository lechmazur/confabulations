<other>Considering the article to answer the questions.</other>  
<question_number>1</question_number>  
<answer>It represents a transformative change in the use of A.I. in mathematics and the ability of A.I. systems to do mathematics.</answer>  
<question_number>2</question_number>  
<answer>It demonstrates the combination of abstract, precise, and creative reasoning required for mathematics, which is a litmus test for reaching artificial general intelligence.</answer>  
<question_number>3</question_number>  
<answer>It shows that computers can now tackle problems that were previously considered too complex, marking a step-change in the history of mathematics.</answer>  
<question_number>4</question_number>  
<answer>It suggests that the A.I. system performed at the level of a silver medalist, indicating significant but not perfect mathematical reasoning compared to human competitors.</answer>  
<question_number>5</question_number>  
<answer>It highlights that the system can learn and keep learning independently, ultimately solving the hardest problems humans can solve and potentially going beyond.</answer>  
<question_number>6</question_number>  
<answer>It serves as evidence that a useful research tool for solving hard mathematical problems may not be far away.</answer>  
<question_number>7</question_number>  
<answer>It implies that mathematicians might eventually have less to do if computers surpass them in speed and capability, but this is still a long way off.</answer>  
<question_number>8</question_number>  
<answer>It reflects the possibility of A.I. surpassing human capabilities in mathematical reasoning by solving problems that humans currently find challenging.</answer>
