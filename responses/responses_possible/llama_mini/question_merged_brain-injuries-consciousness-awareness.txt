<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The implication is that knowing some patients are aware despite their unresponsive state necessitates further action to help them communicate.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Cognitive motor dissociation</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that brain implants could potentially help patients with cognitive motor dissociation communicate, similar to how they have helped patients with ALS.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that long-term survivors might be more resilient and therefore more likely to retain awareness, but this could also mean that the study's results are biased towards more resilient patients.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The article draws a parallel between the potential future use of brain implants for disorders of consciousness and a recent breakthrough for patients with ALS, where a patient was able to communicate through a brain implant after just 30 minutes of training.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The study suggests that up to 100,000 patients in the United States alone might have some level of consciousness despite their devastating injuries.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The use of both functional MRI and electrode recordings strengthens the study's findings by providing multiple lines of evidence for cognitive motor dissociation.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that the development of brain-computer interfaces could potentially help patients with cognitive motor dissociation communicate in the future.</answer>
