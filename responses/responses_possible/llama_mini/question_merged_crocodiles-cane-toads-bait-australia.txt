<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The chicken necks served as a control to measure the effectiveness of the tainted toad bait by allowing researchers to compare the crocodiles' consumption of the tainted toads to their consumption of a non-toxic food source.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that the success of the taste aversion strategy might vary between different predator species because each species may require a fine-tuned approach tailored to its specific hunting style.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The potential long-term challenges associated with maintaining the conditioned taste aversion in crocodile populations include the need for ongoing maintenance and the possibility that the aversion may not be retained over time.</answer>
