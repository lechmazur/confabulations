The A.I. approach, as demonstrated by GraphCast, learns from historical data to identify subtle patterns and relationships in atmospheric systems, potentially allowing it to better predict chaotic weather events.</answer>

<question_number>9</assistant<|end_header_id|>

The contrast between GraphCast's training data timespan (four decades) and the recent improvements in traditional weather forecast durations (up to 10 days) suggests that AI may have potential for long-term climate prediction by learning from extensive historical data.</answer>
