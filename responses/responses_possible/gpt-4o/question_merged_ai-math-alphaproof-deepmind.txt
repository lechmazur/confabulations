<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The A.I. system's performance in the 2024 I.M.O. reflects a "phase transition" in the use of A.I. in mathematics as it represents a transformative change in the ability of A.I. systems to do mathematics, achieving a medal-worthy performance for the first time.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The significance of the A.I. system's ability to solve I.M.O. problems in the context of reaching artificial general intelligence is that it serves as a litmus test for A.G.I., demonstrating a combination of abstract, precise, and creative reasoning.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The A.I. system's performance in the I.M.O. challenges the traditional limitations of computers in mathematical problem-solving by reaching a threshold where it is possible to tackle complex problems, indicating a step-change in the history of mathematics.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The A.I. system's ability to solve four out of six I.M.O. problems suggests that its current level of mathematical reasoning is comparable to a silver medalist, indicating significant progress but not yet at the level of the top human competitors.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The significance of the A.I. system's ability to solve I.M.O. problems without a human teacher is that it can learn and keep learning independently, potentially solving the hardest problems humans can solve and even going beyond them.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The A.I. system's performance in the I.M.O. serves as a benchmark for its potential to solve research-level mathematical problems by demonstrating that if it can solve some hard I.M.O. problems, a useful research tool may not be far away.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The A.I. system's ability to solve I.M.O. problems implies that the future role of mathematicians might involve using adept tools to make mathematics more accessible, speed up research, and explore novel ideas, although there is still a long way to go before computers can do research-level mathematics.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The A.I. system's performance in the I.M.O. reflects the potential for A.I. to surpass human capabilities in mathematical reasoning by reaching a point where computers can prove complex things that humans can't, representing a step-change in mathematical history.</answer>
