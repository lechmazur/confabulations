<answer>Results from vulnerable Thwaites showed runaway cliff collapse unlikely, hinting broader West Antarctic ice sheet also less prone to that failure mode.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Testing complete loss of Thwaites’s ice shelf revealed that its removal speeds glacier flow and stops cliffs from reaching collapse‑triggering heights.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>By examining Antarctica’s most unstable glacier, findings implying low risk of ice‑cliff instability can be cautiously extended to other regions.</answer>

<answer>Accelerated glacier flow after shelf loss kept cliffs from growing tall enough to fail.</answer>
