<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>AI uses learned patterns from decades‑long historical data and creates forecasts in seconds, whereas supercomputers assimilate current observations and solve fluid‑dynamics equations for an hour or more.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Its pattern‑recognition of four decades of historical atmospheric data let it identify the Texas‑landfall signature more accurately than the agency’s real‑time model.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Christopher Bretherton, team leader at Paul G. Allen’s Allen Institute for AI, highlighted ECMWF’s interest in adopting GraphCast‑type systems.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Studios could time outdoor filming more precisely using laptop‑speed, highly accurate GraphCast forecasts, reducing weather‑related delays.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Campaigns might exploit GraphCast’s severe‑weather turnout predictions to target or suppress voters, raising manipulation ethics.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Both illustrate how AI tools—generative text or precise weather models—can be misused to manipulate public perception and behavior.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Extra safety‑rule compliance could slow or complicate ECMWF’s operational rollout of GraphCast‑based forecasting.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>By learning subtle cause‑effect patterns across decades, GraphCast can anticipate chaotic atmospheric shifts that stump equation‑based models.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Traditional methods stretched forecasts to 10 days, but GraphCast’s four‑decade training suggests AI can leverage long records to push toward longer‑term climate prediction.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Both blending multisource weather data and generating campaign content risk introducing inaccuracies or biases from heterogeneous inputs.</answer>
