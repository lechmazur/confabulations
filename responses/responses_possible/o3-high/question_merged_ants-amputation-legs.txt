<answer>Thigh wounds slow hemolymph flow, limiting bacterial spread, so amputating only those injuries effectively prevents infection</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Numerous hemolymph‑pumping muscles in the thighs</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Closer‑to‑body (thigh) wounds have high amputation success, while farther (lower leg) wounds have low success</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Saves colony energy by avoiding production of 10–20 % more replacement ants</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Thigh injuries allow a long window for effective amputation; lower leg injuries offer only a very narrow window</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Thigh muscles reduce hemolymph flow, slowing bacteria and making post‑amputation infection unlikely</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Slow bacterial movement from thigh injuries enables effective amputation, while rapid movement from lower legs undermines it</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Injured ant calmly presents its leg for removal, then offers the fresh stump for cleaning</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>High density of hemolymph muscles in the thigh aligns with 90 % survival; lack of such muscles in lower leg aligns with 20 % survival</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>High amputee survival reduces need for replacement workers, boosting colony energy efficiency</answer>
