<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>By stressing that the ATR 72‑500’s post‑1994 de‑icing upgrades should have prevented icing, it diverts attention from icing as a likely cause.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It states the plane would stall only if its speed drop combined with extreme icing had raised the stall threshold above the recorded values.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The wing’s rubber‑boot de‑icing system, when paired with the 63 °F crash‑site temperature, makes severe icing appear improbable.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The aircraft hit almost flat on its belly instead of nose‑first, differing from the usual trajectory of a stall crash.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Its speed never fell to normal stall velocity, so a stall explanation fits only if icing had unrealistically elevated the stall speed.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The pilots sent no emergency call or descent request, contrary to standard severe‑icing protocol.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The warm 63 °F temperature at Vinhedo contradicts the assumption of persistent, extreme icing.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The upgraded wing de‑icing boots added after the 1994 ATR crash now obscure whether icing could still have caused this accident.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The specification that its de‑icing relies on rubber‑boot tubes requiring activation becomes critical to the icing theory.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Beginning its descent from only about 17,000 feet leaves scant time for gradual heavy ice accumulation, challenging that assumption.</answer>
