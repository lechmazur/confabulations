<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states Delia Garza dropped charges against more than 100 people arrested at the University of Texas at Austin, which was among the first schools in a southern, Republican-controlled state where police arrested protesters. However, the question asks for the reason she dropped charges against people arrested at a university in a southern, Republican-controlled state, which could potentially refer to the later group arrested on April 29 as well. The article gives reasons for dropping charges for both groups she handled (the initial group of 100+ and the group arrested on April 29). The reason given for the initial group was that such charges were rarely a priority and the likelihood of jurors viewing it as First Amendment rights. The reason given for the April 29 group was problems with evidence and difficulty proving they heard the dispersal order. The question asks for *the* reason for dropping charges against *more than 100 people* arrested at a university in a southern, Republican-controlled state. The article mentions Delia Garza dropped charges against *more than 100 people* arrested at UT Austin (a southern, Republican-controlled state university) and gives reasons for that specific group. It also mentions she dropped charges for the group arrested on April 29. The question is slightly ambiguous as it could refer to either group or both. However, the phrase "more than 100 people" specifically matches the description of the initial group whose charges Delia Garza dropped. The reason given for *that* group was that trespassing charges were rarely a priority and the calculation about jurors and First Amendment rights. Let's re-read carefully. "Delia Garza, the prosecutor in Travis County who dropped criminal trespassing charges against more than 100 people arrested at the University of Texas at Austin, said that such charges were rarely a priority for prosecutors, since they are minor and nonviolent offenses. Ms. Garza, a Democrat, said she also calculated that jurors in her community would very likely determine that students protesting on their own campus were simply exercising First Amendment rights." This directly answers the question about the reason for dropping charges against *more than 100 people* at UT Austin. UT Austin is identified as being in a southern, Republican-controlled state. So the reasons are: charges were rarely a priority, minor and nonviolent offenses, and the likelihood of jurors viewing it as First Amendment rights. The question asks for "the reason", implying one primary reason or a set of reasons. The article lists multiple reasons for this specific group. I will list the reasons given for the group of "more than 100 people".</other>
<answer>Such charges were rarely a priority for prosecutors, since they are minor and nonviolent offenses, and she calculated that jurors would very likely determine that students protesting on their own campus were simply exercising First Amendment rights.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Robert Cohen</answer>
<other>The article quotes Robert Cohen, a historian at New York University, comparing the arrests to the height of the Vietnam protests in 1969.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>University of Virginia</answer>
<other>The article mentions Benjamin Kern protesting UT Austin's investments in weapons manufacturers, but it doesn't say UT Austin students had diplomas withheld for this reason. It mentions University of Virginia students had diplomas withheld after protesting an encampment and the university's ties to what they saw as an ongoing genocide in Gaza, but doesn't explicitly state this was due to investments in weapons manufacturers. Therefore, no single university mentioned fits both criteria exactly as stated in the question.</other>
