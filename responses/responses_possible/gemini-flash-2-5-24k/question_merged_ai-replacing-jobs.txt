<other>The article states that telemarketing qualifies as a "goon" job and software engineering can veer into "box ticking". It mentions Kelly Eden lost email drafting work to ChatGPT, which is administrative work. It doesn't explicitly categorize email drafting or administrative work under Graeber's specific categories like "flunkies", "goons", or "box tickers" in relation to Kelly Eden's situation, although it mentions "flunky" automation candidates like executive assistants. Therefore, I cannot directly associate her lost work with a specific category mentioned in the question.</other>
