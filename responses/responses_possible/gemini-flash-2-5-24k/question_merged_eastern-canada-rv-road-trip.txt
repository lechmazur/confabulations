<other>The user wants me to answer 10 questions based solely on the provided article. I need to answer each question in order, using the specified tags. If the answer is not directly provided or logically inferable according to the strict rules, I must answer "N/A". The questions ask for interpretations, illustrations, relationships, or connections between different parts of the author's experience. I will check if the article explicitly states these relationships or interpretations.</other>
