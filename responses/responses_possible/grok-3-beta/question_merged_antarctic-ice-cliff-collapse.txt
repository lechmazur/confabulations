<answer>Thwaites Glacier, a Florida-size river of ice, is among the fastest receding and least stable in Antarctica, providing a critical case study for understanding potential collapse mechanisms in the West Antarctic ice sheet.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The study simulated scenarios where the Thwaites Glacier's ice shelf completely disappears, testing its impact on ice cliff stability and potential collapse.</answer>

<answer>Scientists might miss rapid ice collapses, leading to incomplete data and less accurate projections for sea-level rise.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The study suggests that ice cliff collapse in West Antarctica is less likely than previously thought, challenging earlier assumptions of a high-impact, runaway breakdown scenario.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Increased glacier flow speed to the sea after the ice shelf removal prevented cliffs from becoming tall enough to trigger runaway breakdown.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Continued high levels of emissions from burning fossil fuels.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Higher ice cliffs are associated with slower glacier flow, but when the shelf is removed, faster flow prevents cliffs from reaching unstable heights.</answer>
