<answer>Repsol's strategy of retrofitting existing refineries to produce biofuels aligns with the European Union's regulations, which require energy companies to supply airports with jet fuel containing a growing proportion of sustainable aviation fuel, starting at 2 percent in 2025 and rising to 70 percent by 2050.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The paradox in Repsol's claim about the flexibility of its new biofuel plant is that while it states the plant can use various waste materials like used cooking oil, the article highlights a potential scarcity of such ingredients, making it difficult to sustain production despite the claimed flexibility.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The contradiction in perceiving biofuels as a practical solution for reducing emissions lies in the logistical challenges of sourcing waste ingredients, which may need to be transported globally, creating additional emissions in the process.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The European Union's requirement for sustainable aviation fuel to reach 70 percent by 2050 creates a complex challenge for Repsol due to the need to secure sufficient waste ingredients and navigate the complicated regulations that also prioritize food supply and forest protection.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The irony in the statement that biofuels provide green credentials with little effort is that sourcing challenges, such as the scarcity of waste ingredients like cooking oil, require significant effort and may involve global transportation, which undermines the ease of obtaining those credentials.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Repsol's strategy differs from its competitors by focusing on transforming its refineries to produce greener fuels from waste and e-fuels, rather than closing traditional oil refineries as some rivals have done.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The potential challenge for Repsol in maintaining its competitive edge in the biofuel market is the global competition for scarce waste ingredients and the impact of cheap biodiesel imports from China, which depress prices in Europe.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that Repsol's biofuel production might be affected by the limited availability of waste ingredients like cooking oil, with concerns that even collecting all used oil from Spain's restaurants would not be enough, and some materials may need to be sourced from Asia.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The potential contradiction in Repsol's claim that its new biofuels are a practical solution for reducing emissions is that logistical challenges, such as the need to transport waste ingredients globally, could create additional emissions, undermining the environmental benefits.</answer>
