<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Because thigh injuries reduce hemolymph flow, making it harder for bacteria to spread, thus increasing the chance of successful amputation without infection.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Multiple muscles in the thighs that pump hemolymph.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Amputations are more successful when the wound is closer to the body (thigh) than further away (lower leg).</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It saves energy by rescuing injured ants instead of producing 10 to 20 percent more ants to compensate for losses.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>For thigh injuries, the time window allows for successful amputation, while for lower leg injuries, the window is narrow, reducing success chances.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Multiple muscles in the thighs reduce hemolymph flow when injured, limiting bacterial spread and increasing amputation success.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Bacterial movement is slower from thigh injuries due to reduced hemolymph flow, making amputation effective, while it is faster from lower leg injuries, reducing effectiveness.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The injured ant presents its leg calmly, sits while the nestmate gnaws it off, and then presents the wound for cleaning.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Hemolymph-pumping muscles in the thighs correlate with higher success rates for thigh amputations compared to lower leg amputations.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>High survival rate of amputee ants (90 percent for thigh injuries) reduces the need to produce more ants, saving energy for the colony.</answer>
