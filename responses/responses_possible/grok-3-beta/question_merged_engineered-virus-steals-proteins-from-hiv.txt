<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Single injection of TIPs may keep H.I.V. at low levels permanently, unlike lenacapavir which requires twice-yearly shots.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Might make it harder for people to transmit H.I.V. to others.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>TIPs become a permanent part of the body, requiring consent for potential spread to others who cannot be asked for consent.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>TIPs interfere with H.I.V.'s life cycle by outcompeting it for protein shells, unlike protease inhibitors which target specific viral proteins.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Unexpected side effects that cannot be reversed since TIPs integrate into DNA permanently.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>TIPs are engineered to enter protein shells more effectively, releasing three times more TIPs than H.I.V. viruses when cells burst.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Unexpected side effects may not be removable since TIPs become a permanent part of the body.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>In principle, it's a universal approach to developing antivirals as other viruses might be vulnerable to the same strategy.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Doctors cannot obtain consent from others who might be infected with TIPs if they spread from treated patients.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>TIPs mimic H.I.V. and interfere with its life cycle by stealing protein shells, while protease inhibitors attack specific viral proteins like protease.</answer>
