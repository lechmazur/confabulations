<answer>A transformative change in the use of A.I. in mathematics and the ability of A.I. systems to do mathematics.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Mathematics requires abstract, precise, and creative reasoning, making it a good litmus test for reaching artificial general intelligence.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>It represents a step-change from computers only proving very simple things to being able to tackle complex problems, possibly even those humans can't solve.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It performed at the level of a silver medalist, solving four out of six problems for 28 points, compared to human competitors who won gold, silver, and bronze medals.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It can learn and keep learning indefinitely until it solves the hardest problems humans can solve, and potentially go beyond those.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that if Google DeepMind can solve hard I.M.O. problems, a useful research tool for mathematics can't be far away.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>It raises the possibility of a future where mathematicians might have nothing to do if computers become better and faster at everything mathematicians currently do, though this is still far off.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>It indicates a step-change in mathematics history, reaching a threshold where it's possible to tackle such problems, with potential to prove things humans can't.</answer>
