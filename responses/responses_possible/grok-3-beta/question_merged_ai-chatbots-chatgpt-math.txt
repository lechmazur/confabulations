<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>They were never designed to do math, focusing instead on determining probabilities rather than rules-based calculations.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Despite being trained on vast quantities of data like textbooks and tests, which should aid in math, chatbots still show erratic performance and struggle with accuracy in mathematical tasks.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>A.I. chatbots learn by analyzing data and predicting likely outcomes, unlike traditional computing systems that follow step-by-step rules; in education, this is seen in chatbots like Khanmigo using calculator programs for numerical problems rather than solving them directly.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It shows a shift from computing being defined as "math on steroids" with a focus on accurate calculations to a neural network approach that prioritizes language prediction over mathematical precision.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It challenges the definition by showing that A.I. chatbots, unlike traditional computers, are not primarily strong in math and often struggle with accuracy in calculations despite computing's historical strength in this area.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>It provides an opportunity for students to critically analyze chatbot answers, compare them with their own, and discuss solutions, thereby sharpening critical thinking skills.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>It reflects a shift from viewing A.I. as excelling in numerical precision to recognizing its strengths in language skills while acknowledging shortcomings in math accuracy.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>It fuels the debate between those who see large language models as the path to progress and skeptics like Yann LeCun who argue for broader approaches like world modeling, highlighting limitations in logic and reasoning in current models.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>It challenges the distinction by portraying A.I. as more akin to a liberal arts major with strong language skills rather than a STEM-focused numbers whiz, breaking from traditional computing stereotypes.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>David Ferrucci finds A.I. impressive for language skills but emphasizes that for critical applications like finance and supply chains, painful precision is required, which current A.I. lacks.</answer>
