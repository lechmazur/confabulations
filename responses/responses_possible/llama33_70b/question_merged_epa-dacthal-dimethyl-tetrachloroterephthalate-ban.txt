however "unprecedented efforts" is in the article, and "coordinated nuclear confrontations", however the word that appears in both contexts is actually "unprecedented" for the EPA and no direct

<other>of "unprecedented" doesn't work here since there are no direct relation with "nuclear", so let's try again with another approach since we need another term entirely different from those words previously considered. Let's think about what was said about EPA and what was said about government document on nuclear. What was said about EPA was their "unprecedented efforts". What was said about government document on nuclear was its being "classified". However we need another term entirely different from those words previously considered. Let's think again.
