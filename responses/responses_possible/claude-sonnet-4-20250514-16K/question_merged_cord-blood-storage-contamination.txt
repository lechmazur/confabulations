<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>They market cord blood as a "biological insurance policy" and sell parents "the hope of a 'healthier tomorrow'" by promising the cells could become tailor-made cures for conditions like cancer, diabetes, or autism, despite the overwhelming majority of samples sitting indefinitely unused and doctors rarely using cord blood anymore.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Cord blood representatives are largely exempt from laws prohibiting kickbacks to doctors because insurers do not cover their product.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>FDA inspectors found bacteria in a supposedly sterile processing area, leaky bags used to collect cord samples, failure to ensure appropriate shipping conditions leading to samples arriving warmer than accepted thresholds, and a contamination test that had not worked properly for two years and was failing to catch bacterial growth.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The claim that "stem cells can be used to treat over 80 different conditions" is misleading because most conditions are exceedingly rare and the list included diseases treatable with various types of stem cells, not necessarily from cord blood.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Anna Lazos paid for cord blood storage and spent about $1,300 on storage fees over 11 years, but when she tried to withdraw the sample for her son's autism clinical trial, the cells were contaminated with E. coli and unusable, illustrating how families can pay thousands only to find their samples worthless when needed.</answer>
