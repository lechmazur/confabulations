<other>I need to analyze each question based solely on the information provided in the article about China's Communist Party economic plan.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The plan prioritizes industrial policy over consumer spending, as it made only a "brief and cautious call to 'refine long-term mechanisms for expanding consumption'" while the Communist Party "doubled down on industrial policy."</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The emphasis shows continuity with historical approach, as the plan "echoed many familiar themes" and the strategic industries promoted were "essentially the same industries as in the country's decade-old Made in China 2025 plan."</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The strategy avoids implementing a significant real estate tax (which was never implemented from a 2013 plan) and instead proposes "the central government should become responsible for more of the country's spending."</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The plan implies no deviation from balancing economic recovery against national security concerns while maintaining social stability, as noted by the EU Chamber of Commerce.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Real estate sector, as there was "little mention of anything that would directly address China's plunging real estate prices or the millions of unfinished apartments left behind by failed developers."</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The rate cut could make it "slightly easier for companies and households to borrow and spend" and "temper disappointment among investors" about the lack of housing market measures.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The brief consumption mention contradicts the overall focus because economists called for rebalancing "away from investment and toward consumer spending" but the Party "doubled down on industrial policy."</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The approach shows caution about social stability by proposing "gradual" and "prudent and orderly" changes that "could be voluntary," though it still triggered social media criticism that was quickly censored.</answer>
