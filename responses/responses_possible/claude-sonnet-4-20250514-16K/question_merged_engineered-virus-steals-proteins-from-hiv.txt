<other>I need to analyze each question carefully based solely on the article provided, looking for specific information about TIPs, their advantages, disadvantages, and ethical concerns.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>TIPs may require only one shot that works permanently, while lenacapavir may be difficult to ensure people keep up with twice-yearly shots</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It might make it harder for people to transmit H.I.V. to others</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>TIPs can potentially spread to others, and doctors cannot receive consent from anyone else who might be infected with them</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>TIPs interfere with H.I.V.'s normal life cycle as an impostor virus, while protease inhibitors attack the virus itself</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>If there are unexpected side effects, it may not be possible to remove them since TIPs become permanently integrated into DNA</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>TIPs do a better job of entering the protein shells, resulting in three times more TIPs being released than H.I.V. viruses</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Unexpected side effects may not be removable</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Other viruses might also be vulnerable to the same strategy</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Doctors cannot receive consent from people who might be infected with TIPs by the treated patients</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Traditional drugs attack the virus itself, while TIPs work as an impostor virus that interferes with H.I.V.'s life cycle and steals essential proteins from the virus</answer>
