<other>I need to carefully read through the article and answer each question based solely on the information provided.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The lithium chlorine solution made the toads nauseating, causing crocodiles to develop taste aversion to toads, which trained them to avoid toxic toads in the wild, thereby reducing mortality rates.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Chicken necks served as a control to demonstrate that crocodiles maintained their appetite and continued feeding, showing their specific avoidance was directed at toads rather than general loss of appetite.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The article states that each predator needs an aversion strategy fine-tuned to its hunting style, citing yellow-spotted monitors requiring live "trainer toads" instead of toad sausages due to their active pursuit of live prey.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The article indicates it remains unclear how long crocodiles will retain this knowledge, and that maintaining the aversion is not a "one-and-done thing" but requires ongoing maintenance.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The Grinch metaphor relates to the scientific finding that nauseous crocodiles become lethargic and prefer to lay about instead of swimming after another meal, similar to a "seasick crocodile."</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The methodology used a control river that was left un-baited, allowing researchers to compare mortality rates between test and control sites to demonstrate the experiment's effectiveness.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Initially crocodiles consumed equal amounts of toad carcasses and chicken necks on the first day, but as the baiting period continued, they consumed fewer toads, showing the initial enthusiasm masked the developing aversion.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Cane toads</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Nausea, which makes crocodiles lethargic and causes them to avoid eating rather than seeking more food.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Crocodiles received dead toad carcasses injected with nauseating lithium chlorine solution, while yellow-spotted monitors required live young "trainer toads" because they actively pursue live prey and toad sausages didn't work.</answer>
