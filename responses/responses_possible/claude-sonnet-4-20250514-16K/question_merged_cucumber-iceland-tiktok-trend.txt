<other>I need to carefully analyze each question based solely on the information provided in the article, focusing on direct answers rather than inferences about connections that may not be explicitly stated.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The article states this is "the latest example of a social media phenomenon disrupting food supply chains" and explains that Iceland is "an island, isolated in the far Northern Hemisphere" where "importing to fill the gap can be much more expensive," requiring emergency shipments from Netherlands when the TikTok trend caused shortages in their greenhouse-grown produce.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Iceland had to get emergency shipments from Netherlands despite usually growing 99% of cucumbers in greenhouses, showing that being "isolated in the far Northern Hemisphere" makes importing "much more expensive" when self-sustaining systems are disrupted.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The social media trend disrupted Iceland's greenhouse agriculture system despite its isolation, forcing expensive emergency imports from Netherlands when local production couldn't meet sudden demand.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Being "isolated in the far Northern Hemisphere" means "importing to fill the gap can be much more expensive" and with a "small population of over 380,000 residents" there's "little wiggle room to handle sudden surges in demand."</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The article states that Iceland's "small population of over 380,000 residents, means little wiggle room to handle sudden surges in demand" and "A few people can have a lot of influence."</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The timing was "particularly bad" because "Farmers grow cucumbers in cycles, and the fad hit during a small lull in the yield of the crop."</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Consumers "typically try to buy locally grown foods instead of imported ones to reduce their carbon footprint" which "combined with Iceland's small population of over 380,000 residents, means little wiggle room to handle sudden surges in demand."</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The article mentions Iceland grows produce in "geothermal-powered greenhouses" but does not establish a direct connection between geothermal power and vulnerability to social media trends.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Despite Iceland priding "itself on its self-sustaining agriculture" with produce "grown in geothermal-powered greenhouses," they had to get "emergency shipment from the Netherlands" due to the shortage.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Despite usually growing "99 percent of its cucumbers in greenhouses," the system required emergency imports from Netherlands, and there was "a slight shortage of carbon dioxide...a key element of greenhouse production."</answer>
