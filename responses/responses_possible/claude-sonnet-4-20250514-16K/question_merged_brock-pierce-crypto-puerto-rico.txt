<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Pierce bought the former children's museum building in 2019, announced it as "a space to meet and discuss big ideas," but it now sits empty with peeling paint, while "Gringo go home" was written in red paint on its side, showing both local resistance and his broader pattern of acquiring properties with grand plans that don't materialize.</answer>
