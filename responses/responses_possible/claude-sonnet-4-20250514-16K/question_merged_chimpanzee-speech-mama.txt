<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The 2016 finding that primate vocal tracts were "speech ready" challenged Philip Lieberman's argument that anatomical differences in the larynx and tongue position prevented apes from producing the wide range of sounds required for complex speech, leading researchers to consider whether the ape brain lacked something essential for speech instead.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Fischer suggested that Renata and Johnny might be making standard chimpanzee pant-grunt sounds, and "the simplest explanation is that they simply added two of these pant-grunts together and were rewarded for doing so," rather than actually saying "mama."</answer>

<answer>The analysis showed that Johnny's and Renata's sounds had "a very particular, very unique acoustic profile" that couldn't be "mistake[n] for something else," and 61 volunteers agreed they were saying "mama," suggesting the sounds were distinct from typical chimp vocalizations like pant-grunts.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The comparison reflects an evolution from dismissing adoption experiments as failures to scientifically analyzing acoustic patterns - Viki only made consonant sounds without vowels, while Johnny and Renata could add vowels after consonants, showing more sophisticated vocal capabilities through proper acoustic analysis.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The discovery challenges the notion by demonstrating that chimpanzees can learn new sounds, contradicting the claim that "humans, unlike the vast majority of other animals, can learn new sounds from others."</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The analysis suggests that apes might already have "some of the mental requirements for speech" rather than lacking something essential in their brains, as one scientist noted the results indicated ancient apes might have had mental requirements for speech.</answer>
