<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Thigh injuries reduce hemolymph flow, making it more difficult for bacteria to move from the wound into the body, while lower leg injuries allow bacteria to penetrate the body very quickly, making amputation less successful</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Many muscles in the thighs</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Wounds closer to the body (thighs) have better amputation success than wounds further from the body (lower legs)</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Saves enormous amount of energy on the colony level by not needing to produce 10 to 20 percent more ants to compensate for losses</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Lower leg injuries have a narrow time window for successful amputation, while thigh injuries allow for quick amputation with low infection risk</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The multiple muscles reduce hemolymph flow when the thigh is injured, making it more difficult for bacteria to move from the wound into the body</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Slower bacterial movement (in thigh injuries) makes amputation more effective with low infection chance, while faster bacterial penetration (in lower leg injuries) makes amputation less effective</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The injured ant presents its leg and sits calmly while another ant gnaws it off, then presents the newly amputated wound for the other ant to clean</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Areas with more hemolymph-pumping muscles (thighs) have higher amputation success rates (90%) compared to areas with fewer such muscles (lower legs at 20%)</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Higher survival rates allow the colony to save enormous energy by not having to produce replacement ants to compensate for losses</answer>
