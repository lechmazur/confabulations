<answer>requires only a single injection rather than maintaining twice-yearly lenacapavir shots</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>could make it harder for treated people to transmit H.I.V. to others</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>possibility that TIPs spread to non-consenting individuals</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>TIPs replicate inside infected cells and outcompete H.I.V. instead of merely blocking one viral enzyme</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>risk of irreversible side effects from permanent integration into patient DNA</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>they are packaged into viral shells more efficiently, yielding about three times more TIP particles than H.I.V.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>unexpected side effects could be permanent because TIPs cannot be removed once integrated</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>the cheating-virus strategy could, in principle, be applied to many other viruses</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>secondary spread means people could receive TIPs without consent, complicating ethical approval</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
