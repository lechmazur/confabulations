<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Genomic data indicate wild animals, especially birds, may carry closely related virus strains between farms, acting as vectors for H5N1 spread.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Shows higher nasal viral presence in asymptomatic cows, suggesting infection starts in respiratory tract before obvious illness, contradicting prior assumptions.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Demonstrates that asymptomatic cows shed virus through nasal secretions and urine, revealing additional transmission routes beyond milk.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Interspecies transmission to cats and raccoons implies virus moves beyond cattle, so restricting cow and equipment movement alone is insufficient.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Genomic similarity implies wild birds may transport the virus between distant farms, serving as mobile reservoirs.</answer>

<answer>wild blackbirds</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows more often harbored virus in noses or urine than milk, indicating milk-only surveillance can miss infections.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Predominant shedding via nasal passages and urine rather than milk.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Cross-species viral matches reveal wildlife involvement, undermining farm-centric control strategies.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows had higher likelihood of nasal virus than sick cows.</answer>
