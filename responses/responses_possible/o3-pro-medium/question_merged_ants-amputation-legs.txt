<answer>Reduced hemolymph flow at thigh wounds slows bacteria, giving time for effective amputation, so selection favored amputations only there</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>abundance of hemolymph-pumping muscles in the thighs</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>closer (thigh) injuries yield higher amputation success than farther (lower-leg) injuries</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>saves energy by avoiding the need to produce an extra 10â€“20 % of workers</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>thigh injuries allow a long window for surgery; lower-leg injuries allow only a very narrow window</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>they slow hemolymph circulation, limiting bacterial spread and making post-amputation infection unlikely</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>rapid bacterial entry from lower-leg wounds thwarts amputation, whereas slow bacterial movement from thigh wounds makes it effective</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>injured ant calmly offers its leg, nestmate bites it off, then the ant presents the stump for cleaning</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>areas with many hemolymph-pumping muscles (thighs) correspond to ~90 % survival; areas lacking them (lower legs) to ~20 %</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>high amputee survival reduces replacement needs, greatly improving colony energy efficiency</answer>
