<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Modeling West Antarcticaâ€™s most unstable glacier shows runaway collapse may not occur even there, hinting that the wider ice sheet could be similarly stable.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It tests whether loss of the floating ice shelf would expose cliffs tall enough to start an ice-cliff collapse.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>If even Thwaites resists chain-reaction collapse, other Antarctic glaciers are likely less prone to such failure.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Greater uncertainty in sea-level forecasts and risk of overlooking rapid, catastrophic ice failures.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Finds the feared self-sustaining ice-cliff instability is less likely, challenging earlier, more alarming projections.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Faster seaward ice flow after shelf loss kept cliff faces from reaching destabilizing heights.</answer>

<answer>Assumes unabated, extremely high fossil-fuel emissions.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Higher flow speed limits cliff height; slower flow allows taller, more unstable cliffs.</answer>
