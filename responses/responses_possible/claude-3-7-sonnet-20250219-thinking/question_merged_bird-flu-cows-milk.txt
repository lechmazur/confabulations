<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The genomic sequencing suggests wildlife could transport the virus between farms, as infected blackbirds found miles from affected farms carried virus genetically similar to what was infecting cows on farms in different states.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It suggests the infection may start in the upper respiratory tract before moving to the mammary glands, contrary to assumptions that sick cows would show more respiratory viral presence.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>It shows that asymptomatic cows are more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk, suggesting multiple transmission pathways beyond milk that could facilitate spread.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>By showing virus transmission to other species like cats and raccoons, the study indicates that even with strict controls on cow and equipment movement, the virus could continue spreading through other infected animals.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The study implies wild birds might be involved in transporting the virus between farms in different states or introducing it to other wild animals, serving as long-distance vectors.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Wild blackbirds</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows are more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk, suggesting that testing milk samples alone is insufficient for surveillance.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows are more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The genomic analysis shows transmission to multiple species (cats, raccoons, wild birds), indicating the virus can establish itself in wildlife that moves freely between farms and isn't subject to farm control measures.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses than obviously sick ones.</answer>
