<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The lithium chlorine solution made crocodiles nauseous when they ate the toad carcasses, creating a taste aversion that prevented them from eating toxic cane toads in the wild, resulting in lower mortality rates compared to un-baited control sites.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The chicken necks demonstrated that crocodiles maintained their general appetite while specifically avoiding the tainted toads, showing the aversion was targeted to toads rather than being general appetite loss.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Each predator requires an aversion strategy fine-tuned to its hunting style - toad carcasses worked for crocodiles but yellow-spotted monitors needed live "trainer toads" because they actively pursue live prey and didn't respond to toad sausages.</answer>

<answer>According to Dr. Johnson, "It's not a one-and-done thing" and "Even if it's wildly successful, you have to maintain it." The article also notes "it remains to be seen how long these reptiles will retain this knowledge."</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Seuss's metaphor about a "seasick crocodile" accurately describes how crocodiles become lethargic rather than vomiting when nauseous - the exact behavior researchers leveraged in their taste aversion strategy.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The researchers left one river un-baited as a control site and included chicken necks alongside toad carcasses at bait stations, allowing them to compare mortality rates between treated and untreated areas and distinguish between specific toad aversion versus general appetite loss.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Crocodiles initially "scarfed down equal amounts of toad carcasses and chicken necks on the first day" but later consumed fewer toads while continuing to eat chicken necks, showing their initial enthusiasm didn't predict their eventual learned aversion.</answer>

<answer>Cane toads</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>When nauseous, crocodiles become lethargic rather than vomiting, which researchers leveraged to create taste aversion without the crocodiles regurgitating the tainted food.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>For crocodiles, researchers used dead toad carcasses injected with lithium chlorine solution, while for yellow-spotted monitors they used live juvenile "trainer toads" because the monitors actively pursue live prey and didn't respond to processed toad baits.</answer>
