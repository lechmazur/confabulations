<answer>Because in thigh injuries, reduced hemolymph flow makes it difficult for bacteria to move from the wound into the body, making amputation effective for preventing infection</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Many hemolymph-pumping muscles in the thighs</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Wounds closer to the body (thigh injuries) have more successful amputations than wounds further from the body (lower leg injuries)</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Colonies save energy by not having to produce 10-20% more ants to replace those lost to injuries</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Thigh injuries have a longer time window for successful amputation while lower leg injuries have a narrow time window</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Multiple muscles in thighs reduce hemolymph flow when injured, preventing bacteria from easily moving into the body</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Slower bacterial movement in thigh injuries allows time for successful amputation, while rapid bacterial movement in lower leg injuries makes amputation less effective</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The injured ant presents its injured leg, calmly sits while another ant gnaws it off, then presents the newly amputated wound for cleaning</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Higher concentration of hemolymph-pumping muscles in thighs correlates with higher amputation success rate (90% vs 20% for lower legs)</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>High survival rate (90%) of amputee ants means fewer replacement ants need to be produced, saving colony energy</answer>
