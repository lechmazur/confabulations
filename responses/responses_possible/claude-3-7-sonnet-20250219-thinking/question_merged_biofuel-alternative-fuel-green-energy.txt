<answer>Repsol's strategy of retrofitting refineries aligns with EU regulations by enabling production of sustainable aviation fuel that must increase from 2% in 2025 to 70% by 2050, while using existing infrastructure to reduce costs.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The paradox is that while Mayoral claims the plant is "quite flexible" and can use different types of waste, the article later notes there's a fundamental scarcity of these waste ingredients, with experts stating "there is a limit on the amount of feedstock."</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>While biofuels are presented as a practical solution for reducing emissions, environmentalists note that ingredients will likely need to be transported globally, creating additional emissions that could offset some of the claimed benefits.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The 70% sustainable aviation fuel requirement by 2050 creates challenges for Repsol due to feedstock scarcity, regulations complicated by priorities like protecting food supply and forests, and what the article describes as "dizzying complexity" that "gives people a headache from the long-term planning perspective."</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The irony is that while customers get "green credentials with little effort" by simply purchasing these fuels, producing them requires companies to "scour the globe" for increasingly "valuable and even scarce commodities" as feedstock.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Repsol is maintaining and retrofitting its existing refinery infrastructure to produce biofuels, while some of its rivals have chosen to close their traditional oil refineries completely.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Repsol faces challenges from cheap Chinese biodiesel imports, falling prices (sustainable aviation fuel prices dropped 40% in one year), concerns about oversupply, and market conditions that caused competitors like Shell to suspend biofuel plant construction.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Limited availability of waste ingredients could constrain production, as environmentalists note that "even if they took used oil from all the restaurants in Spain, it wouldn't be enough," forcing Repsol to source globally and seek alternative waste sources.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>While Repsol claims its biofuels will cut emissions by up to 90% compared to petroleum-based products, the global transportation of ingredients needed to produce these fuels would create additional emissions, potentially undermining some of the environmental benefits.</answer>
