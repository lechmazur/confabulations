<answer>The study identifies local "breaks" in emissions, while Trancik emphasizes that effective climate mitigation requires global-scale effects and technology development that can enable future emissions cuts across multiple locations, not just near-term effects in countries where policies were adopted.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The study shows that most emissions reductions resulted from combinations of multiple national policies rather than standalone approaches, supporting Meckling's explicit statement that "There is no silver bullet policy solution for climate mitigation."</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The methodology enabled identification of effective policy combinations, but had limitations including excluding agriculture/land use sector, missing data from many developing countries, and only measuring near-term effects within implementing countries rather than global or long-term impacts.</answer>

<answer>The exclusion of most African nations (only South Africa was included) along with many developing economies in Latin America and the Caribbean means the study's conclusions aren't truly global and may miss different challenges and solutions specific to these regions.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The study identified policies reducing 1.8 billion metric tons of carbon, but the Paris Agreement requires 23 billion metric tons of reductions by 2030. The study suggests that implementing best practices could close up to 41% of this emissions gap.</answer>
