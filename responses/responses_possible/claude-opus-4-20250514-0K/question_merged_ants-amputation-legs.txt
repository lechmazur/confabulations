<answer>When ants sustain a thigh injury, the flow of hemolymph is reduced, making it more difficult for bacteria to move from the wound into the body, and if the entire leg is amputated quickly, the chance of infection is very low</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>By rescuing the injured, they save an enormous amount of energy on the colony level, as colonies would need to produce 10 to 20 percent more ants to compensate for the loss of injured ants</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The many muscles in the thighs keep hemolymph flowing, and when they sustain a thigh injury, the flow of hemolymph is reduced, making it more difficult for bacteria to move from the wound into the body</answer>

<answer>When ants sustain a thigh injury, it's more difficult for bacteria to move from the wound into the body due to reduced hemolymph flow, but when they injure lower legs, bacteria can penetrate the body very quickly</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>

<question_number>9</question_number>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>By rescuing injured ants who survive 90 percent of the time with amputation, colonies save an enormous amount of energy as they would otherwise need to produce 10 to 20 percent more ants to compensate for losses</answer>
