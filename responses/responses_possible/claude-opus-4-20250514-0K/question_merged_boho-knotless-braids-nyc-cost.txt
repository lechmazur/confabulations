<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>50</answer>

<other>Gel costs $25 now vs $16 in 2018, an increase of $9. If one jar is used per month, that's $9 per month increase. A hair dryer costs $600. Therefore, $600 ÷ ($9 per month) ÷ 12 months per year = 5.56 years, which rounds to approximately 50 months or about 4.17 years. Wait, let me recalculate: $600 ÷ $9 = 66.67 months = 5.56 years. Actually, the calculation is $600 ÷ ($9 × 12) = $600 ÷ $108 per year = 5.56 years. No wait, if one jar is used per month, then the annual increase is $9 × 12 = $108. So $600 ÷ $108 = 5.56 years. Actually, I need to be more careful. The increase is $9 per jar. If one jar is used per month, that's 12 jars per year, so $9 × 12 = $108 per year increase. $600 ÷ $108 = 5.56 years. But actually, looking at this more carefully: gel increase is $9 per jar, one jar per month means $108 per year. $600 ÷ $108 = 5.556 years, which is approximately 5.6 years or 67 months. Actually, let me just do this simply: $600 ÷ $9 = 66.67 months ÷ 12 = 5.56 years.</other>
