<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The paradoxical situation is that while the updated Covid vaccines are now available, the vaccination rates among older Americans, especially those in nursing homes, remain low. Despite the increased risk of severe illness and death from Covid for this population, they are largely spurning the shots, with only 40% of people 75 and older taking last year's vaccine.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The main reason for the confusion and reluctance among nursing home residents, families, and staff is that they are being asked to receive Covid vaccinations more frequently than the usual annual flu shot schedule, with federal recommendations calling for older people to get two Covid shots per year.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The article states that last year's Covid vaccines offered moderate protection against getting infected, but those defenses waned over time. Across all ages, a vast majority of Americans who were hospitalized for Covid did not receive the shots offered last fall.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The article does not directly address the discrepancy between the approval of updated Covid vaccines and the emergence of new variants, and how this affects the perceived urgency of getting vaccinated among older Americans. The text does not provide information to answer this question.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The shift from federal bulk purchases to the commercial market for Covid vaccines has left the uninsured without a clear option for obtaining the shots, as the earlier Covid vaccines were purchased in bulk by the federal government and administered for free. This has created financial and logistical challenges for local health departments, who now have to record people's insurance information and ask insurers to reimburse the city for the shots.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The lack of funding for proactive vaccination campaigns has hindered the ability of public health departments to increase booster uptake among older Americans. The article states that the "money's gone" for the extra funding that health departments received during the pandemic to send teams to vaccinate people who were disabled and had to stay at home.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The factor related to both nursing homes and public health departments that is hindering vaccination efforts for older Americans is inadequate staffing and resources. The article mentions that nursing homes are dealing with "fatigue over repeated Covid vaccinations and distrust in federal guidance", while public health departments are short on funding for the proactive vaccination campaigns that drove uptake earlier in the pandemic.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The article states that while most Americans have acquired immunity against the virus from repeated infections or vaccinations, or both, older and immunocompromised Americans struggle to mount immune responses, leaving them exposed. Despite this, the article notes that in recent weeks, people have been hospitalized with Covid at a rate nearly twice as high as during the same time last year, and Covid was killing roughly 600 Americans each week, a substantial drop from this winter but double the number from this spring.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The article states that in many cases, the responsibility of finding vaccines for nursing home residents has been left to their relatives, due to the lack of major vaccination drives by the nursing homes themselves, even when local health departments offer to help.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The article indicates that the disappearance of certain community vaccination initiatives, such as the one organized by Dr. Zeke McKinney in Minneapolis, is connected to the drying up of federal funding for programs to bring shots to community centers, nursing homes, and people's front doors.</answer>
