<answer>Florida carpenter ants perform amputations only on thigh injuries because the flow of hemolymph (their version of blood) is reduced in the thigh, making it more difficult for bacteria to move from the wound into the body.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Florida carpenter ants have many muscles in their thighs that help keep the flow of hemolymph circulating.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>When a Florida carpenter ant injures its lower legs, bacteria can penetrate its body very quickly, so the time window for a successful amputation is narrow and the chance of it being successful is slim.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The amputation behavior benefits the entire Florida carpenter ant colony by saving lives and curbing the spread of pathogens, as roughly 10 to 20 percent of ants that go out hunting eventually get injured in their lifetime.</answer>

<answer>The time window for successful amputation is narrow and the chance of it being successful is slim when a Florida carpenter ant injures its lower legs, compared to thigh injuries.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The presence of multiple muscles in ant thighs helps maintain the flow of hemolymph, which contributes to the success of amputation as an infection prevention method.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Bacterial movement plays a key role in determining the effectiveness of amputation, as when a wound is further away from the body, bacteria can penetrate the body more quickly, reducing the chances of successful amputation.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The injured ant presents its injured leg and calmly sits there while another ant gnaws it off, and as soon as the leg drops off, the ant presents the newly amputated wound and the other ant finishes the job by cleaning it.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The correlation is that the presence of more hemolymph-pumping muscles in the thighs contributes to the success of amputations performed on thigh injuries, compared to lower leg injuries.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The high survival rate of amputee ants, around 90 percent, saves the Florida carpenter ant colony an enormous amount of energy that would otherwise be needed to produce 10 to 20 percent more ants to compensate for the injured ants that would have died without the amputation treatment.</answer>
