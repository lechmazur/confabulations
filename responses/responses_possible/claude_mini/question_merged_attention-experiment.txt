<answer>The ghostlike second reflection in Whistler's painting suggests that the artist may have changed his mind during the painting process and flipped the panel upside down to start over, creating a pentimento - a change to the artwork that emerges over time. Whistler described his paintings as arrangements of "line, form and color first", indicating he was more focused on the formal elements than depicting definitive subject matter.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>If the ghostly reflection was not originally part of Whistler's "Nocturne in Blue and Silver", it may suggest that the artist intentionally left it in for the viewer to discover, rather than trying to hide or remove it. This could reflect Whistler's approach of allowing the viewer to interpret the artwork rather than imposing a definitive meaning.</answer>

<answer>The article suggests that Professor Roberts' students initially react to her assignment to spend 3 hours looking at a single artwork with "horror", seeing it as both "impossible" and "remedial". This indicates that the perceived difficulty of sustained focus on a single piece of art is a significant challenge for many people.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The potential for a pentimento in Whistler's painting suggests that the artist's original intentions may not fully align with how the viewer ultimately interprets the artwork. The emergent reflection creates an ambiguity that allows for multiple interpretations, challenging the notion of a single, definitive meaning intended by the artist.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The article states that in Whistler's lecture, he described how "the poor buildings lose themselves in the dim sky, and the tall chimneys become campanili, and the warehouses are palaces in the night." This suggests that the artistic element of lighting, specifically the transition from day to night, transforms the industrial structures into more architectural, even majestic, forms.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The ghostly second reflection in the painting challenges the viewer's perception of time within the artwork, as it may represent a previous stage of the painting's creation that has emerged over time. This creates a sense of temporal ambiguity, where the viewer is unsure of the exact moment being depicted.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article does not directly connect Whistler's lecture on the interaction between nature and the artist with the conservator's theory about the painting's creation process. The article discusses these two elements separately without explicitly linking them.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests a parallel between the ghostly second reflection in Whistler's painting and the student reactions to Professor Roberts' assignment. Just as the painting's hidden reflection challenges the viewer's perception, the extended focus required by the assignment challenges the students' typical attention spans, leading to a sense of unease or difficulty.</answer>

<answer>Whistler's refusal to confirm the identities of figures in another painting, stating "They are just what you like," parallels the ambiguity created by the emergent pentimento in "Nocturne in Blue and Silver". Both examples suggest Whistler's intention to allow the viewer to interpret the artwork rather than imposing a definitive meaning.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The painting's subject matter of industrial structures and their reflections in the water relates to the challenges described in the research on typical office worker screen time. Just as the painting requires the viewer to focus on a static scene without constant change, the research indicates that office workers struggle to maintain attention on a single screen for more than a minute at a time.</answer>
