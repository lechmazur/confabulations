<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The unexpected formations, including immense terraces with rounded, swirling edges, and teardrop-shaped divots, challenged the previous assumption that the melting process smooths out the topography of underwater ice.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The researchers' use of dead reckoning for navigation under the ice shelf impacted the success rate of Ran's missions, as the robot had to navigate without GPS and there was "heart-in-throat tension each time the scientists slid Ran into the water".</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The presence of seals living in a fracture in the Dotson Ice Shelf was a potential factor in the loss of the robot Ran, as one of the seals could have started circling Ran underwater, causing it to become disoriented.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The researchers' findings challenged the assumption that melting smooths out the topography of underwater ice, as the complex features and indentations they discovered were found to persist.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The researchers were unable to survey the Thwaites Glacier due to too much sea ice in the way.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The underwater robot Ran, which was later lost during a subsequent expedition, initially captured the images of the enigmatic ice formations beneath the Dotson Ice Shelf.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The newly discovered topography, including features like immense terraces and teardrop-shaped divots, contradicted the previous scientific assumption that the melting process smooths out the underwater ice topography.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The Thwaites Glacier, which is estimated to potentially raise global sea levels by about two feet over several centuries, prompted the researchers to study the Dotson Ice Shelf instead when they were unable to access Thwaites due to too much sea ice.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The newly discovered complex topography of the ice shelf's underside could impact the understanding of overall melting patterns in response to ocean warming, as further study is required to determine how these features and indentations affect the overall melting process.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The researchers risked encountering the misconception that the underwater topography of ice shelves could be flat and featureless, which would have been a "letdown" according to the article.</answer>
