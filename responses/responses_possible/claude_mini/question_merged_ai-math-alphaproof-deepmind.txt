<answer>A "phase transition" - a transformative change - in the use of A.I. in mathematics and the ability of A.I. systems to do mathematics.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Solving I.M.O. problems is considered a benchmark for reaching artificial general intelligence (AGI), a system with capabilities ranging from emerging to competent to virtuoso to superhuman.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The fact that the A.I. system was able to tackle these I.M.O. problems at all represents a step-change in the history of mathematics, moving from computers only being able to prove very simple things to being able to prove things that humans can't.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The A.I. system performed at the level of a silver medalist, solving four out of six problems for a total of 28 points.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The A.I. system's ability to learn and keep learning without requiring a human teacher allows it to "rediscover knowledge for itself" and potentially solve the hardest problems that humans can solve and even go beyond those.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>If Google DeepMind can solve at least some hard I.M.O. problems, then a useful research-level mathematical tool can't be far away.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>It is possible to imagine a state of affairs where mathematicians are basically left with nothing to do if computers become better and far faster at everything that mathematicians currently do.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The A.I. system's performance in the I.M.O. represents the point at which computers went from only being able to prove very simple things to being able to prove things that humans can't, suggesting the potential for A.I. to surpass human capabilities in mathematical reasoning.</answer>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article does not discuss how the A.I. system's performance in the I.M.O. challenges the traditional role of human intuition in mathematical problem-solving.</other>
