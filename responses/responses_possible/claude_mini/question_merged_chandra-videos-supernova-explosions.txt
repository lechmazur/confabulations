<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article does not mention how the discovery of a singing black hole by Chandra challenged existing theories about the formation of massive black holes or the role of sound waves in intergalactic plasma.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Chandra's X-ray observations revealed that enigmatic flecks of light in the early universe, initially detected by the Webb telescope, were actually quasars -- young galaxies harboring supermassive black holes. This finding caused some astrophysicists to reconsider their ideas about how and when such massive black holes form.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The Chandra X-ray Observatory discovered a black hole that was periodically blowing bubbles in the hot, diffuse gas pervading a cluster of galaxies some 250 million light years away, producing sound waves -- an eternal note of B flat belted into intergalactic plasma.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The Crab nebula was created in the year 1054 in an explosion that was seen by Chinese and Japanese astronomers and recorded in Native American pictographs.</answer>

<answer>Riccardo Giacconi, a physicist who pioneered the field of X-ray astronomy, was the dream-child of the Chandra X-ray Observatory and won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2002.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Cassiopeia A, located about 11,000 light-years away from Earth, is the remains of a star that exploded as a supernova about 340 years ago. Nobody seems to have observed it at the time, but astronomers have recently pinpointed a bright dot at its center, a dense neutron star that is the squished leftover core of the original star.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Chandra scientists announced the discovery of a black hole with a mass of 80 million suns that was kicking up a rumpus back when the universe was only a half-billion years old. Scientists can't explain how it got so big so fast.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>William Faulkner's quote "The past is never dead. It's not even past." reflects the idea that everything that has ever happened in the history of the universe has left a mark on the sky, which Chandra's observations have been able to decipher.</answer>

<answer>The Crab nebula, observed by Chandra, was created in the year 1054 in an explosion that was seen by Chinese and Japanese astronomers and recorded in Native American pictographs.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The article states that chains of supernova explosions have acted as thermonuclear foundries over the course of cosmic history, progressively transforming a simple baby universe of hydrogen and helium into a more complex mix of the heavier elements needed for life as we know it. This connection between the elements in our cells and the elements shed into space by supernova remnants is mentioned.</answer>
