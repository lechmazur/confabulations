<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The seamount's height of about 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) is crucial in preventing A23a from drifting into warmer waters, as it creates a Taylor column that causes the iceberg to spin in place.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The seamount, which is about 100 kilometers across (62 miles) and rises up from the deep sea floor to a height of about 1,000 meters (3,280 feet), is causing the world's largest iceberg to rotate at a rate of about 15 degrees per day.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The melting of A23a, which originated from a floating ice shelf, would not significantly contribute to global sea level rise, as the ice is already floating in the ocean.</answer>

<answer>The iceberg A23a broke off from the Filchner Ice Shelf in 1986, when three icebergs, including the even larger A23, calved from the shelf.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Like the robotic float trapped in a Taylor column for four years near A23a's current location, the iceberg A23a could also spend an extended time in the vortex, leading to significant melting.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>A23a got caught in a Taylor column, a current that forms around seamounts and creates a stagnant cylinder of fluids above the underwater mountain, slowly rotating the water counterclockwise around the bump.</answer>

<answer>Christopher A. Shuman, a glaciologist and research professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, surmised that A23a would eventually go the way of other large icebergs -- toward the island of South Georgia in the South Atlantic and melt.</answer>
