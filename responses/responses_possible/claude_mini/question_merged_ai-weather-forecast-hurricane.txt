<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The A.I. approach, as demonstrated by GraphCast, fundamentally differs from traditional supercomputer methods in that it draws on what it has learned about the cause-and-effect relationships that govern the planet's weather, rather than relying on current readings and millions of calculations. GraphCast can produce a 10-day forecast in seconds, whereas a supercomputer would take more than an hour.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The article states that GraphCast was trained on four decades of global weather observations compiled by the European forecasting center, allowing it to identify subtle patterns and use that knowledge to predict the weather more accurately than the European agency's forecast for Hurricane Beryl.</answer>
