<question_number>2</question_number>

<answer>The consequences of Carlyle's decision to change the compensation structure without giving sellers a year to adjust, as initially planned by Ms. Renfrew, were that top sellers' commissions were drastically reduced, with one seller's monthly check being more than 60% less than the previous month's.</answer>

<answer>The multilevel marketing model played a key role in Beautycounter's initial success, as the company had a community of ardent promoters, most of them women, who evangelized the brand to their families, friends and neighbors. However, this model also contributed to the subsequent challenges after Carlyle's acquisition, as sellers started to leave and sales dropped.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
