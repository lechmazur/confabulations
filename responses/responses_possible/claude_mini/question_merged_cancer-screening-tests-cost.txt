<answer>Improved treatment for colon cancer and changing diets and exposures to other factors, like medications that might decrease risk.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Adamson questions the value of cancer screening because studies repeatedly failed to show that people live longer if they are screened, and screening barely lowers the death rate from the cancer being screened.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>According to Dr. Welch, the increase in screening did not accelerate the decline in colon cancer death rates, which have been on a linear decline for 40 years.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The implication is that the effects of cancer screening on mortality are so small that it takes huge clinical trials to observe them.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The 33% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality in the clinical trial mentioned by Dr. Welch represents a drop from 3% to 2%, which is just a 1 percentage point change, and there was no change at all in the overall mortality rate with screening.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The potential impact of improved colon cancer treatments on the perceived value of screening, as suggested by Dr. Welch, is that the decline in colon cancer death rates might be attributed more to the improved treatments than to the screening.</answer>

<answer>N/A</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The paradox in Dr. Adamson's view is that while he questions the effectiveness of cancer screening in reducing death rates, the article states that the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended screening to reduce the death rates for four of the five cancers in the study.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The contradiction in the article is that while it states that cancer death rates have been plummeting in the past few decades, it also suggests that the effects of cancer screening on mortality are so small that it takes huge clinical trials to observe them.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that the decline in cancer death rates might be attributed to factors other than screening, such as improved treatment for colon cancer and changing diets and exposures to other factors, like medications that might decrease risk.</answer>
