<answer>The higher rates of swelling and bleeding in the donanemab trial compared to the Leqembi trial could negatively impact the perception of Kisunla's safety.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that the higher price of Kisunla compared to Leqembi is justified by the expectation that patients can stop Kisunla after their plaques are cleared, which could reduce the overall cost and inconvenience of the treatment.</answer>
