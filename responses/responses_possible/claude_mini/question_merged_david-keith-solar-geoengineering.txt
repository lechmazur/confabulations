<answer>Intentionally spraying a pollutant (sulfur dioxide) into the sky to block some sunlight and lower global temperatures.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The Oxford atmospheric physicist Raymond Pierrehumbert considers solar geoengineering a "grave threat to human civilization" and believes that even doing research on it is "not just a waste of money, but actively dangerous", in contrast to the central figure David Keith who believes the risks are "well understood" and "quantitatively small compared to the benefits".</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The 1992 paper by David Keith raised questions about who should authorize the use of geoengineering technologies and who is liable if something goes wrong, which are the same governance concerns raised by critics of solar geoengineering.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The central figure David Keith believes that since humans have already altered the planet by heating the climate with greenhouse gases, we may need to take even more drastic action and engineer the stratosphere to return the climate to a more pristine, pre-industrial state.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The $72 million personal windfall that David Keith received from the sale of his company Carbon Engineering to Occidental Petroleum contrasts with the up to $100 million funding for his new academic program on geoengineering at the University of Chicago.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Seeing a glacier that had shrunk dramatically in recent years during his birthday hike in the Canadian Rockies confirmed David Keith's belief that global warming is upending the natural world, and motivated him to push further on solar geoengineering.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>David Keith agrees that nations should stop burning fossil fuels, but believes solar geoengineering is needed in addition to that to lower global temperatures.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article does not mention any connection between David Keith's dyslexia, late reading development, and his eventual career in experimental physics.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>"A lesson I've learned from this is that if we do this again, we won't be open in the same way," indicating that David Keith plans to be less transparent about future solar geoengineering experiments in response to the protests against the Scopex experiment.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>According to Raymond Pierrehumbert, if solar geoengineering was abruptly stopped, it could result in a "potentially massive temperature rise in an unprepared world over a matter of five to 10 years, hitting the Earth's climate with something that it probably hasn't seen since the dinosaur-killing impactor".</answer>
