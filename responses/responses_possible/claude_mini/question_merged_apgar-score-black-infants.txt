<answer>The study found that although Black newborns had lower Apgar scores at one and five minutes than non-Black babies and were admitted to the NICU at higher rates, they did not have more abnormal umbilical cord gas values, which are an objective measure of the newborn's metabolic condition and oxygen levels.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The skin color portion of the Apgar test was found to be driving the racial discrepancies in the first Apgar tests, given one minute after birth.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The study found that there was no difference in the umbilical cord gases between Black and non-Black babies, despite the difference in Apgar scores.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Low Apgar scores were far more inaccurate predictors of poor outcomes for Black babies than for Asian babies. Asian infants with low Apgar scores were 100 times more likely to die than Asian babies with normal scores, while low-scoring Black babies were only 23 times more likely to die than those with normal scores.</answer>

<answer>Only 1.2 percent of Chinese-American infants got a perfect Apgar score of 10, compared to 3.3 percent of white babies.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Low Apgar scores were 54 times more likely to predict mortality for white babies, compared to only 23 times more likely for Black babies.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that the Apgar test's reliance on skin color could be resulting in extra medical treatment, such as admission to the NICU, being heaped on healthy babies of color.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The study by Dr. Sara E. Edwards and her colleagues specifically identified the skin color component as the driver of racial discrepancies in Apgar scores.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The article mentions that if skin color is taken out of the Apgar score, it may be hard to find another measure to replace it, as umbilical cord gas analyses and pulse oximetry have also been found to be less accurate for Black patients.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The article states that the American Academy of Pediatrics does not emphasize the Apgar score at all, and instead stresses a quick assessment of breathing and heart rate to guide resuscitation decisions, not color.</answer>
