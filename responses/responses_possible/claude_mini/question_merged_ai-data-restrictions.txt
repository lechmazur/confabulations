<answer>Smaller A.I. companies and academic researchers may face challenges in accessing high-quality training data from public data sets like Common Crawl because major tech companies already have access to that data, and changing the data licenses does not retroactively revoke that permission.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The paradoxical effect is that while major tech companies already have access to the extensive data, changing the data licenses primarily impacts later-arriving actors, such as smaller start-ups and researchers, who are typically excluded from that initial data access.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Many researchers doubt that today's A.I. systems are capable of generating enough high-quality synthetic data to replace the human-created data that A.I. companies are losing access to.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The potential consequence for A.I. companies is that if they continue to treat the internet as an "all-you-can-eat data buffet", the web will start shutting its doors and restricting access to that data.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that the data restrictions could disproportionately affect smaller A.I. companies and researchers, as major tech companies already have access to the data, while the primary impact is on later-arriving actors who typically cannot afford to license data directly from publishers.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The implication is that the major tech companies that have already gathered extensive data will not be as impacted by the changing data licenses, as their existing data access is not retroactively revoked.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The significance is that the data restrictions primarily impact smaller start-ups and researchers who are trying to enter the A.I. field, rather than the major tech companies that have already established access to the data.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that the data restrictions may lead to a reevaluation of the relationship between A.I. companies and data creators, as the web owners start to exert more control over the use of their data and demand more value in return.</answer>

<answer>According to the article, up to 45% of the data in the C4 dataset has been restricted by websites' terms of service, in addition to the 25% of data from the highest-quality sources that has been restricted through the Robots Exclusion Protocol.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The article states that the researchers estimate 25% of data from the highest-quality sources in the studied datasets has been restricted.</answer>
