<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The industry claims the colder waters of the Magallanes will limit disease outbreaks and make it easier to reduce antibiotic use, but the article suggests this may not be the case and the region could still face the same ecological issues seen in northern Chile.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The industry portrays salmon farming in southern Patagonia as coming from "very pure, pure waters in pure places", while environmentalists and Indigenous groups raise concerns about the industry's potential to damage the region's unique ecosystems and biodiversity.</answer>
