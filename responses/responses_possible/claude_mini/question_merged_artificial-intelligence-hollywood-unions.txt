<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The sound editor's experience with iZotope software, which diminished the craftsmanship involved in sound editing but made it more efficient, is seen as evidence that AI could soon displace editors and other Hollywood craftspeople in a similar way.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>IATSE members hoped to negotiate protections similar to what Hollywood writers won last year, including a prohibition on requiring writers to use AI programs like ChatGPT for scripts or outlines, but the new IATSE contract did not include such measures.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The IATSE contract says studios won't require workers to "provide prompts" that lead to the displacement of union members, but also says studios can "require employees to use any AI system", which differs from the writers' union contract that prohibited the use of AI for scripts and outlines.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The Animation Guild, which represents not just artists and character designers but also writers and directors, faces even bigger threats from AI than other IATSE members, as animation studios often outsource work to nonunion shops, some of which appear intent on experimenting with AI.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Brandon Jarratt, a member of the Animation Guild's board and its AI task force, said the challenge is how much leverage and pressure the guild can put on AI provisions, given that the parent union's AI provisions may have set a precedent that makes their task harder.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The sound editor's description suggests that while the iZotope software diminished the craftsmanship involved, it still required the sound editor's refined ear, whereas new generative AI programs have enabled someone with almost no training to largely achieve what the sound editor previously accomplished.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Christopher Glass, an IATSE member and production designer, critiqued the contract language that says studios can "require employees to use any AI system", noting that this provision is not necessary and the writers' union contract did not have a similar requirement.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The contract's approach allows studios to require employees to use any AI system, which differs from the prohibitions on using AI for scripts and outlines that some IATSE members had sought.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>IATSE leadership cited that the union contract covers dozens of different crafts, making sweeping prohibitions on AI less practical compared to the writers' contract, which covers a single craft.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The contract's language on not requiring workers to "provide prompts" that lead to the displacement of union members is related to concerns that studios will simply hire fewer workers for each project, knowing that AI will make them more productive.</answer>
