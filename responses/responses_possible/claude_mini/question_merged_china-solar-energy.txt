<answer>Longi Green Energy Technology is furloughing workers instead of laying them off permanently, which contradicts the industry's overall approach of laying off thousands of workers to cut costs.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The housing crisis in China is making it hard for local governments to sell long-term leases on state land to real estate developers, which was previously their biggest source of cash to support local solar companies like Sunzone.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The overcapacity in China's solar industry, where the country's solar factory capacity is roughly double the entire world's demand, mirrors the challenge faced by China's automotive sector, where annual car sales are around 25 million, more than any other country but barely half the country's ability to make vehicles.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The article states that China's banks, acting at Beijing's direction, have lent so much money to the solar sector for factory construction that the country's solar factory capacity is roughly double the entire world's demand, which contradicts the government's strategy of letting companies compete and fail.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The article states that the European Union has begun barring the use of Chinese solar panels in government procurement projects unless Chinese companies disclose their subsidies, which they refuse to do. If the Biden administration were to adopt a similar policy, they would likely bar the use of Chinese solar panels in U.S. government procurement projects unless the Chinese companies disclose their subsidies.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that Longi Green Energy Technology is furloughing workers in preparation for even bigger production pushes in the future, rather than laying them off permanently.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The article states that European countries have begun barring the use of Chinese solar panels in government procurement projects unless Chinese companies disclose their subsidies, which they refuse to do. Therefore, if a Chinese solar company were to fully disclose its government subsidies, it would likely face the consequence of being barred from European government procurement projects.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that if a Chinese solar company were to pivot to a new industry favored by the government, like Sunzone Optoelectronics' founder did with artificial intelligence and electric cars, they would face the risk of the government withdrawing support and letting the company "stumble and even fail in large numbers" as has happened in the solar industry.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The article states that China's solar panel manufacturers are resilient and have restarted operations, often with the help of banks and local governments, after collapsing a decade ago. This suggests that Chinese solar panel manufacturers may still be able to compete in the American market despite the imposition of tariffs.</answer>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article does not provide information about the potential impact on the global supply of solar panels if the Chinese government were to completely withdraw its support from the solar industry.
