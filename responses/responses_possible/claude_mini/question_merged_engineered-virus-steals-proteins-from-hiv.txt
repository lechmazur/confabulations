<answer>Daily doses of protease inhibitors are too expensive for most people with H.I.V. to rely on, while lenacapavir may be more effective but also difficult to ensure people keep up with twice-yearly shots. In contrast, the article states that just one shot of TIPs may keep H.I.V. at low levels permanently.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The article states that if TIPs make it through clinical trials, they might not only hold off the development of AIDS, but also make it harder for people to transmit H.I.V. to others.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The critical factor is that TIPs insert themselves into the DNA of a patient's immune cells, becoming a permanent part of their bodies, unlike traditional H.I.V. treatments.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The article states that traditional H.I.V. drugs attack the virus itself, while TIPs take an entirely different approach by creating an impostor virus that interferes with H.I.V.'s normal life cycle.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The most significant challenge is that if TIPs turn out to have unexpected side effects, it may not be possible to remove them since they become a permanent part of the patient's body.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The article states that the TIPs are engineered to do a better job of entering the protein shells of the infected cells, allowing them to replicate more efficiently than the H.I.V. viruses.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The most significant risk is that people with TIPs can potentially spread them to others, and doctors cannot obtain consent from anyone else who is infected with them.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>According to the article, the reason TIPs could be considered a universal approach to developing antivirals is that other viruses might also be vulnerable to the same strategy of using a cheating virus to interfere with the normal life cycle of the target virus.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The article states that if doctors obtain consent from patients to treat them with TIPs, they cannot receive consent from anyone else who is infected with them, which complicates the ethical considerations of its use.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The article states that traditional H.I.V. drugs attack the virus itself, while TIPs take an entirely different approach by creating an impostor virus that interferes with H.I.V.'s normal life cycle.</answer>
