<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The implication is that the researchers believe it is unacceptable to know that a significant number of patients diagnosed as vegetative or minimally conscious may actually have some level of awareness, and yet not take action to further investigate and potentially help these patients communicate with the outside world.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Cognitive motor dissociation</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that the brain implants developed to help people with other conditions, such as ALS, may also be able to help patients with cognitive motor dissociation communicate in the future.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that patients who managed to survive for a longer period after their injuries may have been more resilient, and this resilience may have made them more likely to remain aware compared to those who died sooner.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The article draws a parallel between the potential future use of brain implants to help patients with disorders of consciousness communicate, and a recent breakthrough where a patient with ALS was able to communicate through a brain implant after just 30 minutes of training.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The study suggests that up to 100,000 patients in the United States alone might have some level of consciousness despite being diagnosed with disorders of consciousness.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The study's use of both functional MRI and electrode recordings to assess patient awareness strengthens its findings compared to earlier research that relied solely on functional MRI.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that the development of brain-computer interfaces may allow patients with cognitive motor dissociation to eventually communicate with the outside world.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>According to Dr. Schiff, "We have tens of thousands of people like that," referring to patients who may be able to benefit from brain implants in the future.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that the study may be missing some patients with some awareness, as the tests were so demanding that some patients with awareness probably did not score positive results.</answer>
