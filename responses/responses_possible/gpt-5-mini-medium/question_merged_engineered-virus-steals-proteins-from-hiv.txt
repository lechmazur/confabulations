<answer>one-time injection potentially eliminates need for twice-yearly shots, improving adherence</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>reduced H.I.V. transmission</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>TIPs permanently insert into patients' DNA and may spread to others, so consent from secondary recipients cannot be obtained</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>they parasitize H.I.V.'s replication by stealing resources and outcompeting the virus rather than directly inhibiting viral enzymes</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>permanence in patients' DNA making unexpected side effects potentially irreversible</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>engineered advantage in entering viral shells leading infected cells to release three times more TIPs than H.I.V.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>unexpected side effects that cannot be removed because TIPs integrate permanently into DNA</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>the cheating-virus strategy could be applied to other viruses</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>it could lead to people being infected with TIPs without their consent, preventing consent from those secondarily exposed</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>protease inhibitors block a viral enzyme; TIPs are engineered viral particles that hijack and outcompete H.I.V.'s replication machinery</answer>
