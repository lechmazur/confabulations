<answer>It aligns: retrofitting lets Repsol produce sustainable aviation fuel needed to meet the EU's rising mandates (2% in 2025 to 70% by 2050).</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Paradox: plant touted as "quite flexible" to use various wastes, yet feedstock is scarce so flexibility may be limited.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Contradiction: biofuels are seen as practical because they fit existing infrastructure, but sourcing and transport logistics may create emissions and shortages that undermine that practicality.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The 2050 mandate requires sharply increased sustainable fuel volumes, creating pressure to secure large amounts of sustainable feedstock amid supply, sustainability and planning constraints.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Irony: customers get easy "green" credentials at the pump, while the underlying sourcing may involve long-distance imports, scarcity and sustainability questions.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Contradiction: fuels perform well in cold climates, yet the needed ingredients may be hard to source locally and might require distant imports that complicate logistics and emissions.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Repsol is retrofitting and transforming existing refineries to make biofuels, whereas some competitors have closed traditional refineries.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Challenge from cheap imports (notably Chinese biodiesel), alleged dumping, tariffs, oversupply and competition for scarce feedstock could erode Repsol's edge.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Production could be constrained by limited supplies of waste like cooking oil, forcing imports or limiting output despite preference for local collection.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Contradiction: marketed as a practical emissions solution using current infrastructure, yet logistical hurdles—feedstock scarcity, transport emissions and sustainability concerns—could negate those benefits.</answer>
