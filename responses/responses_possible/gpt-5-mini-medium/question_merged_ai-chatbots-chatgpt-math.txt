<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>They are optimized for probabilistic language prediction rather than rules-based calculations.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Despite vast relevant training data improving apparent proficiency, that pattern-matching training does not guarantee correct rule-based mathematical accuracy.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Chatbots use neural-network probabilistic language prediction and sometimes call external calculators, whereas traditional computers follow step-by-step, rules-based precise calculations.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Computing has shifted from being primarily precise, rules-based number-crunching to neural-network, language-focused systems that predict words rather than perform exact math.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It shows modern A.I. excels at language fluency but often lacks the tireless, accurate calculation that historically defined computing as "math on steroids."</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Students compare bot answers with their own, using errors as a focal point to sharpen critical thinking.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>It emphasizes language fluency and pattern recognition as AI's main strengths rather than numerical accuracy.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>AI math shortcomings bolster the debate between scaling large language models versus pursuing broader approaches like world modeling and adding rules-based systems.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>By excelling at language but struggling at math, AI blurs the expected divide, appearing more like a liberal-arts specialist than a STEM number-cruncher.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>He says AI is impressive for language but not for accuracy in critical applications, so structured, rules-based software is needed alongside large language models.</answer>
