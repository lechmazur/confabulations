<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The Grinch metaphor evokes a seasick, lethargic crocodile, paralleling how induced nausea made crocodiles lethargic and less likely to hunt toads, underpinning the aversion strategy.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>By using an un-baited control gorge and alternative food controls (chicken necks) and monitoring with cameras, the experiment allowed direct comparison to show baiting caused specific aversion and lower mortality.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Although crocodiles initially consumed as many toads as chicken necks, their toad consumption declined over time, showing early acceptance did not predict long-term avoidance.</answer>
