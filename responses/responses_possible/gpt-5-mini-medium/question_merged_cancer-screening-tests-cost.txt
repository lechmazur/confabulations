<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>studies repeatedly fail to show people live longer / screening barely lowers death rates</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>the increase in screening did not accelerate the decline; the decline was linear even when few were screened</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>the mortality benefit of screening is very small, so huge clinical trials are needed to detect it</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>a 33% relative reduction but only a 1 percentage-point absolute reduction (from 3% to 2%) and no change in overall mortality</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>improved treatments could explain much of the mortality decline, reducing the apparent value of screening</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>changing diets may lower colon cancer risk and thus contribute to falling death rates independent of screening</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>although screening is widely believed to save lives and is recommended, he believes evidence shows it barely reduces death rates</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
