<answer>Using Thwaites as a vulnerable, fast-receding case study shows that even in worst-case shelf-loss scenarios the glacier's accelerated flow can prevent cliff heights that would trigger runaway collapse, informing assessments of West Antarctica's broader stability.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It allowed testing worst-case shelf removal (today or 2065) to see if exposed cliffs would grow tall enough to collapse, showing shelf loss led to faster flow that prevented cliff instability.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>As a Florida-size, fast-receding exemplar, Thwaites serves as a case study suggesting ice-cliff-instability may be less likely elsewhere, though broader conclusions require more observations.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Rapid collapses can be missed, leading to insufficient data and greater uncertainty in models and projections.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It suggests the previously feared runaway ice-cliff collapse is less likely, challenging the idea that such collapse would rapidly destabilize West Antarctica.</answer>

<answer>The glacier's ice flowed more quickly out to sea (increased flow speed), preventing cliffs from growing tall enough to trigger runaway breakdown.</answer>

<answer>Observations of how ice behaves when it fractures (ice-fracture/collapse behavior)</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>That nations' emissions of heat-trapping gases will climb to extremely high levels (continued high fossil-fuel burning)</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Faster glacier flow reduces/prevents cliffs from becoming taller; taller cliffs are more prone to collapse.</answer>
