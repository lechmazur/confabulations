<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It revealed limited buffers in a self-sustaining system: production cycles, a CO2 shortage and high import costs left local growers unable to meet sudden extra demand.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>An external social-media craze produced rapid demand that Iceland's local greenhouse production and limited import options could not absorb.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>

<answer>Empty store shelves and the need for an emergency import from the Netherlands undercut Iceland's reputation for self-sustaining agriculture.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>It exposed greenhouse limitations—99% local production, fixed production cycles and a CO2 shortage—preventing rapid scale-up and causing sell-outs and imports.</answer>
