<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>By showing that conspiracists point to Biden’s poor debate showing as a small, factual "nugget" to justify the larger, unproven claim that Democratic elites are scheming to replace him.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>By noting that the belief Biden is a puppet of Democratic elites or the "Deep State" supports the idea that those elites control him and could therefore orchestrate his replacement.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>

<question_number>7</question_number>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>By explaining that replacing a candidate would trigger political upheaval and factional fights, making a quiet, orchestrated switch nearly impossible and undermining the conspiracy’s premise of an easy, secret transition.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>By reporting the claim that Democrats could swap in a new candidate to "get the honeymoon phase"—i.e., brief uncritical support without scrutiny—which the conspiracy says would be a motive for replacing Biden.</answer>
