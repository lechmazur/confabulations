<answer>That wildlife can transport and disseminate the virus between farms, potentially moving it from infected dairies to new locations.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It suggests infection may begin in the upper respiratory tract and that asymptomatic cows can have nasal infection, contradicting the idea that the virus primarily starts in the mammary glands and only sick cows shed nasally.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>It shows additional transmission routes (respiratory and urine) exist, meaning focus on milk alone may miss significant asymptomatic spread.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Interspecies transmission to cats and raccoons creates extra routes of spread beyond cow and equipment movement, so those controls alone may be insufficient.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>That wild birds may act as carriers, potentially transporting the virus between farms or introducing it to other wild animals.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Wild blackbirds</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows often shed virus in nasal swabs and urine rather than in milk, so milk-based surveillance can miss infections.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have virus in their noses or urine than in their milk.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Cross-species infections and wildlife-mediated spread create routes outside farm-focused measures, reducing those measures' effectiveness.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely than obviously sick cows to have virus present in their noses.</answer>
