<answer>It shows primate vocal tracts are "speech ready," implying anatomy may not be the barrier to speech.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It offers a simpler explanation that the sounds could be standard pant-grunts (e.g., two pant-grunts concatenated) rather than learned "mama" words.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Analysis found a vowel after a consonant and a unique wordlike acoustic profile judged by listeners as "mama," inconsistent with a pant-grunt explanation.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>From anecdotal/adoption-era claims to systematic acoustic analysis, comparison with human utterances, and listener transcription experiments.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>If vocal tracts are "speech ready," then combining consonants and vowels likely depends on neural coordination (jaw/throat) rather than vocal anatomy.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Shows chimpanzees produced and learned humanlike sounds ("mama"), challenging the idea that only humans can learn new sounds from others.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Their wordlike vocalizations provide evidence that apes may possess some mental/neural requirements for speech, challenging the view that they entirely lack essential brain features.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>By showing chimps can add a vowel after a consonant, the discovery suggests they may share some of the coordinated jaw/throat control associated with human speech.</answer>
