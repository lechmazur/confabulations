<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Because thigh injuries reduce hemolymph flow, limiting bacterial spread and making quick amputation effective</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Many hemolymph-pumping muscles located in the thighs</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Amputations are more successful when the wound is closer to the body (thigh) and less successful when farther away (lower leg)</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Saves colony energy by rescuing workers and avoiding the need to produce roughly 10–20% more ants</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Thigh injuries: amputation can be effective with low infection risk; lower-leg injuries: very narrow time window and low chance of success</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Thigh muscles pump hemolymph; when a thigh is injured flow is reduced, hindering bacterial movement and making amputation effective</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>If bacteria can move into the body quickly (lower leg) amputation is ineffective; if bacterial movement is hindered by reduced hemolymph flow (thigh) amputation is effective</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The injured ant presents its leg and calmly allows a nestmate to gnaw it off, then presents the wound to be cleaned</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>A high concentration of hemolymph-pumping muscles in the thigh correlates with high amputation success; wounds farther from those muscles correlate with low success</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>High amputee survival (90%) reduces the need to produce about 10–20% more ants, saving substantial colony energy</answer>
