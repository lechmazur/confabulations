<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The study shows most large reductions came from combinations of policies rather than single measures, undermining the idea of a single "silver bullet."</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Strengths: statistical models to detect 63 breaks and machine learning to match policies from 1,500 entries; Weaknesses: excludes agriculture/land use, omits hundreds of countries, and assesses only near-term, within-country effects.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Hundreds of countries are missing—particularly developing economies in Africa—so the conclusions are not globally representative; only South Africa is included from Africa.</answer>
