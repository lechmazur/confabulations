<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>It notes post-1994 de-icing improvements to the ATR model, which could misleadingly downplay icing as a cause.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>If the recorded speed drop alone was insufficient to stall, then only extremely severe icing (which raises stall speed) could make a stall possible.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The aircraft’s rubber-tube anti-icing system (and the possibility of its failure) versus a relatively warm ground temperature (~63°F) undermines the likelihood of fatal severe icing.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The plane was seen spinning slowly as it fell and crashed almost directly on its belly, not in a rapid nose-down impact often associated with stalls.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The last recorded speed did not drop low enough to cause a stall unless icing was so severe that it raised the stall speed dramatically.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The pilots did not communicate with air traffic control or declare an emergency or request descent despite severe-icing protocols.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The ground temperature at the crash site was about 63 degrees, contradicting assumptions of very cold conditions for extreme icing.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The post-1994 upgrade to the ATR’s de-icing system paradoxically complicates the investigation by raising the question of whether the improved system failed.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The presence of rubber inflatable/deflatable tubes on the wings as the de-icing mechanism.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The aircraft fell from about 17,000 feet, suggesting a sudden loss of lift rather than a slow, gradual accumulation of ice.</answer>
