<answer>By adding immense freshwater to the North Atlantic that freshens surface waters, reduces sinking of dense salty water, and can slow or stall the AMOC</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Surface lowering exposes more ice to warmer air at lower elevation, accelerating melt</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>It freshens the North Atlantic, making surface water lighter and reducing the sinking that drives the circulation, causing a slowdown</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Thaw frees organic carbon that microbes convert to CO2 and methane, which warm the climate and intensify heat, fires and rain, causing more thaw</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It could upend European weather patterns</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>By contributing to changes in ocean circulation and rainfall (via freshwater-induced AMOC disruption) that could reduce Amazon rainfall and lead to forest degradation</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>It could upend tropical weather patterns</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>By infusing the North Atlantic with freshwater that freshens surface waters, reduces dense-water sinking, and weakens the AMOC</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Microbial conversion of thawed carbon to CO2 and methane increases greenhouse gases, which amplify warming, fires and rain, causing further thaw</answer>
