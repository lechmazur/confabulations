<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>By showing that even at highly unstable Thwaites, simulations did not produce runaway cliff collapse, implying greater overall stability</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It showed that removing the ice shelf speeds glacier flow and prevents cliffs from reaching unstable heights</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>By modeling a worst case at a highly unstable glacier and not finding runaway collapse, suggesting similar cliff-instability is less likely elsewhere</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Missed rapid collapses and insufficient data, undermining reliable sea-level projections</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It suggests runaway ice-cliff collapse is less likely than previously assumed</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Faster glacier outflow after ice-shelf loss, which kept cliffs from growing too tall</answer>
