<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Because thigh injuries reduce hemolymph flow, slowing bacterial spread and making amputation effective</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Many hemolymph-pumping muscles in the thighs</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Wounds closer to the body (thigh) have higher amputation success; farther away (lower leg) have lower success</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Saves enormous colony energy by reducing the need to produce 10–20% more ants</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Lower leg injuries: very narrow window; thigh injuries: less constrained due to reduced hemolymph flow</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>They reduce hemolymph flow after thigh injury, slowing bacterial movement so amputation prevents infection</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Rapid bacterial penetration at distal wounds reduces effectiveness; impeded movement at thigh wounds makes it effective</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The injured ant presents its leg, calmly allows it to be gnawed off, then presents the stump for cleaning</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Muscle concentration in the thigh coincides with high amputation success; lower legs show low success</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>By increasing amputee survival, the colony avoids producing 10–20% more ants, saving energy</answer>
