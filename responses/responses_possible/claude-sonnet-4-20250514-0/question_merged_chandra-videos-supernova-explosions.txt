<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Chandra's X-ray observations revealed that enigmatic flecks of light initially detected by the Webb telescope were actually quasars -- young galaxies harboring supermassive black holes, causing some astrophysicists to reconsider their ideas about how and when such massive black holes form.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>A singing black hole that had been periodically blowing bubbles in hot, diffuse gas pervading a cluster of galaxies some 250 million light years away, producing an eternal note of B flat.</answer>

<answer>The Crab nebula was created in an explosion in 1054 that was recorded in Native American pictographs.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>A black hole with a mass of 80 million suns that was active when the universe was only a half-billion years old.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Both reflect the idea that the past is never dead and continues to have ongoing effects - Faulkner's literary perspective that "The past is never dead. It's not even past" parallels how Chandra observes ongoing effects of ancient cosmic events.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions the Crab nebula was observed by Chinese astronomers and recorded in Native American pictographs, but doesn't describe the pictographs as "cultural artifacts" or establish a direct link between Chinese observations and Native American pictographs.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Supernova explosions have acted as thermonuclear foundries transforming hydrogen and helium into heavier elements needed for life, with the past marching on "in our cells as well as in the sky."</answer>
