<other>I need to carefully read through the article and answer each question based solely on the information provided, following the specified format.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Kohli described the result as a "phase transition" -- a transformative change -- "in the use of A.I. in mathematics and the ability of A.I. systems to do mathematics" because it was the first time that A.I. has achieved a medal-worthy performance on an Olympiad's problems.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>According to Dr. Davies, mathematics requires "this interesting combination of abstract, precise and creative reasoning," and this repertoire of abilities makes math a good litmus test for the ultimate goal of reaching artificial general intelligence (A.G.I.), a system with capabilities ranging from emerging to competent to virtuoso to superhuman.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>According to Dr. Silver, the A.I. system's performance represents "the point at which we went from computers only being able to prove very, very simple things toward computers being able to prove things that humans can't" and represents "a step-change in the history of mathematics."</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The A.I. system's ability to solve four out of six problems for 28 points means it performed at the level of a silver medalist, demonstrating medal-worthy mathematical reasoning comparable to high-achieving human competitors.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>According to Dr. Silver, since the algorithm doesn't require a human teacher, it can "learn and keep learning and keep learning until ultimately it can solve the hardest problems that humans can solve" and "maybe even one day go beyond those."</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>According to Dr. Gowers, "It's a fairly safe bet that if Google DeepMind can solve at least some hard I.M.O. problems, then a useful research tool can't be all that far away."</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>According to Dr. Gowers, "It is possible to imagine a state of affairs where mathematicians are basically left with nothing to do" if computers became better and far faster at everything mathematicians currently do, though he notes there still seems to be quite a long way to go before computers can do research-level mathematics.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Silver suggests the system could eventually "solve the hardest problems that humans can solve" and "maybe even one day go beyond those," indicating potential for A.I. to surpass human mathematical reasoning capabilities.</answer>
