<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Carlyle lost all the money it put into the company (approximately $700 million total investment), making it one of the worst investments in the firm's 37-year history, with the company ultimately being shut down and handed over to lenders.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Almost as soon as Carlyle bought the brand, sellers started to leave and Beautycounter sales started to drop, which was a shocking reversal for the company that had seen sales grow sharply month after month for years.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Sellers were shocked when Marc Rey told them to stop emphasizing "clean beauty" because it was no longer "sexy" or a clear differentiator, and instead focus on "the environment" as the new "sexy," which attacked the founding ethos that motivated the sellers to join the company.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Top sellers' commissions were drastically reduced (some by more than 60 percent), sellers sent shocked texts saying "WTF," some tried working with other multilevel marketers to make up lost income, and many sellers ultimately left the company.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Sellers filed lawsuits in Minnesota and California challenging nonsolicitation agreements that prevented them from recruiting people they had brought to Beautycounter, with plaintiffs arguing they never signed or saw these agreements until the company used them against the sellers.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Marc Rey's changes included drastically reducing seller commissions, dismissing the founding "clean beauty" ethos, and taking a dismissive tone with top sellers, which led to seller departures, legal challenges, and continued sales declines despite his mainstream beauty expertise.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The multilevel marketing model initially drove success through 60,000 enthusiastic sellers who recruited others and earned commissions from their networks, but after Carlyle's acquisition, the model became problematic when compensation changes and cultural shifts caused massive seller departures and sales declines.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>

<question_number>9</question_number>
