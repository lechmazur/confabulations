<other>I need to carefully read through the article and answer each question based solely on the information provided. Let me analyze each question systematically.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions that daily doses of protease inhibitors are too expensive for most people with H.I.V. in poor countries, and while lenacapavir may be more effective, it may be difficult to ensure people keep up with twice-yearly shots. It suggests TIPs may keep H.I.V. at low levels permanently with just one shot, but doesn't directly compare TIPs to lenacapavir in terms of a primary reason for better protection in poor countries.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It might make it harder for people to transmit H.I.V. to others</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>TIPs can potentially spread to others, but doctors cannot receive consent from anyone else who might be infected with them</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article describes how TIPs work as molecular mimics that steal proteins from H.I.V., while protease inhibitors prevent a protease protein from activating H.I.V., but doesn't explicitly state what the most significant advantage is in terms of mechanism of action.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>If TIPs have unexpected side effects, it may not be possible to remove them since they become a permanent part of patients' bodies</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>TIPs were engineered to do a better job of entering protein shells, causing infected cells to release three times more TIPs than H.I.V. viruses</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>If TIPs turn out to have unexpected side effects, it may not be possible to remove them</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Other viruses might also be vulnerable to the same strategy</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Doctors cannot receive consent from anyone else who might be infected with TIPs if people with TIPs spread them to others</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>TIPs are molecular mimics that invade cells and steal essential proteins from H.I.V., while protease inhibitors prevent a protease protein from activating H.I.V.</answer>
