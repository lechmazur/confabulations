<other>I need to analyze the article to answer questions about H5N1 bird flu spread in dairy cows, focusing on wildlife involvement, asymptomatic cases, and transmission patterns.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Wild birds might be involved in transporting the virus between farms or introducing it to other wild animals, as infected blackbirds found 5-8 miles from an affected farm carried virus closely matching what was infecting cows on that farm and one in Kansas</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It suggests the infection may start in the upper respiratory tract where modest levels of virus accumulate before moving to mammary glands, which appear to be the primary site of viral replication</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>It shows the respiratory route cannot be completely ruled out, and that testing milk samples may not be enough to give officials a full picture of asymptomatic spread since asymptomatic cows were more likely to have virus in noses or urine than in milk</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that even strict controls on movement of cows and farm equipment may not be enough to stamp out the outbreak, as genomic sequencing showed infected cows passed the virus to other species including cats and raccoons</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Wild birds might be involved in transporting the virus between farms, as birds could come into heavily contaminated milking parlors, get infected, and fly away</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Wild blackbirds</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have virus in their noses or urine than in their milk, suggesting testing milk samples may not be enough for full surveillance</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>It shows virus spread to multiple species including cats, raccoons, and wild birds that could transport virus to new locations, meaning strict controls on cow and equipment movement may not be enough to stamp out the outbreak</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses than obviously sick ones</answer>
