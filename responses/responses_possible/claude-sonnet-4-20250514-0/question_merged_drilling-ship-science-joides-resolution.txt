<other>I need to analyze the article about the JOIDES Resolution and answer each question based solely on the information provided in the text.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions the Chicxulub event (asteroid impact 66 million years ago) marked by a black layer in sediment cores, but it doesn't establish any direct or indirect connection between this event and the ship's retirement. The retirement was due to rising costs and lack of international support.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Environmental certification expiring</answer>

<other>The article states that the ship's environmental certification is soon to expire, along with the underlying agreement set to lapse this year.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Complicates the work for installing more borehole observatories off the Pacific Northwest coast</answer>

<other>Dr. Tobin leads a proposal to install more borehole observatories off the Pacific Northwest coast, and the retirement of the J.R. complicates this work.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article doesn't explicitly describe an irony in the NSF's plan for a coordination office. It mentions researchers are wary and there will likely be fewer expeditions, but doesn't frame this as ironic given historical contributions.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>While the article discusses both past achievements and current uncertainty, it doesn't explicitly frame this as a paradox.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The ship's extensive contributions to earth science versus the NSF citing rising costs and lack of international support</answer>

<other>The article contrasts the ship's many scientific achievements with the NSF's decision to retire it due to funding challenges.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Federal legislation under consideration could support three expeditions in 2025, but a new drill ship would take at least a decade or more</answer>

<other>The article mentions both the potential for near-term expeditions through legislation and the long timeline for a replacement ship.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Borehole observatories that measure subtle subterranean shifts</answer>

<other>The article mentions these could help reveal signs that forewarn of devastating earthquakes.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Kevlar blankets</answer>

<other>The crew wrapped cores in Kevlar blankets to prevent plastic tubes from becoming projectiles when cores exploded due to gas pressure.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>China's new drill ship Mengxiang and drill crew members receiving job offers to work on the Chinese ship</answer>

<other>The article mentions China's new drill ship and that several crew members from the J.R.'s final expedition received job offers to work on it, suggesting China may benefit from the U.S. ship's retirement.</other>
