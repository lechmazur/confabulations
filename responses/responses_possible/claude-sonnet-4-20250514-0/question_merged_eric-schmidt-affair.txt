<other>I need to analyze the article about Eric Schmidt, Marcy Simon, and Derek Rundell to answer questions about their legal disputes involving Away luggage company and Maple Beach Ventures.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Ms. Rubio assumed incorrectly that Maple Beach Ventures was Ms. Simon's company and that Mr. Rundell was an employee who worked for her, which led to Away not understanding the true ownership structure when Ms. Simon later created a new Delaware LLC with the same name and sold shares that weren't legally hers.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The 2018 termination meant Ms. Simon would get nothing from the Away investment profit, as she was only entitled to 20 percent of the profit if she were still employed as a consultant when the investment was sold.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Away canceled the original Maple Beach Ventures' shares, reissued them to the investor group, and wired $2.83 million to Ms. Simon's account for the new Delaware company, while Mr. Rundell and Mr. Schmidt were never notified and had no idea what transpired.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The misunderstanding led to Away unknowingly processing Ms. Simon's fraudulent tender offer, which later resulted in Away settling with Mr. Schmidt for $3.5 million and subsequently suing Ms. Simon for fraud when they realized Maple Beach Ventures wasn't her company.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Ms. Simon and Mr. Rundell's constant disagreements over investment decisions and due diligence procedures, with Ms. Simon complaining he ignored most investment ideas and Mr. Rundell faulting her for not conducting proper due diligence.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Ms. Simon said she was being prevented from giving the full story by the confidentiality clauses in the 2014 settlement with Mr. Schmidt, leading her to start a separate arbitration proceeding to unshackle herself from these clauses to better defend herself.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The termination led to Ms. Simon losing her entitlement to profits from investments like Away, prompting her to file a breach of contract arbitration against Maple Beach Ventures in April 2019, which she won in January 2021.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Derek Rundell</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The 2014 settlement between Eric Schmidt and Marcy Simon that created the Maple Beach Ventures consulting arrangement</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The confidentiality clauses in Ms. Simon's 2014 settlement with Mr. Schmidt prevented her from disclosing his involvement in investments, which contributed to the misunderstanding about ownership and enabled her alleged fraudulent scheme with the Away tender offer.</answer>
