<other>I need to analyze the article about Iceland's cucumber shortage caused by a TikTok trend and answer each question based solely on the information provided.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Social media trends can disrupt local food supply chains even in countries with self-sustaining agriculture, as Iceland's geothermal-powered greenhouse system couldn't quickly adapt to sudden demand spikes, requiring expensive emergency imports from the Netherlands due to its isolated island location.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The cucumber craze showed that even self-sustaining agricultural systems in isolated locations face challenges when sudden demand spikes occur during natural production lulls, forcing expensive imports that contradict the goal of self-sufficiency.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The shortage demonstrated that isolated agricultural systems with small populations have little wiggle room to handle sudden demand surges, making them vulnerable to external social media influences that can quickly overwhelm local production capacity.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The craze illustrated that geographically isolated countries face complex supply management challenges, as sudden demand increases require expensive emergency imports and leave little flexibility to respond quickly to unexpected consumption patterns.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The shortage showed that small populations can create vulnerabilities where "a few people can have a lot of influence" on demand, making it difficult to maintain self-sufficient food supplies when sudden consumption trends emerge.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The TikTok trend hit during a small lull in cucumber yield cycles, creating particularly bad timing that coincided with natural production gaps in Iceland's greenhouse farming system.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Iceland's climate-conscious consumers typically buy locally grown foods instead of imported ones to reduce carbon footprint, which combined with the small population meant little flexibility to handle sudden demand surges.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Iceland's geothermal-powered greenhouses normally provide 99% of cucumbers, but this self-sustaining system made the country vulnerable when social media trends created demand that exceeded local production capacity, forcing expensive imports.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The shortage challenged Iceland's agricultural self-sufficiency by forcing emergency cucumber imports from the Netherlands when the country's normally reliable geothermal greenhouse system couldn't meet sudden demand increases.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The trend exposed limitations including vulnerability to production cycle timing, carbon dioxide shortages affecting greenhouse production, and inability to quickly scale up during demand spikes, requiring expensive emergency imports.</answer>
