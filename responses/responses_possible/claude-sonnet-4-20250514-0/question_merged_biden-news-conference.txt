<other>The article mentions Biden said he "wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president" but this appears to be a slip where he called Kamala Harris "Vice President Trump," not suggesting Trump was his VP. The question asks about Biden suggesting a former presidential candidate was his VP, but Trump is described as his opponent, not a former presidential candidate in this context.</other>
