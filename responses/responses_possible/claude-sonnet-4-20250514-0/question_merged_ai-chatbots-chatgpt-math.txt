<other>I need to carefully read through the article and answer each question based solely on the information provided in the text.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>They were never designed to do math and are fine-tuned for determining probabilities, not doing rules-based calculations</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>A.I. chatbots often excel when they have consumed vast quantities of relevant training data, but they still struggle with mathematical accuracy despite this training</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>A.I. chatbots learn by analyzing vast amounts of data and predict what comes next, while traditional computing systems follow step-by-step rules; educational applications now use calculator programs for math problems instead of relying on A.I.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It represents a sharp break from computing's past where computers were defined as "math on steroids" and were tireless, fast, accurate calculating machines, to A.I. that is more like a liberal arts major than numbers whiz</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It shows that the world's smartest computer scientists have created artificial intelligence that is more liberal arts major than numbers whiz, which is a sharp break with computing's past definition as "math on steroids"</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The occasional slip-ups became a focal point for class discussions where students compare their answers to the bot's, determining who's right and how each arrived at their solution, teaching critical thinking</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>It shows A.I. systems excel at language tasks with human-level fluency in writing poetry, summarizing books, and answering questions, but struggle with mathematical accuracy</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>It adds support to the debate between those who believe large language models are the path to artificial general intelligence and skeptics who question whether this approach is enough, with some arguing for broader "world modeling" approaches</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>It shows A.I. that excels in traditionally liberal arts tasks like language, poetry, and writing while struggling with mathematical precision, blurring the traditional STEM versus liberal arts distinction</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>He finds the A.I. technology impressive mainly for its language skills, not for its accuracy, and emphasizes that for things that really matter, painful precision is required</answer>
