<other>I need to carefully analyze the article to answer each question based solely on the information provided.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>I can calculate that $500 million went to non-Black farmers ($2B - $1.5B), and with $82,000 average that's about 6,098 farmers, but the question asks specifically about a calculation "according to the source quoted" which isn't provided.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>

<other>43,000 received payments and 60,000 applied, so 17,000 did not receive payments. But the question asks for this as a percentage of total applicants, which would be about 28%, but I need to be precise about whether this calculation is directly supported.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>$500 million</answer>
