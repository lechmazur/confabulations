<other>I need to carefully read through the article and answer each question based solely on the information provided. Let me work through each question systematically.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article presents both Amazon's claims and the employee group's criticism, but doesn't explicitly discuss how this discrepancy highlights challenges of measuring corporate environmental impact in general terms.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>geothermal power</answer>

<other>Google entered an agreement with Berkshire Hathaway's utility for geothermal power, and this isn't mentioned as part of Amazon's clean energy portfolio which focuses on solar and wind.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>Amazon's net-zero goal is 2040, while Google reported increased emissions in 2023. These are different years, so there's no shared year mentioned.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>natural gas</answer>

<other>Natural gas is mentioned both in environmentalists' concerns about utilities relying more heavily on natural gas power plants, and it's referenced in the employee criticism about data centers being fueled by various sources.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions Amazon operates in 27 countries for its clean energy achievements, but the employee criticism mentions West Virginia (not a country), Saudi Arabia, and Canada. No single country appears in both contexts.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>Amazon's net-zero goal is 2040, but the article doesn't specify what year they originally planned to achieve 100% clean energy - it only says they achieved it seven years ahead of schedule.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>renewable energy certificates (RECs)</answer>

<other>Both Ms. Stokes (the academic expert) and the employee group criticize the use of RECs in relation to Amazon's clean energy claims.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>A large data center uses as much energy as a small power plant serving roughly 100,000 homes, while Amazon's clean energy projects can power the equivalent of 7.6 million U.S. homes</answer>

<other>The article provides these specific figures for comparison.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>2019</answer>

<other>The employee group sent a letter to Jeff Bezos in 2019, and if Amazon achieved their goal seven years early and the goal was originally set five years ago, that would put the original deadline around 2019 as well.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>17</answer>

<other>Amazon's net-zero goal is 2040, and Google reported increased emissions in 2023, so 2040 - 2023 = 17 years.</other>
