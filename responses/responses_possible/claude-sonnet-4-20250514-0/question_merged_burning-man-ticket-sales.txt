<other>The questions ask for specific relationships and correlations that require analysis beyond what is directly stated in the article. While the article mentions factors like economic conditions, extreme weather, and regional events as likely causes of ticket sales slump, it doesn't provide the specific relationships and correlations asked about in questions 1-9. Question 10 asks for a factor mentioned at both the beginning and end that could explain both ticket sales slump and growth of regional events - "economy" or "economic conditions" is mentioned in both locations.</other>
