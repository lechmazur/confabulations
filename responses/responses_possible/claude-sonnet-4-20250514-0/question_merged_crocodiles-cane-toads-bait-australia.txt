<other>I need to analyze the article about crocodiles and cane toads to answer each question based solely on the information provided.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The lithium chlorine solution made crocodiles nauseous when they ate the toad carcasses, which taught them to avoid eating toads through conditioned taste aversion, leading to lower mortality rates at test sites compared to the control site.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The chicken necks demonstrated that crocodiles maintained their appetite and feeding behavior while specifically avoiding the tainted toads, showing the aversion was specific to toads rather than a general loss of appetite.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Each predator needs an aversion strategy fine-tuned to its hunting style, as shown by yellow-spotted monitors requiring live "trainer toads" instead of toad carcasses because they actively pursue live prey.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The taste aversion requires ongoing maintenance and is not a one-time solution, as the knowledge retention duration is uncertain.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The Grinch metaphor relates to how nauseous crocodiles become lethargic and prefer to lay about instead of swimming after meals, similar to the seasick crocodile comparison.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The methodology used four baited gorges and one un-baited control site to compare mortality rates, demonstrating the importance of having a control group to measure the experiment's effectiveness.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Initially crocodiles consumed equal amounts of toad carcasses and chicken necks on the first day, but their consumption of toads decreased over time while chicken neck consumption remained steady.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Cane toads</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Nausea-induced lethargy that makes crocodiles prefer to lay about instead of hunting for more food</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Crocodiles received toad carcasses injected with nauseating lithium chlorine solution, while yellow-spotted monitors were given live juvenile "trainer toads" because they actively pursue live prey and the carcass method didn't work for them.</answer>
