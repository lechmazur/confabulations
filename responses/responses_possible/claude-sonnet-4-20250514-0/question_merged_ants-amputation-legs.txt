<other>I need to analyze the article about Florida carpenter ants and their amputation behavior to answer each question based solely on the information provided.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>When Florida carpenter ants sustain a thigh injury, the flow of hemolymph is reduced, making it more difficult for bacteria to move from the wound into the body, so if the entire leg is amputated quickly, the chance of infection is very low.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Many muscles in the thighs that keep hemolymph flowing.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>When the wound is further away from the body the amputations don't work, but when it's closer to the body, they do work.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>By rescuing the injured, they save an enormous amount of energy on the colony level rather than needing to produce 10 to 20 percent more ants to compensate for loss.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>When a Florida carpenter ant injures its lower legs, the time window for a successful amputation is narrow, while thigh injuries allow for successful amputation if done quickly.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The many muscles in the thighs reduce hemolymph flow when there's a thigh injury, making it more difficult for bacteria to move from the wound into the body.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>When there's a thigh injury, reduced hemolymph flow makes it more difficult for bacteria to move from the wound into the body, but when lower legs are injured, bacteria can penetrate the body very quickly.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The ant presents its injured leg and calmly sits there while another ant gnaws it off, and as soon as the leg drops off, the ant presents the newly amputated wound and the other ant finishes the job by cleaning it.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Florida carpenter ants have many muscles in the thighs that keep hemolymph flowing, and thigh amputations have a 90 percent survival rate while lower leg amputations have only a 20 percent survival rate.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The 90 percent survival rate of amputees saves the colony from needing to produce 10 to 20 percent more ants to compensate for the loss of injured ants, saving enormous amounts of energy.</answer>
