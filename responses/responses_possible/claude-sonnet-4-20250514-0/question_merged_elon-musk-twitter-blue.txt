<other>I need to carefully analyze the article to answer these questions about Twitter Blue's launch and its consequences. Let me go through each question systematically.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article shows that Musk eventually chose $8/month, but this wasn't directly suggested by any of the advisors mentioned. Sacks wanted $20/month, Calacanis wanted $99/year, Isaacson wanted a low price for accessibility, and Musk had settled on $100/year before his assistant's comment about gas prices led him to think about Starbucks pricing.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The U.S. midterm elections occurring on November 8</answer>

<other>The launch was moved from before the election to November 9th (the day after), and this timing may have prevented more serious election interference since the main voting had already concluded.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Both involved him reversing his initial stance due to external pressure - first waiting on certain features due to FBI concerns, then shutting down the entire service due to advertiser threats</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Both involved impersonation issues that could cause real harm - La Russa's lawsuit was about a parody account making jokes about his dead player, while employees warned Twitter Blue could enable dangerous impersonation like fake emergency orders</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>He kept the launch quiet to avoid system overload, but the service still broke down and had to be shut off due to chaos from impersonators</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The chaos and advertiser backlash forced him to shut down the service, ironically reducing Twitter's advertising dependence in the worst possible way</answer>

<other>This is ironic because he wanted to reduce dependence on advertising through subscription revenue, but instead lost advertising revenue due to the subscription service's problems.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>He hated the "lords & peasants system" of verified vs unverified users, but Twitter Blue created even more confusion with paid, free, and fake identifiers</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>He said he would act only if there was "death or serious injury," but ended up shutting down the service due to advertiser threats over much less serious incidents</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Despite wanting to reduce advertising dependence, he immediately capitulated to advertiser threats, showing Twitter was still completely dependent on advertising revenue</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The service was overwhelmed by impersonators creating confusion, fulfilling the prediction that "if everyone could be verified, then no one would truly be verified"</answer>
