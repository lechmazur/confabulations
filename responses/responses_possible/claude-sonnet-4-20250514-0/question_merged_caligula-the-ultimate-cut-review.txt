<other>I need to analyze the article about "Caligula: The Ultimate Cut" to answer questions about disagreements, production challenges, and contradictions in the re-editing process.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions Brass took exception to "The Ultimate Cut" but doesn't describe a specific disagreement between Brass and Negovan or what it reveals about defining original intentions.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Tinto Brass</answer>

<other>The article states that Brass took exception with "The Ultimate Cut" last year, and the original production was described as fraught from the start with little agreement on intentions and tone.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions the replacement of Bruno Nicolai's original music and classical cues by Prokofiev and Khachaturian with a new score by Troy Sterling Nies that is "anodyne at best," but doesn't explicitly connect this to contradicting the goal of legitimizing the film's portrayal of its protagonist.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Less graphic sex and violence than the original</answer>

<other>The article states this is "the rare re-edited version of a movie that features less graphic sex and violence than the original" which contradicts conventional expectations for director's cuts.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions various production elements but doesn't explicitly identify which one mentioned in relation to the original release is ironically echoed in creating "The Ultimate Cut."</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>This question is very similar to question 5 and the article doesn't explicitly identify what aspect is paradoxically preserved.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>This is another similar question and the article doesn't specify what element mentioned in passing becomes ironically central.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>Again, the article doesn't explicitly identify what production detail becomes paradoxically relevant.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article doesn't explicitly connect aspects of the original film's reception to being ironically mirrored in creating "The Ultimate Cut."</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article describes changes to narrative structure like moving scenes around, but doesn't explicitly state how this contradicts the stated intentions behind the re-edit.</other>
