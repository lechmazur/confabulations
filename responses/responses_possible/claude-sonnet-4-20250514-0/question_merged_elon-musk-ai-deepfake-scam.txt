<other>I need to carefully analyze the article to answer each question based solely on the information provided.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article doesn't explicitly state the primary reason for effectiveness despite lack of recent interviews. While it mentions Mr. Beauchamp thought he saw Musk on CNN but CNN said Musk hadn't appeared for an interview in years, it doesn't explain why this makes the deepfakes particularly effective.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Scammers target Mr. Musk's global fanbase of conservatives, anti-establishment types and crypto enthusiasts who are drawn to alternative paths for earning fortunes, and use A.I. tools to create convincing deepfake videos that are promoted on social media including paid ads on Facebook to magnify their reach.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article doesn't discuss Mr. Musk's actual stance or involvement in the cryptocurrency market, so I cannot identify any irony.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The new-wave deepfakes featuring Mr. Musk emerged last year after sophisticated A.I. tools were released to the public, allowing anyone to clone celebrity voices or manipulate videos with eerie accuracy, showing how digital scams evolved from being as old as the internet itself to using advanced A.I. technology.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The A.I.-generated videos are hardly perfect as Mr. Musk can sound robotic and his mouth does not always line up with his words, but they appear convincing enough for some targets and are improving all the time.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Meta described a cat-and-mouse game where well-funded scammers constantly shift their tactics to evade detection, while platforms like Facebook take down ads for violating policies and disable accounts, but other videos remain online and more appear each day.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Scammers encourage targets to send a small sum at first (about $250) and slowly lure them into investing more as they claim the initial investment is increasing in value, exploiting people who believe the secret to wealth is being hidden from them.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>A.I. voice-cloning tools and lip-synching technology</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Iconic stilted cadence and South African accent</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The videos cost as little as $10 to create and can be made in less than 10 minutes using free and cheap tools, while being expected to contribute to billions of dollars in fraud losses each year.</answer>
