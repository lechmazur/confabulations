<answer>The study's focus on the Thwaites Glacier provides insights into the broader stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet by simulating worst-case scenarios for this glacier and finding that ice cliff collapse might be less likely than previously thought.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The study's focus on the Thwaites Glacier's ice shelf helps understand the potential for ice cliff collapse by testing what happens when the ice shelf completely disappears, showing that the glacier's ice flows more quickly out to sea, preventing cliffs from becoming tall enough to trigger runaway breakdown.</answer>

<answer>The potential consequences of scientists not having enough observations of ice behavior when it fractures include missing quick ice collapses and getting projections wrong, which could affect how major coastal cities prepare for higher seas.</answer>

<answer>The study's conclusion challenges previous assumptions by suggesting that the prospect of ice cliff collapse leading to runaway breakdown might be more remote than previously thought.</answer>

<answer>The article states that once the ice shelf was removed, the glacier's ice started flowing more quickly out to sea, which prevented the cliffs from becoming so tall as to trigger runaway breakdown.</answer>
