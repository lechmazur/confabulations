<answer>It challenged Philip Lieberman's argument that the human larynx and tongue being lower in the throat than in other primates was necessary for complex speech, as the 2016 X-ray movies showed the primate vocal tract was actually "speech ready."</answer>

<answer>Julia Fischer suggested that Renata and Johnny might be making a standard chimpanzee sound known as a pant-grunt, proposing they simply added two pant-grunts together and were rewarded for doing so.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The discovery shows that chimpanzees can learn to vocalize sounds, as evidenced by Johnny and Renata saying "mama," challenging the notion that only humans can learn new sounds from others.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The analysis shows that Johnny and Renata could produce wordlike sounds by combining consonants and vowels, suggesting that apes may not lack essential brain capabilities for speech as previously thought.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The discovery indicates that chimpanzees can produce wordlike sounds, suggesting they may have some ability to send coordinated commands to the jaw and throat, though not to the extent humans can.</answer>
