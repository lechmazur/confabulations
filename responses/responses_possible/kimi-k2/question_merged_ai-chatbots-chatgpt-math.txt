<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>They were never designed to do math; they are fine-tuned for determining probabilities, not doing rules-based calculations.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>They excel when they have consumed vast quantities of relevant training data like textbooks and standardized tests, but still struggle with mathematical accuracy.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Khan Academy's A.I.-powered tutor Khanmigo sends numerical problems to a calculator program instead of asking the A.I. to solve the math, while traditional computing systems follow step-by-step rules.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It shows a shift from computing being defined as "math on steroids" to A.I. systems that are more liberal arts major than numbers whiz, breaking with computing's past of being tireless, fast, accurate calculating machines.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It shows A.I. chatbots struggle with simple arithmetic and math word problems, which contradicts the traditional definition of computing as "math on steroids" where computers have been tireless, fast, accurate calculating machines.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Teachers use the chatbot's occasional mathematical errors as a focal point for discussion, having students compare their answers to the bot's and analyze how each arrived at their solution.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>It shows A.I. systems are more proficient in language tasks like writing poetry and summarizing books than in mathematical accuracy, shifting the perceived strengths from calculation to language fluency.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>It contributes to the debate between those who believe large language models are the path to artificial general intelligence versus skeptics like Yann LeCun who question whether adding more data is enough and advocate for "world modeling" systems.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>It portrays A.I. as more like a liberal arts major than a numbers whiz, challenging the traditional distinction by showing artificial intelligence excelling in language tasks while struggling with mathematical accuracy.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>He finds the latest A.I. technology impressive mainly for its language skills, not for its accuracy, and uses large language models as one ingredient while also incorporating more rules-based software for critical applications requiring "painful precision."</answer>
