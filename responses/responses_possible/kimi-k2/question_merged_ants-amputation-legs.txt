<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Many muscles in the thighs that keep hemolymph flowing.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Amputations work when wounds are closer to the body (thigh) but not when further away (lower leg).</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>By rescuing injured ants, colonies save energy by not needing to produce 10-20% more ants to compensate for losses.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>

<question_number>6</question_number>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The injured ant presents its leg calmly while another ant gnaws it off, then presents the wound for cleaning.</answer>
