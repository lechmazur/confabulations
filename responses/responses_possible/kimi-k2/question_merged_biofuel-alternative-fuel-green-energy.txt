<answer>Repsol's strategy of retrofitting existing refineries to produce biofuels directly aligns with the European Union's regulations requiring airports to receive jet fuel with a growing proportion of sustainable aviation fuel, starting at 2% in 2025 and rising to 70% by 2050.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The paradox is that while Repsol claims its new biofuel plant is "quite flexible" and can use various waste materials, the article highlights potential scarcity of waste ingredients like cooking oil, with environmentalists noting that even taking all used oil from Spanish restaurants wouldn't be enough.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The contradiction is that while biofuels are presented as a practical solution for reducing emissions because they can use existing infrastructure, the logistical challenges of sourcing enough waste ingredients globally may undermine their environmental benefits through transportation emissions.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The European Union's requirement for sustainable aviation fuel to reach 70% by 2050 creates a complex challenge for Repsol as it must secure sufficient waste ingredients globally while facing competition and potential scarcity of feedstock, as noted by analysts who say "there is a limit on the amount of feedstock."</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The irony is that while biofuels are described as providing green credentials with little effort for customers, the sourcing challenges mentioned - including potential global transportation of waste ingredients and questions about sustainability criteria - suggest significant effort and complexity behind the scenes.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Repsol's strategy differs from competitors who have closed traditional oil refineries by choosing to transform its facilities to produce greener fuels from waste and eventually e-fuels, taking advantage of reduced competition and potentially higher prices for lower carbon fuels.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The potential challenge for Repsol is maintaining its competitive edge amid global competition, including cheap biodiesel imports from China that have depressed European prices, leading to Shell suspending construction of a biofuel plant and the EU investigating alleged dumping.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests Repsol's biofuel production might be affected by the limited availability of waste ingredients like cooking oil, with analysts noting "there is a limit on the amount of feedstock" and environmentalists questioning whether even all Spanish restaurant waste oil would be sufficient.</answer>

<answer>The potential contradiction is that while Repsol claims its new biofuels are a practical solution for reducing emissions, the logistical challenges of sourcing sufficient waste ingredients globally - including potential transportation emissions and competition for scarce feedstock - may undermine their environmental benefits.</answer>
