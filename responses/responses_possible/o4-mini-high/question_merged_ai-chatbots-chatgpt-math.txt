<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Because they were designed for probabilistic language modeling rather than rule-based mathematical calculations</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Despite consuming vast quantities of relevant math training data, they remain erratic and inaccurate in mathematical problem-solving</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Chatbots rely on probabilistic language generation and external calculators for math, whereas traditional systems use deterministic, step-by-step rule-based computation</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It marks a shift from computing as precise, rules-based number-crunching to neural network-driven probabilistic language modeling that de-emphasizes math accuracy</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>By showing AI can excel in language yet often err in math, it undermines the notion of computers as infallible "math on steroids"</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Using chatbot math errors as discussion points to teach students critical thinking and compare solutions</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>It portrays AI as stronger in language fluency than numerical calculation, signaling a shift from computing’s traditional strengths</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>It underscores that math shortcomings fuel the debate over scaling large language models versus integrating logic-based or world-modeling approaches</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>By revealing AI’s prowess in language and weakness in math, it blurs the traditional STEM (math) versus liberal arts (language) distinction</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>That while AI’s language skills are impressive, its accuracy is insufficient for critical applications, requiring integration with precise, rule-based systems</answer>
