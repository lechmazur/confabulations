<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>By using Thwaites as a case study to show how ice shelf loss accelerates flow and limits cliff heights, shedding light on the sheet’s overall collapse dynamics</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It tests whether removal of Thwaites’s ice shelf would generate cliffs tall enough to trigger runaway collapse</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>By showing that accelerated flow after shelf loss prevents tall unstable cliffs, suggesting similar behavior across Antarctica</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Rapid collapse events can be missed, resulting in insufficient data for accurate modeling</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It finds that cliffs may not reach heights for runaway collapse, contradicting previous assumptions of likely instability</answer>
