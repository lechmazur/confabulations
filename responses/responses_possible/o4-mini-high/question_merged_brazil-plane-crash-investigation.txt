<answer>The ATR 72‑500’s post‑1994 de‑icing upgrades could mislead investigators into dismissing icing as a cause despite the crash theory.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The article notes a sharp speed drop from ~325 mph wouldn’t induce a stall “unless icing was extremely severe,” tying speed and icing in a conditional.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The inflatable rubber‑tube anti‑icing system, given the ~63°F ground temperature, suggests icing should’ve been unlikely or easily mitigated by descent.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The aircraft spun slowly as it plummeted and struck belly‑first, unlike the steep nose‑down dive typical of a stall.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The last recorded speed (~325 mph) exceeded stall speed, so a stall shouldn’t occur without severe ice altering the wing.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The pilots made no emergency declaration or ATC communication, contra protocol for handling severe icing.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The ~63°F ambient temperature at Vinhedo contradicts the assumption of sufficiently cold conditions for severe icing.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The post‑1994 enhancement of the ATR 72’s de‑icing system paradoxically complicates attributing the crash to icing.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The ATR 72‑500’s ice sensitivity—via its rubber‑tube de‑icing setup—is critical to the icing theory.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The stall occurred from 17,000 ft, indicating a sudden failure versus gradual ice build‑up during descent.</answer>
