<answer>The study's focus on the Thwaites Glacier provides insights into the broader stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet by showing that even in worst-case scenarios, the glacier's ice flow prevents runaway collapse.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The significance of the study's focus on the Thwaites Glacier's ice shelf is that it shows how the shelf's disappearance affects the glacier's flow and the stability of ice cliffs.</answer>

<answer>Observational data on how ice behaves when it fractures.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The assumption is that nations' emissions of heat-trapping gases climb to extremely high levels.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The article draws a connection that as the ice shelf disappears and the glacier retreats, the ice flows more quickly, affecting the height and stability of ice cliffs.</answer>
