<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>A.I. chatbots struggle with mathematical accuracy because they were not designed to do math; they are fine-tuned for determining probabilities, not doing rules-based calculations.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>A.I. chatbots excel when they have consumed vast quantities of relevant training data, but their mathematical capabilities remain erratic.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>A.I. chatbots use neural networks to learn from data and generate language, while traditional computing systems follow step-by-step rules and retrieve information from structured databases.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The shift in A.I. technology reflects a move from rigid, rules-based programming to learning by analyzing vast amounts of data, which is less accurate for mathematical tasks.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>AI's math abilities challenge the traditional definition of computing as "math on steroids" because AI is more proficient in language tasks than in mathematical accuracy.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The occasional mathematical errors made by AI chatbots have turned out to be a teaching opportunity, encouraging students to compare answers and discuss critical thinking.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The article reflects a shift in the perceived strengths of AI systems from being primarily mathematical to being more proficient in language and liberal arts tasks.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The article's discussion contributes to the debate by highlighting the limitations of large language models and the need for a broader approach to achieve artificial general intelligence.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The article challenges the traditional distinction by showing that AI systems are more proficient in language tasks, which are typically associated with liberal arts, rather than mathematical tasks, which are associated with STEM fields.</answer>
