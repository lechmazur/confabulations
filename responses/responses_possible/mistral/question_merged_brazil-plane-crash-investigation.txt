<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The mention of the plane's model and its de-icing system improvements since 1994 could create a potential red herring by suggesting that icing should not have been a problem, possibly distracting from other potential causes.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The article's mention of the plane's speed and altitude changes creates a complex conditional statement by suggesting that the plane's speed did not drop far enough to cause a stall unless icing was extremely severe.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The aspect of the plane's anti-icing system, which consists of rubber tubes on the wings, when considered alongside the crash location's temperature of around 63 degrees, challenges the primary theory about the cause by suggesting that icing alone should not lead to a crash.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The plane's trajectory, described as spinning slowly and plummeting before crashing almost directly on its belly, contradicts standard expectations for a stall-induced crash, which typically involves a more abrupt descent.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The discrepancy between the plane's last recorded speed, which did not drop far enough to cause a stall, and the minimum speed for a stall challenges the primary theory about the crash cause by suggesting that icing would need to be extremely severe to cause a stall at that speed.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The pilots' behavior immediately preceding the crash, where they did not communicate with controllers just before the crash, conflicts with standard protocol for addressing severe icing conditions, which typically involves alerting air traffic controllers.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The detail about the crash location being in Brazil, not Antarctica, contradicts a key assumption underlying one expert's statement about potential icing conditions, as the temperature on the ground was around 63 degrees.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The technological advancement implemented after a previous incident involving the same aircraft model, which improved the de-icing system, paradoxically complicates the current investigation by suggesting that icing should not have been a problem.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The seemingly minor detail about the aircraft's specifications, specifically its anti-icing system consisting of rubber tubes on the wings, becomes crucial when considering the icing theory proposed by experts, as it raises questions about whether the system was activated or if it failed.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The precise altitude at which the plane began to fall, 17,000 feet, challenges assumptions about gradual ice accumulation by suggesting that the plane fell from a high altitude, which is not typical for gradual ice accumulation.</answer>
