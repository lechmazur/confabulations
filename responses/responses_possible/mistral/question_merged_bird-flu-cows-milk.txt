<answer>Genomic sequencing suggests that wildlife, including wild birds, might be involved in transporting the virus between farms or introducing it to other wild animals.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The finding suggests that the infection may start in the upper respiratory tract before moving to the mammary glands, challenging the idea that the virus primarily affects the mammary glands first.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The presence of the virus in nasal swabs and urine of asymptomatic cows suggests that the virus can spread through routes other than milk, complicating the narrative of milk-based transmission.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The spread of the virus to cats and raccoons indicates that controlling cow and equipment movement may not be sufficient to curb the outbreak, as other species can also transmit the virus.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The study implies that wild birds may play a role in the spread of H5N1, as genomic similarities were found between viruses in blackbirds and those on affected farms.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Wild blackbirds carried a virus closely matching that infecting cows in Texas and Kansas.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The finding that asymptomatic cows are more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk challenges the effectiveness of current surveillance methods that focus on milk samples.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows are more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk, contradicting assumptions about milk-based transmission.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The genomic analysis showing infections in multiple species challenges the effectiveness of farm-focused control measures, as the virus can spread through other animals.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows are more likely to have the virus in their noses than obviously sick ones, suggesting a different progression of the infection.</answer>
