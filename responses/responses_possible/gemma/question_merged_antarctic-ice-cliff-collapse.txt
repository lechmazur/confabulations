<answer>The Thwaites Glacier is one of the fastest receding and least stable glaciers in Antarctica, making it a good model for understanding the broader stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The study focuses on the Thwaites Glacier's ice shelf because its disappearance is a key factor in triggering ice cliff collapse.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The study's findings on the Thwaites Glacier suggest that ice cliff collapse may be less likely in other parts of Antarctica as well.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Insufficient observations of ice fracturing could lead to inaccurate projections of sea-level rise and inadequate preparations for coastal communities.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The study suggests that ice cliff collapse may be less likely than previously thought, challenging the assumption that it is a highly probable scenario.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The increased flow speed of the glacier after the ice shelf disappeared prevented the cliffs from becoming tall enough to trigger a runaway breakdown.</answer>

<answer>Data on how ice behaves when it fractures</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>That nations' emissions of heat-trapping gases will climb to extremely high levels</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The study found that when the ice shelf was removed, the glacier's ice started flowing more quickly out to sea, preventing the cliffs at the end of the glacier from becoming so tall as to trigger a runaway breakdown.</answer>
