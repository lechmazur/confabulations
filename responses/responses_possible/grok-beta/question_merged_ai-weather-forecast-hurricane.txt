<answer>GraphCast uses historical weather data to learn patterns and predict future weather, doing so in minutes or seconds, while traditional supercomputers rely on current weather observations and complex calculations, taking hours to produce forecasts.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>GraphCast was trained on four decades of global weather observations, allowing it to identify subtle patterns and predict weather with greater accuracy than the European weather agency's forecast, which relied on real-time data and supercomputer calculations.</answer>

<answer>Paul G. Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, established the Allen Institute for A.I., where Dr. Bretherton, who praised the European center's interest in A.I., now works. This connection suggests that Allen's involvement in AI could influence the adoption of GraphCast by the world's top weather agency.</answer>

<answer>GraphCast's learning from historical data allows it to identify patterns in atmospheric behavior, potentially overcoming the chaotic nature of weather systems by recognizing and predicting the evolution of these patterns over time.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The contrast between GraphCast's training data timespan and the recent improvements in traditional weather forecast durations suggests that AI could significantly enhance long-term climate prediction by learning from extensive historical data, potentially offering more accurate long-term forecasts than current methods.</answer>
