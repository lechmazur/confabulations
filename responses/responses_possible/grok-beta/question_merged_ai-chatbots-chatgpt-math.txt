<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>They are fine-tuned for determining probabilities, not doing rules-based calculations.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>They excel when they have consumed vast quantities of relevant training data, but struggle with math because they were not designed for it.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>A.I. chatbots learn by analyzing vast amounts of data and predicting likely outcomes, while traditional computing systems follow step-by-step rules and retrieve information from structured databases.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The shift reflects a move from computers as calculating machines to systems that learn from data, emphasizing language generation over mathematical accuracy.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It challenges the traditional definition by showing that A.I. systems, despite their computational power, are not inherently better at math than at language tasks.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>It teaches students to look at things with a critical eye and sharpens critical thinking.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>It reflects a shift where A.I. systems are seen as more adept at language and pattern recognition than at precise mathematical calculations.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>It contributes by highlighting the limitations of current large language models in handling logic and common sense reasoning, suggesting a need for broader approaches like "world modeling."</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>It challenges the distinction by showing that A.I. systems, traditionally associated with STEM, excel in areas typically linked to liberal arts like language generation.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>He finds the latest A.I. technology impressive for its language skills but not for its accuracy, emphasizing the need for structured software in critical applications.</answer>
