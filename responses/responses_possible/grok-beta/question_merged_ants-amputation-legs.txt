<answer>When ants sustain a thigh injury, the flow of hemolymph is reduced, making it more difficult for bacteria to move from the wound into the body.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The presence of many hemolymph-pumping muscles in the thighs of Florida carpenter ants.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>When the wound is further away from the body, amputations are less successful, but when it's closer to the body, they are more successful.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>By rescuing injured ants, the colony saves energy that would otherwise be used to produce 10 to 20 percent more ants to compensate for the loss.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The time window for successful amputation is narrow for lower leg injuries, making the chance of success slim, whereas for thigh injuries, the chance of infection is very low if the leg is amputated quickly.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The presence of multiple muscles in the thighs reduces the flow of hemolymph, which limits bacterial movement into the body, thereby increasing the success of amputation as an infection prevention method.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Bacterial movement is slower when the wound is closer to the body due to reduced hemolymph flow, making amputation more effective at preventing infection.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The injured ant presents its injured leg and calmly sits there while another ant gnaws it off, then presents the newly amputated wound for cleaning.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The success rate of leg amputations is higher when the wound is closer to the body where there are more hemolymph-pumping muscles.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The high survival rate of amputee ants (90 percent) contributes to the colony's energy efficiency by reducing the need to produce more ants to replace those lost to injury.</answer>
