<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>One shot of TIPs may keep H.I.V. at low levels permanently, while lenacapavir requires twice-yearly shots.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It might make it harder for people to transmit H.I.V. to others.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>TIPs insert themselves into the DNA of a patient's immune cells, becoming a permanent part of their bodies, which raises concerns about consent for potential side effects and transmission to others.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>TIPs interfere with H.I.V.'s normal life cycle by outcompeting the virus for essential proteins, whereas protease inhibitors attack the virus itself by preventing a protein called protease from activating H.I.V.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The potential for unexpected side effects that cannot be removed due to TIPs becoming a permanent part of the patient's body.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>TIPs can replicate more efficiently than H.I.V. in infected cells, releasing three times more TIPs than H.I.V. viruses when the cells burst open.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The risk of unexpected side effects that cannot be removed due to TIPs becoming a permanent part of the patient's body.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The strategy of using TIPs could potentially be applied to other viruses, making it a universal approach to developing antivirals.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Doctors cannot obtain consent from anyone else who might be infected with TIPs by the treated patient, complicating ethical considerations.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>TIPs interfere with H.I.V.'s life cycle by outcompeting the virus for essential proteins, while traditional H.I.V. drugs like protease inhibitors attack the virus itself by preventing specific viral proteins from functioning.</answer>
