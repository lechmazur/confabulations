<answer>The use of dead reckoning for navigation under the ice shelf resulted in only about half of Ran's missions being completely successful.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The seals could have caused Ran to become disoriented, potentially leading to its loss.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The findings showed that the melting process does not smooth out the topography of underwater ice as previously assumed, but instead, complex structures and indentations can persist.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Thwaites Glacier</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The complex topography suggests that these features and indentations can persist, potentially affecting overall melting patterns in response to ocean warming.</answer>
