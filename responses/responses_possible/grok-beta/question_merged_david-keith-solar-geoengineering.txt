<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The central figure, David Keith, believes the risks of solar geoengineering are well understood and not as severe as portrayed by critics, while Raymond Pierrehumbert considers it a grave threat to human civilization and even doing research on it as dangerous.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>David Keith's 1992 paper, "A Serious Look at Geoengineering," raised questions about who should authorize the use of these technologies and who is liable if something goes wrong, which are governance concerns echoed by critics of solar geoengineering.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>David Keith's observations of natural climate changes, like the shrinking glacier, confirm his belief that humans have already altered the planet, motivating him to pursue solar geoengineering as a means to repair the climate.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>David Keith's personal windfall from the sale of Carbon Engineering was about $72 million, while the funding for his new academic program at the University of Chicago could reach as much as $100 million.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Seeing a glacier that had shrunk dramatically during his birthday hike in the Canadian Rockies confirmed his belief in the need for drastic action like solar geoengineering to address climate change.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>David Keith agrees that nations should stop burning fossil fuels, but he also believes in going further by implementing solar geoengineering to lower global temperatures.</answer>

<answer>N/A</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>David Keith learned from the protests against his experiment that if they do it again, they won't be as open about it, suggesting a shift towards less transparency in research.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Raymond Pierrehumbert warns that stopping solar geoengineering abruptly could result in a sudden rise in temperatures, potentially causing a "termination shock" with massive temperature rise in an unprepared world over a matter of five to 10 years.</answer>
