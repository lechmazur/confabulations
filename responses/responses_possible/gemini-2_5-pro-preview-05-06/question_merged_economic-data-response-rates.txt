<answer>The decline in funding for the Bureau of Labor Statistics since 2009 has meant that the agency has had less opportunity to do research and to advance modernization plans for its data collection methods.</answer>
<other>The article states, "Funding for the Bureau of Labor Statistics has fallen 18 percent in inflation-adjusted terms since 2009... But the history of underfunding for the past 20-some-odd years at least means that they have had less opportunity to do research and to advance modernization plans that they know are needed."</other>

<answer>The Supreme Court's decision, while blocking a specific attempt at political interference (the citizenship question), highlighted the lack of existing legal provisions ensuring statistical agencies' independence, thereby underscoring the report's recommendation for Congress to enact legislation to make professional autonomy statutory.</answer>
<other>The article says the episode "highlighted that there are few legal provisions ensuring that the statistical agencies can operate independently" and quotes Ms. Potok: "That's why we're saying Congress needs to enact legislation to make this issue of professional autonomy statutory."</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that funding for the Bureau of Labor Statistics fell 18% since 2009. The response rate for the Current Population Survey fell from nearly 90% to about 70%, which is a 20 percentage point drop, or a relative drop of approximately 22.2% ((90-70)/90). The article does not state that any agency's budget decline "mirrors" this percentage drop in survey response rates.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Job growth data</answer>
<other>The article states Federal Reserve officials use government data for interest rates (monetary policy) and Congress/White House use it for jobless benefits or stimulus payments (fiscal stimulus). It also mentions "the risks to economic data are particularly notable because of the attention it receives from policymakers". "Job growth" is listed as a key monthly report and economic data. Compromised job growth data would impact both types of decisions made by policymakers.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Just as neglected physical infrastructure like highways and bridges can fail, the statistical system, if ignored (e.g., through underfunding and falling response rates), can also fail, leading to an inability to produce vital data, such as reliable monthly employment and unemployment data for smaller demographic groups.</answer>
<other>The article likens the statistical system to physical infrastructure: "vital, but often ignored until something goes wrong." It then quotes William Beach saying the BLS was "nearing the point where it would no longer be able to publish reliable monthly data on employment and unemployment for smaller demographic groups".</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The Supreme Court's decision blocked a specific instance of potential political interference but also revealed that the autonomy of statistical agencies relies on norms rather than law; this highlighted vulnerability led to the report's call for new legislation to make professional autonomy statutory.</answer>
<other>The article states the Supreme Court blocked the citizenship question effort, but "the episode highlighted that there are few legal provisions ensuring that the statistical agencies can operate independently." This led to the call for legislation because "we've relied on norms for the autonomy of the statistical agencies, and sometimes norms are overturned."</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Job growth data</answer>
<other>The article states Federal Reserve officials use government data for interest rates. Congress and the White House use it for unemployment benefits. Investors place bets tied to "monthly reports on job growth". The article also notes "risks to economic data are particularly notable because of the attention it receives from policymakers and investors," linking economic data like job growth to all three areas.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The British Office of National Statistics temporarily suspended publication of data from its Labour Force Survey due to reliability concerns, which parallels the Bureau of Labor Statistics' recent announcement that it expected to cut the size of the Current Population Survey and a former BLS head's warning that the agency was nearing a point where it might not be able to publish reliable data for smaller groups.</answer>
<other>The article mentions the UK suspension "because of concerns over its reliability" and the BLS expecting to "cut the size of the Current Population Survey" due to rising costs and budget issues, with a former head warning about future inability to report some data.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The proposal for easier data sharing among agencies might ironically conflict with the goal of ensuring data reliability (a goal supported by the recommendation for increased funding) if increased sharing heightens public privacy concerns, thereby further reducing survey response rates, which are already a threat to data quality.</answer>
<other>The article states "Issues like privacy concerns... have all contributed to the decline" in survey response rates. A recommendation is to "make it easier for agencies to share data". If this sharing increases privacy concerns, it could worsen response rates, undermining data reliability, which other recommendations (like funding) aim to bolster.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Historically, the professional autonomy of statistical agencies has relied on norms, but because these norms can be overturned, future legislative proposals call for Congress to enact legislation to make this professional autonomy statutory, or legally mandated.</answer>
<other>The article quotes Ms. Potok: "we've relied on norms for the autonomy of the statistical agencies, and sometimes norms are overturned... That's why we're saying Congress needs to enact legislation to make this issue of professional autonomy statutory."</other>
