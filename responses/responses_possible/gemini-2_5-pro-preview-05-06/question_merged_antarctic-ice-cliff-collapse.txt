<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>By showing that a calamitous ice-cliff collapse scenario, previously considered for West Antarctica's gigantic ice sheet, may be more remote than previously thought, based on simulations of the Thwaites Glacier, which is among the fastest receding and least stable in Antarctica.</answer>
<other>The article states the study focused on Thwaites to understand a scenario for "West Antarctica's gigantic ice sheet."</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The disappearance of the ice shelf is the hypothesized trigger for the formation of immense, sheer ice cliffs, so studying the consequences of its removal is key to understanding the potential for such a collapse.</answer>
<other>The article describes the scenario starting with "Once enough of the ice sheet's floating edges melt away..." and the study tested what happens if the "ice shelf... completely disappeared".</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article focuses on a specific scenario for "West Antarctica's gigantic ice sheet" and uses Thwaites Glacier (in West Antarctica) as a case study. It does not explicitly state how these findings contribute to understanding ice cliff collapse in other parts of Antarctica, such as East Antarctica or glaciers with different characteristics.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It makes it hard to say with high confidence how much time the world has to prepare for higher seas and to get projections for sea-level rise right, which is important for protecting coastal cities.</answer>
<other>Dr. Morlighem mentions the difficulty in estimating preparation time, and Dr. Alley notes the importance of accurate projections for coastal cities.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that the specific scenario of runaway ice cliff collapse, previously considered a "low-likelihood, high-impact" possibility for West Antarctica, looks less likely and may be more remote than previously thought.</answer>
<other>The article contrasts the previous inclusion of this scenario in UN assessments with the new study's findings.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Dr. DeConto</answer>
<other>The article states Dr. DeConto was "among the researchers who first proposed that ice-cliff instability could spell ruin for West Antarctica."</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The glacier's ice started flowing more quickly out to sea.</answer>
<other>The article states this faster flow "prevented the cliffs at the end of the glacier from becoming so tall as to trigger a runaway breakdown."</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Observations of how ice behaves when it fractures.</answer>
<other>Dr. Alley is quoted saying, "scientists don't have enough observations of how ice behaves when it fractures."</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>That nations' emissions of heat-trapping gases climb to extremely high levels.</answer>
<other>The article links the general calamitous scenario (which the study's "worst-case scenarios" for Thwaites are part of) to this assumption about emissions.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Faster glacier flow speed prevented ice cliffs from becoming so tall as to trigger a runaway breakdown.</answer>
<other>The study found that increased flow speed limited cliff height.</other>
