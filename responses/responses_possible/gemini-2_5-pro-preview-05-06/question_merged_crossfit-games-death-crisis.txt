<answer>Greg Glassman</answer>
<other>The article states Greg Glassman said in 2005, "If the notion of falling off the rings and breaking your neck is so foreign to you, then we don't want you in our ranks." Lazar Dukic's death occurred at the CrossFit Games described in the article, which were the 17th annual Games. The Games began in 2007. The 17th Games would be in 2023 (2007 + 17 - 1). The time difference is 2023 - 2005 = 18 years. While Dukic's death was a drowning, not a neck injury from rings, Glassman's quote shows a cavalier attitude towards severe physical risk, which is ironic given the subsequent fatality in the sport's premier competition.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The evolution from the former motto, "Forging Elite Fitness," to current messaging that emphasizes accessibility and that "the needs of the Olympian and our grandparents differ by degree, not kind," reflects the tension by showing a shift from a focus on high-level, intense performance to a broader appeal of being a scalable workout regimen suitable for almost anyone, while the CrossFit Games continue to embody the "elite fitness" aspect.</answer>
<other>The article explicitly states the former motto and the new emphasis on accessibility, and that CrossFit the workout and the CrossFit Games are meant to be different.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions Mat Fraser nearly drowned in a swimming event in 2017. Lazar Dukic's death occurred at the Games described as happening "last week," which, based on the Games' 17-year history starting in 2007, would be in 2023. The interval between 2017 and 2023 is six years, not four years as stated in the question.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Jeffrey Adler and Laura Horvath</answer>
<other>The article states Greg Glassman's early vision included the sentiment, "If the notion of falling off the rings and breaking your neck is so foreign to you, then we don't want you in our ranks," implying an acceptance of extreme risk. Jeffrey Adler and Laura Horvath, the reigning champions, withdrew from the competition after Lazar Dukic's death due to the decision to continue the Games. Their withdrawal, prioritizing other values over continuing in the face of such a tragedy, can be seen as contradicting Glassman's stated expectation of participants' willingness to face extreme dangers.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Tia-Clair Toomey</answer>
<other>Tia-Clair Toomey, a seven-time champion, chose to stay, believing Lazar Dukic "would have done himself." This aligns with CrossFit's evolving message that "the needs of the Olympian and our grandparents differ by degree, not kind," as her decision reflects the mindset of an elite competitor operating at a high "degree." However, it paradoxically contradicts the broader shift away from the "Forging Elite Fitness" motto towards general accessibility and potentially a softer image, as continuing an elite, high-risk competition after a death emphasizes the extreme aspect of the sport that the new messaging tries to balance with inclusivity.</other>

<answer>Danielle Brandon</answer>
<other>Greg Glassman's early statement was, "If the notion of falling off the rings and breaking your neck is so foreign to you, then we don't want you in our ranks." Danielle Brandon commented, "What's so safe about putting a heavy dumbbell over your head?" Both statements acknowledge inherent risk in CrossFit activities. Brandon's comment about a specific exercise echoes Glassman's broader sentiment about risk acceptance.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Kettlebell swings</answer>
<other>The article mentions kettlebell swings as an exercise influenced by CrossFit. It also states that CrossFit workouts "could be adapted to accommodate almost anyone," implying accessibility for exercises like kettlebell swings (e.g., by varying weight). The potential danger is represented by the "Uncle Rhabdo" mascot, named after rhabdomyolysis, a "potentially deadly muscle condition that CrossFit has sometimes been known to cause" through high-intensity exercise, which can include kettlebell swings if performed excessively or improperly.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Pat Vellner</answer>
<other>The "Uncle Rhabdo" mascot, named after a "potentially deadly muscle condition," served as an early, ironic acknowledgment of the physiological dangers of CrossFit if pushed too far. Pat Vellner's statement, "We've been talking about our safety concerns for a long time, and it's fallen on deaf ears," echoes this theme of danger by highlighting ongoing, unaddressed safety concerns within the CrossFit Games, pointing to a risk that has been known or warned about.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Challenging competitors to conquer "the unknown and the unknowable"</answer>
<other>Adrian Bozman, CrossFit's competition director, stated the Games' purpose is to test athletes by challenging them to conquer "the unknown and the unknowable." This pursuit may have contributed to the decision to include an 800-meter open-water swim in Texas in August, where conditions (allegedly unsafe water temperatures) became a factor in Lazar Dukic's death. The irony is that the very aim to push into "the unknown" may have led to an event with inadequately managed risks, resulting in the tragic outcome.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The inclusion of tasks like outdoor swimming events, which the article states "would never be performed in a CrossFit class," contradicts the claim that CrossFit (the training methodology) prepares athletes for "the unknown and the unknowable" if the preparation itself doesn't cover such event types.</answer>
<other>If the regular training regimen ("CrossFit class") does not include certain types of activities that then appear as "unknowns" in the Games, it suggests a gap between the preparation and the specific challenges presented, thereby weakening the claim of comprehensive preparation for all "unknown and unknowable" tasks.</other>
