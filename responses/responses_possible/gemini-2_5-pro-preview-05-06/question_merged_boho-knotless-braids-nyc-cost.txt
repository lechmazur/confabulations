<answer>$50</answer>
<other>The salon pays $6/pack for synthetic hair. For boho knotless braids, if clients prefer human hair, they must bring their own, and "A pack of human hair ranges from $50 to $200". The salon's $450 price for boho knotless braids likely assumes the use of synthetic hair provided by the salon. If a client chooses to bring their own human hair (minimum cost $50), this would be an additional expense for the client on top of the service fee, making their minimum additional cost $50 compared to a scenario where synthetic hair (cost absorbed by salon within the service fee) is used.</other>

<answer>50/9 years</answer>
<other>The increase in gel price is $25 (now) - $16 (in 2018) = $9 per jar. Assuming one jar is used per month, the increased cost is $9 per month. The cost of one hair dryer is $600. It would take $600 / $9 = 200/3 months for the increased gel cost to equal the dryer cost. Converting to years: (200/3 months) / (12 months/year) = 200/36 years = 50/9 years.</other>
