<answer>Joseph Lipsey III, who became close to Pierce's mother and promised to always be there for Pierce's family after her death, later entered into a risky business deal with Pierce for the W Hotel. Pierce admitted to doing "zero due diligence" on this deal, suggesting that the personal relationship and trust, possibly influenced by Lipsey's promise to his mother, led to a lack of business scrutiny which ultimately resulted in Lipsey seizing control of the hotel.</answer>
<other>The article states Lipsey's wife became friends with Pierce's mother, and Lipsey made a promise to Pierce's mother to look after her family.

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Pierce publicly presented himself as a visionary aiming to revitalize Puerto Rico's economy with crypto and "Robin Hood" tactics, and as a spiritual, globally connected figure. His stated goals included reopening the W Hotel and launching various community projects. However, his actual achievements were marked by failed projects like the W Hotel revival, the NFT gallery, and a children's museum conversion, along with numerous legal disputes, unpaid bills, and accusations of exploitation, creating a significant disconnect between his grand pronouncements and the tangible outcomes of his ventures.</answer>
<other>The article details Pierce's grand promises ("crypto magic," "Puertopia," "Robin Hood fashion") and his actual track record of "unpaid bills and legal quarrels," projects that "have not come to fruition," and being seen as an "offender in a centuries-long history of global elites who have treated Puerto Rico as their personal playground."</other>

<answer>Pierce's yacht, the Aurora, was used to project an image of success and to solicit investments ("portraying himself as Puerto Rico's savior"), but it fell into disrepair, with missed payments and engine problems, eventually "collecting water and slowly sinking."

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Pierce's NFT gallery was announced as a pioneering venture, "the world's first art gallery dedicated to nonfungible tokens," but it "was never fully opened," "struggled to make money," and was put up for sale. This reflects the broader trajectory of his business ventures in Puerto Rico, which often started with grand announcements and promises of innovation but frequently failed to materialize or sustain themselves, becoming mired in issues.</answer>
<other>The gallery's failure to launch successfully despite ambitious claims is presented as an example of his broader pattern of unfulfilled projects.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>During a dispute with Joseph Lipsey III over the W Hotel, Pierce allegedly had an armed guard present during a meeting at the Hacienda Tamarindo, which Lipsey reported as a kidnapping. Pierce's adviser suggested the guard was for Pierce's protection from a cult she believed was exercising a "malign influence" over him, and noted Pierce "wasn't in a healthy frame of mind." This incident, coupled with Pierce's self-admitted "poor judgment and naivete" and accusations of manipulative business practices, highlights concerns about his decision-making and stability, which impacted his business dealings.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Pierce acquired a former children's museum building as part of his real estate strategy of buying properties for redevelopment. The project faced local resistance, evidenced by "Gringo go home" graffiti. Ultimately, the building remains "empty, paint peeling from its walls," and the planned conversion "has not come to fruition," reflecting a pattern in his broader real estate strategy where acquisitions were made with ambitious plans that often went unfulfilled, sometimes amidst local disapproval.</answer>
<other>The article links the museum's acquisition to his broader strategy, notes the local resistance, and describes its current state of disrepair and unfulfilled potential.</other>
