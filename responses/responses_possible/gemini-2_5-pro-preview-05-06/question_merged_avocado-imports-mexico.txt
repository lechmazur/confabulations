<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states the halt highlighted U.S. dependency on Michoacan. It separately mentions environmental concerns like deforestation due to avocado production. However, it does not state how the temporary halt of inspections itself, which was due to safety concerns for U.S.D.A. workers, indirectly affects these pre-existing environmental concerns.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Reduced impact of unrest in Michoacan on the reliability of U.S. avocado supplies.</answer>
<other>The article states that "the heavy reliance on Michoacan means unrest there will continue to affect the reliability of supplies." Diversifying away from Michoacan would logically lessen this specific vulnerability. California's strained production underscores the need for reliable import sources.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Rising demand from U.S. consumers.</answer>
<other>The article states, "Most of that rise in demand has been met by imports" and that Mexico became the world's top producer "largely in response to the pull of rising demand from U.S. consumers." Strain on California's farms "further feeding a reliance on imports" is a contributing factor, but rising U.S. demand is presented as the primary pull.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The U.S. gains economic benefits from a crucial supply of a popular fruit from Michoacan, but this reliance simultaneously exposes the U.S. to security risks for its personnel and supply chain disruptions stemming from criminal activity in that same region.</answer>
<other>The article details the high U.S. demand met by Michoacan (economic benefit of supply) and the security issues for U.S.D.A. workers and infiltration by criminal groups in Michoacan's avocado industry (security risks and disruptions). The paradox lies in the source of benefit also being a source of risk that threatens that benefit.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states the U.S. ambassador visited Michoacan to meet with authorities and later announced that a "satisfactory proposal on worker safety" allowed inspections to resume. It does not explicitly state the primary reason the ambassador's visit itself was crucial for the resumption, beyond his role in these discussions and announcements.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The pursuit of economic growth through avocado expansion leads to deforestation and the draining of aquifers, which releases climate-warming gases and threatens the water supply relied upon by many farmers, thereby undermining long-term environmental sustainability and potentially the livelihoods that contribute to economic stability.</answer>
<other>The article states deforestation is for avocado orchards (economic activity), which releases climate-warming gases and drains aquifers (environmental unsustainability) "on which many farmers rely" (economic impact on others/long-term viability).</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>It helps diversify the sources of avocados, but the market's stability remains significantly affected by unrest in Michoacan due to continued heavy reliance on that state.</answer>
<other>The article quotes Luis Ribera saying that allowing imports from Jalisco "helps diversify the sources of avocados" but "the heavy reliance on Michoacan means unrest there will continue to affect the reliability of supplies."</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>A severe reduction in the overall U.S. avocado supply.</answer>
<other>The U.S. imports 90% of its avocados, mostly from Michoacan, because U.S. domestic production (mainly California) is strained by environmental issues. If Michoacan, the primary import source, faced similar environmental production issues, the main supply line for the vast majority of U.S. avocados would be compromised, leading to a significant shortage.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>By creating security risks for U.S.D.A. inspectors, leading to temporary halts in inspections which are necessary for verifying food safety and allowing shipments, thereby disrupting the supply chain's reliability.</answer>
<other>The article states inspections were halted due to "security issues for agency workers," including an assault and detention. These inspectors vet for pests and food safety. Halts disrupt imports. Criminal groups are linked to these security issues.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>California.</answer>
<other>The article states that avocados are Mexico's fourth most valuable agricultural export and their production increased significantly. It also states that "irregular weather patterns linked to climate change, including droughts and wildfires, have put a strain on [California's] farms in recent years, further feeding a reliance on imports" from Mexico.</other>
