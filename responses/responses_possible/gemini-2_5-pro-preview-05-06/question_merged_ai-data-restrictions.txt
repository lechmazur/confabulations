<other>The user wants me to answer questions based solely on the provided article. I will go through each question and find the answer directly from the text, or state N/A if the information is not present or cannot be logically inferred. I will use sentence fragments or words where possible, as requested.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Inability to afford licensing data directly from publishers.</answer>
<other>The article states, "They could also spell trouble for smaller A.I. outfits and academic researchers who rely on public data sets, and can't afford to license data directly from publishers."</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>New license restrictions primarily hinder later-arriving actors, as major tech companies already possess the data, potentially solidifying their lead.</answer>
<other>Stella Biderman is quoted: "Major tech companies already have all of the data. Changing the license on the data doesn't retroactively revoke that permission, and the primary impact is on later-arriving actors, who are typically either smaller start-ups or researchers." This implies that attempts to control data access might paradoxically benefit those who already have it.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Many researchers doubt that today's A.I. systems are capable of generating enough high-quality synthetic data to replace the human-created data they're losing.</answer>
<other>The article directly states this: "But many researchers doubt that today's A.I. systems are capable of generating enough high-quality synthetic data to replace the human-created data they're losing."</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The web will start shutting its doors.</answer>
<other>The article concludes with: "Eventually, if you take advantage of the web, the web will start shutting its doors."</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>They cannot afford to license data directly from publishers, and new restrictions primarily impact later-arriving actors like them, while major tech companies have existing data and can strike deals.</answer>
<other>The article mentions smaller outfits "can't afford to license data directly from publishers" and quotes Stella Biderman that "the primary impact is on later-arriving actors, who are typically either smaller start-ups or researchers." Major companies are noted to have "gone to extreme lengths... to gather more data" and "struck deals with publishers."</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Data gathered before license changes remains usable by those who collected it, disadvantaging newcomers.</answer>
<other>Stella Biderman's quote, "Changing the license on the data doesn't retroactively revoke that permission," implies that entities that already collected data are not affected by subsequent license changes for that previously collected data.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Later-arriving actors, typically smaller start-ups or researchers, face greater hurdles in data acquisition than established players who already possess large datasets.</answer>
<other>This is a direct interpretation of Stella Biderman's quote: "the primary impact is on later-arriving actors, who are typically either smaller start-ups or researchers."</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Forcing A.I. companies to move from treating data as free towards obtaining consent, striking deals, and potentially compensating data creators.</answer>
<other>The article discusses the "emerging crisis in consent," "blowback from data creators," and A.I. companies striking deals with publishers, indicating a shift from the "all-you-can-eat data buffet" approach.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that "5 percent of all data" across three datasets (C4, RefinedWeb, Dolma) has been restricted by Robots Exclusion Protocol. It also states "as much as 45 percent of the data in one set, C4, had been restricted by websites' terms of service." The 5% is an average and not specific to C4 for robots.txt. The article does not specify the overlap between these two types of restrictions for the C4 dataset, nor the precise robots.txt restriction percentage for C4 alone. Therefore, a combined unrestricted percentage for C4 cannot be calculated from the provided information.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that "25 percent of data from the highest-quality sources, has been restricted" by the Robots Exclusion Protocol across the three studied datasets. This implies 75% of high-quality data is unrestricted by *that specific protocol*. However, the question asks about the impact of *all identified restrictions*, which includes terms of service. The article provides a figure for terms of service restrictions ("as much as 45 percent") only for *all data* in *C4*, not specifically for "highest-quality sources" across *all three studied datasets*. Therefore, the combined impact of all restrictions on high-quality data across all datasets cannot be determined.</other>
