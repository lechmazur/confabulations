<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>London's data showing public health benefits from extra costs contrasts with Governor Hochul's argument of financial hardships for suspending a similar plan.</answer>
<other>The article states London's mayor aimed to persuade motorists "that the extra costs are good for public health," while Governor Hochul "said it would create financial hardships for some drivers."</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The article uses London's cleaner air and its mayor's re-election despite opposition citing financial hardship to challenge arguments against congestion pricing in New York based on financial hardship and political risk.</answer>
<other>The article mentions London's "air is cleaner" and Mr. Khan "prevailed, winning a third term," and that London's figures "could be used to bolster the efforts of mayors." This challenges the "financial hardship" and "politically risky" arguments mentioned for New York.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that the evidence of success from London's ULEZ expansion, which "could hold lessons for other politicians," provides a contrasting context to the legal challenges faced by the U.S. governor who shelved a similar policy in New York.</answer>
<other>The article states London's data "could hold lessons for other politicians, including in New York, where the United States' first congestion-pricing policy was shelved," immediately followed by mentioning the lawsuits against Governor Hochul.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>London's mayor successfully navigated the political risks of the ULEZ expansion and won re-election, which contrasts with the suspension of New York's similar initiative due to concerns about political risk in an election year.</answer>
<other>Mr. Khan "prevailed, winning a third term" despite the ULEZ expansion being a "battleground issue." Governor Hochul shelved the NY plan, with critics saying she "buckled because it was politically risky in a crucial election year."</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states London's high compliance means revenue is projected to end, and separately states New York's plan was expected to raise $1 billion annually. It does not draw a direct connection between London's compliance rates and New York's *projected* revenue figures or suggest NY's revenue would be similarly affected by compliance.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Both London's ULEZ and New York's proposed plan involve the generation of significant revenue.</answer>
<other>London's ULEZ "had brought more than 130 million pounds into city coffers," and New York's plan was "expected to... raise $1 billion annually."</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The article states that high and anticipated full compliance of vehicles with London's ULEZ standards is the reason the city is not expected to collect revenues from ULEZ fees by 2026.</answer>
<other>The article explicitly says, "by 2026, the city is not expected to collect revenues from ULEZ fees, because all cars will comply."</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that evidence from London's successful ULEZ expansion, which "could hold lessons for other politicians," provides a relevant contrasting example to the U.S. governor's decision to halt a similar policy, a decision now facing legal challenges.</answer>
<other>This is similar to question 3. The article links London's "evidence" and its potential as "lessons" to the New York situation where a similar policy was shelved and is now subject to lawsuits.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>London's recent and rapid success in implementing its ULEZ expansion and achieving air quality improvements within months contrasts sharply with New York's decades-long, unsuccessful struggle to enact a similar congestion pricing policy.</answer>
<other>London's expansion was "August last year" with results in "the first six months." New York has had "decades-long efforts to enact a congestion price" which "failed."</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>A parallel is that both schemes involve significant revenue generation; London's ULEZ generated substantial revenue, and a key intended benefit of New York's plan was the generation of substantial annual revenue.</answer>
<other>London's ULEZ "had brought more than 130 million pounds into city coffers." New York's plan was "expected to... raise $1 billion annually." Both relate to revenue generation, even if London's is projected to cease.</other>
