<answer>The improvement to the de-icing system since a 1994 crash might suggest that icing is a less probable cause or that any icing-related failure must be complex (e.g., failure of the improved system), potentially diverting focus from other factors or simpler icing scenarios.</answer>
<other>The article states the de-icing system was improved after a 1994 icing-related crash. This could lead investigators to initially downplay icing or focus heavily on how an *improved* system could fail, potentially distracting from the core issue of ice formation or other contributing factors.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The plane's speed reportedly did not drop low enough to cause a stall *unless* icing was extremely severe, creating a conditional statement where the stall (and subsequent fall from 17,000 feet) is dependent on the presence of extreme icing to alter stall characteristics at that speed.</answer>
<other>The article quotes an expert saying the plane's speed "did not drop far enough to cause a stall... unless icing was extremely severe." This links the observed speed drop (before falling from 17,000 feet) to the stall theory via the condition of severe icing.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The existence of a pilot procedure to counteract a malfunctioning anti-icing system by descending to warmer air (supported by the 63-degree ground temperature) challenges the theory that icing was an insurmountable cause, as this mitigation was seemingly not attempted or communicated.</answer>
<other>The article mentions that if the de-icing system malfunctioned, pilots could descend to warmer air. The ground temperature of 63 degrees suggests warmer air was available at lower altitudes. This known countermeasure, apparently not used (no communication), challenges the idea that icing alone was the unmanageable cause.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that the plane "spinning slowly as it plummeted" is characteristic of a stall, with an expert quoted saying, "You can't get into a spin without stalling." Thus, the described trajectory supports, rather than contradicts, expectations for a stall-induced crash according to the text.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The plane's last recorded speed was not low enough to cause a stall under normal conditions; this challenges the primary stall theory by requiring the additional condition of "extremely severe" icing to explain how a stall could occur at that speed.</answer>
<other>The article states, "The speed did not drop far enough to cause a stall, he said, unless icing was extremely severe." This discrepancy means a simple low-speed stall is unlikely, making the stall theory dependent on the presence of severe icing.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The pilots' failure to communicate with air traffic controllers or declare an emergency before the crash conflicts with the standard protocol of alerting controllers before descending to lower altitudes to mitigate icing.</answer>
<other>Standard protocol for descending to deal with icing includes alerting air traffic controllers. The article states, "pilots did not communicate with controllers just before the crash."</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>An expert stated, "We're talking about Brazil here, not Antarctica," implying warmer air at lower altitudes would melt ice. The crash location's ground temperature of "around 63 degrees" supports this assumption rather than contradicting it. The article does not present a detail about the crash location that contradicts this expert's underlying assumption.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The improvement made to the ATR plane model's de-icing system after 1994 paradoxically complicates the investigation by introducing more specific failure points to consider, such as whether the improved system was activated or if it failed, rather than just assessing the presence of icing with a known, less effective system.</answer>
<other>The article mentions the de-icing system was improved. This leads to questions like, "Did the crew activate the anti-icing system? Or did they activate it and it failed?" These questions add layers to the investigation compared to if the system hadn't been improved.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The specific design of the plane's de-icing system – "rubber tubes on the wings that are supposed to inflate and deflate to break up any ice" – becomes crucial as its functionality, activation, and potential failure are central to evaluating the icing theory.</answer>
<other>The article details this system for the ATR 72-500. The questions raised by experts ("Did the crew activate the anti-icing system? Or did they activate it and it failed?") directly pertain to this specific type of system.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states the plane "fell from 17,000 feet" and that there was a warning for "severe icing where the plane was flying." It does not, however, present the altitude of 17,000 feet as challenging any specific assumptions about the *gradualness* of ice accumulation. Severe icing could result from gradual accumulation reaching a critical point at that altitude.</other>
