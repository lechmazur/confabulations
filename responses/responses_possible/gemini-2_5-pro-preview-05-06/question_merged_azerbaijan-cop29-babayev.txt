<answer>Russia, exercising its veto power due to its invasion of Ukraine, blocked most other candidates from Eastern Europe or the Caucasus, leaving Azerbaijan as the only remaining option under the UN's rotational and consensus-based selection process.</answer>
<other>The article explains, "host countries are chosen on a rotating cycle, and this time it was the turn for a nation in Eastern Europe or the Caucasus. But because the location must be agreed upon by consensus, Russia was able to veto most candidates, seeing them as hostile to its invasion of Ukraine. Azerbaijan, eventually, was the only country left."</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The European Union's increased demand for Azerbaijani gas, as a replacement for Russian supplies, is used by Azerbaijan to question criticisms of gas production, with Mukhtar Babayev highlighting the EU energy commissioner's frequent visits to Baku to request more gas.</answer>
<other>The article quotes Mr. Babayev: "If the European countries are against gas, then why do they request more from Azerbaijan? Why does Commissioner Simson come to Baku three, four times in a year?" It also notes Europe "scrambled to find replacements for Russian supplies."</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that the possibility of Donald Trump's victory "looms over the summit's preparations" and that he has "promised to roll back laws that promote clean energy and to ramp up fossil fuel drilling." However, it does not specifically state what the potential impact would be on *Azerbaijan's* climate commitments at COP29.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Azerbaijan is hyper-dependent on fossil fuels and has barely begun the process of replacing oil and gas, yet it is hosting a global climate summit focused on avoiding the dangers of climate change, largely caused by fossil fuels.</answer>
<other>The article states Azerbaijan is "hyper-dependent on fossil fuels" and "has barely begun the process of replacing oil and gas," making it "an unlikely place for such talk."</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Natural gas consists largely of methane, which can leak and cause short-term spikes in the greenhouse effect, thereby undermining the argument that gas is a significantly "less-harm-to-nature energy resource" compared to oil and coal.</answer>
<other>The article notes that gas "consists largely of methane, which can leak and cause short-term spikes in the greenhouse effect," even though Mr. Babayev calls gas "a less-harm-to-nature energy resource."</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Azerbaijan plans to invest in renewable energy at home, suggesting a move towards decarbonization, while simultaneously aiming for increased gas exports, which contributes to global fossil fuel consumption and emissions.</answer>
<other>The article states, "The future, Mr. Aliyev's government has said, is investment in renewable energy at home coupled with increased gas exports." This presents a contradictory approach.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Western countries advocate for rapid climate action and have barred their banks from financing fossil fuels, yet Europe has increased its consumption of Azerbaijani gas and hopes for pipeline expansion, while the United States calls for faster climate action even as it increases its own oil and gas production and exports.</answer>
<other>The article highlights: "Even as Europe in recent years barred its banks from financing fossil fuels, it gobbled up Azerbaijani gas and now hopes others will fund the expansion of the pipelines. Similarly, the United States has called on the world to move more quickly to fight climate change, even as it produces and exports more oil and gas than ever."</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Azerbaijan, a petrostate chosen due to geopolitical maneuvering involving Russia's veto, is hosting COP29, highlighting the challenge of a fossil fuel-dependent nation leading global climate talks, amidst pressures from divergent international interests, internal concerns about energy transition, and the contradictory climate policies of major Western powers.</answer>
<other>The article details Azerbaijan's selection process ("quirky United Nations selection process," Russia's veto), its economic dependence ("hyper-dependent on fossil fuels," "Nearly all of Azerbaijan's exports are oil and gas"), the internal pressures ("fear the global energy transition"), and the "often-contradictory policies of climate-conscious Western countries."</other>
