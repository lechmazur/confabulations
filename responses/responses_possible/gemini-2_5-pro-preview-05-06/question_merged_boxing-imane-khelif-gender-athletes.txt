<answer>Track and field requires athletes with 46XY DSD to lower their testosterone levels to a designated point for two years before being eligible to compete in international competitions, while boxing's rules primarily link a competitor's eligibility to the gender listed on their passport and permit gender testing but give no details about the circumstances or specific rules for 46XY DSD.</answer>
<other>The article contrasts the specific testosterone-lowering requirement in track and field for 46XY DSD athletes with the vaguer, passport-based rules in boxing which lack detailed procedures for gender testing or conditions like 46XY DSD.</other>

<answer>The I.O.C.'s expulsion of the International Boxing Association led to the I.O.C. overseeing the Paris Olympics boxing competition through a temporary body, but the eligibility rules used for the event were those established by the expelled I.B.A. several years prior.</answer>
<other>The article states the I.O.C. took over but used the old I.B.A. rules.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states the I.O.C. called the disqualification process "arbitrary" and "unfair," which relates to its concerns about the I.B.A.'s governance. However, the article does not state how the disqualification related to the I.O.C.'s concerns about the I.B.A.'s funding sources. Since the question asks how it related to both governance AND funding sources, and the latter is not addressed, the answer is N/A.</other>

<answer>For boxing at the Paris Olympics, the I.O.C. is directly overseeing the competition through a temporary body it established, whereas for other sports with gender eligibility issues, the I.O.C. has left it up to individual sports governing bodies to determine their own eligibility rules.</answer>
<other>The article highlights that the I.O.C. usually defers to individual sports federations but took direct control of boxing for the Paris Olympics via a temporary body, albeit using existing rules.</other>

<other>The article mentions this condition in the context of the chromosome claims and track and field regulations, suggesting its potential relevance to the boxing controversy even if not explicitly linked by officials in that case.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The test results from the 2022 world championships, which indicated Khelif and Lin had failed eligibility requirements, were not received until after the competition concluded, so they were not disqualified at that time; this situation, where they were allowed to compete in 2023 and then disqualified mid-competition, contributed to the controversy.</answer>
<other>The article explains that the delay in 2022 results meant no disqualification then, making the 2023 disqualification more contentious.</other>
