<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that "Caped Crusader" has allowed Timm to "hew even closer to his original plans for 'BTAS'". This implies the approach in "Caped Crusader" is more aligned with, or a fulfillment of, his original vision for "BTAS", rather than differing from it. The premise of the question (that the "Caped Crusader" approach *differs* from his original vision for "BTAS") is not supported by the text.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions Hamish Linklater was chosen to play Timm's conception of the character and is versatile. It states Linklater himself was "striving to find a unified sound that worked as well for Batman as it did for Bruce Wayne" during his audition preparation, but it does not state that he was chosen *because* of an established "ability to unify the character's dual identities."</other>

<answer>His relationships with allies are not chummy.</answer>
<other>The article contrasts "Caped Crusader" with "BTAS," "where Batman still had chummy relationships with allies." For "Caped Crusader," Timm's preferred hero type "didn't crack jokes. They weren't hugging their teammates."</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states "Caped Crusader" takes Batman back to his roots as a Depression-age pulp hero and is set when he has "barely begun his war on crime." It does not specify any aspect of his *origin story* (e.g., the events that made him Batman) being reimagined to reflect the Depression-era setting, only the setting for his early career and the style of hero.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions Timm wants Batman to be like pulp heroes who "didn't crack jokes" and "weren't hugging their teammates." However, it does not explicitly state that avoiding these traits is "contrary to some modern interpretations." The comparison made is to his original vision for "BTAS" and the pulp heroes.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Portraying Batman as a more remote protagonist who doesn't wear his heart on his sleeve, crack jokes, or hug teammates.</answer>
<other>The article states Timm hoped the "BTAS" protagonist would be "very remote -- none of them wore their heart on their sleeve... They didn't crack jokes. They weren't hugging their teammates," but he "couldn't fully realize this on 'BTAS'." "Caped Crusader" allows him to "hew even closer to his original plans for 'BTAS,' unhindered by the content restrictions."</other>
