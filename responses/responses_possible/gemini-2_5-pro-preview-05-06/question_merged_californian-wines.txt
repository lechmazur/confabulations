<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>An advantage among consumers who choose not to pursue esoteric options and get overwhelmed by too many choices.</answer>
<other>This is supported by the sentence: "Paradoxically, the narrow set of choices has proved to be a commercial advantage for California, especially among consumers who choose not to pursue the more esoteric options available from around the world," and Stephen Rannekleiv's comment about consumers getting overwhelmed.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>European vineyard land has often been in a family for generations and is paid for, while California vineyard owners are often mortgaged and need higher returns.</answer>
<other>This is based on Mike Veseth's explanation: "For small estates in Europe, vineyard land has often been in a family for generations. It's paid for, while vineyard owners in California are often mortgaged and need higher returns than in Europe, Mr. Veseth said."</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Marketing's preference for simplicity makes California's narrower range of grapes, which require less consumer investment to understand, more appealing to consumers who get overwhelmed by the diversity of European wines.</answer>
<other>This is derived from Stephen Rannekleiv's quote about California's focus on marketing and consumers getting overwhelmed, and the author's statement that "marketers prefer simplicity."</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>European producers often honor centuries of tradition and heritage, even with unfashionable wines, while California's grape choices are more likely based on sales potential rather than legacy or tradition.</answer>
<other>The article states: "Many small producers [in Europe] take particular pride in what they consider their heritage... California's setup is entirely different. Its choices of which grapes to plant are more likely to be based on sales potential rather than legacy or tradition."</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>California wines have singular identities shaped by American terroirs; European wines' identities are also shaped by their different climates and soils, alongside winemakers' sensibilities and centuries of tradition.</answer>
<other>The article says, "The grapes are grown in different climates and soils, and the winemakers have their own sensibilities. California wine producers... are making wines with their own singular identities, shaped by American terroirs." European wines' diversity is also linked to "centuries of tradition" and "distinctive array of grapes."</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Marketers prefer simplicity and might wish to eliminate diverse grape options to focus on selling a few popular ones, thereby reducing perceived diversity.</answer>
<other>The author states: "Diversity and complexity are beautiful, but marketers prefer simplicity. They might wish to eliminate dozens of, say, Italian white grapes so they could focus on selling pinot grigio."</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Destroying local traditions and diminishing choices for wine lovers.</answer>
<other>The author states that focusing on a few popular grapes "would mean destroying local traditions and diminishing choices. For wine lovers, where's the joy in that?"</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Most are not particularly good and not on par with what can be found from elsewhere in the world at that price point.</answer>
<other>The author states: "The problem is that most are not particularly good, certainly not on par with what I can find from elsewhere in the world..."</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Megan Bell.</answer>
<other>Megan Bell (Margins) makes a skin-fermented Chenin Blanc. Tegan Passalacqua (Sandlands) also makes Chenin Blanc, described as "bright and floral," implying a different, more conventional technique. Both focus on grapes/vineyards on the margins or neglected. Megan Bell is the one whose wine uses the explicitly different technique (skin-fermentation) for the shared grape variety.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>From small producers.</answer>
<other>The article's subtitle states: "These bottles, from small producers... are superb with singular identities." The cheapest wine (Broc Cellars) is from a "micro-negociant" and the most expensive (Lady of the Sunshine) is from a "proprietor," both indicating small scale. The author is drawn to "smaller producers."</other>
