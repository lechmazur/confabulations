<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article provides details on resources for the recent rescue (869 people, 93 vehicles, etc.) but for the previous disaster, it only states that "all-out rescue efforts" were ordered, without specifying the resources deployed. Therefore, a comparison of resources to infer effectiveness cannot be made based solely on the text.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that China's top leaders ordered "all-out rescue efforts" and that Mr. Xi ordered local governments to pay more attention to risks.

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Frequent rain-related disasters challenging the country's extensive network of newly built expressways.</answer>
<other>The article states, "It was the second such rain-related disaster in less than three months, as extreme weather challenges the country's extensive network of newly built expressways." This links the frequency of disasters to the rapidly expanded ("newly built," "extensive network") expressways being challenged.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that "Mr. Xi had ordered that local governments across China pay more attention to identifying and dealing with such risks."

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Mao's turbulent Cultural Revolution.</answer>
<other>The article states, "Mr. Xi himself left Beijing for his father's home county soon after Mao's turbulent Cultural Revolution began in 1966, later spending his teenage years in Shaanxi Province." Shaanxi Province is the region of the latest disaster.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Large-scale infrastructure development, including an extensive network of newly built expressways, being challenged by extreme weather.</answer>
<other>The article describes China's heavy investment and rapid construction of infrastructure ("invested heavily," "extensive network of newly built expressways," "twice as many miles of expressways as... the United States"). It then contrasts this with the vulnerability: "extreme weather challenges the country's extensive network of newly built expressways," leading to "deadly episode[s]."</other>
