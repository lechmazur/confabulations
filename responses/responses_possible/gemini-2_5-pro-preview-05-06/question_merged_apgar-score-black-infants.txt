<other>I will go through each question and find the answer directly from the provided article. I will ensure that the answer is concise and directly addresses the question asked, using "N/A" if the information is not present or cannot be logically inferred from the text.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Black newborns had lower Apgar scores but did not have more abnormal umbilical cord gas values, an objective measure of metabolic condition and oxygen levels.</answer>
<other>The article states: "Although Black newborns had lower Apgar scores at one and five minutes than non-Black babies and were admitted to the NICU at higher rates than non-Black babies, they did not have more abnormal cord gas values." and "'There was no difference in the umbilical cord gases, but there was a difference in the Apgar scores -- that's the essential take-home message,' said Dr. Quetzal Class".</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Skin color.</answer>
<other>The article mentions Dr. Sara E. Edwards' study found "that the skin color portion of the test was driving the racial discrepancies in the first Apgar tests" and Dr. Class stated this "contributes to whether that neonate is sent to the NICU or not." Dr. Grunebaum also believes "the skin color component should be dropped".</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Black newborns did not have more abnormal umbilical cord gas values despite having lower Apgar scores and higher NICU admission rates than non-Black babies.</answer>
<other>The article states: "What the researchers found surprised them. Although Black newborns had lower Apgar scores at one and five minutes than non-Black babies and were admitted to the NICU at higher rates than non-Black babies, they did not have more abnormal cord gas values."</other>

<answer>Low Apgar scores were far more inaccurate predictors of poor outcomes for Black babies; Asian infants with low scores were 100 times more likely to die than those with normal scores, while Black babies with low scores were only 23 times more likely to die than those with normal scores.</answer>
<other>The article states: "Low scores at five minutes were far more inaccurate predictors of poor outcomes for Black babies than for other babies, she and her colleagues found. Asian infants with low Apgar scores were 100 times more likely to die than Asian babies with normal scores... But Black babies with low scores were only 23 times more likely to die than those with normal scores."</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>White infants were more likely to achieve a perfect Apgar score (3.3%) compared to Chinese-American infants (1.2%).</answer>
<other>The article states: "3.3 percent of white babies scored a perfect 10, compared with 1.4 percent of Black newborns... Only 1.2 percent of Chinese-American infants got a 10".</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Black babies with low Apgar scores were 23 times more likely to die than those with normal scores, whereas low-scoring white babies were 54 times more likely to die than white babies with normal scores.</answer>
<other>The article states: "Low-scoring white babies were 54 times more likely to die than white babies with normal scores. But Black babies with low scores were only 23 times more likely to die than those with normal scores."</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>It may result in extra medical treatment, such as unnecessary NICU admission, for healthy babies of color.</answer>
<other>The article states: "...critics of the Apgar score's reliance on skin color fear that it is resulting in extra medical treatment being heaped on babies of color who are healthy, potentially sending them to intensive care unnecessarily."</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The study initiated by Dr. Sara E. Edwards.</answer>
<other>The article states: "Only one study has incorporated the kind of data needed for researchers to examine whether the skin color component was the culprit dragging down Black babies' Apgar scores. Dr. Sara E. Edwards initiated the study... The study also found that the skin color portion of the test was driving the racial discrepancies in the first Apgar tests..."</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>It won't be easy to find another measure to replace it, and it's not clear that losing the metric altogether would suffice; additionally, alternatives like umbilical cord gas analyses are not immediate, and pulse oximetry is less accurate for Black patients.</answer>
<other>The article states: "If skin color is taken out of the Apgar score, for example, it won't be easy to find another measure to replace it -- and it's not clear that losing the metric altogether would suffice." It also mentions: "Umbilical cord gas analyses take time to run through a lab and can't provide immediate results. Pulse oximetry... has also been found to be less accurate for Black patients." The question asks for *a* specific challenge, and the difficulty of finding a replacement is directly stated. The issues with alternatives are also specific challenges.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The American Academy of Pediatrics stresses a quick assessment of breathing and heart rate to guide resuscitation decisions, not color, and does not emphasize the Apgar score.</answer>
<other>The article quotes Dr. Vishal S. Kapadia: "'We do not emphasize the Apgar score at all... What we stress is a quick assessment of breathing and heart rate to guide resuscitation decisions, not color.'"</other>
