<answer>MAC Lipstick in Ruby Woo</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Portrait of a Lady</answer>
<other>The interviewee mentions, "the Frederic Malle Body Butters -- the scents stay with you and go onto your sheets". However, "the scents" is plural and the specific scents are not named. She also says, "I wear the Portrait of a Lady perfume every day." As a perfume worn daily, its scent would likely transfer to sheets. Since the question asks for "What scent" (singular), the specifically named "Portrait of a Lady" perfume is a suitable answer. The guest using "all the products" would use this perfume.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>Gelee's production involves a powder form for convenience. The article states the glass cabins were "designed by the Estonian mirror house production company Ood" and "added" to the property.
