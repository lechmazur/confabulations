<answer>Duct tape covering cracks in the lobby ceiling.</answer>
<other>The article states, "Overhead, parts of the ceiling have deteriorated, and some of its cracks are covered in what appears to be duct tape." The lobby is described as a "grand, Art Deco-style lobby," so this specific issue in a prominent area symbolizes the decline.</other>

<other>The article mentions the rent increased from $7.75 million to $32.5 million in 2018, and this is discussed in the context of the building's lower sale price and one co-owner's insolvency, implying a financial strain.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions the Cloud Club shut down in the 1970s, which was a period of decline but predates the "yuppie success" era of the late '80s. It does not specify a particular former tenant whose departure coincided with the shift *from* the yuppie success era to the more recent deterioration described.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The top of the Chrysler Building.</answer>
<other>The article quotes a line from "Annie": "You'll stay up 'til this dump shines like the top of the Chrysler Building." The "top of the Chrysler Building" (part of its terraced crown) is the architectural feature. The irony lies in the building's current state of disrepair and loss of "shine" compared to this idealized image.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Its lack of an observation deck.</answer>
<other>The article states, "the Chrysler lacks an observation deck, unlike the Empire State Building...or the newly constructed One Vanderbilt," and connects this to tourists having "nowhere else to go" and crowding the lobby, highlighting a disadvantage compared to more modern or better-equipped tourist attractions.</other>

<answer>The line from "Annie": "You'll stay up 'til this dump shines like the top of the Chrysler Building."</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>26.15%</answer>
<other>The rent is set to increase from $32.5 million to $41 million by 2028. The increase is $41 million - $32.5 million = $8.5 million. The percentage increase is ($8.5 million / $32.5 million) * 100 = 26.1538...%, which is approximately 26.15%.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that "Spaces occupies over 100,000 square feet". If the retail space is half of this, it would be "half of over 100,000 square feet". Since "over 100,000 square feet" is not an exact figure, half of it is also not an exact figure, making it impossible to calculate the total annual revenue precisely based on the information given.</other>
