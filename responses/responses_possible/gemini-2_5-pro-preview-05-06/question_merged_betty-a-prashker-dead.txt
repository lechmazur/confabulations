<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>After being rejected by the male-only Century Association, a club where publishing careers were advanced in a realm closed to women, she established the Grill Room of the Four Seasons as "her club" and preferred venue for mixing business and pleasure, thereby creating her own center of influence as a powerful woman in publishing, which was consistent with her advocacy for women in a male-dominated industry.</answer>
