<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that astrotourism is "seen as a growing potential economic driver" but does not provide the primary reason why it is considered so, beyond its general appeal and the factors catalyzing interest in night skies.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Full-moon goat hikes</answer>
<other>This activity involves hiking on terrain (terrestrial) with goats (domesticated animals) under the full moon (celestial element, natural satellite).</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article describes full-moon goat hikes where people hike with leashed goats and see the full moon, but it does not explicitly state that they are "guided by" both the goats and the moon. For the full-moon river float, the moon is mentioned as a guiding light, but this activity does not involve living creatures guiding participants on terrain.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Bioluminescence</answer>
<other>During the night snorkeling at Secret Bay, bioluminescence is described as "tiny underwater plankton that, stirred up by the activity, create an ethereal blue glow, mimicking the cosmos above."</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Secret Bay, Dominica</answer>
<other>At Secret Bay, guests can experience night snorkeling where they observe marine life and then bioluminescence, which mimics "the cosmos above," implying celestial observation is part of the broader context or at least comparable.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Night snorkeling</answer>
<other>During night snorkeling at Secret Bay, participants use "diving lights" (artificial light) to explore and see creatures, and then "extinguish their lights" to behold bioluminescence (a different natural phenomenon).</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The full-moon river float involves floating on water and seeing the Milky Way. However, the article does not explicitly state that the objects seen during this specific activity are "millions of light-years away." The Andromeda Galaxy (which is millions of light-years away) is mentioned in the context of stargazing at Enchantment Resort, which is not an activity involving floating on water.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The full-moon goat hike involves close encounters with goats (Earth-bound creatures) and observation of the full moon (a celestial body). However, the question asks for "distant observations of celestial bodies" (plural), and the article only explicitly mentions the "full moon" as being observed during the goat hike, not multiple celestial bodies or general stargazing as part of that specific reward.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The night snorkeling experience involves using artificial illumination (diving lights) to observe marine life. However, the article does not state that participants then rely on natural light for "terrestrial navigation." The snorkeling trip is boat-based, and there is no mention of subsequent land navigation.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The full-moon goat hike mentions a view of the "full moon bouncing off" a lake's surface (reflection), but the transportation for this experience is hiking, not on water. The full-moon river float uses water for transportation (kayak/canoe), but the article does not explicitly state that water is also used as a medium for reflection of celestial objects during this float.</other>
