<answer>It will allow Boeing to more easily monitor and change Spirit's production practices and fully align its production and safety systems with Spirit's workforce, aiming to stem quality problems.</answer>
<other>The article states: "In buying Spirit, Boeing hopes to stem quality problems that have plagued the supplier in recent years. While it already has significant influence over Spirit, Boeing will more easily be able to monitor and change production practices by owning the business." And, "By reintegrating Spirit," ... the company "can fully align" its production and safety systems with its work force."</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The January incident involved a door plug that had been removed so Spirit workers could perform repairs, and the plane subsequently left the factory without necessary bolts; direct Boeing ownership of Spirit would allow for better monitoring of such production practices and alignment of safety systems to potentially prevent such occurrences.</answer>
<other>The article mentions the plug "had been removed so that Spirit workers could perform repairs" and that owning Spirit would allow Boeing to "more easily be able to monitor and change production practices" and "fully align" systems.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Boeing's historical reliance on independent suppliers, a strategy from the early 2000s to cut costs, led to the creation of Spirit AeroSystems. Now, Boeing is acquiring Spirit to address quality problems that have plagued the supplier, exemplified by Spirit's involvement in repairs related to the January 737 Max 9 incident.</answer>
<other>The article states Boeing started "relying more extensively on independent suppliers in the early 2000s" and Spirit was "created during that outsourcing drive." Boeing is buying Spirit to "stem quality problems that have plagued the supplier," and the January incident involved a plug removed for Spirit workers to perform repairs.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It reveals a stricter approach to quality control, prioritizing that fuselages fully meet Boeing's standards upon acceptance rather than tolerating some flaws to be fixed later to maintain production speed.</answer>
<other>The article says Boeing "stopped accepting 737 bodies, or fuselages, from Spirit that do not fully meet Boeing's standards -- rather than tolerating some flaws that could be fixed later, to keep production moving."</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Boeing's plan to reduce traveled work, a practice of performing tasks out of sequence that can contribute to defects and poor work, is part of its response to improve quality following the January incident, which involved a significant defect.</answer>
<other>The article states Boeing "aims to reduce its practice of performing manufacturing tasks out of sequence, a practice known as traveled work" because "too much can disrupt the complicated process of making airplanes, possibly contributing to defects and poor work." This is mentioned as one of the changes Boeing made in recent months in response to the January incident.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Expanded training and increased inspections at both its 737 factory and at Spirit are direct quality improvement measures that complement the broader strategy of reintegrating Spirit, which aims to fully align production and safety systems across the combined workforce and operations for better quality oversight.</answer>
<other>The article mentions expanded training and increased inspections "at its 737 factory in Renton, Wash., as well as at Spirit" as changes made by Boeing. Reintegrating Spirit is intended to "fully align" production and safety systems.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems, with talks announced after the January 5th incident, aligns with Boeing's internal efforts (like expanded training, increased inspections, and stricter acceptance criteria for Spirit's fuselages, implemented "in recent months" and "since March") as both are aimed at addressing quality problems and improving quality control in light of recent incidents.</answer>
<other>The article states talks for the acquisition were announced at the end of February, after the January incident. The acquisition is to "stem quality problems" and "fully align" systems. Internal efforts were also made "in response" to the January incident.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Boeing's historical outsourcing strategy, which led to the creation of Spirit AeroSystems as an independent supplier in 2005, is directly related to the current challenges, as Boeing is now acquiring Spirit to address quality problems that have plagued this key outsourced supplier.</answer>
<other>The article states Spirit was "created during that outsourcing drive in 2005" and Boeing is now buying Spirit to "stem quality problems that have plagued the supplier."</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>It represents a reversal of the decision Boeing made two decades ago to outsource production of key parts to independent suppliers.</answer>
<other>The article explicitly states: "The multibillion-dollar deal will reverse a decision the plane maker made two decades ago to outsource production of key parts to independent suppliers."</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Traveled work, the practice of performing manufacturing tasks out of sequence.</answer>
<other>The article states: "Boeing has also said it aims to reduce its practice of performing manufacturing tasks out of sequence, a practice known as traveled work. Some traveled work is considered necessary, but too much can disrupt the complicated process of making airplanes, possibly contributing to defects and poor work."</other>
