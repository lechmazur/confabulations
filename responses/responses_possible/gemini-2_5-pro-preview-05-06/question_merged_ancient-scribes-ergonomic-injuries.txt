<answer>Damage to temporomandibular joints</answer>
<other>The article states, "damage to temporomandibular joints, where the jaw attaches to the skull, was found more than twice as often among the scribes as among the non-scribes." Dr. Brukner Havelkova "speculated that the higher incidence among scribes might have been a consequence of nibbling the brushlike heads of the pens," which is a writing-related habit.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The architectural element in scribes' tombs is the "inscribed false door," which acted as "portals." The modern office feature for Bartleby is a "screen," which served to relegate or separate him. The article does not state these features share a function; their described functions (portal vs. separator) are different.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Right knee</answer>
<other>Artistic depictions show scribes in "one-legged squatting postures." The study theorized "scribes frequently squatted on their right legs, which could explain why their right knees were a particularly common point of osteoarthritis." The right knee is the body part that is the specific osteoarthritis location correlated with this use.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Egyptian rush pen</answer>
<other>The article states scribes used "stems of rush (and later reed) as pens." Maintenance involved: "When the fibers became ragged, the scribe chopped off the end and gnawed on the next section." This "nibbling the brushlike heads of the pens" was speculated to contribute to damage to temporomandibular joints.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Osteoarthritis in the spine (especially the neck)</answer>
<other>The article mentions that "In a typical scribe's working position, the head had to be bent forward... which changed the center of gravity of the head and put stress on the spine." This led to osteoarthritis, especially in the neck. This mirrors ailments of "desk jockeys today" who also suffer from poor posture.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Squatting on the right leg</answer>
<other>Artistic depictions show scribes in "one-legged squatting postures." The study "theorized that scribes frequently squatted on their right legs, which could explain why their right knees were a particularly common point of osteoarthritis." This right-sided damage was a pattern observed in scribes.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The repetitive tasks and postures of scribal work</answer>
<other>Scribes were identified in the study by, among other things, "titles found in their tombs" (a form of tomb decoration). These titles infer they were scribes. The work of a scribe involved "repetitive tasks" and specific "postures," which led to degenerative changes like osteoarthritis, a condition not as prevalent in the lower-class (non-scribe) remains studied.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article lists several anatomical features affected in scribes (e.g., spine, jaw, thumb, knee). It mentions scribes manipulated "papyrus scroll" and "sheets of papyrus." The article does not name any part of a papyrus scroll that shares its name with an anatomical feature affected in scribes.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Inferred social rank</answer>
<other>Scribes were identified by their "inferred social rank" (among other factors related to their burials). They were "dignitaries." The irony is that "For all their prestige, the scribes... faced many of the same occupational hazards as the desk jockeys... of today," indicating their high status did not protect them from the physical detriments of their work.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions "recording the biennial cattle census" as a scribal task. However, it does not link this specific biennial task to a *specific pattern* of joint wear that would be distinct from the wear caused by other repetitive writing tasks performed by scribes. The joint wear patterns are attributed to general scrivening postures and tool use.</other>
