<answer>Sloping greens with false fronts.</answer>
<other>The article states Crenshaw restored Pinehurst No. 2 with "sloping greens" and "false fronts" as Donald Ross intended, which "defend it so well". The Postage Stamp is known for its "tiny green" testing "accuracy". Both features challenge precision on approach shots and penalize misses near the green.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Clampett's triple-bogey on a long hole and Woods's high score on the short Postage Stamp, both derailing their title chances.</answer>
<other>The article mentions Clampett "carded a triple-bogey 8 that sent him reeling" on the long sixth hole, and Woods "took a 6 on the par-3 Postage Stamp hole" when he was in contention. These examples show how both types of holes at Troon can severely impact a player's performance.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Oakmont's strategy of extreme length to make a hole unreachable in two, contrasting with Doak's preference for tempting players to risk trouble on seemingly reachable long holes.</answer>
<other>Oakmont stretched its 12th hole to 684 yards. Tom Doak is quoted saying, "It's better when the long hitter thinks he can get there, so he will risk getting in trouble to do it," rather than making it "unreachable in two" through extreme length.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Both players being in contention at Royal Troon and having their chances significantly damaged by a high score on a single hole.</answer>
<other>Clampett "led by five after two rounds" before his triple-bogey. Woods "was in contention at Troon until he took a 6 on the par-3 Postage Stamp hole."</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Reed's good score on an extremely long course (Erin Hills) demonstrating that length is not the strongest deterrent, thereby highlighting the effectiveness of short, thinking holes like the Postage Stamp.</answer>
<other>The article states Reed shot 73 on Erin Hills at maximum yardage, followed by Hurdzan's quote: "Length is not a strong deterrent to scoring among the elite players of today, but making them think is, and that is what a short hole can do." The Postage Stamp is the article's prime example of such a short hole.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>A short hole with surrounding bunkers that creates uncertainty and makes players unsure, like Erin Hills' ninth.</answer>
<other>Hurdzan praised Troon's "capriciousness of the fairways" making players "hit it hard and true." He also designed Erin Hills, where "The ninth at Erin Hills is just 135 yards with bunkers surrounding it; it made many players at the 2017 U.S. Open unsure." Both features create uncertainty and challenge elite players.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Both being short par-3s with greens surrounded by bunkers, creating uncertainty and testing players' accuracy and nerve.</answer>
<other>The Postage Stamp is "123 yards... A tiny green surrounded by five bunkers." Erin Hills' ninth is "just 135 yards with bunkers surrounding it; it made many players... unsure." Both test skill on short holes.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Tom Doak's.</answer>
<other>Oakmont stretched its 12th hole to 684 yards. Tom Doak stated he "wouldn't want to do that anyway" (make a hole 700 yards to be unreachable) and prefers when "the long hitter thinks he can get there."</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Tom Doak's view on creating a tee-shot hazard so challenging it almost certainly costs players a stroke.</answer>
<other>Royal Troon's fairways are described as "capricious," where "the ball can land and scoot one way or the other," making tee shots challenging. Doak suggested "a tee-shot hazard so challenging... that it almost certainly costs players a stroke." Both emphasize the difficulty and penalty associated with the tee shot.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Both courses featuring greens with significant roll-offs that demand precise approach shots.</answer>
<other>Pinehurst No. 2 has "sloping greens" with "false fronts" causing balls to "roll back." The article states, "We're going to see some of that at Troon because those greens have a lot of roll off."</other>
