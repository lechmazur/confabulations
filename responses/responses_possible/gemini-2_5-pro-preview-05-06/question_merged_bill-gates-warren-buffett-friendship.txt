<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Bloat and inflated operating costs.</answer>
<other>The article explicitly states, "For more than a decade, Mr. Buffett -- known for his love of lean and efficient operations free of bureaucracy -- had been bothered by what he saw as the bloat and inflated operating costs of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation," and this is mentioned immediately before stating his 2023 decision about posthumous donations.</other>

<answer>It led him to entrust his fortune to the Gates Foundation, run by Bill Gates, for philanthropic disbursement during his lifetime, as he believed in giving back wealth but preferred not to oversee its disbursement himself, instead picking capable managers.</answer>
<other>The article explains Buffett believed in Carnegie's ideas about giving back but "had little interest in overseeing the disbursement of his own wealth." Instead, "Mr. Buffett was picking Mr. Gates to run his philanthropy for him," similar to how he picked managers for Berkshire Hathaway.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The article shows Buffett exercising control by redirecting his posthumous donations because the Gates Foundation did not meet his expectations for lean, efficient operations and risk-taking philanthropy, demonstrating a donor's influence over how their funds are used.</answer>
<other>The article details Buffett's concerns about "bloat and inflated operating costs" and the foundation becoming "complacent," and his subsequent decision that his remaining fortune "wouldn't continue to go to the organization" after his death. This illustrates a donor using their financial leverage to align philanthropic activities with their vision.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that the remaining shares, valued at around $100 billion in 2023, "would be placed into a trust. His three children would be the co-trustees, and they would have a decade after their father's death to disburse those funds to charity." It does not specify which philanthropic entity or entities, not already mentioned as receiving funds (like the family foundations), will receive the bulk of this trust.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>His lack of forte in small talk and repartee, not being immediately interested in the person in front of him, and courtesies being lost on him.</answer>
<other>The article describes Bill Gates: "small talk and repartee are not his forte. He isn't immediately interested in the person in front of him... Courtesies are lost on him." Later, it states Buffett "was also upset by comments relayed to him by others who had found Mr. Gates rude and condescending," which could stem from these traits.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Gates's traditional billionaire lifestyle, with multiple homes, expensive art, and luxury cars, contrasts with the principle from "The Gospel of Wealth" that the wealthy should disburse their fortune as an "antidote for the temporary unequal distribution of wealth," as such lavish personal spending represents wealth not being used for public good.</answer>
<other>The article describes Gates's lifestyle ("multiple homes, planes, expensive art...oil painting...for a reported $30 million...several Porsches") and Carnegie's essay arguing the wealthy man should "disburse his fortune" as the "true antidote for the temporary unequal distribution of wealth." The lavish spending on personal assets is wealth not disbursed for public benefit, subtly contradicting the spirit of Carnegie's message about reconciling rich and poor through philanthropy.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The foundation's growth into a "far bigger framework" and "big institutionalized philanthropy," necessary to manage large donations and achieve wide impact, paradoxically led to the "bloat and inflated operating costs" that Buffett found problematic.</answer>
<other>The article praises the foundation's ability to build a "far bigger framework" to handle Buffett's donations and become a "big institutionalized philanthropy." However, Buffett, who prefers "lean and efficient operations," was bothered by the "bloat and inflated operating costs," which can be a consequence of such large-scale institutional growth.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The foundation's development into a "big institutionalized philanthropy" with a "far bigger framework" capable of handling massive donations and reshaping global philanthropy.</answer>
<other>The article highlights the foundation's achievement in building a "far bigger framework" and cementing "big institutionalized philanthropy." This scale and institutionalization, while positive for its capacity and impact, likely contributed to the "bloat," "inflated operating costs," and "complacency" that Buffett later found problematic.</other>
