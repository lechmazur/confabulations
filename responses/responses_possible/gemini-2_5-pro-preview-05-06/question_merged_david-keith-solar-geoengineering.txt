<other>The central figure is David Keith. I will go through each question and find the relevant information in the article.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Spraying a pollutant (sulfur dioxide) into the sky to engineer the stratosphere.</answer>
<other>The article states, "David Keith wants to spray a pollutant into the sky to block some sunlight" and later, "To repair the climate and return it to a more pristine state, we may need to take even more drastic action and engineer the stratosphere."</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Keith believes the risks are well understood, not as severe as portrayed, quantitatively small compared to benefits, and the uncertainties are not that big, while Raymond Pierrehumbert considers solar geoengineering a grave threat to human civilization, not safe to deploy, and even research on it actively dangerous.</answer>
<other>Dr. Keith: "the risks posed by solar geoengineering are well understood, not as severe as portrayed by critics and dwarfed by the potential benefits." and "there's really a lot of evidence that the risks are quantitatively small compared to the benefits, and the uncertainties just aren't that big." Raymond Pierrehumbert: "said he considered solar geoengineering a grave threat to human civilization. 'It's not only a bad idea in terms of something that would never be safe to deploy,' he said. 'But even doing research on it is not just a waste of money, but actively dangerous.'"</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>His 1992 paper raised questions about who should authorize the use of these technologies and who is liable if something goes wrong, which are central to governance concerns.</answer>
<other>The article states: "In 1992, he published an academic paper, 'A Serious Look at Geoengineering,' that raised the questions that would shape his career: Who should authorize the use of these technologies? Who is liable if something goes wrong?" These are governance issues.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>He cites the natural climate change caused by the Mount Pinatubo eruption, which lowered temperatures, as validation for his idea of intentionally altering Earth's climate to blunt global warming, and his observation of a shrinking glacier (a natural change due to warming) confirmed his belief that drastic action like engineering the stratosphere is needed.</answer>
<other>The article mentions: "Dr. Keith cites that event [Mount Pinatubo eruption] as validation of an idea that has become his life's work: He believes that by intentionally releasing sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, it would be possible to lower temperatures worldwide..." And regarding the glacier: "It was a visual reminder that global warming is upending the natural world, and it confirmed his central, controversial belief: Humans have already altered the planet... To repair the climate... we may need to take even more drastic action and engineer the stratosphere."</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>His personal windfall was about $72 million, while the funding for his new academic program could reach as much as $100 million.</answer>
<other>The article states: "Dr. Keith owned about 4 percent of the company at the time of the sale, delivering him a personal windfall of about $72 million." And for the new program: "The total cost could reach as much as $100 million."</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>His birthday hike, where he saw a dramatically shrunk glacier, served as a visual reminder of global warming's impact and confirmed his belief in the need for solar geoengineering, making him more motivated to pursue it.</answer>
<other>The article states: "To celebrate his 60th birthday in October, Dr. Keith went hiking in the Canadian Rockies and came across a glacier that had shrunk dramatically in recent years. It was a visual reminder that global warming is upending the natural world, and it confirmed his central, controversial belief... 'I'm more motivated even now to push on solar geo because the rationalist case for it is looking stronger...'"</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>He agrees that nations should stop burning fossil fuels, but believes in going further by also using solar geoengineering to lower temperatures.</answer>
<other>The article states: "He agrees that nations should stop burning coal, oil and gas, period. But Dr. Keith believes in going further." His proposed solution is solar geoengineering.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions his dyslexia, late reading development, becoming a voracious reader, and eventually studying experimental physics, but it does not explicitly state a relationship or connection between his dyslexia/late reading development and his eventual career in experimental physics.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>After protests led to an experiment being called off, he stated that if they do it again, they "won't be open in the same way," suggesting the protests influenced him to consider less transparency in future research efforts.</answer>
<other>The article states: "Within months, the experiment was called off. 'A lesson I've learned from this is that if we do this again, we won't be open in the same way,' Dr. Keith said."</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>A potentially massive temperature rise in an unprepared world over a matter of five to 10 years, hitting the Earth's climate with something it probably hasn't seen since the dinosaur-killing impactor.</answer>
<other>The article quotes Raymond Pierrehumbert: "stopping the effort abruptly could result in a sudden rise in temperatures, a phenomenon known as 'termination shock.' The planet could experience 'potentially massive temperature rise in an unprepared world over a matter of five to 10 years, hitting the Earth's climate with something that it probably hasn't seen since the dinosaur-killing impactor,' Dr. Pierrehumbert said."</other>
