<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Russian hackers in 2020 exploited a software update system (SolarWinds) to gain widespread access for espionage; Friday's incident, a flawed update to a security tool (CrowdStrike), caused widespread disruption, with both highlighting vulnerabilities in software supply chains or trusted tools that can lead to large consequences and provide lessons for adversaries.</answer>
<other>The 2020 SolarWinds hack involved Russians worming "into the update systems of software." Friday's incident was "a flawed update to a trusted tool... CrowdStrike's software." Both illustrate the "software supply chain problem that lets small errors ripple into large consequences."</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Friday's cybersecurity incident, by revealing American digital vulnerabilities and providing a "road map for disruption," could embolden China, potentially making it seem easier to use cyberattacks to distract the U.S. during a hypothetical invasion of Taiwan, a scenario mentioned earlier in the article.</answer>
<other>The article mentions scenarios where "China's military hackers trigger chaos, shutting down water systems and electric grids to distract Americans from an invasion of Taiwan." Friday's incident "provided a road map of American vulnerabilities," which adversaries like China could use.</other>
