<answer>The "petals".</answer>
<other>The article describes the "petals" as evoking natural forms and capturing light (aesthetic). Functionally, "The fiberglass stems conduct heat down to the ground... Their hollow shafts also help direct rainwater into the surrounding soil." The "petals" are the architectural element encompassing these features.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions Carmen Herrera's work draws from "local buildings and plant life," covering local architecture and flora. However, it does not state that her work (or any other named artist's contribution like Kay Rosen or Gabriel Dawe) serves as a "visual pun for the building's function." The upside-down arch by Snohetta is described as "wryly indicating" its function and references local architecture (the museum's loggia), but it's by the architects (Snohetta), not one of the mural/sculpture artists, and it doesn't explicitly reference flora. No single artist's contribution mentioned meets all three criteria simultaneously.</other>

<answer>The Michener Gallery's upside-down arch.</answer>
<other>The article states: "the Michener Gallery's arch is upside-down, wryly indicating that it is the complex's main art-viewing space."
