<answer>His reaction of being "taken aback" and his feelings shifting because his friend was direct instead of providing a socially expected polite excuse reflects these themes by demonstrating his prioritization of social expectations for tactfulness over the friend's direct assertion of her personal boundary.</answer>
<other>The birthday boy expected a lie ("my calendar was too crowded"), which is a social expectation for a polite decline. The friend's directness was an assertion of her personal boundary/preference. His negative reaction to this directness shows the clash.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The aunt's suggestion of family therapy serves as a potential catalyst by proposing a formal mechanism (therapy) for addressing the estrangement and by highlighting that the new baby might provide an incentive for both sides to reconcile.</answer>
<other>The columnist states, "I would suggest to your sister and your nephew that they might benefit from family therapy. (The baby may give both sides an incentive to reconcile.)" This indicates how the suggestion could act as a catalyst.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The birthday boy's internal conflict, shown by his being "taken aback" by his friend's honesty and his admission that he would have lied, highlights these complexities by demonstrating his struggle with his friend's choice of directness over expected social tact, a common dilemma in balancing honesty and politeness in friendships.</answer>
<other>His expectation of a polite lie versus the friend's directness creates his internal conflict, which is a direct example of the complexities of friendship and social etiquette regarding honesty.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Her limited knowledge ("I don't know all the details," "you don't know the full story") impacts her ability to mediate by making her not well placed to get involved, not in a position to know the full story of the conflict, or to determine if estrangement is the healthiest outcome.</answer>
<other>The columnist explicitly states, "you don't seem particularly well placed to get involved here... you don't know the full story... you aren't in a position to know."</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The birthday boy's shift in feelings towards his friend after she directly stated her reason for not attending, instead of offering a polite excuse, reflects these themes by demonstrating that his adherence to social expectations for tact is significant enough that a deviation towards direct honesty negatively impacts his perception of the friendship.</answer>
<other>His feelings "shifted" because the friend violated his social expectation of a polite, perhaps less honest, decline, highlighting the tension between direct honesty and social niceties.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The aunt's uncertainty about whether her sister already knows about the grandchild complicates her feelings of loyalty and responsibility because it makes it unclear whether her silence is actually withholding crucial, unknown information, thereby making her assessment of her own "disloyalty" for not sharing the news ambiguous.</answer>
<other>She feels "disloyal... withholding this news," but the article notes "I don't know if he [nephew] did [tell his parents]" and the columnist adds "or even whether your sister knows about the baby already." This uncertainty directly affects the premise of her feeling of disloyalty.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article describes the fianc√©e's discomfort ("I am uncomfortable paying") and her question ("How should we handle this...?"). It does not describe her actual approach to handling the request, but rather the columnist's advice on how she *should* approach it.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The birthday boy's reaction of being "taken aback" and his feelings shifting because his friend directly stated her personal preference (not liking another guest) instead of offering a socially nice excuse (a crowded calendar) illustrates this tension by showing his negative response when a direct personal preference is prioritized over an expected social nicety.</answer>
<other>He explicitly states he would have offered a "social nicety" ("my calendar was too crowded"), and his negative reaction to the friend's directness (personal preference) highlights the tension.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The columnist's reference to attending a dog's birthday party, which he acknowledged as potentially "silly," reinforces his stance by illustrating the principle that if the individuals involved are happy, one should refrain from judgment and offer support, a principle he then applies to the brother's fourth marriage.</answer>
<other>The columnist says of the dog party, "the hosts were so happy! Who am I to judge?" and applies this logic to the brother's marriage: "if he's happy... wish him well."</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article provides separate advice to the aunt and to the birthday boy. While the columnist criticizes the birthday host directly ("a little self-centered"), the text does not explicitly or implicitly suggest that the advice given to the aunt regarding estrangement serves as a form of criticism towards the birthday host's perspective.</other>
