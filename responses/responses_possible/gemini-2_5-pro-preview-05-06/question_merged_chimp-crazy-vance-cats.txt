<other>The article discusses cultural conversations around pets, children, and caregiving, using "Chimp Crazy" and a New York magazine essay as central examples. I will go through each question and extract the answer solely from the provided text.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>A critique of the punishing, isolated model of family care, especially for women, and its inherent contradictions and harms.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The expectation of women providing boundless, selfless, and pure care versus the reality that caregiving is demanding labor with limits, often unfairly concentrated on one woman within an isolated family structure.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>They are positioned as adversaries of the traditional family or as women resisting a punishing, isolated model of care to pursue public life; or, in extreme cases like Haddix, as starkly lonely figures mythologizing animals as eternal children.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Society idealizes certain forms of care (e.g., mothering human children, as an unending, pure act) but may not recognize the labor involved, and it critiques or pathologizes intense care for animals when it mimics or supplants human child care, as seen with Haddix whose "love" leads to ruin.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Caregiving can be sought for personal fulfillment (as with Tonia Haddix's perceived happiness with primates), but societal pressures and the overwhelming burden of isolated care can undermine this fulfillment and lead to desperation (as with the anonymous mother).</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Society often views caregiving through the romanticized lens of "infinite love" rather than recognizing it as labor with limits, a capacity to work that can be exhausted.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Societal expectations of idealized, boundless care can lead to harmful outcomes for dependents (neglect, abuse, or being made a "nemesis") and trap caregivers in unsustainable or damaging roles.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Societal expectations shape perceptions by idealizing care as selfless, unending, and pure (Haddix's view of her chimp mothering) or by creating guilt when caregivers cannot meet superhuman expectations of boundless love (anonymous mother feeling like a "psychopath").</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Tonia Haddix.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Lucky's treatment illustrates how the overwhelming burden of caretaking labor (for a human child) can exhaust emotional capacity for other dependents, and how the societal expectation of "infinite love" can prevent practical solutions for meeting a dependent's needs.</answer>
