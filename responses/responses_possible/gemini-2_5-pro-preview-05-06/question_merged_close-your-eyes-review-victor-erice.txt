<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states the TV program "Unsolved Cases" revisits the puzzling history of Miguel's movie and that Miguel agrees to participate, which leads him to try to find Julio. It does not state that the TV program creates a misleading sense of resolution regarding Julio's disappearance.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article identifies Frankenstein's monster as a haunting presence in "The Spirit of the Beehive." However, it does not state that Frankenstein's monster serves as a metaphorical bridge to the protagonist's (Miguel's) method of investigation in "Close Your Eyes." Miguel's investigation method is described as assuming the role of a detective, similar to Julio's character in the unfinished film.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The protagonist's current investigation directly concerns the unresolved mystery (the lead actor's disappearance) that led to the abortion of his last film and the end of his prior profession as a filmmaker.</answer>
<other>Miguel was a filmmaker whose career ended when his lead actor, Julio, disappeared during the making of "The Farewell Gaze." The catalyst for his current investigation is a TV program revisiting this unsolved case, leading Miguel to confront his unfinished film and search for Julio.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article explains that the phrase "Close your eyes" is how Ana's sister in "The Spirit of the Beehive" explains how to summon Frankenstein's monster, an emblem of cinema. In "Close Your Eyes," Miguel is actively investigating and confronting the past to find Julio. If "closing your eyes" is interpreted as a way to access or summon something lost (like the past or Julio), then Miguel's actions might be seen as consistent with, rather than contradictory to, the title's metaphorical meaning. The article does not explicitly state that the title ironically contradicts the character's actions.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The director's birth year, 1940, coincides with the temporal setting of "The Spirit of the Beehive" (around 1940, in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War), potentially informing its focus on a traumatized child and country during the early Franco years. For "Close Your Eyes," his age, stemming from his 1940 birth, potentially informs the film's themes of looking back at the past, memory, lost time, and a search for meaning, as the protagonist also confronts an unfinished past after several decades.</answer>
<other>The article notes Erice was born in 1940. "The Spirit of the Beehive" is set around 1940. "Close Your Eyes" features a protagonist who hasn't directed in decades, and the film itself is Erice's first feature in over 30 years, dealing with themes of returning to the past.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The film-within-a-film, "The Farewell Gaze," features a character (played by Julio) who is a detective charged with finding a missing person, which mirrors the main storyline where the protagonist, Miguel, assumes the role of a detective searching for the missing actor, Julio.</answer>
<other>The article states, "Much like Julio's character in the unfinished film... Miguel assumes the role of a detective who's charged with finding a missing person..."</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The protagonist, Miguel, begins wearing the trench coat that the missing actor, Julio, wore while playing a detective in the unfinished film-within-a-film, thereby visually merging his real-world investigative role with the fictional detective persona.</answer>
<other>The article says Miguel "even begins wearing the trench coat that Julio wore in the film" as he investigates Julio's disappearance.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The use of narrative ellipses, which were "narratively elliptical" and "beguilingly cryptic" in "The Spirit of the Beehive," is subverted in "Close Your Eyes" where they are described as "frustrating rather than illuminating."</answer>
<other>The article contrasts the effect of narrative ellipses in "Beehive" ("gravely beautiful as it is narratively elliptical") with those in the new movie ("frustrating rather than illuminating").</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The secondary character, Gardel, who helps solve the case of the missing actor Julio, is played by Jose Coronado, the same actor who plays Julio. This complicates the film's exploration of duality by making the helper in the investigation a physical double of the person being sought, further blurring identities and adding another layer to the doppelganger motifs.</answer>
<other>The article states Gardel is "also played by Coronado" and "helps solve the case of the missing actor." It also mentions Erice "often frames the two men [Miguel and Gardel] side-by-side, as if twinning them," extending the doubling motif.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The director Victor Erice's own decades-long hiatus from directing feature-length films (his first since 1992) echoes the key plot point of the protagonist, Miguel, being a filmmaker who hasn't directed a movie in several decades and effectively vanished from his career.</answer>
<other>The article notes "Close Your Eyes" is Erice's "first [feature-length movie] since 'Dream of Light' (1992)" and that the protagonist Miguel "hasn't directed a movie in several decades" and "effectively, caused him to vanish as well." It also states, "Like Miguel, Erice has undertaken a search for meaning by returning to the past..."</other>
