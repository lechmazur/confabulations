<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>By causing nausea which led to conditioned taste aversion, making crocodiles avoid eating real, toxic cane toads, thus reducing their exposure to lethal toxins.</answer>
<other>The lithium chlorine solution made the bait toads nauseating. This experience taught the crocodiles to avoid toads, leading to lower mortality when they encountered actual toxic toads.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It demonstrated that crocodiles still had an appetite and were specifically avoiding the tainted toads, rather than having a general loss of appetite.</answer>
<other>The article states crocodiles "still snapped up the chicken necks" while consuming fewer toads, indicating the aversion was specific to the toads.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>By stating that each predator needs an aversion strategy fine-tuned to its hunting style, as shown by the different approaches for crocodiles (baited carcasses) and yellow-spotted monitors (live, young "trainer toads").</answer>
<other>The article mentions that for yellow-spotted monitors, which hunt live prey, cane toad sausages didn't work, so they used young, nonlethal toads.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Uncertainty about how long the crocodiles will retain the learned aversion and the need for ongoing maintenance of the strategy.</answer>
<other>Dr. Johnson is quoted saying, "It's not a one-and-done thing... you have to maintain it."</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It relates to the observation that nauseous crocodiles become lethargic and prefer to lay about, aligning with the "tender sweetness of a seasick crocodile" being inactive.</answer>
<other>The article opens with this comparison, noting that when nauseous, crocodiles "are largely lethargic and prefer to lay about."</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>By using an un-baited river as a control site to compare crocodile mortality rates and by using chicken necks as bait to ensure the crocodiles' aversion was specific to toads and not a general loss of appetite.</answer>
<other>The un-baited control river allowed researchers to see if the intervention at the test gorges made a difference in mortality. The chicken necks showed the crocodiles were still willing to eat other food.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Their initial high consumption of toad carcasses ("a big hit") did not predict their eventual aversion and reduced consumption after experiencing nausea from the tainted bait.</answer>
<other>The article states they "scarfed down equal amounts of toad carcasses and chicken necks on the first day," but "as the baiting period continued, the crocodiles consumed fewer toads."</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Cane toads.</answer>
<other>The article clearly states, "Cane toads were brought to Australia in 1935 to eat pests... the toads quickly became pests themselves."</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Their tendency to become lethargic and prefer to lay about instead of swimming after another meal when nauseous, rather than vomiting.</answer>
<other>This behavior was leveraged to create conditioned taste aversion using nonlethal nauseating baits.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Crocodiles were conditioned using nauseating toad carcasses, while yellow-spotted monitors, which actively pursue live prey, were conditioned using young, nonlethal "trainer toads" because toad sausages were ineffective for them.</answer>
<other>The article specifies that for crocodiles, "bait stations contained a cane toad carcass... injected with a nauseating lithium chlorine solution," while for monitors, "the team utilized young, nonlethal 'trainer toads'" because "cane toad sausages... the aversion didn't stick."</other>
