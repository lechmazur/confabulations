<answer>To sidestep regulatory scrutiny.</answer>
<other>The article states, "These transactions are being driven by the big tech companies' desire to sidestep regulatory scrutiny while trying to get ahead in A.I." and Justin Johnson is quoted saying, "Large tech firms may clearly be trying to avoid regulatory scrutiny by not directly acquiring the targeted firms."</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>By licensing technology and hiring employees without becoming the owner of the firm.</answer>
<other>The article explains the new deal structure "involves licensing the technology and hiring the top employees -- effectively swallowing the start-up and its main assets -- without becoming the owner of the firm." This is contrasted with typical outright purchases and is done to "sidestep regulatory scrutiny."</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states Character.AI's investors made a return "after just two years" but does not provide information on the "typical timeframe for venture capital investments in Silicon Valley" for comparison.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>35:1</answer>
<other>The article states that from Inflection, "just two employees stayed on while the rest -- roughly 70 people -- joined Microsoft." The ratio of those who joined Microsoft (70) to those who remained (2) is 70/2, which simplifies to 35/1.</other>

<answer>Character.AI</answer>
<other>Character.AI was "privately valued at $1 billion," and Google agreed to pay $3 billion to license its technology, with about $2.5 billion used to buy out shareholders. This represents a significant positive discrepancy. For Inflection and Adept, the article mentions licensing fees in relation to amounts invested or raised, not explicitly stated "previous private valuations" that show a higher discrepancy than Character.AI's. Inflection's $650M license fee was used to reimburse investors who put in $1.5B. Adept's "at least $330 million" license fee had "much of the money going toward paying back the $414 million that the start-up had raised."</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article provides licensing deal amounts: Google ($3 billion for Character.AI), Microsoft ("more than $650 million" for Inflection), and Amazon ("at least $330 million" for Adept). It provides a private valuation for Character.AI ($1 billion) but not for Inflection or Adept (only amounts invested or raised). Therefore, the "combined previous valuations" cannot be determined to make the comparison.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Noam Shazeer's ownership percentage is higher.</answer>
<other>Noam Shazeer "owns 30 percent to 40 percent of the company." "Roughly 20 percent of Character.AI's employees" are joining Google. Thus, 30-40% is higher than 20%.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>For Character.AI, "roughly 20 percent of Character.AI's employees" joined Google, but the total number of employees is not given, so the absolute number who joined is unknown. For Inflection, "roughly 70 people" joined Microsoft for a deal of "more than $650 million." For Adept, "many of its employees" joined Amazon, but no specific number is provided. Without the absolute number of employees who joined for at least two of the start-ups, a comparison of ratios cannot be made to determine the highest.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states Character.AI investors made a "two-and-a-half-times return." For Inflection, the "$650 million licensing fee" was used to reimburse investors who "poured $1.5 billion," suggesting a return of less than 1x ($650M/$1.5B = 0.433x). For Adept, "much of the money" from the "at least $330 million" license fee went to pay back "$414 million raised," which is also likely less than 1x and not precise. The statement "most investors got their money back" for Adept and Inflection is qualitative. Due to the lack of precise return figures for all start-ups, particularly Adept, an average cannot be reliably calculated.</other>
