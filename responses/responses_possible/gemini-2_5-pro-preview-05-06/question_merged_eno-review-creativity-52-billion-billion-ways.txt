<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Art and identity.</answer>
<other>The article states one version focused on how pop musicians like Eno, Bowie, and Talking Heads "create and project an identity," making it a film "about art and identity." If focused solely on U2, this broader theme involving multiple collaborators would likely be diminished.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The generative structure results in the audience's brain, rather than solely the filmmaker's fixed intention, constructing the experience of mood and character by "doing the cooking" and "seeing relationships" among the variable sequences.</answer>
<other>The article contrasts traditional filmmaking, where filmmakers aim for a specific audience experience of mood and character, with "Eno," where the audience's brain "does the cooking."</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>His engagement with randomness and generative art.</answer>
<other>The article states Eno "has fiddled with randomness in his musical practice for decades" and agreed to the film "only if it, too, could be an example of what he and others have long called generative art." A traditional linear format would compromise this.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>To make the film an example of the (non-AI) generative art that Brian Eno champions and has long been part of.</answer>
<other>The article states Eno's condition for participation was that the film be an example of "generative art," and then clarifies that this is distinct from generative AI, aligning with a tradition Eno is part of.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Computers and code-based systems used in his musical practice.</answer>
<other>The article mentions Eno was "propelled along by new technologies" for randomness in music and that artists like him have been "working with computers and code-based systems." Brain One is a "code-based decision tree."</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions the U2 songwriting sequence as content within the film but does not draw an explicit connection between the film's generative *nature* (its method of construction) and the *nature or method* of that specific musical collaboration itself.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The film's variability determines whether details about specific musical projects, like his composition of the Microsoft Windows theme jingle, are included in a particular version.</answer>
<other>The article states, "Only one version I saw included a discussion of Eno's composition of the Microsoft Windows theme jingle," directly linking the film's variability to the inclusion of specific content.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The messy process of creativity.</answer>
<other>The article mentions an archival sequence of U2 writing "Pride (In the Name of Love)" and states that one version of the film focused on "the messy process of creativity." The songwriting sequence illustrates this concept.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Both use a system to introduce randomness or arbitrary elements to guide and shape the creative process.</answer>
<other>The article links "Eno's deck of 'Oblique Strategies'" to "trying arbitrary experiments" and describes the film's generative process as leaving things to "chance" based on rules, inviting "randomness."</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The audience's brain "doing the cooking" and "seeing relationships."</answer>
<other>Eno's quote, "The audience's brain does the cooking and keeps seeing relationships," is a central idea. The scene where Eno shows YouTube clips of music that shaped him illustrates his own process of "cooking" with influences and seeing relationships, mirroring what the audience does with the film.</other>
