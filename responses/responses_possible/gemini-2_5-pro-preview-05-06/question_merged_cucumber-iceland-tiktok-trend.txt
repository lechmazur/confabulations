<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The social media trend caused a rapid surge in demand for cucumbers that Iceland's local, greenhouse-based agriculture, operating in an isolated island nation, could not immediately meet, leading to shortages and the need for expensive emergency imports.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The cucumber craze led to demand outstripping local supply from its self-sustaining agricultural system, and Iceland's isolation made it more expensive and challenging to import cucumbers quickly to cover the shortfall.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The shortage, triggered by an external social media trend, demonstrated that Iceland's isolated agricultural system could be overwhelmed by sudden, externally driven demand spikes it was not prepared for.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The craze showed that in a geographically isolated country like Iceland, sudden demand surges are difficult to manage due to the expense and logistics of importation and limited local capacity to rapidly increase supply.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The shortage demonstrated that a small population provides little buffer or "wiggle room" to absorb sudden surges in demand for a food item, making the self-sufficient supply vulnerable.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The TikTok-inspired cucumber fad coincided with a small lull in the yield of Iceland's cucumber crop production cycle.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The preference for locally grown foods to reduce carbon footprints meant the food system had little flexibility or established reliance on imports to handle sudden demand surges that overwhelmed local production.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Geothermal power enables Iceland's self-sustaining greenhouse agriculture; this reliance on local production became a vulnerability when a social media trend caused demand to exceed the immediate capacity of this local system, especially given Iceland's isolation and the difficulty of rapid, large-scale importation.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The widespread cucumber shortage and the necessity for emergency imports from the Netherlands challenged Iceland's reputation for agricultural self-sufficiency by showing it could not meet domestic demand for this product through its own production.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The trend exposed limitations such as the system's inability to rapidly scale production to meet sudden demand, its vulnerability to cyclical lulls in crop yield, and potential impacts from shortages of key greenhouse inputs like carbon dioxide.</answer>
