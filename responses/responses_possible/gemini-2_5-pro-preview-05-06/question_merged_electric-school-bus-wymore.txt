<answer>He is a sixth-generation farmer deeply familiar with a changing business who closely tracks the latest farming techniques, yet he was skeptical about the practicality of electric vehicles and the electrification of farm equipment.</answer>
<other>The article states, "He is a sixth-generation farmer, deeply familiar with the intricacies of a changing business. He closely tracks the latest farming techniques, so he'd already been reading up on alternative energy and the electrification of farm equipment. It didn't sound practical to him at all." This highlights his progressive stance in his own field versus his skepticism here.</other>

<answer>The fake horse's head was intended to soothe human fears about new automotive technology, just as current skepticism about electric vehicles reflects a similar fear or resistance to new technology and change.</answer>
<other>The article quotes Jim Zvolanek: "The purpose was to calm actual horses, but also to soothe human fears about the new technology. 'It ain't no different now than it's ever been,' he said. 'People don't like change.'"</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The community's historical resistance to change, exemplified by a 1923 poem lamenting the end of horse-drawn transportation, shows a long-standing pattern of finding change unwelcome, which informs their current skeptical reaction to the electric bus.</answer>
<other>The article states, "Change has long been unwelcome. The front page of the Dec. 27, 1923, Weekly Wymorean featured a poem lamenting the end of horse-drawn transportation." and "The comments were typical of Wymore, a place wed to its traditions."</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions "Champagne music maestro Lawrence Welk." However, no individual mentioned as being initially skeptical of the electric bus (e.g., David Zimmerman, John Watts) has the surname Welk. The article does not state that any skeptical individual shares this surname.</other>

<answer>His friend's career of hauling turbine blades across the nation in a huge, fossil-fuel-burning truck.</answer>
<other>The article states, "He often thinks about his friend who hauls turbine blades across the nation in a huge, fossil-fuel-burning truck and wonders what will happen to all these turbines when they inevitably wear out."</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The old bus engine.</answer>
<other>John Watts normally salvages engines for value, but the electric bus grant required the destruction of the old diesel engine, preventing him from recycling it in his usual way.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The bus was so quiet that children, accustomed to hearing the loud diesel engine, did not hear it approaching their stops.</answer>
<other>The article states, "The new bus was almost too quiet... It turned out that children had been accustomed to running outside when they heard the loud diesel engine come roaring down the street."</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The concern that rescuers could be electrocuted if they had to cut into the bus to rescue someone. This paradoxically relates to organ donation (a life-saving practice involving accessing a body's internals) because accessing the bus's "internals" for rescue could be lethal to rescuers, contrasting with the life-saving outcome of organ retrieval.</answer>
<other>Collin Meints worried, "If rescuers had to cut into the bus to rescue someone, could they be electrocuted?" David Zimmerman mentioned his uncle was an organ donor, a practice of salvaging internal parts to save lives. The paradox lies in the bus's internals posing a danger during rescue, while human internals in donation are life-saving.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The observation of "a lot of exposed wires" underneath the bus, which suggested vulnerability to elements like salt, mud, and manure, and potential maintenance issues.</answer>
<other>David Zimmerman "peered underneath and was startled by what he saw. 'What are all these wires and cables and crap?...It looked like a lot of exposed wires.'" This observation implies potential maintenance challenges, contrasting with the superintendent's point that "Districts can save as much as $11,000 a year on maintenance."</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</answer>
<other>The EPA provided the grant for the electric bus. This is ironic because David Zimmerman, the school board president, had previously voted against a wind farm as a county planning board member, and a new board later passed rules making it nearly impossible to build wind farms in the county, indicating local resistance to such alternative energy projects.</other>
