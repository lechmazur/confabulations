<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions that "many A.I. experts and tech executives" previously urged for guardrails and now the "tech industry is recoiling." It also quotes Scott Wiener saying "The CEOs of Meta, Google, of OpenAI -- all of them -- have volunteered to testing," and their companies now have concerns or oppose the bill. However, it does not single out a specific tech executive and detail their personal contradictory stance on AI regulation versus their own previous public statements.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The bill was created with input from the lobbying arm of the Center for A.I. Safety, a think tank with ties to effective altruism, a movement concerned with preventing existential threats from A.I.</answer>

<answer>Dario Amodei</answer>
<other>The article states Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, told Congress A.I. could help create biological attacks, while his company, Anthropic, opposed the bill in its current form and suggested companies control their own safety testing.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The safety rules and the threat of legal action from the state attorney general, which critics argue will discourage open-source development and limit options for start-ups without the resources of tech giants.</answer>
<other>Jeremy Howard is quoted saying the bill would ensure powerful A.I. belongs to the biggest companies, consolidating power. This is linked to the discouragement of open source due to liability concerns.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The tech industry, including many experts and executives, previously urged lawmakers to establish guardrails for A.I. but is now recoiling at California's attempt to implement such regulations.</answer>
<other>The article explicitly states this "about-face" by the tech industry.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Anthropic</answer>
<other>The article notes that Dario Amodei, Anthropic's CEO, warned Congress about A.I. risks like enabling biological attacks, yet Anthropic opposed the bill in its current form.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Its potential to stifle open-source development, which critics argue could push A.I. development to other countries with less oversight or consolidate power in a few corporations, creating new disaster scenarios.</answer>
<other>Critics argue that if open source is stifled, development might move to places like China, or power over A.I. could be consolidated, which Jeremy Howard calls a "recipe for disaster."</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The bill requires safety testing for powerful A.I. technologies, implying they pose significant dangers, whereas recent studies by OpenAI and others showed that today's A.I. technologies were not significantly more dangerous than search engines.</answer>
<other>The article presents these two contrasting points: the bill's premise of needing safety tests versus studies downplaying current AI's unique dangers.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The requirements for safety testing and the potential for legal action from the state attorney general, which critics argue could push A.I. development into other states or countries.</answer>
