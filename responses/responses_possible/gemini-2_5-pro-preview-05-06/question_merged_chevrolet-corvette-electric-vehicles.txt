<answer>Its cultural familiarity and all-American image could make it an ambassador for electrification.</answer>
<other>The article says, "Mr. Juechter said the Corvette, with its cultural familiarity and all-American image, could be an ambassador for electrification.

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article describes the midengine redesign as "highly controversial" which could be seen as "seemingly counterintuitive." However, it states this change was "meant to shake things up" and "in hindsight it looks brilliant," suggesting the resulting success was a desired outcome of a bold strategy, not an inadvertent one. The article does not state that the near-record popularity was inadvertent.</other>
