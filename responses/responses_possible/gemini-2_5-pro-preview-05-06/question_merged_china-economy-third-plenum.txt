<answer>The decline in government revenue from land sales, which historically helped pay for construction projects, means the funding structure for projects like building new factories essential for high-tech growth is losing steam, creating a significant challenge in financing this vision.</answer>
<other>The article states land sale proceeds were used for "construction projects and public services" and that this revenue has "plunged." Xi's high-tech growth involves "building factories." The old funding structure is "losing steam" and finding a replacement is a "big challenge." This implies a direct impact on funding such construction.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that reliance on overseas markets is an outcome of many people earning and spending little, and that this reliance generates tensions with other countries. It mentions "common prosperity" aims to narrow the wealth gap. However, it does not explicitly state how the historical reliance on overseas markets itself creates a potential obstacle for achieving "common prosperity."</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The hukou system creates barriers to household registration that make it hard for rural migrants to settle permanently in many cities and for urban residents to move between cities, hindering efforts to level the social field, which is a crucial measure for achieving "common prosperity."</answer>
<other>The article states that pulling down hukou barriers "would help level the social field in China" and that municipal officials resist this. Leveling the social field is related to "common prosperity" (narrowing the wealth gap).</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The historical funding structure for infrastructure, which relied on local governments selling long-term land leases, is now losing steam due to a plunge in revenue from these sales, making it one of the party's biggest challenges to find a replacement, especially in a country where many are averse to paying taxes.</answer>
<other>The article explains the 1980s system of land lease sales for funding and states this is "now losing steam" and finding a replacement is a "big challenge" due to factors like aversion to taxes.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The regulatory crackdowns have bruised tech giants and other private firms, leaving investors doubtful about the place of private businesses in Xi Jinping's plans, thereby potentially influencing the balance between the state and the market.</answer>
<other>The article quotes Neil Thomas on this exact point and mentions investors' doubts following the crackdowns.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>A nationwide property tax is a potential, though resisted, measure that could help address the broader fiscal challenges faced by local governments, particularly the sharp decline in their revenue from land sales, by providing a new source of funds.</answer>
<other>The article mentions the plunge in government revenue from land sales, the resistance to a property tax, and that the Ministry of Finance is helping indebted local governments, implying a property tax could be a solution to these fiscal challenges.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Xi Jinping's expressed wariness of welfare programs, due to concerns they might erode the country's work ethic, could hinder the achievement of "common prosperity," as the article suggests improved welfare, health coverage, and old-age care are needed for many Chinese people to spend more, which is relevant to narrowing the wealth gap.</answer>
<other>The article links Xi's wariness to welfare programs with the need for such programs to encourage spending, and "common prosperity" is about narrowing the wealth gap, which is affected by low spending.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that China intends to deploy more automation to offset a shortage of workers and that Mr. Xi's hopes for an economy built on automation will have a shaky foundation unless China can deliver more opportunity to workers and farmers. It does not explicitly state how increased automation itself relates to the *challenges* of worker and farmer opportunities (e.g., whether it creates or exacerbates them). It frames delivering opportunity as a condition for the success of the automation strategy.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The emphasis on "high quality" growth, which requires investment, potentially conflicts with low investor sentiment if the policies and approach associated with this growth do not provide assurances to private and foreign businesses or address the uncertainty and disenchantment stemming from past policies, regulatory actions, and ambivalence about their role.</answer>
<other>The article states success depends on winning renewed investor confidence, that investors are doubtful due to past crackdowns and ambivalence about private firms, and that "high quality" growth involves building factories (requiring investment). If the approach to "high quality" growth doesn't alleviate these concerns, the goal conflicts with the sentiment needed to achieve it.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>A nationwide property tax is a potential, though resisted, component of a longer-term solution to replace China's previous infrastructure funding structure, which is challenged by the significant plunge in land sale revenues.</answer>
<other>The article discusses the failing infrastructure funding structure (due to lost land sale revenue) and mentions a property tax in the context of "fixing the fiscal plumbing" and as one of the "possibilities for a longer-term solution," despite resistance to it.</other>
