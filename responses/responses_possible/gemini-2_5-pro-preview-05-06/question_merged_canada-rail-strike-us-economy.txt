<answer>It would have hammered Canada's export-dependent economy and the businesses around the world that rely on its goods.</answer>
<other>The article states, "But a longer stoppage would have hammered Canada's export-dependent economy and the businesses around the world that rely on its goods." A stoppage longer than a week fits this description.</other>

<answer>Trucks cannot handle transporting fertilizer in huge volumes over enormous distances.</answer>
<other>The article states, "Trucks can't handle these products [grains and fertilizer] because they are typically transported in huge volumes over enormous distances." and "Ninety percent of Canadian-produced fertilizer going into the U.S. market is delivered by rail".</other>

<answer>C.H. Robinson advised customers to shift to U.S. ports; this reflects the company's assessment that there was a potential for a significant supply chain disruption warranting proactive rerouting of goods.</answer>
<other>The article says, "C.H. Robinson began advising customers to make that change [shifting to U.S. ports] in May, when the rail union held a strike authorization vote." The advice was given "in anticipation of a potential strike," indicating they assessed the risk as significant.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions an estimate of $1 billion economic loss for a weeklong shutdown from Anderson Economic Group, but it does not explicitly call Anderson Economic Group an "industry group." The Railway Association of Canada and Fertilizer Canada are called "industry groups" and provide estimates (annual value of goods carried by rail, and percentage of fertilizer moved by rail, respectively). The article does not provide enough information to determine which of these "industry group" estimates would be "most affected" by an 8-day shutdown, nor does it define "most affected" in a comparable way for these different types of estimates.</other>

<answer>Sawmills and pulp and paper plants could close as they run out of room to store products.</answer>
<other>The article states, "The rail shutdown could also lead sawmills and pulp and paper plants to close as they run out of room to store products". A 10-day stoppage is a form of "the rail shutdown".</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions various export industries (agricultural commodities like grains, coal) that rely on rail and then shipping. It also mentions low water levels at the Panama Canal as a separate supply chain shock. However, it does not specify which export industry would face the "most severe compounded effects" from both events occurring simultaneously.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that 90% of Canadian-produced fertilizer going to the U.S. is by rail, so a rail shutdown is the primary disruption for this. A dockworkers' strike is mentioned for U.S. ports on the East Coast and Gulf of Mexico. The article does not provide enough information to determine the "primary challenge" for fertilizer distribution specifically from the *combination* of a Canadian rail shutdown and a U.S. dockworker strike, as it doesn't detail fertilizer's reliance on those specific U.S. ports for its distribution network in a way that would define a compounded primary challenge.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Severe disruption of the North American automotive supply chain.</answer>
<other>The article quotes Matt Blunt saying, "A prolonged railroad strike would severely disrupt the North American automotive supply chain, which is critical to the U.S. auto sector". A two-week shutdown would be considered "prolonged." The article states automakers were not feeling effects from a stoppage of "several hours" but were monitoring. The "most immediate effect" of a two-week stoppage would be this severe disruption.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that for grains, there are no practical alternatives to railroads, and a concern is the "inability to cycle products through the supply chain could limit producers' ability to deliver harvested crops." Red Sea disruptions affect international shipping. While a combination would severely hamper grain exports, the article does not explicitly state what the "primary concern" for grain exporters would be from this specific simultaneous occurrence.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions that "sawmills and pulp and paper plants" could close due to running out of storage space during a rail shutdown. However, it does not specify that these would be the "first" to shut down, nor does it link this consequence to an exact three-week duration. It also mentions mines having limited storage but mines are not manufacturing plants.</other>
