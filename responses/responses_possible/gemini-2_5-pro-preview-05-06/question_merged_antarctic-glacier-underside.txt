<answer>The formations showed that melting does not necessarily smooth out the topography of underwater ice, as complex features and indentations can persist, challenging the previous assumption that melting smoothed it out.</answer>
<other>The article states, "In the past, scientists generally assumed that the melting process smoothed out the topography of underwater ice... Now it's becoming clear that these features and indentations can persist." The "unexpected formations" are these features.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions Ran used dead reckoning, which caused tension, and that about half its missions were successful. However, it does not explicitly state how the use of dead reckoning directly impacted the success rate of the missions.</other>

<answer>A curious seal might have circled Ran underwater, causing it to become disoriented, which is one theory for the robot's loss.</answer>
<other>The article says, "The other [theory] is that it had a fateful encounter with a curious seal... One of them could have started circling Ran underwater, causing it to become disoriented."</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>By revealing several never-before-seen formations, including immense terraces and teardrop-shaped divots, which showed that such features and indentations can persist, contrary to the assumption that melting smooths out the topography.</answer>
<other>The article states, "In the past, scientists generally assumed that the melting process smoothed out the topography of underwater ice... Now it's becoming clear that these features and indentations can persist." The findings are the "several never-before-seen formations."</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Too much sea ice was in the way.</answer>
<other>The article states, "When Dr. Wahlin and her team reached the frozen continent, however, Thwaites was inaccessible. Too much sea ice was in the way."</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Ran</answer>
<other>The article identifies the robot as "Ran" and states it "was lost" on a subsequent expedition after initially collecting data under Dotson.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The newly discovered complex topography, featuring immense terraces and teardrop-shaped divots, shows that such features and indentations can persist, contradicting the previous scientific assumption that the melting process smoothed out the topography of underwater ice.</answer>
<other>This is similar to questions 1 and 4. The article states, "In the past, scientists generally assumed that the melting process smoothed out the topography of underwater ice... Now it's becoming clear that these features and indentations can persist."</other>

<answer>Thwaites Glacier</answer>
<other>The article states, "...Dr. Wahlin and her colleagues were originally hoping to survey the bottom of the nearby Thwaites Glacier... When Dr. Wahlin and her team reached the frozen continent, however, Thwaites was inaccessible."</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>It indicates that understanding how these complex features affect overall melting in response to ocean warming and other changes will require further study, suggesting that current understanding of melting patterns may be incomplete.</answer>
<other>The article states, "Understanding how they [these features and indentations] affect overall melting in response to ocean warming and other changes will require further study, he said."</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>That the bottom of the ice shelf would be flat and featureless.</answer>
<other>The article states, "The bottom of the ice shelf could have turned out to be flat and featureless, which would have been a letdown, Dr. Wahlin said." This implies it was a possible, though undesired, finding that would align with a simpler view than what was discovered.</other>
