<answer>More sophisticated exams and more research into patient communication.</answer>
<other>The article states Dr. Schiff said the results "should lead to more sophisticated exams of people with so-called disorders of consciousness, and to more research into how these patients might communicate with the outside world," followed by his quote.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Cognitive motor dissociation.</answer>
<other>The article mentions "a condition -- which Dr. Schiff calls cognitive motor dissociation".</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Brain implants as a potential communication method for patients with cognitive motor dissociation.</answer>
<other>The article states, "Dr. Schiff suspects that some people with cognitive motor dissociation will probably be able to master these implants" for communication.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Their resilience might increase likelihood of retained awareness.</answer>
<other>The article states, "And that resilience might have made them more likely to remain aware."</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>

<answer>More comprehensive detection of awareness by using both fMRI and electrodes, as signs were found on fMRI scans, electrode recordings, or both, potentially capturing cases missed by single-method earlier research.</answer>
<other>The article states, "Their analysis revealed that 60 patients showed signs of awareness on the functional M.R.I. scans, electrode recordings, or both." Earlier research mentioned (2006 study) used fMRI. Using both methods allows for a more comprehensive search for signs of awareness.</other>
