<answer>Brian Eno</answer>
<other>The article states, "Eno's longstanding antipathy to documentaries" and "A generative approach to documentary is especially suitable for Eno, who has made generative music for years." The filmmaker devised the generative film approach because a standard documentary about Eno "wasn't possible."</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions Hustwit used a "proprietary software program." It also mentions Eno's interest in generative music was inspired by Steve Reich's "It's Gonna Rain" (no date given for this work in the article) and that composers experimented with indeterminacy, with Christian Wolff discussing "chance procedures" in 1958. However, the article does not explicitly state that the filmmaker's *technological innovation* (the software program) was *inspired by a 1950s musical experiment*.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Hustwit knew he couldn't hook Eno with half-measures.</answer>
<other>The article states this directly. Eno's desire for a non-linear representation of life ("Lives don't run in straight lines... There is no single reliable narrative of a life") required a more radical approach than the limited variations offered by "Clue" or "Mosaic."</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It suggests a complete refusal to be filmed for any documentary, whereas he agreed to Hustwit's project because its generative nature aligned with his philosophy.</answer>
<other>Eno's reaction in "Words for the Dying" ("Keep that bloody camera off me," flipping off the cameraman) indicates extreme aversion, creating an expectation he wouldn't participate in a documentary. However, he did participate in "Eno" because it was not a "conventional biography."</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>a kind of objectivity, almost anonymity</answer>
<other>Christian Wolff stated that chance procedures were used to achieve "a kind of objectivity, almost anonymity." Eno's generative music relies on a "system or a set of rules" creating music, and Hustwit is "surprised every time" he sees his generative film, suggesting a relinquishing of complete subjective control that aligns with achieving a form of objectivity and the artist's partial anonymity in the moment-to-moment unfolding of the work.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>It shows a willingness to engage with the documentary process on his own specific, controlled terms rather than a blanket refusal of being filmed.</answer>
<other>Instead of a simple "no," Eno negotiated a limited form of participation (filming only hands and feet), which Rob Nilsson noted made the film "more interesting." This indicates a conditional engagement rather than pure aversion.</other>
