<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>By stating "Edgar walked so Ken could run" after describing Edgar's musical performance and referencing Ryan Gosling's performance as Ken in "Barbie."</answer>
<other>The article describes Edgar's performance and then explicitly makes the connection: "Watching Ryan Gosling shimmy and pirouette through 'I'm Just Ken,' I had one thought: Edgar walked so Ken could run."</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article emphasizes "culottes" in the opening ("Maybe it was the culottes?") and mentions "an obsessive attention to culottes," linking them to the film's unique aesthetic and the protagonists' identity ("women in culottes").

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states the villain promised Edgar they could be an "official couple." It links Edgar to Ken from "Barbie" by saying "Edgar walked so Ken could run."

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions that the film "pays gently ironic homage to a host of genres: ... Busby Berkeley musicals." Busby Berkeley is a director known for a particular style of musical numbers. However, the article does not name a specific "cinematic technique" associated with Busby Berkeley that is evoked; it only refers to "Busby Berkeley musicals" as a genre/style.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>By describing the film's tone and visual style as "strange," "zany pastiche quality," a "mishmash," "neon-colored," with "jokes came fast and furiously," and like a film one might "stumble onto late at night," which suggests it might have been too unconventional or niche for broad mainstream appeal, thus contributing to its underperformance or neglect.</answer>
<other>The article directly attributes the underperformance primarily to pandemic-related issues ("theaters weren't open"). It also speculates "Maybe it was the culottes?" as a direct factor. The detailed description of its highly unique and intense style ("Crank up the 'Barbie' tone by a factor of five") indirectly suggests why it might not have reached a wider audience beyond those primary reasons.</other>

<answer>A factor of five.</answer>
