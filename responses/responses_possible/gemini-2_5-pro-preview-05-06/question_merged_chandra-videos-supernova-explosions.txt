<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article describes the discovery of a singing black hole by Chandra and separately mentions that other Chandra discoveries (quasars, an early massive black hole) challenged theories about massive black hole formation. However, it does not state that the discovery of the singing black hole itself challenged theories about the formation of massive black holes.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>By revealing that enigmatic flecks of light in the early universe were actually quasars, young galaxies harboring supermassive black holes, a finding that caused some astrophysicists to reconsider their ideas about how and when such massive black holes form.</answer>
<other>The article states, "Chandra's X-ray observations have also revealed that enigmatic flecks of light in the early universe, initially detected by the Webb telescope, were actually quasars -- young galaxies harboring supermassive black holes. That finding caused some astrophysicists to reconsider their ideas about how and when such massive black holes form."</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>A singing black hole.</answer>
<other>The article says, "In 2003, astronomers using Chandra discovered a singing black hole... The activity was producing sound waves -- an eternal note of B flat belted into intergalactic plasma."</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The explosion that created the Crab nebula was recorded in Native American pictographs.</answer>
<other>The article states, "The Crab nebula was created in the year 1054 in an explosion that was seen by Chinese and Japanese astronomers and recorded in Native American pictographs."</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Riccardo Giacconi.</answer>
<other>The article mentions, "Chandra was the dream-child of Riccardo Giacconi, a physicist who pioneered the field of X-ray astronomy and won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2002." Chandra later discovered the "singing black hole" producing a "note of B flat."</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The supernova explosion that created Cassiopeia A.</answer>
<other>The article states, "Cassiopeia A... is the remains of a star that exploded as a supernova about 340 years ago. Nobody seems to have observed it at the time..." and that supernova remnants like Cassiopeia A are shedding newly minted elements.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>A black hole with a mass of 80 million suns that existed when the universe was only a half-billion years old.</answer>
<other>The article says, "In June, Chandra scientists announced the discovery of a black hole with a mass of 80 million suns that was kicking up a rumpus back when the universe was only a half-billion years old. Scientists can't explain how it got so big so fast." This implies a contradiction to current theories about the timeline of massive structure formation.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Both illustrate that the past persists and leaves decipherable marks that can be observed.</answer>
<other>The article quotes Faulkner: "'The past is never dead,' William Faulkner once wrote. 'It's not even past.'" It then states, "Nobody knows this better than astronomers. Everything that has ever happened in the history of the universe has left a mark on the sky; with the right technology, much of it is now decipherable," and describes Chandra observing the aftermath of past events.</other>

<answer>The Crab nebula.</answer>
<other>The article states, "The Crab nebula was created in the year 1054 in an explosion that was seen by Chinese and Japanese astronomers and recorded in Native American pictographs."</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Human cells are composed of heavier elements, such as iron, oxygen, calcium, and silicon, which are created and shed into space by supernova explosions, the remnants of which Chandra observes.</answer>
<other>The article explains that supernova remnants shed "Newly minted elements like iron, oxygen, calcium and silicon" which are "heavier elements needed for life as we know it. The past marches on, in our cells as well as in the sky."</other>
