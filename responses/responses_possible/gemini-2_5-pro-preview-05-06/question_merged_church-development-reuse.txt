<answer>The soaring roofline of the A-frame building.</answer>
<other>The article states, "fire codes for commercial businesses require sprinkler systems, which proved especially problematic at the church in Des Plaines [Foxtail]... because of the soaring roofline of the A-frame building, typical of midcentury-era churches."</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The preservation of the sanctuary as an open space for events, rather than extensive subdivision, reflects the challenge that such specific church spaces are hard to subdivide in a way that makes sense for many uses while maintaining historical integrity.</answer>
<other>The article quotes Ari S. Heckman: "One of the great difficulties in repurposing a church is that it's a pretty specific type of space... It's hard to subdivide in a way that makes sense for a lot of uses". For the Hotel Peter and Paul, "The sanctuary is now an open space for events" and they "didn't alter the historic fabric of the church itself all that much." This choice of preservation reflects the stated challenge.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>Argodesign preserved a "rose window" and its structure accommodated a team-built car in a parking space. Foxtail preserved "massive stained-glass windows and cross." There is no single architectural feature mentioned as preserved by both that also accommodated a unique team project. The team project (car) is only mentioned for Argodesign, and it was the structure/parking space, not the window, that accommodated it.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Mrs. Tofano's.</answer>
<other>David Villegas, managing partner of Foxtail, was "a bit nervous... about the reaction of former parishioners." Mrs. Tofano, a former parishioner, said "a church is more about the people than the building" and that the renovated restaurant is "beautiful."</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Rotted away studs.</answer>
<other>Jay Colombo mentioned that "Even the studs can be rotted away." This relates to sustainability benefits ("materials are generally repurposed") because rotted studs cannot be repurposed and would likely end up in a landfill, representing a limitation to the general sustainability benefit.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Old wiring and plumbing, and sometimes roofing, may not be salvageable.</answer>
<other>The article states that adaptive reuse is "considered more sustainable since the bricks, concrete and other materials are generally repurposed." However, it then presents a contradiction: "But old wiring and plumbing, and sometimes roofing, may not be salvageable."</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Making an original architectural feature, like a rose window, energy-efficient while preserving its form.</answer>
<other>The article mentions Argodesign "preserved the shape of the rose window... and replaced it with energy-efficient glass." This implies the challenge of reconciling the preservation of an architectural feature with the need for energy efficiency, as the original feature might not be energy-efficient.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The discovery of unknown problems once layers of Sheetrock or plaster are peeled back, such as a weak infrastructure, rotted studs, mold, or asbestos.</answer>
<other>The article states adaptive reuse "can sometimes be done more quickly." However, it also mentions that "Some renovation challenges... are known only once the layers of Sheetrock or plaster are peeled back. That can reveal a weak infrastructure... Mold or asbestos might be found as well." These unforeseen issues can cause significant delays, contradicting the idea that it's generally quicker.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Sprinkler systems.</answer>
<other>The article states, "fire codes for commercial businesses require sprinkler systems, which proved especially problematic at the church in Des Plaines [Foxtail]... because of the soaring roofline of the A-frame building."</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>It's all about the inside and how it works.</answer>
<other>Mr. Land said, "Typically, a church 'is very insular -- it's all about the inside and how it works.' The challenge is to 'flip that notion of insularity and open the structure to the street.'"</other>
