<answer>The stagnant cylinder of fluids above the seamount.</answer>
<other>The article states, "Standard flow diverges around the underwater mountain and creates a stagnant cylinder of fluids above the seamount". This stagnant cylinder is part of the Taylor column phenomenon that has trapped A23a, preventing it from moving into the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and then to warmer waters.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states the iceberg completes a full rotation in "about 24 days." The Earth takes approximately 365 days to orbit the Sun. The premise in the question regarding the rotation rate is incorrect based on the information in the article.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>It would not significantly contribute to global sea level rise, unlike the melting of land-based Antarctic glaciers.</answer>
<other>The article says, "Melting icebergs that originate from floating ice shelves like A23a do not themselves significantly contribute to global sea level rise... Climate scientists are concerned that the deterioration of large portions of ice shelves will make the continent's glaciers more vulnerable to warming," implying land-based glacier melt is a significant concern for sea level rise.</other>

<answer>The calving of iceberg A23 from the Filchner Ice Shelf in 1986.</answer>
<other>The article states, "A23, which was even bigger than A23a, was one of three icebergs that broke off, or calved, from the Filchner Ice Shelf in 1986... A23a broke off later that year".</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Both could be/were trapped in a Taylor column.</answer>
<other>The article mentions a robotic float "trapped in a Taylor column for four years" and states A23a is currently "caught in what's known as a Taylor column."</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>A Taylor column.</answer>
<other>The article states, "Instead, the gigantic iceberg got caught in what's known as a Taylor column, a current that forms around seamounts."</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Four years.</answer>
<other>The article mentions, "...a 2015 study that observed a robotic float... trapped in a Taylor column for four years..."</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>About 100 kilometers.</answer>
<other>The article says, "The bump A23a is swimming over is about 100 kilometers across..."</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Christopher A. Shuman.</answer>
<other>The article states, "Christopher A. Shuman, a glaciologist and research professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, surmised that A23a would eventually go the way of other large icebergs..."</other>

<answer>Antarctic Circumpolar Current.</answer>
<other>The article says, "Typically, large icebergs move through quickly and get sucked into the Antarctic Circumpolar Current..."</other>
