<other>I will go through each question and find the answer directly from the provided article. I will ensure that the answers are concise and based solely on the text, using logical inference where permitted by the instructions.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>By infusing the North Atlantic with immense new flows of freshwater, upsetting its balance.</answer>
<other>The article states in the section about the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC): "Now, though, Greenland's melting ice is upsetting this balance by infusing the North Atlantic with immense new flows of freshwater. Scientists fear that if the motor slows too much, it could stall..."</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>As the surface of the ice loses height, more of it sits at a balmier altitude, exposed to warmer air, making it melt faster.</answer>
<other>The article's section on Greenland states: "In Greenland, the issue is elevation. As the surface of the ice loses height, more of it sits at a balmier altitude, exposed to warmer air. That makes it melt even faster."</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>It upsets the balance of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.</answer>
<other>The article states: "Greenland's melting ice is upsetting this balance by infusing the North Atlantic with immense new flows of freshwater." The "balance" referred to is that of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Microbes convert carbon from thawed permafrost into carbon dioxide and methane; these greenhouse gasses worsen heat, fire, and rain, which intensifies thawing.</answer>
<other>The section on permafrost explains: "As heat, wildfires and rains thaw and destabilize the frozen ground, microbes get to work, converting this carbon into carbon dioxide and methane. These greenhouse gasses worsen the heat and the fire and the rain, which intensifies the thawing."</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Upending weather patterns.</answer>
<other>The article, when discussing the AMOC, says: "Scientists fear that if the motor slows too much, it could stall, upending weather patterns for billions of people in Europe and the tropics."</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>By affecting rainfall in the tropics.</answer>
<other>The section on Greenland states: "They also know that the consequences of another great melt could reverberate worldwide, affecting ocean currents and rainfall down into the tropics and beyond." The Amazon is a major tropical rainforest, and changes in rainfall would affect its ecosystem.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Upending weather patterns.</answer>
<other>The article, discussing the AMOC, states: "Scientists fear that if the motor slows too much, it could stall, upending weather patterns for billions of people in Europe and the tropics."</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>By infusing the North Atlantic with immense new flows of freshwater, upsetting its balance and potentially causing it to slow or stall.</answer>
<other>The AMOC section states: "Now, though, Greenland's melting ice is upsetting this balance by infusing the North Atlantic with immense new flows of freshwater. Scientists fear that if the motor slows too much, it could stall..."</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Microbes convert carbon from thawed organic matter into carbon dioxide and methane; these greenhouse gases worsen the heat, fire, and rain that intensify thawing.</answer>
<other>The permafrost section details this: "As heat, wildfires and rains thaw and destabilize the frozen ground, microbes get to work, converting this carbon into carbon dioxide and methane. These greenhouse gasses worsen the heat and the fire and the rain, which intensifies the thawing."</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Permafrost.</answer>
<other>The description of permafrost thaw fits this: "As heat, wildfires and rains thaw and destabilize the frozen ground, microbes get to work, converting this carbon into carbon dioxide and methane. These greenhouse gasses worsen the heat and the fire and the rain, which intensifies the thawing."</other>
