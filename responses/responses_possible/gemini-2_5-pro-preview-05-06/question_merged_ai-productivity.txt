<answer>The productivity paradox</answer>
<other>The article states, "Economists sometimes call this phenomenon the productivity paradox," referring to the economic growth slump despite high-tech innovations. Acemoglu's paper suggests AI won't significantly break this slump, aligning with the continued existence of the paradox.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article presents Acemoglu's skeptical view on AI's productivity impact and Nvidia CEO's bullish view. However, it does not provide information or speculate on how Nvidia's specific strategy might be affected if Acemoglu's prediction proves accurate.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The percentage of a typical worker's task load that AI tools could automate</answer>
<other>Acemoglu stated he would reconsider his skeptical position if AI tools could automate roughly 40 percent of a typical worker's task load, up from his current finding of about 5 percent. If this metric changed to 40%, his perspective would become more optimistic, aligning more closely with Gratton's optimism.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article describes Sullivan & Cromwell's approach to evaluating student applicants in a separate news brief. It does not draw any connection between this hiring policy and the productivity goals discussed in relation to AI adoption, making it impossible to determine a conflict based solely on the text.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Concerns about the leader's current ability to effectively perform their job duties</answer>
<other>Concerns about Joe Biden's age are exemplified by "meandering answers," implying questions about performance. David Novak states that if a CEO "can't do what made you successful in the job... that's when it's time." Both relate to the leader's capacity to perform effectively.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Being the leader of a company that is doing really well, making them hard to dislodge</answer>
<other>Peter Crist notes, "It's hard to dislodge someone who is the leader of a company that is doing really well." This stability, while a sign of success, could lead to resistance to adopting new, potentially disruptive technologies needed to boost productivity, thereby contributing to the productivity paradox where new innovations don't translate into aggregate growth.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Tessa West's observation that being a "yes person" who takes on all tasks is a red flag, contrasts with the need for workers freed by AI to strategically and effectively tackle more complex challenges rather than simply accumulating tasks.</answer>
<other>Acemoglu's vision for AI productivity involves workers using freed-up time to "tackle more brainy challenges" and "take on more complex tasks." Tessa West warns against employees who say "throw it all at me," indicating such "yes persons" may not be truly effective or strategic, which would be necessary to realize Acemoglu's projected productivity gains from AI.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Exceptional, sustained CEO performance driven by deep human judgment and strategic insight not readily automatable by current AI.</answer>
<other>If Warren Buffett's continued leadership is justified by ongoing high performance (as per Crist's "performance" criterion or Novak's "attacking the job" criterion) based on human skills that AI, in Acemoglu's view, doesn't significantly enhance or replace, this would simultaneously justify his tenure and support Acemoglu's skepticism about AI's universal, transformative impact on productivity.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Applying Amy Edmondson's criteria could lead to more dynamic and effective leadership in AI companies, potentially enabling or accelerating the realization of the high productivity gains predicted by Sam Altman.</answer>
<other>Edmondson's criteria focus on a CEO's continued learning, energy for change, and whether better successors exist. In the fast-moving field of AI, applying these criteria to ensure optimal leadership could help AI companies innovate more effectively, thereby supporting or even speeding up the path to the significant productivity improvements Altman envisions.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states "Lauren Hirsch contributed reporting" but does not specify the nature or content of her contribution. Without knowing what she reported on, it is impossible to determine from the text how her specific contribution might influence future AI development strategies.</other>
