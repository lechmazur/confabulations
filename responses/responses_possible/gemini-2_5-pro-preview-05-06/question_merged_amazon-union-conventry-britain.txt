<other>The article discusses a failed unionization vote at an Amazon warehouse in Coventry, Britain. It details the vote count, accusations against Amazon's conduct, Amazon's defense, the union's (GMB) perspective, legal actions, worker conditions, and pay. I will answer each question based solely on the information provided in this article.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Whether Amazon's actions, such as allegedly pressuring employees to attend anti-union seminars and displaying QR codes to cancel union membership, constituted illegal inducement for employees not to be in a union, in breach of British law.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It suggests the legal challenges involve combating the specific tactics and resources of large technology companies, requiring specialized legal expertise.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>A strategy of attempting to directly dissuade workers from unionizing by suggesting negative consequences to their pay and benefits if the union were recognized.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<other>The article states GMB cannot make another bid for three years due to the *failure* of the current bid. If the bid had succeeded, they would have achieved formal recognition and would not need to make "another bid" in that context. The premise of the question is not supported by the article's information on the consequences of success versus failure.</other>

<other>The lower end of the associates' wage range is £12.30. The national minimum wage is £11.44. The difference is £12.30 - £11.44 = £0.86.</other>
<answer>£0.86.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<other>The article states the effort "fell short by just 28 votes" based on the ballot where "About 2,600 employees" participated. The question asks about a hypothetical scenario where "all eligible workers participated" ("More than 3,000"). The article does not provide information to determine the vote shortfall under this different condition.</other>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<other>Employees "tend to work 10-hour shifts, four days a week". 10 hours/shift * 4 days/week = 40 hours.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<other>Amanda Gearing, a GMB organizer, "has been supporting Amazon workers for more than a decade." The first impromptu cafeteria sit-ins occurred in "August 2022." "More than a decade" is not a precise duration, so the exact number of years cannot be calculated.</other>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<other>The article states the current wage "has increased 20 percent in the past two years." The first walkout protest over pay was in "August 2022." While August 2022 is within "the past two years" relative to the likely writing of the article, the 20% increase is stated for "the past two years" generally and not specifically *since* the walkout or from the wage level *at the time* of the walkout.</other>
