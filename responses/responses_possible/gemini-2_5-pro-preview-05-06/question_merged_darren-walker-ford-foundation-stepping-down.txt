<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states Darren Walker "was pressured to decline an honorary degree from Columbia because of the way the university cracked down on pro-Palestinian campus protests." However, it also states, "Mr. Walker said he planned to accept the honor in person next year." This implies he did not ultimately decline the degree, or that any declination was not final. Therefore, the premise in the question "resulting in Darren Walker declining an honorary degree" is not supported as a final outcome by the text.</other>
