<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>It might be a reason why males and females are not often found next to each other in ponds, and males take a huge risk, putting their lives on the line, when trying to attract mates.</answer>
<other>The article states, "This means males take a huge risk when trying to attract mates" and Dr. Gould says, "Maybe there's a reason why, males and females, you don't often find them next to each other in ponds," directly after discussing the risk of cannibalism.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions that males fighting back is a cost for females attempting cannibalism but does not elaborate on how this specifically influences the broader dynamics of mating interactions among the frogs.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Hellbenders</answer>
<other>The article states, "researchers recently discovered that hellbender fathers may eat their young when faced with suboptimal water conditions." This shows cannibalism, paternal care (fathers), and a response to environmental conditions.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The risk of females cannibalizing males if not pleased by their song.</answer>
<other>The article quotes Dr. Gould: "when a female green and golden bell frog isn't pleased by the song of a male, she might opt to turn him into a meal." He then adds, "Maybe there's a reason why, males and females, you don't often find them next to each other in ponds."</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article presents the information about the cannibalistic frog, the spider tricking fireflies, and the dolphin attacks as separate news items/blurbs without explicitly stating a common thread linking all three behaviors.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Both use signals related to mating in the context of predation.</answer>
<other>Female green and golden bell frogs use the male's song ("calling of their would-be beaus") to locate them and potentially eat them. The spider manipulates a male firefly's flashing "to resemble a female's come-hither signal" to attract prey.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Gaining nutritional resources.</answer>
<other>The article states, "females may gain a clear benefit from cannibalizing males" and that hellbender fathers eat their young "when faced with suboptimal water conditions," implying resource acquisition. Tadpoles also eat smaller tadpoles "to get ahead in life."</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Male fireflies risk being tricked and preyed upon by a different species (a spider) using deceptive mating signals, while male green and golden bell frogs risk being preyed upon by a female of their own species (a potential mate) if their mating signal is deemed unsatisfactory.</answer>
<other>The article describes the spider tricking fireflies and the female frog potentially eating a male whose song isn't pleasing.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The spider actively manipulates a signal to resemble a "come-hither signal" to attract prey, whereas the female green and golden bell frog uses the male's own mate-attraction call to locate him and may then choose to prey on him if his song is not pleasing, rather than actively luring him as prey with her own signal.</answer>
<other>The spider is described as "manipulate[ing] the flashing ... to resemble a female's come-hither signal ... to attract prey." The female frog's ears "are perfectly in tune to the calling of their would-be beaus," and she "might opt to turn him into a meal" if not pleased by the song.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article describes scientists adjusting crocodiles' behavior to make it adaptive (avoiding toxic toads). It describes male frogs' behavior as taking a "huge risk" to reproduce, but it does not label this behavior "maladaptive," nor does it explicitly contrast these two scenarios in the way the question frames it. The premise of "potential maladaptive behavior of male green and golden bell frogs" is an interpretation not directly stated in the article.</other>
