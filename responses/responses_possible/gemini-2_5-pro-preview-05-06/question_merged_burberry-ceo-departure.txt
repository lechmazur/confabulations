<answer>By showing that innovative elements, such as a new brand color and a viral crochet duck hat, failed to define a new stage or have any real aesthetic impact for a brand that was simultaneously trying to re-emphasize its "timeless, classic attributes."</answer>
<other>The article notes Mr. Lee's innovations like the new "Burberry blue" and a viral crochet duck hat, but states "his work has yet to define a new stage or have any real aesthetic impact." It also mentions Burberry's aim to emphasize "more of the timeless, classic attributes that Burberry is known for" and that analysts said the repositioning had "failed." The failure of these innovations to achieve a lasting positive impact while the brand seeks to connect with its heritage illustrates the difficulty.</other>

<other>The need to "rebalance" towards "timeless, classic attributes" implies the recent direction was not aligned.
