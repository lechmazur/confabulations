<answer>By juxtaposing Musk's statement that the new California law would "force families and companies to leave California to protect their children" with information about his personal family situation involving one of his children who is transgender and has expressed a desire to not be related to him.</answer>
<other>The article mentions Musk's quote about protecting children and later details: "In 2022, one of Mr. Musk's children filed paperwork to officially change her name and gender...

<answer>By stating that Musk's business decision to move headquarters was a direct response to a California law concerning gender identification in schools (which he called the "final straw"), and separately detailing his outspoken critical views on transgender issues (such as "pronouns suck" and considering "cisgender" a slur), suggesting his general views inform his specific reaction to the law and the subsequent business decision.</answer>
