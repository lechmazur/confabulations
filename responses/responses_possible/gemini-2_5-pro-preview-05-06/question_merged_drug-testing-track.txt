The user wants me to answer questions based *only* on the provided article. I must not use external sources.
For each question, I need to find the answer directly from the text or infer it logically. If not possible, I must use "N/A".
The answers should be concise, preferably fragments or words, and directly answer the exact question.

Every piece of output must be within one of these tags.
I will go through each question one by one, providing reasoning within <other> tags followed by the question number and answer tags.

For Question 1: I need to identify an athlete whose nationality matches the country where another featured athlete lives/trains.
Athletes: Ciara Mageean (Irish, trains in England), Emily Mackay (American, trains in USA), Olli Hoare (Australian, trains in USA).
Emily Mackay is American. Olli Hoare trains in Boulder, Colo., which is in the USA. Thus, Emily Mackay's nationality (American) matches the location (USA) where Olli Hoare trains.

<answer>Emily Mackay</answer>

For Question 2: The question asks how the article *indirectly* suggests that testing can coincide with significant personal events.
The article provides a direct example: "There was also the early morning when they arrived on the stoop of her boyfriend's home. The problem? It was the day of a family funeral."
The article suggests this possibility by presenting this specific anecdote from Ciara Mageean's experience. The anecdote itself is the means by which the suggestion is made.
</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>By recounting Ciara Mageean's experience of testers arriving on the day of a family funeral.</answer>

<other>
For Question 3: I need to find which athlete's experience implies familial hospitality might influence testing frequency.
The article states: "Mageean used to think that testers showed up on purpose when she was visiting her parents in Northern Ireland because her mother would cook them breakfast." This directly points to Ciara Mageean.

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Ciara Mageean</answer>

For Question 4: The question asks how the article *subtly* indicates that newer athletes might experience more anxiety.
The article contrasts Emily Mackay, a "relative newcomer," who was "freaking out" and "crying," with Ciara Mageean, a veteran, who is "intimately familiar" and "so used to" the process, considering it a "necessary nuisance." This comparison indicates the difference in anxiety levels.
</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>By contrasting Emily Mackay's ("a relative newcomer") distress and anxiety over a potential testing issue with Ciara Mageean's (a veteran) accustomedness and calmer perspective on the process.</answer>

<other>
For Question 5: The question asks how the article implies the testing process might impact personal relationships.
Olli Hoare's account mentions: "I've had girlfriends in the past who have been woken up by drug testers, and they're freaking out." This directly shows an impact on his relationships.
</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>By describing Olli Hoare's girlfriends "freaking out" when woken up by drug testers during unannounced visits.</answer>

<other>
For Question 6: The question asks how the text *subtly* indicates athletes might prefer the inconvenience of testing over the alternative (a sport not free of doping).
Ciara Mageean calls testing a "necessary nuisance" and says, "They're doing us a service to keep our sport clean." Olli Hoare says, "It's a weird situation for some people, but it's so necessary." These statements imply acceptance of the inconvenience for a greater good.
</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Through athletes' statements acknowledging testing as a "necessary nuisance" (Mageean) and "so necessary" (Hoare) for maintaining a clean sport, implying this is preferable to the alternative.</answer>

<other>
For Question 7: The question asks how the article suggests testing protocol might influence communication habits.
Emily Mackay's experience is relevant: "Now, I'm answering all the spam calls that I don't want to be answering because I'm scared it might be USADA." This shows a direct change in her phone communication habits.
</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>By detailing Emily Mackay's acquired habit of answering all phone calls, including spam, out of fear that it might be USADA trying to contact her.</answer>

<other>
For Question 8: I need to identify which athlete's experience suggests a disproportionate emotional impact of a potential mishap compared to actual consequences.
Emily Mackay "had not done anything wrong" and "was not penalized," yet she was "freaking out," "crying," and "felt so guilty and horrible." This strong emotional reaction to a situation with no negative outcome fits the description.
</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Emily Mackay</answer>

<other>
For Question 9: The question asks about the connection between competitive schedule and testing-related stress.
Emily Mackay's stressful incident occurred when she "arrived in Oregon for a meet" and it was "a few weeks before the U.S. Olympic trials." This links travel for competition and proximity to major events with increased stress.
</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The text links travel for competitions and the period leading up to significant events, such as Emily Mackay's experience before the U.S. Olympic trials, with increased potential for testing-related stress and complications with whereabouts reporting.</answer>

<other>
For Question 10: I need to identify which athlete's account implies testing can create situations challenging social norms.
Olli Hoare mentions his friends asking if he's "on probation" or has "a substance-abuse problem." He also describes girlfriends "freaking out" and testers waiting at his table while he's with friends. These situations clearly challenge social norms. Ciara Mageean also describes norm-challenging situations like "poured urine into bottles on your own kitchen table" and being watched while urinating. Hoare's account strongly emphasizes the social awkwardness and misunderstanding from others.
