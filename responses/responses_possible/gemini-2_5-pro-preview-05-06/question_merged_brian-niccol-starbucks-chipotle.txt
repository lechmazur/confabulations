<question_number>5</question_number>

<other>The article mentions Niccol expanded Chipotle's loyalty program. It does not detail Starbucks' existing customer engagement strategies or suggest why Niccol's past success might be misleading in that context.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Starbucks' sales decline is not attributed to food safety issues in the article, unlike the crisis Niccol addressed at Chipotle.</answer>
<other>Niccol's success at Chipotle involved retraining staff in food safety after a food-borne illness crisis. The article states Starbucks is "grappling with weakening results" and "weak sales," but does not link this to food safety. Therefore, his specific experience in solving a food safety crisis might be misleading if applied to a sales decline stemming from different causes.</other>
