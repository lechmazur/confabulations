<other>The article states that Covid vaccine skepticism has "bled into attitudes toward childhood vaccines," parents unwilling to get the Covid vaccine were "more likely to opt out of getting their child the MMR vaccine," MMR vaccination rates are below target, and measles outbreaks "have been largely tied to pockets of unvaccinated children." This demonstrates the impact.</other>

<answer>80%</answer>
<other>Direct savings are $540 billion. Total savings including indirect effects are $2.7 trillion. Indirect savings = $2.7 trillion - $0.540 trillion = $2.16 trillion. Percentage of total savings from indirect effects = ($2.16 trillion / $2.7 trillion) * 100 = (2160 / 2700) * 100 = 0.8 * 100 = 80%.</other>

<answer>$478,299.38</answer>
<other>The article states routine immunizations prevented 1,129,000 deaths and saved $540 billion in health care costs. Average cost savings per prevented death = $540,000,000,000 / 1,129,000 = $478,299.37998, rounded to two decimal places.</other>

<other>The percentage of U.S. kindergartners not immunized with all state-required vaccines in the 2022-23 school year was 7% (100% - 93%). The number of measles outbreaks in 2024 is 13. Since 13 (number of outbreaks) is greater than 7 (the numerical value of the percentage), the condition was met in 2024. The trend mentioned is an increase from 4 outbreaks in 2023 to 13 in 2024.</other>
