<answer>The railway companies' profit-boosting strategies, such as precision-scheduled railroading which involved rigid schedules, running extremely long trains, and cutting back on employees, are linked by the union to increased worker fatigue and a higher risk of derailments and other accidents.</answer>
<other>The article mentions Hunter Harrison's system "boosted profits" and involved steps like "running extremely long trains."

<answer>The article states that the "overwhelming majority of cars and trucks made in Canada are sent to the United States largely by train," and there would be "very limited, if any, capability to transfer finished vehicle shipments from rail to truck," highlighting a greater dependency on rail for this specific industry compared to the general difficulty of shifting cargo for other shippers.</answer>
