<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>They were not designed to do math; they are fine-tuned for determining probabilities, not rules-based calculations.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Despite being trained on vast amounts of mathematical data allowing them to excel on problems similar to what they have seen, their fundamental design for probabilistic language generation, rather than rule-based calculation, means they still struggle with general mathematical accuracy and reasoning.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>A.I. chatbots learn by analyzing data and predicting likely outputs, while traditional computing systems follow programmed step-by-step rules; in education, Khan Academy's chatbot now sends numerical problems to a calculator program instead of solving them itself.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It reflects a shift from the traditional understanding of computing as "math on steroids" (fast, accurate calculating machines) to include systems that learn from vast data and excel at language, even if they struggle with mathematical precision.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>AI's math abilities, often struggling and making it "more liberal arts major than numbers whiz," challenge the definition of computing as primarily tireless, fast, accurate calculating machines.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The chatbots' occasional mathematical errors provide a teaching opportunity for students to critically evaluate AI answers, compare solutions, and sharpen their critical thinking.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>It reflects a shift from perceiving AI's strengths primarily in calculation and number crunching to recognizing its proficiency in language-based tasks like writing poetry and summarizing books, despite its mathematical shortcomings.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Their erratic performance in math adds grist to the debate by highlighting the limitations of current large language models, supporting skeptics who question if these models alone are sufficient for progress towards artificial general intelligence and who advocate for broader approaches incorporating logic and common sense reasoning.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>By being described as "more liberal arts major than numbers whiz," AI's mathematical abilities challenge the traditional distinction, as computing (a STEM field) now produces AI that excels in language (often associated with liberal arts) while struggling with math (a core STEM skill).</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>He finds AI impressive for its language skills but not for its accuracy, emphasizing that "painful precision is required" for critical applications, which current AI may not reliably provide.</answer>
