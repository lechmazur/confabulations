<answer>Jason Calacanis</answer>
<other>Calacanis suggested $99 a year, which is $8.25 per month. Musk eventually decided on $8/month after considering $100 a year and then being influenced by Jehn Balajadia's comment about affordability, leading him to the $8 figure.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states Twitter Blue was launched on Nov. 9, 2022, and shut down "the day after its unveiling" (Nov. 10) due to advertiser threats and chaos. It does not mention a specific event occurring two days after the launch (Nov. 11) that saved the platform from election interference.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Both instances showed Musk's willingness to alter Twitter Blue's rollout in response to perceived risks or pressures; however, his reaction to advertiser threats (shutting down the service entirely) was a far more drastic and immediate response driven by fear of massive revenue loss, compared to his earlier, more controlled decision to delay certain features.</answer>
<other>Musk initially agreed to "wait to make some changes, including a plan to give tweets from Blue subscribers greater reach" before the election. Later, advertiser threats led him to "Turn it off!" showing financial pressure could force major reversals.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Both Tony La Russa's lawsuit, which stemmed from a parody account making harmful jokes, and the employees' warnings about Twitter Blue highlighted the potential for impersonation on the platform to lead to real-world negative consequences, distress, or the spread of misinformation.</answer>
<other>La Russa sued over an impersonation. Employees warned that paid verification could lead to accounts being "hijacked," harassment campaigns, and even death, and that fake accounts could spread disinformation.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Musk kept the launch quiet to avoid overloading Twitter's systems and to manage "a little bit of confusion," but the launch, even quiet, resulted in widespread, unmanageable confusion from impersonation and a breakdown of trust that forced the service to be shut down.</answer>
<other>He feared a technical system overload but instead faced a crisis of credibility and rampant misuse.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The widespread confusion and devaluation of the verification checkmark, making it a "hodgepodge of paid, free and fake identifiers signifying little more than confusion," ironically dismantled the "two-tiered class system of the verified and unverified" that Musk hated, as the badge lost its status-symbol meaning.</answer>
<other>Musk wanted to end the "class system," and the chaos effectively made the old verification status meaningless.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Musk hated Twitter's "two-tiered class system" of verification and aimed for "democratization"; however, his solution of selling checkmarks led to such widespread impersonation and confusion that the verification badge became largely meaningless, undermining the very concept of authentic verification rather than creating a functional, democratized system.</answer>
<other>His attempt to democratize verification resulted in the symbol of verification losing its value and ability to signify authenticity.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Musk stated that a "serious incident" warranting intervention would be "death or serious injury," yet the actual fallout from Twitter Blue—including widespread impersonation, brand damage, election meddling, and major advertiser revolt—was severe enough to force him to shut down the service, even if it didn't explicitly meet his articulated extreme threshold in the initial period.</answer>
<other>The problems were "beyond annoyance or mild confusion" and had significant consequences, prompting action despite his high initial bar.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Musk's strategy was to reduce Twitter's reliance on advertising revenue through Twitter Blue subscriptions, but his immediate decision to shut down Blue in response to advertiser threats demonstrated that the company remained critically vulnerable to advertiser pressure, revealing that advertising revenue still dictated major strategic decisions and his pivot strategy was not robust enough to withstand such pressure.</answer>
<other>He wanted Blue to "wean the company off its dependence on advertising," but his fear of losing ad revenue led him to halt Blue.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The employee prediction that "If everyone could be verified, then no one would truly be verified" was fulfilled when Twitter Blue's rollout led to widespread impersonation and the check marks becoming a "hodgepodge of paid, free and fake identifiers signifying little more than confusion," thereby rendering the verification badge meaningless as an indicator of true authenticity.</answer>
<other>The article states, "Many of the employees on the Blue team came to view the project as pointless at best and, at worst, something that could undermine trust. If everyone could be verified, then no one would truly be verified." The outcome was that "the site's check marks have become a hodgepodge...signifying little more than confusion."</other>
