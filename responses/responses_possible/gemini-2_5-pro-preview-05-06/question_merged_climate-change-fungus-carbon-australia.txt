<answer>Farmers applying the fungi year after year.</answer>
<other>Alan Richardson stated it "would work only if farmers applied the fungi year after year, allowing the soil to build carbon over many years."</other>

<answer>Through Dr. Jackson's concern that they "can't be used as an excuse to continue burning fossil fuels."</answer>
<other>The article quotes Dr. Jackson saying new technologies "can't be used as an excuse to continue burning fossil fuels," illustrating the conflict.</other>

<answer>Stuart McDonald</answer>
<other>Stuart McDonald used "solid waste from Sydney's sewage" which led to an "uptick in soil carbon." Oceans are mentioned as the "world's second-largest carbon store, after oceans" (implying oceans are the largest). Sewage, as organic matter, contains carbon and contributed to carbon storage, sharing a characteristic (related to carbon content/storage) with oceans as described in the article.</other>

<answer>Steve Nicholson</answer>
<other>The criticism mentioned was that "carbon credits were awarded not for substantial changes but for seasonal fluctuations." Steve Nicholson is participating in Loam Bio's program where technicians measure "base-line soil carbon...at the peak of the hot, dry season" and will check for increases, determining "how much of it is in the more stable forms." This focus on stable carbon and careful measurement aims to address the criticism.</other>

<answer>Steve Nicholson</answer>
<other>Steve Nicholson said, "It's a gamble," regarding the prospect of Loam Bio's success. The article discusses challenges in soil carbon, stating "exactly how much excess carbon they can remove and how long they can keep it underground remains contested," and "Accounting for carbon in soil is complicated." Nicholson's "gamble" relates to these uncertainties and measurement challenges.</other>
