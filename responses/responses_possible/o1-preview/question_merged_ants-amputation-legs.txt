<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Because thigh injuries reduce hemolymph flow, slowing bacterial spread, allowing effective amputation to prevent infection.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Presence of multiple hemolymph-pumping muscles in their thighs.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Amputations are more successful when wounds are closer to the body, contrary to expectations.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It saves energy by reducing the need to produce additional ants to replace injured ones.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Thigh injuries have a longer window for successful amputation; lower leg injuries have a narrow window due to rapid bacterial spread.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>They reduce hemolymph flow from thigh injuries, slowing bacterial spread and aiding infection prevention via amputation.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Faster bacterial movement in lower leg injuries limits amputation effectiveness; slower movement in thigh injuries improves effectiveness.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Injured ant presents leg for amputation and then presents wound for cleaning by nestmate.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Higher success rates occur when amputations are near hemolymph-pumping muscles (thighs) due to reduced hemolymph flow.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>High survival rate of amputees reduces need to produce replacements, increasing colony's energy efficiency.</answer>
