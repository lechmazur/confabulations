<answer>Because they were not designed to do math; they predict language, not perform rules-based calculations.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Despite vast math training data, they still struggle with mathematical accuracy.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>AI chatbots predict answers based on language patterns, while traditional computing uses rule-based calculations; in education, chatbots outsource math problems to calculators.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>By showing a shift from rule-based mathematical computing to probabilistic language prediction systems.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>AI's struggle with math challenges the idea of computing as "math on steroids" by excelling in language but faltering in mathematical accuracy.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Using chatbot math errors as teaching tools to promote critical thinking and analysis among students.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>It reflects a shift from AI being viewed as strong in math to being stronger in language skills.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>By highlighting AI's math limitations, it fuels debate over relying on large language models versus broader approaches like "world modeling."</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>By showing AI excels in language (liberal arts) but struggles with math (STEM), challenging traditional field distinctions.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>He emphasizes that AI's language skills don't ensure accuracy in critical applications requiring precise, rules-based computing.</answer>
