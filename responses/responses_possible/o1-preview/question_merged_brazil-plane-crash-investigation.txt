<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>By suggesting that improvements to the plane's de-icing system since 1994 reduce the likelihood of icing being the cause, potentially misleading understanding of the crash's cause.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>By indicating the plane's speed didn't drop enough to cause a stall unless icing was extremely severe, creating a conditional link between speed, icing severity, and the crash.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The plane's anti-icing system could be countered by descending to warmer air, and given the warm temperature at the crash location, this challenges the theory that icing caused the crash.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The plane's speed did not drop low enough to cause a stall under normal conditions, challenging the stall theory unless icing was extremely severe.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The pilots did not communicate any emergency or request to descend, conflicting with standard protocol for addressing severe icing conditions.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The warm temperature of 63 degrees at the crash location contradicts the assumption that severe icing conditions were likely.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The improved de-icing system implemented after the 1994 crash complicates the investigation because icing is still considered a possible cause despite advancements.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The plane's de-icing system using rubber tubes on the wings becomes crucial when considering the icing theory.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The plane began to fall from 17,000 feet without descending to warmer air, challenging the assumption of gradual ice accumulation that would allow time for corrective action.</answer>
