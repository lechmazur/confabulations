<other>Reviewing the article to answer questions strictly based on provided text. For question 1, the article states Silicon Valley companies "worry that state lawmakers are jumping the gun on regulating a still-unproven technology" as their primary concern despite concessions. For question 2, the original bill allowed punishment for non-compliance without harm, while amended version requires "real harm or imminent dangers". For question 3, opponents argue the bill would "choke the progress of smaller A.I. companies" by discouraging open-source code sharing. For question 4, the article discusses safety testing requirement and liability separately but never links them in critics' concerns, so N/A. For question 5, the article mentions past California laws but doesn't compare their approach to this bill's safety treatment, so N/A. For question 6, critics like Lauren Wagner state regulation "should be a federal issue, not something for state lawmakers". For question 7, original bill created new agency, amended version shifts duties to "existing California Government Operations Agency". For question 8, Wiener states innovation and safety "are not mutually exclusive" while critics like Farrell argue the bill "threatens our brand and leadership", showing the tension. For question 9, federal advocates like Wagner say "this is not light touch" and should be federal, contrasting with the state bill's approach. For question 10, Wiener claims innovation and safety aren't mutually exclusive, but companies argue the bill threatens innovation (e.g., Farrell's statement about threatening "brand and leadership").</other>
