<other>For question 7, the article states the effort failed by 28 votes ("fell short by just 28 votes"). However, the question asks "assuming all eligible workers participated", but the article states "More than 3,000 Amazon workers were eligible to vote" and "About 2,600 employees... took part". Since the exact number of eligible voters isn't specified (only "more than 3,000") and the shortfall is based on actual votes cast, the required additional votes under the hypothetical scenario cannot be determined from the text.</other>
