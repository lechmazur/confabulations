<other>Processing question 1: The article states Crenshaw restored Pinehurst No. 2 and that "those sloping greens were what Donald Ross... intended for championship golf." It specifically describes these greens having "false fronts" and roll-offs that challenge players, similar to how the Postage Stamp's small target tests skill. The direct feature mentioned is sloping greens.</other>

<other>Processing question 2: The article details Clampett's triple-bogey 8 on the long sixth hole in 1982 and Woods' 6 on the short Postage Stamp in 1997. Both incidents caused them to lose contention, illustrating how both hole types can lead to high scores under pressure.</other>

<answer>both had high scores on specific holes that derailed their contention</answer>
<other>Processing question 3: Oakmont stretched its 12th hole to 684 yards to make it unreachable, while Doak states it's "almost impossible now to build a hole that's unreachable" and prefers designing holes where "the long hitter thinks he can get there, so he will risk getting in trouble."</other>

<answer>Oakmont uses extreme length to make holes unreachable; Doak prefers strategic temptation to encourage risky shots</answer>
<other>Processing question 4: The article states Clampett "led by five after two rounds" in 1982 but had a "triple-bogey 8" on the sixth hole, and Woods was "in contention" in 1997 until taking "a 6 on the par-3 Postage Stamp." Both experienced high scores on specific Troon holes that ended their contention.</other>

<other>Processing question 5: The article mentions Patrick Reed shot 73 at Erin Hills during a practice round at maximum yardage, but Erin Hills is a different course with its own short ninth hole. No connection is made between Reed's practice and the Postage Stamp at Troon; the Postage Stamp is only discussed in relation to Troon.</other>

<other>Processing question 6: Hurdzan praises Troon's "capriciousness of the fairways" where the ball "scoot[s] one way or the other." He references Pinehurst's "roll offs" as a similar feature that "reduce[s] the margin of error," stating "We saw it at Pinehurst for the U.S. Open with all those roll offs."</other>

<answer>roll-offs</answer>
<other>Processing question 7: The Postage Stamp is described as testing skill "under pressure, with the wind blowing and a tricky pin position," while Erin Hills' ninth hole (135 yards with surrounding bunkers) "made many players... unsure." Both short holes create uncertainty through precision demands.</other>

<other>Processing question 8: Oakmont stretched its 12th hole to extreme length (684 yards) to make it unreachable. Doak explicitly states it's "almost impossible now to build a hole that's unreachable" and prefers strategic design over length, contradicting Oakmont's approach.</other>

<other>Processing question 9: Doak suggests tee-shot hazards like "deep, high-walled bunker[s]" that "cost players a stroke," creating uncertainty. Hurdzan describes Troon's fairways as having "capriciousness" where the ball "scoot[s] one way or the other," forcing players to "hit it hard and true." Both emphasize strategic uncertainty over pure length.</other>

<other>Processing question 10: Crenshaw restored Pinehurst No. 2 with sloping greens per Donald Ross's original intent. He notes Troon will have similar "roll off" greens: "We're going to see some of that at Troon because those greens have a lot of roll off," linking the restoration philosophy to Troon's expected conditions.</other>
