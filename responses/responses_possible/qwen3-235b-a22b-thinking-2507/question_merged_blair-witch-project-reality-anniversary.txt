<other>Question 1 asks about a technological advancement not explicitly mentioned but implied that would have made the marketing impossible. The article states the directors tracked actors using "pre-cellphone, military-style GPS" and that actors were sent into woods without written dialogue. Cellphones would have allowed real-time verification of actors' safety, undermining the missing posters and "true story" angle. The phrase "pre-cellphone" directly implies cellphones as the advancement that didn't exist then but would disrupt the strategy today.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>cellphones</answer>
<other>Question 2 asks how GPS contributed to both authenticity and reality-blurring. The article states directors used GPS to "track the actors" and "each night would try to provoke real fear, frustration and panic," leading to authentic performances ("Much of the fighting in the film wasn't feigned"). However, audiences were unaware of this manipulation, which contributed to the "blurring the line between fact and fiction" as the article describes.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>GPS allowed directors to manipulate actors' environment to provoke genuine fear (authenticity) while hiding this manipulation from audiences (blurring reality)</answer>
<other>Question 3 asks how leveraging confirmation bias might backfire today. The article states Sanchez said they "capitalized on confirmation bias" via their website. Professor Edgerly describes modern "algorithm-fueled echo chambers that reinforce our beliefs" and polarization where people form "two realities." Confirmation bias now would deepen polarization rather than build shared mystery, as seen in conspiracy theories like the Trump assassination attempt being "staged."</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>it would deepen polarization and entrench opposing realities rather than create shared mystery</answer>
<other>Question 4 asks for the production aspect enabling audience belief. The article emphasizes actors had "no written dialogue," filmed themselves while "cold, hungry, lost," with "no action, cut," creating raw authenticity. Combined with 1999's limited reality TV ("Cops," "The Real World") and nascent internet, this made belief possible. Today, constant self-filming and AI content make such raw footage less credible.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>actors filming themselves with no written dialogue while genuinely lost and distressed</answer>
<other>Question 5 asks how Josh's "filtered reality" comment foreshadows the conclusion. Josh says the camera creates "a filtered reality" where "you can pretend everything is not quite the way it is." The article concludes that today we live in "increasingly unique versions of the world," making reality "less of a communal experience," directly mirroring Josh's observation about mediated perception.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>it directly describes how mediated experiences allow pretending reality is different, presaging today's fragmented realities</answer>
<other>Question 6 asks how the film's reality manipulation mirrors Edgerly's news phenomenon. The article states the directors "capitalized on confirmation bias" via their website. Edgerly found people "believe what they agree with" from trusted sources, and news moves "a little bit away from the facts" to foster engagement, creating similar blurring between truth and performance.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>both exploit confirmation bias to make audiences accept manipulated content as real based on preexisting beliefs</answer>
<other>Question 7 asks how directors' "In Search Of..." background tapped childhood fears. The article explicitly states they were "fans of the television show 'In Search Of...'" which "explored folk mysteries," and they "aimed to tap into a childhood state of mind, when the fear of the unknown overlaps with an openness to believe in the seemingly unbelievable."</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>it inspired their approach to evoke childhood openness to believing in the unbelievable through folk mysteries</answer>
<other>Question 8 asks for a production element creating irony with AI concerns. The article notes the directors questioned "why would Heather keep filming" as a plausibility hurdle in 1999. Today, constant self-filming is normal, and the article links this to AI-generated content blurring reality. The production method (actors filming themselves) ironically mirrors how AI now creates indistinguishable fake content.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>actors filming themselves (which seemed implausible then but is now ubiquitous, like AI content)</answer>
<other>Question 9 asks how directors' "true story" concern relates to modern polarization. The article states they "grew concerned that they had pushed the 'true story' angle too far" when a police officer contacted them. This parallels modern conspiracy theories (e.g., Trump assassination attempt being "staged") that spread instantly online amid polarization, as described in the article's discussion of "two realities."</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>their fear of over-pushing realism mirrors how modern conspiracy theories exploit similar uncertainty in polarized environments</answer>
<other>Question 10 asks how the website presaged echo chambers. The article describes the website as a "discussion board for the curious" that "leveraged the burgeoning internet," allowing fans to "explore the mythology." It now connects to "algorithm-fueled echo chambers that reinforce our beliefs," showing the site was an early, intentional version of such spaces.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>it created an early online space where users reinforced shared beliefs about the film's mythology, mirroring modern echo chambers</answer>
