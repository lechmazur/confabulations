<other>Processing question 1: The article quotes Dr. Kohli describing the result as a "phase transition" -- a transformative change -- "in the use of A.I. in mathematics and the ability of A.I. systems to do mathematics." This directly answers how the performance reflects a phase transition according to him.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>a transformative change in the use of A.I. in mathematics and the ability of A.I. systems to do mathematics</answer>
<other>Processing question 2: Dr. Davies states mathematics is "a good litmus test for the ultimate goal: reaching so-called artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I." This directly links IMO problem-solving to AGI.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>mathematics is a good litmus test for reaching artificial general intelligence</answer>
<other>Processing question 3: Dr. Silver states the achievement represents "the point at which we went from computers only being able to prove very, very simple things toward computers being able to prove things that humans can't." This directly addresses how it challenges traditional limitations.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>computers can now prove things that humans can't, moving beyond proving only very simple things</answer>
<other>Processing question 4: The article states the A.I. "performed at the level of a silver medalist, solving four out of six problems for a total of 28 points." This directly compares its level to human competitors.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>at the level of a silver medalist</answer>
<other>Processing question 5: Dr. Silver explains the reinforcement learning algorithm "doesn't require a human teacher" and can "learn and keep learning... until ultimately it can solve the hardest problems that humans can solve." This directly addresses the significance of solving without a human teacher.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>it can learn and keep learning until solving the hardest human problems without human teaching</answer>
<other>Processing question 6: Dr. Gowers states "if Google DeepMind can solve at least some hard I.M.O. problems, then a useful research tool can't be all that far away." This directly links IMO performance to research-level math potential.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>if it can solve hard I.M.O. problems, a useful research tool can't be all that far away</answer>
<other>Processing question 7: Dr. Gowers says "It is possible to imagine a state of affairs where mathematicians are basically left with nothing to do" if computers surpass human math capabilities. This directly addresses the future role of mathematicians.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>mathematicians might be left with nothing to do if computers surpass human capabilities</answer>
<other>Processing question 8: Dr. Silver states the AI might "go beyond" human problem-solving, saying "maybe even one day go beyond those" hardest problems. This directly addresses surpassing human capabilities.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>it might go beyond solving the hardest problems that humans can solve</answer>
<other>Processing question 9: The article discusses AI capabilities but never mentions human intuition or how the AI challenges it specifically. No information provided about intuition, so answer is N/A.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>Processing question 10: The article states Dr. Hubert's team developed "AlphaProof" designed to "engage with a broad range of mathematical subjects" and it was deployed alongside AlphaGeometry for the Olympiad challenge.</other>
