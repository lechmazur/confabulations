<other>Processing question 1: The article states "In a typical 4DX presentation... audiences pay... to sit in pods of four chairs that can pitch and tilt subtly or with extreme force, using technology first developed for military flight simulators." It specifically mentions this technology is used when "the chair shakes so violently" during Paul Atreides and Chani's sandworm ride in "Dune: Part Two." The military technology is explicitly identified.</other>

<answer>technology first developed for military flight simulators</answer>
<other>Processing question 2: The article describes "flexible straws that hang between your feet and wag quickly back and forth smacking your ankles" to simulate "a critter running around the floor," which Raymond Diaz calls "a frightening prospect in New York." This effect is used for "the first jump scare in the horror prequel 'A Quiet Place: Day One.'" The physical sensation (ankle smacking) relates to both the horror film and urban pests (critters).</other>

<answer>flexible straws smacking ankles</answer>
<other>Processing question 3: The article states Takashi Yamazaki, director of "Godzilla Minus One," said "We had a really hard time filming in the ocean. We all got seasick." It then notes the 4DX version "imitates the swaying of the boat with extreme accuracy" and Yamazaki "felt a little sick" during it. The real-life seasickness during filming is mirrored by the immersive 4DX effect causing sickness.</other>

<answer>the 4DX version imitates the swaying of the boat with extreme accuracy, making Yamazaki feel sick like the crew did during filming</answer>
<other>Processing question 4: For "Civil War," the article states "The ceiling fans run gently to create an unexpected breeze that, alongside the eerie quiet, emphasizes the sense that a stray bullet could come from anywhere." Paul Hyo Kim says "Whenever you have so much tension, we don't want to overpower that at all." The gentle breeze enhances tension without intense physical stimulation.</other>

<answer>gentle ceiling fans creating an unexpected breeze alongside eerie quiet to emphasize tension without overpowering it</answer>
<other>Processing question 5: The article opens describing "Twisters": "First you get the aroma of the meadowlands... a soft breeze wafts over you and your seat sways. The wind is not ominous -- not yet." This builds to the scene where "the storm whips into the auditorium. The chairs rattle..." The sensory effects progress from calm (meadow scent/breeze) to violent (rattling chairs) mirroring the tornado's approach.</other>

<answer>starting with meadow scent and soft breeze (non-ominous wind) then progressing to violent chair rattling as the tornado approaches</answer>
<other>Processing question 6: Regarding "Mission Impossible," the article states "The filmmakers behind the 2023 'Mission Impossible' wanted a little more -- gentle rumbling mid-dialogue might signal all was not quite as it seemed." This subverts expectations by using subtle movement during calm moments to create unease.</other>

<answer>gentle rumbling mid-dialogue to signal danger where viewers wouldn't expect movement</answer>
<other>Processing question 7: For "Godzilla Minus One," Yamazaki said he "made sure Godzilla's roars were accompanied not just by vibrations from the soundtrack, but also by vibrations in the seat 'so that your body would tremble as you watched.'" This combines auditory (soundtrack) and tactile (seat) vibrations.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>vibrations in the seat accompanying soundtrack vibrations so the body trembles</answer>
<other>Processing question 8: The article describes scenes where theaters are destroyed: In "Godzilla Minus One," the monster "ravages a theater," and in "Twisters," "a tornado breaks through the wall of a movie theater... The chairs rattle and come loose from the floor." The 4DX effects (rattling chairs) enhance this narrative but also demonstrate the vulnerability of the theater itself, which critics like Scorsese argue undermines the film experience.</other>

<answer>chairs rattling and coming loose from the floor during theater destruction scenes</answer>
<other>Processing question 9: The question asks for a hypothetical outcome if CJ 4DPlex hadn't started in 2009. The article states it "started as a kind of experiment by the South Korean movie chain CJ CGV in 2009 and has now spread to more than 790 theaters." However, it provides no information about alternative scenarios or what would have happened without the 2009 start. This is speculative and not addressed in the text.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>Processing question 10: The article states "more filmmakers are becoming involved with their compositions" and gives examples: Joseph Kosinski ("Top Gun: Maverick") requested less vibration, "Mission Impossible" filmmakers wanted more subtle rumbling, and Yamazaki ("Godzilla Minus One") oversaw 4D effects. It also notes 4DX revenue grew from "$25 million in 2019" to "$68 million at the U.S. box office in 2023" as filmmaker involvement increased. The growth correlates with deeper filmmaker partnerships.</other>
