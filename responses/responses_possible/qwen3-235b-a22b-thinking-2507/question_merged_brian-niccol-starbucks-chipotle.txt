<other>Processing question 1: The question asks for a specific leadership quality of Niccol demonstrated at Chipotle that might be challenged by Starbucks' labor issues. The article describes Niccol's labor relations controversies at Chipotle (e.g., criticizing third-party involvement, store closure during unionization) but does not identify any specific leadership quality demonstrated during his Chipotle tenure that relates to labor issues. It states his focus was on drive-throughs and loyalty programs, not labor relations qualities. No specific quality is named that would be challenged, so answer is N/A.</other>

<other>Processing question 2: The article directly contrasts Niccol's background with Narasimhan's. It states Niccol "is a high-profile name in the restaurant industry" with experience at Chipotle and Taco Bell, while Narasimhan "had little-to-no background in restaurant chains" as former CEO of Reckitt (which owns Lysol/Air Wick). This difference in restaurant industry experience is explicitly cited as relevant to navigating market struggles.</other>

<other>Processing question 3: The question assumes Niccol's stock price success at Chipotle might be less applicable to Starbucks due to activist groups. The article states activist groups "largely cheered the leadership pivot" and notes Niccol's stock success at Chipotle, but does not suggest his approach is less applicable or conflicts with activist groups. No information indicates his stock-increase strategy would be less applicable, so answer is N/A.</other>
