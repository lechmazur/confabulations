<other>Processing question 1: The question asks about the "significance" of the ghostlike reflection considering pentimento and Whistler's description. The article states Whistler described his work as "arrangements of line, form and color first" and refused to confirm figure identities, but does not attribute any specific significance to the reflection itself. It presents the pentimento theory as a possibility without stating its significance. The instructions require direct answers without nuance or interpretation, so this cannot be directly answered from facts.</other>

<other>Processing question 2: The question asks what the absence of the reflection initially "might suggest" about intentions and pentimento nature. The article states it "may have emerged only decades later" or was intentional, but does not suggest what this implies about Whistler's intentions or the nature of pentimento. The instructions prohibit inference beyond direct facts.</other>

<other>Processing question 3: The question asks what student reactions suggest about perceived difficulty. The article directly states students react with "horror," think it's "impossible," and see it as "remedial." This is a factual description of their perceived difficulty.</other>

<answer>horror, impossible, remedial</answer>
<other>Processing question 4: The question asks what pentimento suggests about the relationship between artist intentions and viewer interpretation.

<other>Processing question 5: The question asks which artistic element transforms industrial structures. The article quotes Whistler's lecture: "when the evening mist clothes the riverside with poetry as with a veil, and the poor buildings lose themselves... tall chimneys become campanili, and the warehouses are palaces." Mist is explicitly named as the transformative element.</other>

<other>Processing question 6: The question asks how the reflection challenges perception of time. The article mentions the reflection "may have emerged only decades later" but does not connect this to the viewer's perception of time within the artwork's depicted scene. No facts address time perception in the artwork.</other>

<other>Processing question 7: The question asks for a connection between Whistler's lecture and the conservator's theory. The lecture describes the painted moment's atmosphere, while the theory concerns physical changes to the canvas (pentimento). The article presents them separately with no stated connection.</other>

<other>Processing question 8: The question asks how the reflection relates to Roberts' views on student reactions. The article discusses the reflection and student reactions separately but never links them. Roberts' views on reactions are about the assignment's difficulty, not the painting's features.</other>

<other>Processing question 9: The question asks for a parallel between Whistler refusing to confirm figures and the pentimento. The article mentions both (he wouldn't confirm figures in another painting; pentimento is a possible change here) but does not draw any parallel between them. No facts establish this connection.</other>

<other>Processing question 10: The question asks how the subject matter reflects office worker screen time challenges. The article states the painting has "mysteries revealed upon close inspection" and contrasts this with office workers spending "less than a minute at a time on any one screen," implying the painting requires sustained attention that modern habits undermine.</other>
