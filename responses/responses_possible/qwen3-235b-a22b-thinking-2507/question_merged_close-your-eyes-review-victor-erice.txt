<other>Reviewing the article to answer each question strictly based on provided facts. For question 1, the article describes the TV program "Unsolved Cases" triggering Miguel's investigation but does not state it creates a "misleading sense of resolution" regarding Julio's disappearance; it only says the inquiry "gradually accrues destabilizing existential weight." No mention of misleading resolution exists.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>For question 2, the article explicitly states Frankenstein's monster "haunts 'Beehive' and Ana" and connects to the new film's title phrase "Close your eyes" (how to summon it in "Beehive"). It serves as the haunting presence/metaphorical bridge.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Frankenstein's monster</answer>
<other>For question 3, the article states Miguel was a "melancholic filmmaker" whose career ended when Julio disappeared during his last film. The TV program revisiting "his movie's puzzling history" (the unfinished film) is the catalyst for his investigation. His profession (filmmaker) directly links to the catalyst (the TV program about his unfinished film).</other>

<answer>His profession as a filmmaker whose career ended due to the unfinished film</answer>
<other>For question 4, the article explains the title phrase "Close your eyes" comes from "Beehive" (how to summon the monster), but Miguel actively investigates Julio's disappearance, keeping his eyes open. The article does not explicitly state the title "ironically contradicts" his actions; it only describes his investigation.</other>

<other>For question 5, the article states Erice was "born in 1940" and "Beehive" is "set around 1940," but it does not connect his birth year to the temporal setting or thematic underpinnings of "Close Your Eyes." Only "Beehive" is linked to 1940.</other>

<other>For question 6, the article mentions a "long, chatty section" from the unfinished film opens "Close Your Eyes," but it does not specify how this device mirrors the main storyline's structure. No mirroring device is described.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>For question 7, the article explicitly states Miguel "begins wearing the trench coat that Julio wore in the film," showing a merging of fictional (Julio's character) and real-world (Miguel) identities.</other>

<answer>wearing Julio's trench coat from the film</answer>
<other>For question 8, the article contrasts "Beehive"'s "narratively elliptical" style (which works) with "Close Your Eyes" having "narrative ellipses" that are "frustrating rather than illuminating." Ellipsis is the technique subverted.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>narrative ellipses</answer>
<other>For question 9, the article states Gardel (played by Coronado, same actor as Julio) "helps solve the case," and Erice frames them "side-by-side, as if twinning them," directly complicating duality by visually merging the missing person and the solver.</other>

<answer>framing them side-by-side as twins while solving the case</answer>
<other>For question 10, the article notes Erice's "first [film] since 'Dream of Light' (1992)" and Miguel's career ended when he "was unable to finish the movie." Both involve long absences from filmmaking due to an unfinished project.</other>
