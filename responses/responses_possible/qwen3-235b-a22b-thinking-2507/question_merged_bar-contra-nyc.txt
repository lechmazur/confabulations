<other>Reviewing the article for each question. The article describes new restaurant openings but does not provide comparative analysis, philosophical contrasts, trend exemplifications, or speculative impacts as required by the questions. All questions ask for connections, influences, or interpretations not stated or logically inferable from the text. Corrections in the article explicitly refute some premises (e.g., Dishoom's origins). Strict adherence to instructions requires "N/A" for all questions since answers cannot be directly sourced from the article.</other>
