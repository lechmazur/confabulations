<other>Reviewing the article for question 1: The article states Haynes was drafted by both the Raiders (A.F.L.) and Steelers (N.F.L.) but signed with the Texans. It does not specify any significant impact of this decision on his career trajectory beyond joining the A.F.L. team. No direct impact is described, so answer is N/A.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>For question 2: The article states Haynes was called the "Most Popular Athlete in Big D" in Dallas, but after leading the boycott of the All-Star Game in New Orleans (which forced its move to Houston), he was traded to the Broncos four days later. The paradox is his high popularity in Dallas versus being traded after taking a stand against racism.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Despite being the "Most Popular Athlete in Big D" in Dallas, he was traded to the Broncos after leading the boycott against racial discrimination in New Orleans.</answer>
<other>For question 3: The article states Haynes won the overtime coin flip in the 1962 A.F.L. championship game and chose to kick off ("We'll kick to the clock"), which was potentially costly. However, the Texans' defense held and they won 20-17 on a field goal. The irony is that his seemingly bad decision did not cost them the game.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>He chose to kick off after winning the coin flip, which was potentially costly, but the Texans won anyway.</answer>
<other>For question 4: The article details Haynes' on-field achievements (Rookie of Year, Player of Year, rushing/receiving records) while also describing off-field racial challenges: verbal/physical abuse in college, refusal of admission to nightclubs and cab service in New Orleans, and a team executive telling him "a football player's role is not to help his people." The contradiction is his stardom versus facing discrimination.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>He was a star player (Rookie of Year, Player of Year, record-setter) while facing racial discrimination (abuse in college, nightclub/cab refusals in New Orleans, team executive's letter).</answer>
<other>For question 5: The article states Haynes broke the college color barrier in Texas at North Texas State College, where he faced "verbal and physical abuse from opposing teams and fans." This experience directly foreshadowed his later leadership in the 1965 All-Star Game boycott against similar discrimination in New Orleans.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Breaking the college color barrier and facing racial abuse at North Texas foreshadowed his leadership in the 1965 All-Star Game boycott against discrimination in New Orleans.</answer>
<other>For question 6: This question is nearly identical to question 4. The article shows his on-field success (e.g., leading the league in rushing/receiving) contrasted with off-field racial challenges (college abuse, New Orleans incident, executive's letter). The relationship is the contradiction between his achievements and discrimination.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>His on-field success (e.g., leading the league in rushing/receiving) contrasted with off-field racial discrimination (college abuse, New Orleans incident, executive's letter).</answer>
<other>For question 7: The article states Haynes' five-touchdown game against the Raiders in 1961 (four rushing, one receiving) remains a "franchise record, shared with Jamaal Charles, who tied it in 2013." Its significance is being the franchise's single-game touchdown record.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>It remains a franchise record for most individual touchdowns in a game, shared with Jamaal Charles.</answer>
<other>For question 8: Similar to question 1, the article only states he signed with the Texans over the Steelers but does not describe how this influenced his career trajectory. No specific influence is provided, so N/A.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>For question 9: The article states after retiring, Haynes took a "refreshing" option to work at Zales as a personnel administrator instead of continuing to play. The significance is it was a deliberate, positive career shift after football.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>It was a "refreshing" option he chose instead of continuing to play.</answer>
<other>For question 10: The article states after being traded to the Broncos, Haynes "led the league in kickoff returns in 1965." This shows his career trajectory changed from a starting halfback to a return specialist.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>He led the league in kickoff returns in 1965.</answer>
