merged_apple-quarterly-revenue-up-5.txt
<other>Reviewing the article to answer each question based solely on provided facts. The article reports Apple's quarterly results, regulatory challenges, and future plans but does not address hypothetical scenarios, financial modeling, or speculative impacts beyond stated expectations. All questions ask about potential consequences of events not directly covered in the text (e.g., "if X happens, what is the impact?"). The instructions require answering "N/A" for questions that cannot be directly answered with facts from the article or logically inferred per the examples (e.g., no counterfactual analysis allowed). For Q9, the article provides Google payment loss ($20B/year) and quarterly revenue ($85.78B), but the question asks for the annual loss as a percentage of *quarterly* revenue, which is mathematically invalid (comparing annual to quarterly figures without annual revenue context); the article does not state annual revenue, so calculation is impossible per instructions. For Q10, the article attributes stock rise to multiple factors ("helping it reclaim its position"), not solely AI, so the premise is unsupported.</other>
