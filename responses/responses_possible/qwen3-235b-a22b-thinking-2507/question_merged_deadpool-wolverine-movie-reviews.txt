<other>The article reports critics' opinions but does not establish the analytical relationships, paradoxes, ironies, or underlying themes asked about in the questions. The questions assume interpretations and connections that are not explicitly stated or logically inferable from the text. The text only provides separate critic quotes and summaries without synthesizing the relationships the questions demand. Per instructions, "N/A" is required when the answer cannot be directly answered from the text.</other>
