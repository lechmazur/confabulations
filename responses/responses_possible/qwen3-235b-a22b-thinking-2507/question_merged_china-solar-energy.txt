<other>For question 1, the article states that solar manufacturers across China have been laying off thousands of workers to cut costs, but Longi Green Energy Technology is giving yearlong unpaid vacations instead, which contradicts the industry's overall approach of layoffs to cut costs.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Longi Green Energy Technology</answer>
<other>For question 2, the article mentions that local governments are running out of money as a housing crisis makes it hard for them to sell long-term leases on state land, which is Sunzone's inability factor related to local subsidies.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>local governments running out of money due to housing crisis</answer>
<other>For question 3, Zhang Jianhua (director of China's National Energy Administration) states that "the outdated production capacity is still extensive and needs to be gradually phased out," which mirrors the automotive sector's challenge where annual car sales are "barely half the country's ability to make vehicles" indicating overcapacity.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>outdated production capacity needing to be phased out</answer>
<other>For question 4, China's industrial policy shows "high tolerance for letting firms stumble and even fail," but the article states that "China's banks, acting at Beijing's direction, have lent so much money" and that some companies "restarted operations, often with the help of banks," contradicting the policy of allowing failure.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>banks propping up failing companies instead of letting them fail</answer>
<other>For question 5, the article states Europe "began barring [solar panels] use in government procurement projects unless Chinese companies disclose their subsidies," so a similar Biden policy would require subsidy disclosure for US government contracts.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>bar use in government procurement unless subsidies are disclosed</answer>
<other>For question 6, Zhang Haimeng of Longi states they are furloughing workers "in preparation for even bigger production pushes in the future" when new equipment is ready.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>preparation for bigger production pushes with new equipment</answer>
<other>For question 7, the article states Europe bars solar panels in government projects "unless Chinese companies disclose their subsidies, which they refuse to do," implying disclosure would make them eligible but the consequence of refusal is being barred; if they disclosed, they would avoid being barred but the article doesn't state other consequences, so the specific consequence of disclosure isn't mentioned beyond eligibility.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>For question 8, Sunzone received "practically every possible subsidy" but still failed, becoming obsolete and having its factory demolished, showing that even with government support for favored industries, companies can still fail due to overcapacity and competition.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>failure despite government support due to overcapacity/competition</answer>
<other>For question 9, the article states Chinese manufacturers are "cutting prices far below their costs" to maintain market share, allowing them to absorb tariffs while still undercutting competitors.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>cutting prices far below their costs</answer>
<other>For question 10, the article states "nearly every solar panel on the planet is made by a Chinese company" and China's solar factory capacity is "roughly double the entire world's demand," so withdrawal of support would likely cause a collapse in global supply.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>global supply would collapse</answer>
