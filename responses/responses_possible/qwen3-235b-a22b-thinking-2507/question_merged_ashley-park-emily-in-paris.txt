<other>For question 1, the article states in point 2: "I have these wooden bowls that I got at the farmers' market in my boyfriend's parents' town in the south of France that I keep all my keys in. And so whenever I go to open this door or that door, it's nice to have a little piece of that here." This shows the wooden bowls serve as practical storage (for keys) and a sentimental reminder (of France).</other>

<other>For question 2, point 6 states: "One of the first lessons I learned in college, from one of my musical theater professors, Brent Wagner, was gratitude.

<other>For question 7, the article states she takes roles with "zero percent, if not negative percent, hesitation" (e.g., for "Only Murders").
