<other>For question 1, the article states: "But a longer stoppage would have hammered Canada's export-dependent economy and the businesses around the world that rely on its goods." It also mentions recent global supply chain disruptions like Red Sea attacks and Panama Canal issues, but the direct impact of a prolonged rail shutdown is specified as hammering the export-dependent economy.</other>

<answer>hammered Canada's export-dependent economy</answer>
<other>For question 2, the article states: "Ninety percent of Canadian-produced fertilizer going into the U.S. market is delivered by rail" and "Trucks can't handle these products because they are typically transported in huge volumes over enormous distances." The primary logistical challenge is the lack of practical alternatives for bulk transport.</other>

<answer>no practical alternatives to railroads for huge volumes</answer>
<other>For question 3, the article states: "C.H. Robinson began advising customers to make that change in May" where "that change" refers to "American and Canadian companies that were big users of Canadian ports are shifting to U.S. ports." It specifies 80% shifted to LA/Long Beach and the rest to Seattle/Tacoma. This reflects their assessment of the rail shutdown's potential impact on supply chains.</other>

<answer>advised customers to shift from Canadian ports to U.S. ports (Los Angeles/Long Beach or Seattle/Tacoma)</answer>
<other>For question 4, the Railway Association of Canada estimates "half of Canada's exports are moved on trains." A shutdown lasting 8 days (over one week) would exceed the $1 billion weekly loss estimate, directly impacting this group's export volume metric. No other industry group's estimate is tied to the exact duration.</other>

<other>For question 5, Derek Nighbor states: "The rail shutdown could also lead sawmills and pulp and paper plants to close as they run out of room to store products." This is the specific consequence for forest product companies after a prolonged stoppage like 10 days.</other>

<answer>sawmills and pulp and paper plants closing due to storage limits</answer>
<other>For question 6, the article links low Panama Canal water levels to shipping disruptions and states coal for Asian steel making "travels on dedicated trains from mines in Alberta and British Columbia to ports." Coal exports would face compounded effects as both rail and canal are critical for this specific export route.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>coal</answer>
<other>For question 7, the article mentions the dockworkers' strike anticipation affects East Coast/Gulf ports, and fertilizer relies on rail (90% to US market). However, it does not describe any specific interaction or combined effect between the rail shutdown and dockworkers' strike for fertilizer distribution. No information allows inference of the primary challenge in this combined scenario.</other>

<other>For question 8, Matt Blunt states: "A prolonged railroad strike would severely disrupt the North American automotive supply chain, which is critical to the U.S. auto sector." Two weeks qualifies as prolonged per the context (strikes in 2015/2019 ended in days, weeklong shutdown estimated at $1B). The immediate effect is severe supply chain disruption.</other>

<answer>severe disruption to the North American automotive supply chain</answer>
<other>For question 9, the article states rail is the only practical transport for grains ("for some types of cargo, like grains, there are no practical alternatives to railroads") and mentions Red Sea disruptions affecting Suez shipping. However, it does not connect Red Sea issues specifically to grain exporters or describe compounded effects for them. No information allows inference of the primary concern in this combined scenario.</other>

<other>For question 10, the article states forest products (sawmills and pulp/paper plants) would close "as they run out of room to store products" and coal mines have "limited storage capacity." However, it specifically names forest products as facing closure due to storage limits, while coal is mentioned only for transport to ports. Sawmills/pulp plants are identified as the first to shut down.</other>
