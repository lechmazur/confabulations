<other>Reviewing the article to answer each question strictly based on provided facts. For question 1, the article describes Spaeny's upbringing (seventh of nine children to Southern Baptists, left school at 13) and her role in "Priscilla" (Coppola notes her ability to express much with minimal movement), but does not state any influence of her upbringing on her acting style for this role. No connection is made.</other>

<other>For question 2, the article states Spaeny took a year off after "Alien: Romulus," traveled, and had an "existential crack" where she questioned if acting should be her whole life. It attributes this to achieving her initial goal (acting as an exit from Missouri) and not having a clear next purpose, but does not specify an underlying reason beyond this reflection.</other>

<other>For question 3, the article explicitly states acting was Spaeny's "exit route out of Missouri and toward the life she wanted," and now that she has that life, she questions "if it means anything at all" and says "This could really easily be a chapter of my life and not my whole life." This directly contrasts initial motivation (escape) with current perspective (questioning permanence).</other>

<other>For question 6, the article states Spaeny found Rain's character "close to her" because Rain is a small-town girl with city dreams, similar to Spaeny's own journey.
