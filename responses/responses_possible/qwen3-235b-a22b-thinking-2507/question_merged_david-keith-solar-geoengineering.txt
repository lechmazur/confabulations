<other>Scanning the article for Question 1: The central figure (David Keith) states that to return the planet to a more pristine state, humans may need to "take even more drastic action and engineer the stratosphere" by intentionally releasing sulfur dioxide, which is paradoxical because it involves adding a pollutant to fix pollution caused by fossil fuels. The article explicitly says: "To repair the climate and return it to a more pristine state, we may need to take even more drastic action and engineer the stratosphere." and earlier describes his proposal to "spray a pollutant into the sky to block some sunlight."</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>spraying sulfur dioxide/pollutant into the stratosphere</answer>
<other>For Question 2: Keith states "the risks posed by solar geoengineering are well understood, not as severe as portrayed by critics and dwarfed by the potential benefits." Pierrehumbert calls it "a grave threat to human civilization" and says "even doing research on it is not just a waste of money, but actively dangerous." The contrast is Keith sees small quantifiable risks outweighed by benefits, while Pierrehumbert sees extreme danger even in research.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Keith believes risks are small compared to benefits; Pierrehumbert considers it actively dangerous even to research</answer>
<other>For Question 3: The 1992 paper "raised the questions that would shape his career: Who should authorize the use of these technologies? Who is liable if something goes wrong?" Critics raise governance concerns about authorization and liability, directly matching the paper's questions. The connection is the paper first identified these specific governance issues.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>His 1992 paper first raised the authorization and liability questions that critics now cite as governance concerns</answer>
<other>For Question 4: Keith cites the Mount Pinatubo eruption (natural event where sulfur dioxide cooled the planet) as "validation of an idea." The article states: "Dr. Keith cites that event as validation of an idea that has become his life's work." His perspective on intentional alteration is directly inspired by observing this natural climate change.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>He cites natural climate changes (like Mount Pinatubo eruption) as validation for intentional alteration</answer>
<other>For Question 5: Keith's windfall from Carbon Engineering sale was "about $72 million." The new academic program's cost "could reach as much as $100 million." The comparison is $72 million personal windfall versus up to $100 million program funding.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>His $72 million windfall is less than the $100 million program funding</answer>
<other>For Question 6: During his 60th birthday hike, Keith saw "a glacier that had shrunk dramatically," which was "a visual reminder that global warming is upending the natural world, and it confirmed his central, controversial belief." The connection is the observed glacier shrinkage reinforced his motivation.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Seeing a dramatically shrunken glacier confirmed his belief and motivated him</answer>
<other>For Question 7: Keith "agrees that nations should stop burning coal, oil and gas, period. But Dr. Keith believes in going further." His proposed solution (solar geoengineering) is an additional measure beyond ending fossil fuels. The contrast is he supports ending emissions but insists extra intervention is necessary.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>He supports ending fossil fuel emissions but believes additional intervention (solar geoengineering) is necessary</answer>
<other>For Question 8: The article states dyslexia delayed his reading until "late in 4th grade" and he later studied "experimental physics" at MIT, but no causal relationship or connection between dyslexia and his physics career is provided. It only lists these as sequential life events without linking them.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>For Question 9: After protests canceled the Scopex experiment, Keith said: "A lesson I've learned from this is that if we do this again, we won't be open in the same way." His response to protests was to reduce transparency, directly contradicting his previous openness.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Protests led him to plan reduced transparency in future research</answer>
<other>For Question 10: Pierrehumbert states termination shock could cause "potentially massive temperature rise in an unprepared world over a matter of five to 10 years." The specific risk is rapid, massive temperature increase.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>massive temperature rise in 5-10 years</answer>
