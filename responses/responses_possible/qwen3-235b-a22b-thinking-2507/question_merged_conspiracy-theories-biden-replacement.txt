<answer>right-wing influencers heralding the moment as a conspiracy theory turned true; conspiracists using "moments of truth" to get others on board by leveraging partial truths to claim the broader conspiracy must be true</answer>
<other>The article explains conspiracists rely on "nuggets of truth" as evidence that the conspiracy theory is true, using the anti-vaccine example where minor illnesses or deaths after vaccination were leveraged as proof of a global plot, despite the larger claim being unproven.
