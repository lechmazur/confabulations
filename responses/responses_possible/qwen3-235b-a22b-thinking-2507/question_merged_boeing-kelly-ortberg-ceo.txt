<other>Reviewing the article for question 1: The article states Ortberg became CEO of Rockwell Collins in 2013, remained until late 2018 when Rockwell was acquired by United Technologies, retained a senior role until the merger with Raytheon in early 2020 forming RTX, and retired from RTX in 2021. However, the article does not describe a "sequence of corporate changes that led to" his retirement before Boeing's appointment; it only lists events chronologically without indicating causation for retirement. The question asks for the sequence leading to retirement before appointment, but the article presents retirement as a separate event not caused by prior corporate changes in the context of Boeing's hiring. Per instructions, answer N/A if not directly provided or logically inferable as sequence leading to retirement.</other>

<other>For question 3: The article describes FAA actions (grounding, inspections, production limits) after the January panel incident and notes Ortberg's appointment to lead recovery, but it does not state that his appointment reflects a response to FAA scrutiny specifically. The board's reasoning focuses on his skills/experience generally, not FAA actions. Per instructions, answer N/A if not directly provided.</other>

<other>For question 5: The article directly quotes Kevin Michaels saying Ortberg "balances long-term strategy with meeting shorter-term stakeholder expectations," which addresses what the appointment suggests about Boeing's approach.
