<other>Processing question 6: Nepal (low GDP per capita) lacks sports funding, while Monaco (highest GDP per capita) has no medals due to small population.</other>

<other>Processing question 10: US has 2,975 medals. Next four: Soviet Union 1,204 + Germany 1,058 + Great Britain 955 + France 898 = 4,115. 2,975 is less than 4,115, so US has fewer medals than the combined total. Question premise (US has more) is incorrect.</other>
