<other>For question 1, the article states: "Shaving is more likely than waxing or plucking to cause ingrown hairs because it tends to break off the hair just under the skin, which could push the hair into the skin's layers and interfere with its growing path." This is the primary reason given.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>it tends to break off the hair just under the skin, pushing the hair into the skin's layers and interfering with its growing path</answer>
<other>For question 2, the article states multi-blade razors "cut hair too close to the skin" and "the closer the shave, the more likely an ingrown hair is to form." It also states people with curly hair are "most affected." Shaving against the grain increases closeness. The most likely outcome is increased ingrown hairs.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>increased likelihood of ingrown hairs</answer>
<other>For question 3, the article states: "People with curly or coarse hair are most affected" and "The bumps are also more common if you regularly shave or wax before the hair has fully grown back." The combination explains the increased frequency.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>coarse hair combined with premature hair removal increases risk</answer>
<other>For question 4, the article states: "Replacing your razor blades frequently helps too." This directly links frequent replacement to reduced likelihood.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>frequent replacement reduces likelihood</answer>
<other>For question 5, the article states: "Doctors may also recommend alternative hair removal methods, like depilatory creams, which dissolve the hair and are less likely to cause the bumps." It also notes laser/electrolysis may have "occasional regrowth," but depilatory creams are explicitly stated as less likely to cause bumps while allowing regrowth.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>depilatory creams</answer>
<other>For question 6, the article states multi-blade razors "cut hair too close to the skin" and "the closer the shave, the more likely an ingrown hair is to form, because the hair can get trapped under the skin." This explains the physiological mechanism.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>they cut hair too close, trapping it under the skin</answer>
<other>For question 7, the article states: "People with curly or coarse hair are most affected." It explains ingrown hairs occur when "the hair starts regrowing, it can curve inward and dig into the skin." Straight, fine hair is less likely to curve inward.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>curly hair is more likely to curve inward and dig into the skin</answer>
<other>For question 8, the article states: "Shaving is more likely than waxing or plucking to cause ingrown hairs because it tends to break off the hair just under the skin, which could push the hair into the skin's layers and interfere with its growing path." This describes the physiological process.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>shaving breaks hair under the skin, pushing it into skin layers and interfering with growth path</answer>
<other>For question 9, the article states: "Replacing your razor blades frequently helps too" but does not specify the physiological reason. However, it implies dull blades from infrequent replacement increase risk, so frequent replacement reduces irritation or improper cutting.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>frequent replacement reduces risk by maintaining sharp blades</answer>
<other>For question 10, the article states: "The bumps are also more common if you regularly shave or wax before the hair has fully grown back." Infrequent waxing allows full regrowth between sessions, while daily shaving occurs before full regrowth.</other>

<answer>infrequent waxing allows hair to fully grow back between sessions</answer>
