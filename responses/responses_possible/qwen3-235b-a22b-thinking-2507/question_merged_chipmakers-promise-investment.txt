<answer>10:1</answer>
<other>Processing question 4: Largest grant mentioned is Intel's $8.5 billion. Smallest grant mentioned is SK Hynix's $450 million ($0.45 billion). Difference is $8.5 billion - $0.45 billion = $8.05 billion.</other>

<answer>$8.05 billion</answer>
<other>Processing question 5: Total CHIPS Act funding is $39 billion. Allocated amount is more than $30 billion, but the article specifies "$30 billion" as the allocated figure for calculation purposes. Unallocated = $39 billion - $30 billion = $9 billion. Percentage = ($9 billion / $39 billion) * 100 = 23.08%.</other>

<answer>23.08%</answer>
<other>Processing question 6: Total allocated funds are $30 billion. Projected job creation is more than 100,000 jobs, but the article specifies "more than 100,000" with 100,000 used as the base figure. Average = $30 billion / 100,000 = $300,000 per job.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>$300,000</answer>
<other>Processing question 7: Private investment commitments are more than $300 billion. Public funding allocated is $30 billion. Ratio = $300 billion / $30 billion = $10 private investment per $1 public funding.</other>

<answer>$10</answer>
<other>Processing question 8: The article mentions grants to non-U.S. companies (SK Hynix, TSMC, Samsung) but only specifies SK Hynix's amount ($450 million). TSMC's grant is stated as up to $6.6 billion, but Samsung's grant amount is not provided in the text. Therefore, the total funding to non-U.S. companies cannot be determined from the given information.</other>

<other>Processing question 9: Largest grant is Intel's $8.5 billion. SK Hynix grant is $450 million ($0.45 billion). Ratio = $8.5 billion / $0.45 billion â‰ˆ 18.89.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>18.89</answer>
<other>Processing question 10: U.S. semiconductor manufacturing share was 37% in 1990 and is currently about 10%. Difference = 37% - 10% = 27 percentage points needed to return to 1990 level.</other>
