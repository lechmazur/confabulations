<other>For question 1, the article states: "Greenland's melting ice is upsetting this balance by infusing the North Atlantic with immense new flows of freshwater" regarding AMOC, and scientists fear "if the motor slows too much, it could stall." The contribution is freshwater infusion disrupting the salt/freshwater balance.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>infusing the North Atlantic with immense new flows of freshwater, upsetting the salt/freshwater balance</answer>
<other>For question 2, the article states: "As the surface of the ice loses height, more of it sits at a balmier altitude, exposed to warmer air. That makes it melt even faster." Elevation change exposes ice to warmer air.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>exposing more ice to warmer air at balmier altitudes, accelerating melting</answer>
<other>For question 3, the article states: "Greenland's melting ice is upsetting this balance by infusing the North Atlantic with immense new flows of freshwater" which could cause the AMOC to slow or stall.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>upsetting the salt/freshwater balance, potentially slowing or stalling the currents</answer>
<other>For question 4, the article states: "As heat, wildfires and rains thaw and destabilize the frozen ground, microbes get to work, converting this carbon into carbon dioxide and methane. These greenhouse gasses worsen the heat and the fire and the rain, which intensifies the thawing." This describes the self-propelling cycle.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>releasing carbon dioxide and methane that worsen heat, fire, and rain, intensifying further thawing</answer>
<other>For question 5, the article states AMOC stalling would "upend weather patterns for billions of people in Europe."</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>upending weather patterns</answer>
<other>For question 6, the article discusses Greenland melting affecting AMOC and AMOC affecting global weather, but no direct link between Greenland melting and Amazon ecosystem is stated. The Amazon section only mentions deforestation, wildfires, and droughts as threats.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>For question 7, the article states AMOC stalling would "upend weather patterns for billions of people in Europe and the tropics."</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>upending weather patterns</answer>
<other>For question 8, identical to question 1 and 3: "Greenland's melting ice is upsetting this balance by infusing the North Atlantic with immense new flows of freshwater" which could cause AMOC to stall.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>infusing the North Atlantic with immense new flows of freshwater, potentially causing slowdown or stall</answer>
<other>For question 9, identical to question 4: permafrost thaw releases greenhouse gases that worsen conditions causing more thawing.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>releasing carbon dioxide and methane that worsen heat, fire, and rain, intensifying further thawing</answer>
<other>For question 10, the permafrost section describes how thawing releases greenhouse gases that exacerbate the warming causing the thaw, creating a self-propelling cycle. No other system is described with this specific self-exacerbating gas release mechanism.</other>
