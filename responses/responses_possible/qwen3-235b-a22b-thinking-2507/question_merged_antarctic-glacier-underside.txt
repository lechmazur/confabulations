<other>For question 1, the article states: "In the past, scientists generally assumed that the melting process smoothed out the topography of underwater ice... Now it's becoming clear that these features and indentations can persist." This directly answers how the formations challenged previous assumptions.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>persistence of complex features and indentations contradicted the assumption that melting smoothed out underwater ice topography</answer>
<other>For question 2, the article states: "By the end of the scientists' monthlong expedition, Ran had completed 14 undersea missions, but only about half of them were completely successful." The navigation method (dead reckoning) is directly linked to this success rate.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>only about half of Ran's missions were completely successful</answer>
<other>For question 3, the article states Dr. Wahlin's theory: "it had a fateful encounter with a curious seal... One of them could have started circling Ran underwater, causing it to become disoriented." This explains the significance of the seals to Ran's potential loss.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>seals could have caused Ran to become disoriented leading to its loss</answer>
<other>For question 4, the article states: "In the past, scientists generally assumed that the melting process smoothed out the topography of underwater ice... Now it's becoming clear that these features and indentations can persist." This directly shows how the findings challenged the assumption.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>the persistence of complex features and indentations contradicted the assumption that melting smoothed out underwater ice topography</answer>
<other>For question 5, the article states: "When Dr. Wahlin and her team reached the frozen continent, however, Thwaites was inaccessible. Too much sea ice was in the way." This is the primary reason.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>too much sea ice was in the way</answer>
<other>For question 6, the article states Ran initially captured the images ("Their findings were published...") and was later lost ("after one of its dives, Ran never showed up... The robot was lost").</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Ran</answer>
<other>For question 7, identical to question 1 and 4, the article states the persistence of features contradicted the assumption that melting smoothed topography.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>persistence of complex features and indentations contradicted the assumption that melting smoothed out underwater ice topography</answer>
<other>For question 8, the article states: "Dr. Wahlin and her colleagues were originally hoping to survey the bottom of the nearby Thwaites Glacier... Scientists have estimated that Thwaites's total collapse would increase global sea levels by about two feet over several centuries. When Dr. Wahlin and her team reached the frozen continent, however, Thwaites was inaccessible."</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Thwaites Glacier</answer>
<other>For question 9, the article states: "Understanding how they affect overall melting in response to ocean warming and other changes will require further study." This directly addresses the impact on understanding.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>requires further study to understand how they affect overall melting</answer>
<other>For question 10, the article states: "The bottom of the ice shelf could have turned out to be flat and featureless, which would have been a letdown." This was the potential misconception they risked encountering.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>the ice shelf underside being flat and featureless</answer>
