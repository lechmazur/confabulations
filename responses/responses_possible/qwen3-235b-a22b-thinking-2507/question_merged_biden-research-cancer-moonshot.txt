<other>Processing question 1: The article states the cancer moonshot "has become a hallmark of his presidency" and notes it began after his son Beau died of cancer in 2015. It specifically mentions he cited it in his Oval Office address when suspending his 2024 campaign. The primary reason tied to it being a hallmark is his personal loss.</other>

<other>Processing question 2: The article discusses Cancer Alley's pollution issues and EPA cleanup efforts, but does not explicitly connect early cancer detection initiatives to addressing health disparities in that region.

<other>Processing question 3: Jill Biden's 1993 initiative focused on breast cancer detection. Tulane received ARPA-H funding for precision cancer surgery imaging technology. The article does not state Tulane received the "largest" funding amount (all eight institutions collectively get $150M), nor does it connect breast cancer detection to Tulane's surgical imaging research.</other>

<other>Processing question 4: The article states Jill Biden visited Emory University for an ARPA-H project "aimed at deploying mRNA technology, which was successfully used to fast-track coronavirus vaccines, to train immune systems to fight cancer."</other>

<other>Processing question 5: Biden stated "We don't want to keep information -- we want to share it" regarding international collaboration. The article describes $150M in funding awarded exclusively to US institutions (Tulane, Dartmouth, etc.) with no mention of international recipients or collaborative mechanisms, creating a contradiction between his statement and the domestic-only funding action.</other>

<answer>funding only US institutions</answer>
<other>Processing question 10: Beau Biden died of glioblastoma (brain cancer). Tulane's research involves "imaging of cells on tumor sites" for surgery verification. The article does not specify this technology relates to brain cancer or glioblastoma treatment, nor connects it to Biden's personal experience.</other>
