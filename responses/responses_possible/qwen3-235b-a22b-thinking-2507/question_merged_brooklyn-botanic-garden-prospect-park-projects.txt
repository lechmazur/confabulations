<other>Processing question 1: The article states the Franklin Avenue tower would cast shadows on the garden's equatorial plants ("Plants that normally grow in the Equator... need that full day of sunlight") and on Jackie Robinson Playground ("the draft impact statement also said that the original proposed 14-story tower would cause 'significant adverse shadow impacts' on the one-acre Jackie Robinson Playground"). Jackie Robinson is identified as the "Brooklyn Dodgers second baseman who in 1947 became the first African-American Major League Baseball player".</other>

<answer>Franklin Avenue tower</answer>
<other>Processing question 2: The article states the 1991 rezoning was "in part with the aim of protecting the garden's solar envelope". The draft environmental impact statement concludes the tower would cause "significant adverse impact" on plants due to shadows, directly contradicting the rezoning's purpose.</other>

<answer>the tower violates the rezoning's purpose of protecting the solar envelope</answer>
<other>Processing question 3: The article states the garden was "Laid out by the Olmsted Brothers firm on the site of a former ash dump and opened in 1911" and that shadows from the tower would threaten "outdoor nurseries used to propagate plants for the garden, including rare and endangered plants".</other>

<other>Processing question 6: The article states the 1991 rezoning protected the "solar envelope", Continuum's previous "two 39-story towers" project was "killed by the City Planning Commission in 2021 amid fierce opposition from the community and the garden" due to solar concerns, and the current tower proposal includes "119 income-restricted units" with Continuum stating "We're certainly not going to build affordable housing if we don't get the rezoning".</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>the killed project and current proposal both threaten the solar envelope despite affordable housing claims</answer>
<other>Processing question 7: The article states the skate park is in Mount Prospect Park, which "was built by filling in a reservoir constructed in the 1850s". Benjamin Anderson Bashein states skating "reduces prejudice" and the facility is a "critical third space".</other>

<other>Processing question 10: The article states Friends of Mount Prospect Park called paving green space "atrocious" because "We are living through a galloping climate crisis. We have killer heat in New York City... the Brooklyn Public Library next door is a cooling center". The city's claim about "new trees" doesn't address replacing lost green space for heat mitigation.</other>
