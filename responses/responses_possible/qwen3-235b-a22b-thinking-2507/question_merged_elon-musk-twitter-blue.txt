<other>For question 1, the article states Musk eventually set Twitter Blue at $8/month. Jason Calacanis suggested $99/year (approximately $8.25/month), which is closest to Musk's decision.

<answer>Jason Calacanis</answer>
<other>For question 2, the article mentions the advertiser threats happened on Nov. 10 (one day after launch), which led Musk to turn off the service. This prevented further election interference as some results were still being tallied. However, the question asks about an event two days after launch, and the text doesn't mention any specific event on Nov. 11 that saved the platform from election interference.</other>
