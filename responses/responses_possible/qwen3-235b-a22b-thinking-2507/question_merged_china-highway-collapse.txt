<answer>Rapid expressway expansion correlates with increased frequency of infrastructure failures</answer>
<other>Question 5 asks for correlation between bridge achievements and weather vulnerability. The article states "By 2017, China had 81 of the world's 100 tallest bridges" and "Cloudbursts have periodically posed a problem," with examples like the Zhengzhou flood and two highway disasters, showing vulnerability despite construction achievements.</other>

<other>Question 10 asks how infrastructure scale contrasts with disaster vulnerability.
