<answer>Agriculture Department</answer>
<other>For question 4, the article states transmission is mainly mechanical (milk/machines), which Dr. Richt calls "good news" for containment focus, but dairy farm operations differ from swine farms with stricter biosecurity, making similar measures harder to implement.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>easier due to mechanical transmission focus; harder due to dairy farm operational differences vs swine farms</answer>
<other>For question 5, the article states the virus is "entrenched in wild birds, including waterfowl," and USDA claims "there is no wildlife reservoir," but experts note wild birds are a reservoir complicating eradication.</other>

<answer>other nations do not move animals between farms at the scale Americans do</answer>
<other>For question 7, the article describes the poultry industry suffering losses: "it resulted in the culling of 1.8 million birds" and Dr. Peacock states the dairy industry will "sink the poultry industry."</other>

<answer>poultry industry</answer>
<other>For question 8, the article states: "Genetic data suggest that the U.S. outbreak stemmed from a single spillover of the virus from birds into cattle and then spread," contradicting multiple transmission events.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>it stemmed from a single spillover event</answer>
<other>For question 9, the article states vaccinating cattle "might be a workable option" while human vaccination is "premature," noting animal vaccines can be more effective with ingredients not tolerated in humans.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>vaccinating cattle instead of humans</answer>
<other>For question 10, the article states: "Scientists have found the cattle version of the virus in blackbirds in Texas, suggesting that the birds could carry the virus to new farms," challenging cattle-only containment.</other>
