<other>For question 1, the article states EU regulations prompted Repsol's refinery overhaul and specifies requirements like sustainable aviation fuel percentages (2% in 2025, 70% by 2050). Repsol's retrofitting strategy directly responds to these mandates.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Repsol's retrofitting strategy is a direct response to EU regulations requiring increasing proportions of sustainable aviation fuel (2% in 2025, 70% by 2050) and similar motor vehicle fuel rules.</answer>
<other>For question 2, the article says Repsol claims flexibility in using various wastes but notes feedstock limits: "it's going to be very difficult to get enough oil" and "even if they took used oil from all the restaurants in Spain, it wouldn't be enough." This creates a paradox between claimed flexibility and actual scarcity.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Claimed flexibility to use various waste sources contradicts the scarcity of feedstock, as even all Spanish restaurant oil would be insufficient.</answer>
<other>For question 3, the article calls biofuels a "practical and relatively inexpensive solution" but also describes "dizzying complexity" in planning, global sourcing challenges, and transport emissions from ingredient collection. This shows a contradiction between perceived practicality and logistical hurdles.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Biofuels are deemed practical for using existing infrastructure, but face "dizzying complexity" in long-term planning and global sourcing logistics that undermine this practicality.</answer>
<other>For question 4, the article explicitly states EU requirements create complexity due to "other priorities, like protecting the food supply and tropical forests," causing "headache from the long-term planning and business management perspective."</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The 70% sustainable aviation fuel requirement by 2050 is complicated by other priorities like food supply and forest protection, creating "dizzying complexity" for long-term planning.</answer>
<other>For question 5, the article says biofuels give "green credentials with little effort" but notes environmentalists' skepticism about transport emissions from global ingredient sourcing, making the "little effort" claim ironic given the logistical burden.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Claiming "green credentials with little effort" is ironic because sourcing waste globally creates transport emissions and requires significant logistical effort.</answer>
<other>For question 6, the article states biofuels perform well in cold weather and separately mentions sourcing challenges, but never links cold-weather performance to sourcing issues. No contradiction is stated or inferable.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>For question 7, the article directly contrasts Repsol's approach: "some of its rivals have closed traditional oil refineries, but Repsol plans to gradually retrofit its facilities."</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Repsol is retrofitting refineries to produce greener fuels, while competitors have closed traditional oil refineries.</answer>
<other>For question 8, the article describes challenges from Chinese biodiesel imports (depressing prices), EU tariffs, and Shell suspending projects due to market conditions, threatening Repsol's competitive edge.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Global competition from cheap Chinese biodiesel imports and market volatility (e.g., Shell suspending projects) threaten Repsol's competitive edge.</answer>
<other>For question 9, the article explicitly states scarcity issues: "it's going to be very difficult to get enough oil," requiring imports, and notes "cooking oil and other waste have become valuable and even scarce commodities."</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Scarcity of waste ingredients like cooking oil may require global sourcing and imports, as even all Spanish restaurant oil would be insufficient.</answer>
<other>For question 10, identical to question 3: the article presents biofuels as a "practical solution" but details logistical complexities (global sourcing, planning headaches) that contradict this claim.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Biofuels are called a "practical solution" for using existing infrastructure, but face "dizzying complexity" in planning and global sourcing that undermines practicality.</answer>
