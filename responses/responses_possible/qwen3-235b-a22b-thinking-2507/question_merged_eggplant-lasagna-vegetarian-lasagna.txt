<other>For question 1, the article mentions freezing roasted eggplant planks and separately references Sam Sifton's "mandatory 6 a.m. fly fishing lessons" as a phrase staff repeats, but no connection is made between freezing ingredients and fly fishing. The freezing is part of the author's time-saving strategy, while fly fishing is presented as an unrelated mandatory activity. No reflection is stated.</other>

<other>For question 8, the chicken adobo section emphasizes regional variations and personalization ("No adobo is ever the same"), but the "appearance of effortlessness" statement relates to planning for spontaneous-looking meals.
