<other>For question 1, I need to find how Pierce's personal relationships influenced business dealings with Lipsey. The article states they grew close, Lipsey's wife became friends with Pierce's mother, and after Pierce's mother died, Lipsey said he promised to "always be there for her family." This personal connection led to the $10 million loan deal for the W Hotel, which later deteriorated into Lipsey seizing control of the hotel and legal disputes. The friendship ended completely.</other>

<other>For question 2, I need to compare Pierce's portrayal of the NFT gallery versus reality.

<other>For question 3, I need to find the disconnect between Pierce's public persona and private actions. The article shows he promised to "revitalize the local economy" with "crypto magic" and "Puertopia" but his ventures like the W Hotel remained closed with "windows smashed and floors covered in mold," many properties were abandoned, and there's "no clear evidence" tech entrepreneurs helped the local economy.</other>

<answer>$17,000 lounge chair</answer>
<other>For question 6, I need to connect the yacht's fate to his business ventures.

<other>For question 7, I need to connect the birthday celebration to losing the Vieques investment.
