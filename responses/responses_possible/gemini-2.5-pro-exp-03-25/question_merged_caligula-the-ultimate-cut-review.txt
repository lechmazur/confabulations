<answer>Tinto Brass's objection.</answer>
<other>Processing question 3. The article mentions the removal of the original music and its replacement with an "anodyne" score goes against the "very essence of the original 'Caligula'", which portrayed madness via madness. The stated goal is to "legitimize 'Caligula' as a portrayal of an anarchic free spirit". While the anodyne music might clash with the film's chaotic essence, the article doesn't explicitly state *how* this removal contradicts the goal of legitimizing the *portrayal of the protagonist*. It's more about contradicting the film's overall original feel.</other>

<answer>The Penthouse archive.</answer>
<other>Processing question 9. The article states enduring interest is driven by the "belief that a masterpiece lurks within the mangled original release". Negovan's cut is an attempt to prove this theory, thus mirroring that aspect of its reception/legacy.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The belief that a masterpiece lurks within the mangled original version.</answer>
<other>Processing question 10. The intention is to "legitimize" the portrayal. The article describes the original's essence (partly retained) as including "disjointed storytelling". However, the article doesn't explicitly describe the narrative structure of the *new cut* in enough detail to state how *it* contradicts the intention. It mentions some changes but doesn't offer a structural analysis or state that the structure itself undermines the goal.</other>
