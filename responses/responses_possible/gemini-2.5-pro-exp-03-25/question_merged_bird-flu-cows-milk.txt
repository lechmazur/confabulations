<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Genomic sequencing suggested that infected cows passed the virus to other species on farms, and identified wild blackbirds miles away carrying a virus matching farm samples, raising the possibility that wild birds might be involved in transporting the virus between farms or introducing it to other wild animals.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It suggests the infection may start in the upper respiratory tract before moving to the mammary glands, which appear to be the primary site of viral replication.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that testing milk samples may not be enough to give officials a full picture of asymptomatic spread and that the respiratory route cannot be completely ruled out.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that even strict controls on the movement of cows and farm equipment may not be enough to stamp out the outbreak because other species can become infected and potentially spread the virus.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It implies that wild birds might be involved in transporting the virus between farms or introducing it to other wild animals.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Wild blackbirds</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk, suggesting testing milk samples may not give a full picture of asymptomatic spread.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Genomic analysis showed the virus spread to other species (cats, raccoons, wild birds), suggesting that controls focused only on cows and farm equipment may not be sufficient to stop the outbreak.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses than obviously sick ones.</answer>
