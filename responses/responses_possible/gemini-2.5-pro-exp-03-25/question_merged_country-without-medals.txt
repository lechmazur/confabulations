<other>Analyzing Question 1: The question asks about the relationship between population size and Olympic success using Bangladesh, Jamaica, and Grenada. The article states Bangladesh is the most populous country without a medal. Jamaica, a smaller country, has many medals by focusing on track. Grenada, a very small country, has medals. This suggests population size isn't the only factor; large size doesn't guarantee success, and small size doesn't preclude it, especially with strategic focus.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Population size is not the sole determinant of Olympic success; a large population does not guarantee medals (e.g., Bangladesh), while smaller countries can achieve success (e.g., Jamaica, Grenada), sometimes by focusing on specific strengths.</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 2: The question asks about the long-term effects of winning a medal on sports infrastructure, citing Costa Rica and Dominica. For Costa Rica, Sylvia Poll's medal led to more pools and swimmers. For Dominica, Thea LaFond-Gadson hopes her medal will spur the government to build a needed track. This suggests winning can boost participation and potentially lead to infrastructure improvements.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Winning an Olympic medal can lead to increased participation in sports and potentially spur investment in sports infrastructure, as seen with more swimming pools in Costa Rica after its first medal and the hope for a new track in Dominica following its first gold.</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 3: The question asks about the disparity between Cuba and India, countries with similar populations but different government investment levels. The article states Cuba (11 million pop.) has 235 medals due to deliberate government spending, while India (1.4 billion pop.) has 35. Hungary (10 million pop.) also has many medals (521) due to government spending. This highlights that government investment significantly impacts Olympic success, potentially outweighing population size.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The article highlights that deliberate government spending on sports can lead to significantly greater Olympic success, as Cuba (with 235 medals) and Hungary (with 521 medals) far outperform India (with 35 medals) despite having much smaller populations, suggesting investment is a key factor.</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 4: The question asks about the potential for smaller countries to succeed via targeted investment, using Jamaica and Bolivia. Jamaica is cited as an example of a smaller country winning many medals by focusing on its strength (track and field). Bolivia is mentioned as studying how to focus its efforts on sports it does best to improve its medal chances. This implies targeted investment is a viable strategy for smaller nations.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The article implies that smaller countries can enhance their chances of Olympic success by strategically focusing investment on specific sports where they excel, using Jamaica's success in track and field as an example and noting Bolivia's consideration of this strategy.</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 5: The question asks about the potential for countries with no medals to succeed through strategic investment, using Bolivia and Jamaica. Bolivia (no medals) is considering focusing on specific sports. Jamaica (many medals) is presented as a model for how focusing on strengths (track and field) can yield success for a smaller nation. This suggests strategic investment is a potential pathway for non-medaling countries.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that countries without Olympic medals, like Bolivia, might achieve success by adopting a strategy of strategic investment in specific sports where they have potential, similar to how Jamaica achieved success by focusing on track and field.</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 6: The question asks about the relationship between economic status and Olympic success, using Nepal and Monaco. Nepal, a very poor country, struggles with funding and lacks medals. Monaco, the wealthiest country per capita, also lacks medals despite numerous appearances, partly due to a small talent pool. This shows that while poverty hinders success, wealth does not guarantee it; other factors are also crucial.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The article portrays that while low economic status and lack of funding (like Nepal's) make Olympic success difficult, high economic status (like Monaco's) does not guarantee medals, suggesting wealth is not the sole factor and issues like small population size can also be limitations.</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 7: The question asks about the potential impact of winning a medal on future sports policies, citing Dominica and St. Lucia. The article states Dominica's medalist hopes her win will motivate government officials to build a track. It mentions St. Lucia's first medal but doesn't detail any impact on its policies. This implies a win can potentially influence policy, particularly infrastructure, but it's not guaranteed or detailed for all cases.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The article implies that winning an Olympic medal can potentially influence future sports policies, particularly regarding infrastructure development, as expressed by the hope of Dominica's medalist, although no specific policy impact is mentioned for St. Lucia.</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 8: The question asks which country has the most Olympic appearances without a medal, despite a high GDP per capita. The article explicitly states Monaco has the most appearances (32) without a medal and also has the highest GDP per capita in the world.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Monaco</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 9: The question asks how many times more medals Cuba has won than India. Cuba has 235 medals, India has 35. Calculation: 235 / 35 â‰ˆ 6.71. The article provides the numbers needed for this calculation.</other>

<answer>6.7</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 10: The question asks how many more medals the US has than the combined total of the next four countries. US medals = 2,975. Next four (Soviet Union, Germany, Great Britain, France) combined = 1,204 + 1,058 + 955 + 898 = 4,115. The US has 2,975 medals, which is less than the combined total of 4,115 for the next four countries. The question asks how many *more* medals the US has. Since the premise (US having more than the combined next four) is incorrect based on the article's data, the answer should be N/A according to the instructions.</other>
