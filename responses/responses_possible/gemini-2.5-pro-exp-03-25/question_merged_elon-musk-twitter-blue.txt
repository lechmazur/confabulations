<other>Calacanis suggested $99/year, and Musk decided on $8/month, which is $96/year.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states the launch was delayed until Nov 9, the day *after* the US midterm elections (Nov 8), preventing interference *during* the election. It does not mention an event *two days after* the launch that prevented interference.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Musk initially downplayed the risks of impersonation and urged against drastic reactions short of "death or serious injury," but the immediate financial threat from advertisers pulling ads prompted him to quickly shut down the service, overriding his earlier stance.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Both involved the negative consequences of impersonation on Twitter; La Russa's lawsuit highlighted the harm from impersonation leading to the original verification system, while employees warned Musk that selling verification would recreate and amplify this exact problem, undermining the system's purpose.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Musk wanted a quiet launch partly to manage potential chaos and system load, but the chaos that ensued stemmed directly from the service's flawed concept (paid impersonation), forcing its shutdown regardless of the launch's quietness.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Musk wanted to end the "two-tiered class system" of verification; the chaotic rollout made checkmarks signify "little more than confusion," effectively destroying their status value and thus eliminating the perceived class distinction by making the symbol meaningless.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Musk hated the original verification system as a "lords & peasants system," but his attempt to "democratize" it by selling checkmarks resulted in chaos, impersonation, and damage to the platform's trustworthiness and utility, arguably creating a worse situation.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Musk stated action would only be taken for "death or serious injury," but the actual fallout involving widespread impersonation, potential election interference, and significant financial threats from advertisers forced him to shut down Blue, demonstrating his initial threshold for intervention was unrealistic.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Musk aimed for Blue subscriptions to reduce reliance on advertising, but his panicked reaction to advertiser threats (shutting down Blue) showed the company's continued critical dependence on ad revenue and that his strategy was flawed because the new product immediately jeopardized the existing, essential revenue stream.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The widespread impersonation and chaos following the rollout fulfilled predictions by employees like Esther Crawford, who warned accounts "will be hijacked," and another who called the project an "obvious train wreck."</answer>
