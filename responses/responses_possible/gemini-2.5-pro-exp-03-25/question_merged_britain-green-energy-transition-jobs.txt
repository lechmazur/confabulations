<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>While forecasting the creation of 650,000 jobs through its clean energy push, the Labour Party's plans to curtail oil and gas production risk costing more jobs in that sector than green energy might create, particularly in the near term.</answer>
<other>The article contrasts the 650,000 job forecast with warnings about job losses in oil and gas, highlighting the potential negative impact despite the positive forecast.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Labour promises lower bills, but analysts warn the proposals are unlikely to be cheap, and a rush to build renewables could push up costs, potentially leading to increased electric bills for consumers.</answer>

<answer>A rush to build renewable energy sources could push up costs, which might then be passed on to consumers through increased electric bills.</answer>
<other>The article cites analysts and David Reiner on the potential for increased costs and bills.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The plan could highlight or exacerbate the UK's current lack of a domestic supply chain for developing wind or solar energy.</answer>
<other>Based on Dieter Helm's comment about the UK lacking the supply chain.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Labour's plans risk costing jobs among the approximately 200,000 linked to oil and gas, while only 34,000 jobs are currently linked to renewables in the North Sea energy sector, raising concerns that green job creation may not compensate for losses quickly enough.</answer>
<other>The article provides these figures and mentions the concern about the pace of job transition.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Higher costs, which have already risen 40% for offshore wind farms recently, make achieving Labour's renewable energy goals more expensive and challenging, potentially hindering development if pricing targets are not realistic.</answer>
<other>The article mentions the 40% cost increase and the failed auction as evidence of the tougher environment.</other>
