<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>A single shot of TIPs may keep H.I.V. at low levels permanently, potentially simplifying treatment adherence compared to the twice-yearly shots required for lenacapavir.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It might make it harder for people to transmit H.I.V. to others.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The inability to obtain consent from individuals who might inadvertently acquire TIPs if they spread from treated patients.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>TIPs interfere with H.I.V.'s life cycle by stealing essential proteins and outcompeting the virus for resources, rather than directly attacking a specific viral protein like protease inhibitors do.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The potential for permanent integration into the patient's DNA, leading to irreversible side effects and the possibility of spreading to others without consent.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>They were engineered to be packaged into new viral shells more efficiently, resulting in three times more TIPs being released from infected cells than H.I.V. viruses.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>If unexpected side effects occur, it may not be possible to remove the TIPs from the patient's body.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The strategy of creating "cheating viruses" that interfere with the original virus might be applicable to other viruses.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Individuals who did not consent to the treatment could potentially become infected with the engineered TIPs if they spread from treated patients.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>TIPs act as molecular mimics that interfere with H.I.V.'s life cycle and compete for its resources, whereas traditional drugs like protease inhibitors directly attack components of the virus.</answer>
