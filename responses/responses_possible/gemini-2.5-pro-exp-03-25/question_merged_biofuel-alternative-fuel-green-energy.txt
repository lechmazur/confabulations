<other>Reading and analyzing the article to answer each question based *only* on the provided text.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Repsol's strategy of retrofitting refineries to produce biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuel, is a direct response aimed at meeting the European Union's regulations that mandate increasing proportions of sustainable aviation fuel in jet fuel supplied to airports, rising to 70 percent by 2050.</answer>
<other>The article states Repsol's makeover was prompted by EU regulations and mentions the specific SAF requirements.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The plant is claimed to be flexible in using various waste inputs, but the article highlights a potential overall scarcity and limit on the amount of suitable feedstock available, creating a paradox between the theoretical flexibility of input type and the practical limitation of input quantity.</answer>
<other>The article mentions flexibility claimed by Mayoral and scarcity mentioned by analysts like Gelder and environmentalists.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Biofuels are perceived as practical because they can use existing infrastructure like pumps and tanks, but this contradicts the logistical challenges of sourcing sufficient waste ingredients, which may need global transportation (creating emissions) and face scarcity, potentially undermining their practicality and environmental benefits.</answer>
<other>The article mentions biofuels as a practical solution using existing infrastructure but also details sourcing challenges and environmental concerns about transport emissions.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The requirement for 70% sustainable aviation fuel by 2050 creates a challenge due to the potential scarcity of feedstocks, the need to source ingredients globally (which creates emissions), competition for these resources, and market volatility, making it difficult to scale production sufficiently and economically to meet the high mandate.</answer>
<other>The article links the EU mandate to challenges like feedstock limits, sourcing issues, and market conditions.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The irony lies in biofuels offering customers "green credentials with little effort" (using existing infrastructure) while potentially requiring significant logistical effort and generating emissions through the global sourcing and transportation of scarce waste ingredients, which could undermine the claimed environmental benefits.</answer>
<other>The article contrasts the "little effort" for customers with the sourcing difficulties and environmental concerns raised about transport.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions the fuel performs well in cold weather and separately mentions logistical challenges in sourcing ingredients, but it does not draw a connection or contradiction between these two points.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Repsol's strategy involves transforming its existing refineries to produce greener fuels, whereas some of its rivals have chosen to close their traditional oil refineries.</answer>
<other>The article explicitly contrasts Repsol's strategy ("not to close our refineries but to transform them") with rivals who "have closed traditional oil refineries".</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Challenges include competition from imports of cheap biodiesel (specifically mentioning China and alleged dumping), worries about market oversupply depressing prices, and actions by other large energy companies potentially entering or expanding in the biofuel market.</answer>
<other>The article discusses Chinese imports, EU investigation, falling prices, and Shell's (paused) project as competitive factors.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests production could be limited by the scarcity of waste ingredients like cooking oil, noting there's a "limit on the amount of feedstock," that these materials have become scarce commodities, and that sourcing may need to extend globally, potentially impacting volume and cost.</answer>
<other>The article directly addresses feedstock limits, scarcity, and sourcing needs affecting production.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Biofuels are claimed as a practical solution partly because they utilize existing infrastructure, but this potentially contradicts the significant logistical challenges in sourcing sufficient waste ingredients globally, which involves transport emissions and faces issues of scarcity, questioning the overall practicality and environmental soundness.</answer>
<other>This question is identical to question 3. The answer reflects the contradiction between ease of use/distribution and difficulty/impact of sourcing raw materials mentioned in the text.</other>
