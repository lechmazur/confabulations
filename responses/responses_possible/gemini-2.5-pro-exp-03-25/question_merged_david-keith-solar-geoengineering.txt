<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Taking drastic action to engineer the stratosphere, potentially by spraying a pollutant (sulfur dioxide), to repair the climate.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Keith believes the risks are quantitatively small compared to the benefits and well understood, while Dr. Pierrehumbert considers solar geoengineering a grave threat and unsafe to deploy, with even research being dangerous.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>His 1992 paper raised questions about who should authorize the use of these technologies and who is liable if something goes wrong, which are central governance concerns also raised by critics.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>He cites the natural cooling effect of the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption as validation for his idea, and his observation of climate change impacts (like shrinking glaciers) motivates his belief that intentional alteration is needed to restore the planet.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>His personal windfall was about $72 million, while the potential cost of his new academic program could reach as much as $100 million.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Seeing a dramatically shrunk glacier during the hike served as a visual reminder of global warming's impact and confirmed his belief in the need for solar geoengineering, strengthening his motivation.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>He believes nations should stop burning fossil fuels entirely, but also advocates for solar geoengineering as an additional measure to lower temperatures.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions his dyslexia, late reading, becoming a voracious reader, and eventually studying experimental physics, but does not state a relationship or connection between these facts.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>After protests led to an experiment being called off, he stated that a lesson learned was that "if we do this again, we won't be open in the same way," suggesting a potential reduction in transparency.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Potentially massive temperature rise over 5 to 10 years, comparable to the climate impact of the dinosaur-killing impactor.</answer>
