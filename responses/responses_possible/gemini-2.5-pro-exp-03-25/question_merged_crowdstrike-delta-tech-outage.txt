<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>It contributed to a misleading narrative that CrowdStrike is responsible for Delta's IT decisions and response to the outage.</answer>
<other>The article states CrowdStrike's letter mentioned the threat of a lawsuit "has contributed to a misleading narrative that CrowdStrike is responsible for Delta's IT decisions and response to the outage." The letter also asked Delta why it turned down help, implying this refusal is part of the narrative issue.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Details likely to emerge from the investigation about why Delta struggled more than others could weaken Delta's claims against CrowdStrike.</answer>
<other>The article explicitly states, "Details of why the airline struggled more than others are likely to emerge from an investigation started by the Department of Transportation after the outage." This suggests findings about Delta's own vulnerabilities or response could impact its legal position.</other>

<answer>The estimated $500 million financial impact is significantly larger than the less than $10 million liability limit proposed by CrowdStrike.</answer>

<answer>Delta leaned more heavily on cancellations than its peers.</answer>
<other>The article states, "Aviation experts told The Times that Delta had leaned more heavily on cancellations than delays" compared to peers like American and United who "rebounded faster". It doesn't provide specific percentages for peers.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states about 5,000 flights were canceled and about three in four of the *remaining* flights were delayed. It does not provide the total number of scheduled flights or the absolute number of delayed flights, making it impossible to calculate a precise ratio based solely on the text provided.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Delta canceled about 37% of its schedule, while Southwest canceled more than a third of its schedule during its 2022 disruption.</answer>
<other>The article provides "about 37 percent" for Delta and "more than a third" for Southwest.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article provides the financial impact for Delta ($500 million) and the percentage of affected flights for both Delta (about 37%) and Southwest (more than a third), but it does not provide the financial cost of Southwest's 2022 disruption, making the requested comparison impossible.</other>
