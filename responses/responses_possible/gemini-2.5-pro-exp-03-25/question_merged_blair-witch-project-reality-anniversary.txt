<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Widespread mobile internet access / Social media</answer>
<other>The article implies that the actors' ability to maintain "ultralow profiles" and the directors' ability to control the narrative on the "burgeoning internet" were key. Widespread mobile internet and social media would allow for instant sharing of information and photos, likely exposing the actors and debunking the "missing" narrative quickly.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states the GPS tracking was used by the directors to provoke "real fear, frustration and panic" in the actors, contributing to the authenticity of their performances. However, it does not state that the *use of GPS itself* blurred reality *for the audience*. The audience's blurring of reality stemmed from the marketing and found-footage presentation, not the behind-the-scenes tracking method.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states the filmmakers capitalized on confirmation bias via their website. It contrasts this with today's "algorithm-fueled echo chambers that reinforce our beliefs" and contribute to polarization. While it describes the current landscape where confirmation bias operates differently and more intensely, it does not explicitly state *how* leveraging it today for a film project might *backfire*. It implies a loss of control and potential entanglement with broader, unrelated conspiracy theories or polarization, but doesn't state this outcome directly as a backfire.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The actors filming all the footage themselves</answer>
<other>The article highlights that the actors "actually wielded the film's cameras" and filmed "all the footage used in the movie" without a script, leading to authentic reactions. This production technique, combined with the "documentary" marketing, missing posters, faux documentary, and the relatively naive state of the "burgeoning internet" (where the website served as a novel discussion hub), created the unique conditions for belief.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Josh's comment identifies the camera as creating a "filtered reality" where one can "pretend everything is not quite the way it is," mirroring the article's conclusion that modern media consumption involves pervasive filtering, performance, and questioning of reality, leading to increasingly unique, less communal versions of the world.</answer>
<other>Josh's realization within the film directly speaks to the mediation and alteration of reality through a lens, which the article argues has become a default mode of experiencing the world via modern technology and media, resulting in fragmented and performative realities.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Both involve blurring lines between fact and fiction/entertainment, leveraging confirmation bias, and fostering confusion or diverging perceptions of reality among the audience/public.</answer>
<other>The film intentionally blurred fact and fiction for entertainment, using marketing and a website that played on confirmation bias. Professor Edgerly describes news moving "away from the facts" towards entertainment due to commercial pressures, also fostering confusion and leveraging confirmation bias (people believing news aligning with their views), leading to fragmented understandings of reality.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Their appreciation for shows like "In Search Of..." informed their goal to tap into a "childhood state of mind, when the fear of the unknown overlaps with an openness to believe in the seemingly unbelievable," using a folk mystery structure to evoke primal fear.</answer>
<other>The article explicitly links their fandom of these shows, which explored mysteries like Bigfoot and UFOs, to their strategy of evoking childhood fears associated with the unknown and the potential to believe in the unbelievable.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The human-driven creation and presentation of entirely fabricated footage as authentic reality</answer>
<other>The film involved humans meticulously crafting a fake scenario and presenting the resulting footage as real, fooling audiences unfamiliar with such manipulation. This parallels modern concerns about AI generating fabricated content (images, video, text) that appears authentic, similarly designed to deceive or manipulate perception, highlighting a continuity in the challenge of discerning manufactured reality, whether human- or AI-created.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The filmmakers' worry that their fabricated "true story" was too convincing foreshadows the current environment where fabricated narratives, like conspiracy theories, are easily believed and amplified within polarized groups, contributing to real-world distrust and division.</answer>
<other>Their specific concern about the fiction bleeding into reality (e.g., police inquiry) reflects the broader societal issue discussed in the article, where distinguishing manufactured narratives from facts is difficult and contributes to polarization and the existence of "two realities."</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The website served as a central hub for "the curious" to discuss and receive reinforcing information about the film's mythology, capitalizing on confirmation bias and creating a self-selected community around a specific narrative, thus acting as an early, manually curated precursor to modern algorithm-fueled echo chambers that reinforce beliefs.</answer>
<other>While not algorithm-driven, the website gathered interested individuals, fostered discussion among them, and provided more tailored content, creating a feedback loop of belief similar in function (though not technology) to today's echo chambers described as reinforcing beliefs and isolating users.</other>
