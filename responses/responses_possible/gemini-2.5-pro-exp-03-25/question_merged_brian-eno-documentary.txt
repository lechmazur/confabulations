<answer>Brian Eno</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states Hustwit used a proprietary software program. It mentions Eno's interest in generative music was inspired by Steve Reich, and separately mentions 1950s composers using chance, but it does not state that Hustwit's software itself was inspired by a 1950s musical experiment.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Hustwit knew he couldn't hook Eno with half-measures; Eno disliked the linearity of conventional biographies and wanted a form reflecting that lives are stories we rewrite without a single reliable narrative, which the limited options of "Clue" or "Mosaic" wouldn't achieve.</answer>
<other>The article contrasts the limited endings/perspectives of "Clue" and "Mosaic" with the vast possibilities of Hustwit's film, implying the former were insufficient "half-measures" for Eno's views on narrative.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The anecdote shows extreme hostility towards being filmed ("Keep that bloody camera off me," flipping off the cameraman), creating an expectation that he would refuse any participation, contrary to his eventual agreement to Hustwit's project under specific conditions.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>free of artistry and taste</answer>
<other>Wolff used this phrase to describe the results of using chance procedures, which aligns with Eno's and Hustwit's use of systems that generate outcomes somewhat independently of direct artistic control.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Agreeing to film only his hands and feet shows a willingness to negotiate the terms of representation and control how he was depicted, rather than a complete refusal to be documented, indicating a specific objection to conventional methods rather than total aversion.</answer>
