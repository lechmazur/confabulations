<other>I will read the article carefully and extract the facts needed to answer each question. I will ensure that the answers are based solely on the provided text and adhere strictly to the required format.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>To sidestep regulatory scrutiny while trying to get ahead in A.I.</answer>
<other>The article explicitly states this reason, citing three people involved in such agreements and a quote from Justin Johnson.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Google licensed the technology and hired employees without becoming the owner of the firm, unlike a traditional acquisition where the firm is bought outright.</answer>
<other>The article contrasts the licensing/hiring structure with typical outright purchases, noting the intent is to avoid scrutiny associated with acquisitions.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states Character.AI investors made a 2.5x return in two years, calling it a "fast return," but it does not provide information on the "typical timeframe" for venture capital investments in Silicon Valley for comparison.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>35:1</answer>
<other>The article states roughly 70 employees joined Microsoft and just two stayed at Inflection. 70 divided by 2 is 35.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article provides the licensing deal value ($3 billion) and private valuation ($1 billion) only for Character.AI. It mentions the licensing deal value for Inflection ($650 million) and Adept (at least $330 million) and the amount raised by them ($1.5 billion and $414 million, respectively), but not their private valuations. Therefore, a comparison of discrepancies cannot be made.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The total spent on licensing deals mentioned is $3 billion (Google/Character.AI) + $650 million (Microsoft/Inflection) + at least $330 million (Amazon/Adept), summing to over $3.98 billion. However, the article only provides the previous valuation for Character.AI ($1 billion) and not for Inflection or Adept. Therefore, a comparison cannot be made.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Noam Shazeer's ownership percentage (30% to 40%) is higher than the percentage of Character.AI employees joining Google (roughly 20%).</answer>
<other>The article states Shazeer owns 30-40% and roughly 20% of employees joined Google.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article provides the deal value and number/proportion of employees for Google/Character.AI ($3B / ~20% of employees) and Microsoft/Inflection ($650M / ~70 employees). For Amazon/Adept, it gives the deal value (at least $330M) but only says "many" employees joined. The total number of employees at Character.AI is not given, preventing calculation of the exact number joining Google. Therefore, a definitive comparison of the ratios cannot be made.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions specific returns for investors in Character.AI (2.5x), Adept (most got money back), and Inflection (reimbursed from $650M after investing $1.5B, implying a loss). It does not provide enough information to calculate an average return across all venture capital firms involved in these deals.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Character.AI</answer>
<other>The article states that after the Google deal, "What remains of Character.AI will continue operating without its founders and investors."</other>
