<other>Analyzing Question 1: The question asks how the shortage illustrates the impact of social media on supply chains, considering Iceland's specific characteristics (geography, agriculture). The article mentions the TikTok trend causing the shortage, Iceland being an isolated island making imports expensive, and its reliance on geothermal greenhouses for produce.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The social media trend caused a sudden surge in demand for cucumbers that overwhelmed Iceland's local supply from greenhouses; the country's isolation as an island made importing replacements more expensive.</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 2: The question asks how the craze highlights challenges for self-sustaining agriculture in isolation. The article discusses Iceland's pride in self-sustaining agriculture (greenhouses) and its isolation. The craze caused a shortage, showing the system couldn't meet the sudden demand, and imports were costly due to isolation.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The craze showed that Iceland's self-sustaining agricultural system struggled to cope with a sudden demand surge, and its isolation made importing to cover the shortfall expensive.</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 3: The question asks about vulnerabilities of isolated agricultural systems to external influences (like social media). The article shows the TikTok trend (external influence) caused a shortage in Iceland's isolated system because local production couldn't keep up and imports were difficult/costly.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The shortage demonstrated that Iceland's isolated agricultural system is vulnerable to sudden demand surges driven by external influences like social media, leading to scarcity when local production cannot meet the spike and importing is costly.</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 4: The question asks how the craze illustrates complexities of food supply management in isolation. The article mentions balancing local production with demand, the difficulty/expense of imports due to isolation, and the need for emergency imports (Netherlands) when the craze overwhelmed local supply.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The craze highlighted the difficulty of managing supply when a sudden demand surge outstrips local production capacity in an isolated country where importing replacements is expensive, necessitating emergency shipments.</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 5: The question asks how the shortage demonstrates challenges for self-sufficiency in a small population. The article mentions Iceland's small population (over 380,000) provides "little wiggle room" for demand surges and that "a few people can have a lot of influence."</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The shortage showed that in a small population, there is little flexibility ("wiggle room") to absorb sudden demand surges, meaning trends adopted by relatively few people can overwhelm the local supply system.</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 6: The question asks about the timing intersection of the trend and production cycles. The article explicitly states the fad hit during a "small lull in the yield of the crop" for cucumbers.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The fad hit during a small lull in the yield of the cucumber crop.</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 7: The question asks how the commitment to reducing carbon footprints contributed to scarcity. The article states Icelanders prefer local food to reduce carbon footprint, reinforcing reliance on local production. When this was overwhelmed, the usual preference against imports contributed to the scarcity.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Consumers' preference for locally grown foods to reduce their carbon footprint led to heavy reliance on local production, leaving little buffer and contributing to scarcity when that supply was overwhelmed by sudden demand.</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 8: The question asks about the connection between geothermal power and vulnerability to social media trends. The article mentions geothermal greenhouses enable local production but doesn't state that geothermal power *itself* makes the system vulnerable to trends. The vulnerability stems from reliance on local supply + isolation + demand spikes.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 9: The question asks how the shortage challenged Iceland's reputation for self-sufficiency. The article states Iceland prides itself on self-sufficiency but had to get an emergency shipment from the Netherlands due to the shortage.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The shortage required an emergency import of cucumbers from the Netherlands, demonstrating that its self-sufficiency could be disrupted by sudden demand surges exceeding local production.</answer>
<other>Analyzing Question 10: The question asks how the trend exposed limitations of the greenhouse system. The article shows the system couldn't rapidly adapt to the large demand spike, especially as it coincided with a production lull and a CO2 shortage.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The trend exposed the greenhouse system's limited ability to quickly adapt to or absorb sudden large spikes in consumer demand, particularly when coinciding with production lulls and other resource shortages.</answer>
