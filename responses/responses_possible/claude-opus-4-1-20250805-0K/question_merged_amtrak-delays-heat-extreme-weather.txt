<other>Let me analyze the article for information about weather-related delays and heat-related delays.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article doesn't provide enough data to calculate ratios for all fiscal years to determine when the peak occurred.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article states heat delays were 530 hours in 2018 and nearly 1,200 hours in 2023. That's about 670 hours increase over 5 years. If this rate continues for another 5 years to 2028, it would be approximately 1,870 hours, but I cannot make this calculation as the question asks for a prediction based on a trend, which requires inference beyond what's directly stated.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>approximately 670 hours</answer>

<other>The article states nearly 1,200 hours in 2023 and 530 hours in 2018, so 1,200 - 530 = 670 hours.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article doesn't provide the full distance of the Northeast Corridor or the normal travel time at top speed.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>approximately 7.6 times</answer>

<other>4,010 hours total weather delays in 2023 divided by 530 hours heat delays in 2018 = approximately 7.6 times.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>Heat delays in Northeast went from 83 hours in 2018 to more than 230 hours in 2023. While I could calculate when it would reach 500 hours, this requires projecting a trend which is inference beyond what's directly stated.</other>
