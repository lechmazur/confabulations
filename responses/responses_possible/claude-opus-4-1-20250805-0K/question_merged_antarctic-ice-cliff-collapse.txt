<other>Let me analyze each question based solely on the article content.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article doesn't explicitly explain how the Thwaites Glacier study provides insights into broader West Antarctic ice sheet stability, though it mentions Thwaites is among the least stable.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article doesn't directly state the significance of focusing on the ice shelf for understanding ice cliff collapse potential.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article doesn't discuss how the Thwaites study contributes to understanding ice cliff collapse in other Antarctic regions.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>Dr. Alley mentions insufficient observations and that ice can collapse quickly and be missed, but doesn't explicitly state the consequences.</other>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article doesn't explicitly discuss how the findings challenge previous assumptions about stability.</other>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Dr. DeConto</answer>

<other>The article states Dr. DeConto was among researchers who first proposed ice-cliff instability could spell ruin for West Antarctica.</other>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>the glacier's ice started flowing more quickly out to sea</answer>

<other>The article states this faster flow prevented cliffs from becoming so tall as to trigger runaway breakdown.</other>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>observations of how ice behaves when it fractures</answer>

<other>Dr. Alley specifically states scientists don't have enough observations of how ice behaves when it fractures.</other>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions emissions climbing to extremely high levels but doesn't specify what implicit assumption about fossil fuel usage underlies the worst-case scenarios.</other>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>once the shelf was removed, the glacier's ice started flowing more quickly out to sea. This prevented the cliffs at the end of the glacier from becoming so tall as to trigger a runaway breakdown</answer>

<other>The article indicates faster flow prevents cliffs from becoming tall enough for runaway breakdown.</other>
