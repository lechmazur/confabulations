<other>I need to carefully analyze each question based solely on the article provided.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Genomic sequencing suggested that on some farms infected cows passed the virus on to other species, including cats and raccoons, and wild blackbirds found 5-8 miles from a Texas farm carried a virus closely matching that on farms in Texas and Kansas, raising the possibility that wild birds might transport the virus between farms or introduce it to other wild animals</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The finding suggests the infection may start in the upper respiratory tract where modest levels of virus accumulate before moving to the mammary glands, which appear to be the primary site of viral replication</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk, suggesting that testing milk samples may not give officials a full picture of asymptomatic spread</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The virus spread widely to cats and raccoons on farms, meaning that even strict controls on the movement of cows and farm equipment may not be enough to stamp out the outbreak</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Wild blackbirds found 5-8 miles from an affected Texas farm carried a virus closely matching that on farms in Texas and Kansas, raising the possibility that wild birds might transport the virus between farms or introduce it to other wild animals</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Wild blackbirds</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Genomic sequencing suggested infected cows passed the virus to cats and raccoons on farms, and wild blackbirds carried matching virus strains, meaning strict controls on cow and equipment movement may not be enough to stamp out the outbreak</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses than obviously sick ones</answer>
