<other>Let me analyze each question based solely on the article provided.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Just one shot of TIPs may keep H.I.V. at low levels permanently, while lenacapavir requires twice-yearly shots</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It might make it harder for people to transmit H.I.V. to others</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Doctors cannot receive consent from anyone else who is infected with TIPs if people with TIPs can spread them to others</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<other>The article doesn't directly compare the mechanism of action advantage of TIPs over protease inhibitors. It mentions protease inhibitors prevent a protein from activating H.I.V., and TIPs work by stealing proteins and outcompeting H.I.V., but doesn't state which mechanism is more advantageous.</other>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>If TIPs have unexpected side effects, it may not be possible to remove them</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>TIPs were engineered to do a better job of entering the shells, allowing cells to release three times more TIPs than H.I.V. viruses</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>If they turn out to have unexpected side effects, it may not be possible to remove them</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Other viruses might also be vulnerable to the same strategy</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Doctors cannot receive consent from anyone else who is infected with them</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Protease inhibitors attack the virus itself by preventing a protein from activating H.I.V., while TIPs are a molecular mimic that invades cells and steals essential proteins from the virus</answer>
