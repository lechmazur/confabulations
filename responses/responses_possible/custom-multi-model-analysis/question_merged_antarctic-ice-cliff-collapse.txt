<answer>The Thwaites Glacier study suggests that ice cliff collapse may be less likely in West Antarctica than previously thought, potentially indicating greater stability for the broader ice sheet.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The study's focus on the Thwaites Glacier's ice shelf disappearance scenarios provides insights into how the absence of the floating edge affects ice cliff stability and potential collapse.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Insufficient observations of ice fracture behavior could lead to inaccurate projections of sea-level rise, potentially affecting coastal city planning and protection efforts.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The study suggests that runaway ice cliff collapse in West Antarctica may be less likely than previously thought, challenging assumptions about the ice sheet's instability and potential rapid disintegration.</answer>
