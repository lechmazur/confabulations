<answer>The unexpected formations revealed complex structures like terraces and teardrop-shaped divots, challenging the assumption that melting smooths out underwater ice topography.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Dead reckoning contributed to only about half of Ran's 14 undersea missions being completely successful, as it relied on onboard motion sensors without GPS or real-time communication.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Seals observed living in a fracture in Dotson's ice could have caused Ran to become disoriented underwater, potentially leading to its loss during a subsequent expedition.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The findings revealed persistent complex structures and indentations, contradicting the assumption that melting smooths out underwater ice topography and suggesting a more intricate melting process.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Too much sea ice blocked access to Thwaites Glacier, making it inaccessible for the researchers.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Ran</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The newly discovered complex topography, including terraces and teardrop-shaped divots, contradicts the assumption that melting smooths out underwater ice, suggesting a more complex interaction between ice, water currents, and other factors.</answer>

<answer>Thwaites Glacier</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The complex topography requires further study to understand how these structures and indentations affect overall melting patterns in response to ocean warming, potentially improving predictions of sea-level rise and glacier retreat.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The researchers risked encountering a flat and featureless bottom of the ice shelf, which would have been a disappointing and less informative outcome for their research goals.</answer>
