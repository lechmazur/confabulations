<answer>They were never designed to do math and are fine-tuned for determining probabilities, not doing rules-based calculations</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>They excel with vast quantities of training data like textbooks and tests, yet still struggle with basic arithmetic and multi-step math problems</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Traditional computing uses step-by-step rules and structured databases, while AI chatbots learn by analyzing data and predicting probabilities</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It shows a shift from computers being programmed with rigid rules to neural networks that learn by analyzing vast amounts of data</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>While computers were traditionally excellent at calculations, modern AI chatbots often struggle with basic math despite their advanced language capabilities</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Teachers can use chatbot errors to encourage students to compare answers, discuss solution methods, and develop critical thinking skills</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>It shows AI systems are more proficient at language-based tasks than mathematical calculations, contrary to traditional computing strengths</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The math limitations fuel debate between those who believe in large language models as the path forward versus skeptics who argue for broader approaches like "world modeling"</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>While the article mentions AI being more like a liberal arts major, it doesn't explicitly discuss how this challenges the traditional STEM/liberal arts distinction</other>
