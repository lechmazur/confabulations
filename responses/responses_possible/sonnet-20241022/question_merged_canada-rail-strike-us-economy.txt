<other>While the article mentions various impacts of the rail shutdown, most questions ask about specific scenarios or timeframes that aren't directly addressed in the text. The article does mention that sawmills and pulp/paper plants would close as they run out of storage, but doesn't specify timing. Similarly, while economic impacts are discussed, specific durations and compound effects with other disruptions aren't detailed.</other>
