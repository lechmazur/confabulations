<answer>Genomic sequencing suggests infected cows passed the virus to other species, and wild birds could be transporting the virus between farms</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows having higher viral presence in noses suggests infection may start in upper respiratory tract before moving to mammary glands</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The presence of virus in nasal swabs and urine of asymptomatic cows indicates multiple transmission routes beyond milk</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The spread to cats and raccoons indicates that controlling cow and equipment movement alone may not be sufficient to stop the outbreak</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The matching viral sequences between blackbirds and farm infections suggests wild birds may transport the virus between farms and introduce it to other wild animals</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Blackbirds found five to eight miles away from a Texas farm carried virus matching infections from Texas and Kansas farms</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have virus in noses and urine than in milk, suggesting milk testing alone is insufficient for surveillance</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have virus in their noses or urine than in their milk</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The analysis shows virus spread across multiple species including cats, raccoons, and wild birds, indicating farm-focused controls may be inadequate</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses than obviously sick ones</answer>
