<answer>Genomic sequencing suggests that wild birds might be involved in transporting the virus between farms or introducing it to other wild animals.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that the infection may start in the upper respiratory tract before moving to the mammary glands, which appear to be the primary site of viral replication.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>It shows that the respiratory route and urine are also potential pathways for spread, and that asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that even with strict controls on cows and equipment, the virus can spread through other animal species, making these controls insufficient to stamp out the outbreak.</answer>

<answer>The study implies that wild birds might be involved in transporting the virus between farms or introducing it to other wild animals.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Wild blackbirds.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk, which suggests that testing milk samples may not be enough to give a full picture of asymptomatic spread.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>It shows the virus can spread to other species, including wild birds that can travel between farms, suggesting that controls focused only on cow and equipment movement may not be enough to stop the outbreak.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses than obviously sick ones.</answer>
