<other>I will analyze each question and find the answer solely within the provided article. For question 1, the article attributes the challenging of black hole formation theories to the discovery of quasars, not the singing black hole, so the premise is incorrect based on the text. For question 2, the article explicitly states that the discovery of quasars caused a reconsideration of ideas about black hole formation. For question 3, the article identifies a "singing black hole" as the source of a B flat note. For question 4, the article links the Crab nebula's creation event to Native American pictographs. For question 5, the article names Riccardo Giacconi as the visionary behind Chandra. For question 6, the article describes the supernova that created Cassiopeia A as unobserved at the time but now providing insights into element formation. For question 7, the article points to a specific, massive, and ancient black hole that scientists cannot explain. For question 8, the article directly connects the Faulkner quote about the past not being past to how astronomers can observe the aftermath of ancient events. For question 9, the article connects the Crab nebula to both Chinese astronomers and Native American pictographs. For question 10, the article explains that supernovas create the heavier elements needed for life and our cells.</other>
