<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>More than 10 to 1</answer>
<other>The article states that "roughly $30 billion in total public investment has been accompanied by commitments from private companies to invest more than $300 billion".

<answer>$8.05 billion</answer>
<other>The largest grant mentioned is "up to $8.5 billion" for Intel. The smallest grant mentioned is "up to $450 million" for SK Hynix. $450 million is $0.45 billion. The difference is $8.5 billion - $0.45 billion = $8.05 billion.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that "more than $30 billion" of a "$39 billion pot" has been allocated. Because "more than $30 billion" is not a precise figure, the exact percentage remaining cannot be calculated.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions grants to non-U.S. based companies SK Hynix ($450 million) and TSMC ($6.6 billion). It also mentions an agreement with Samsung, another non-U.S. company, but does not provide the grant amount. Therefore, the total amount cannot be determined.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Approximately 18.9</answer>
<other>The largest grant mentioned is "up to $8.5 billion" for Intel. The grant for SK Hynix is "up to $450 million". The ratio is $8,500,000,000 divided by $450,000,000, which equals 18.88..., or approximately 18.9.</other>
