<other>I will analyze each question based only on the provided article.

For question 1, I will look at the text describing what happens when a gymnast fails to perform a switch ring leap correctly. The text says she "might get credit for only a switch leap, 0.2 less." The question asks for the difference in score compared to a successful switch leap. If the failed skill is credited as a switch leap, and the comparison is to a successful switch leap, the credited value is the same. Therefore, the difference is 0.

For question 2, I will calculate the required sum for the "Skill Values" component of the D-score. D-score = CR (2.0) + Skill Values. Target is 6.0, so Skill Values must sum to 4.0. One skill is an H (0.8), so the other 7 skills must sum to 3.2. The question asks for a single "difficulty rating" for these 7 skills. The article does not define how to derive a single rating from a sum of values for multiple skills. Thus, the question is unanswerable.

For question 3, the question asks for the "minimum difficulty rating for their acro series". The article defines an acro series as being composed of multiple skills, but it does not assign a single difficulty rating to a series itself. Therefore, this question cannot be answered from the text.

For question 4, I will find the passage that compares the switch leap and the switch ring leap. The article states that getting credit for a switch leap instead of a switch ring leap is "0.2 less," which directly states the difference in their difficulty values.

For question 5, I will calculate the minimum possible D-score. The D-score is the sum of Composition Requirements (CR) and Skill Values. CR is 2.0 (4 requirements x 0.5 each). Skill Values are the sum of the 8 hardest skills. The known skills are a switch leap (D=0.4) and a double pike (E=0.5). To minimize the score, the other 6 skills must be the lowest possible value, which is A (0.1). The total skill value is 0.5 + 0.4 + (6 * 0.1) = 1.5. The minimum D-score is 2.0 + 1.5 = 3.5.

For question 6, I will find the difficulty ratings for both the double-twisting double tuck and the full-twisting double tuck in the article and compare them. The article lists the former as H and the latter as G.

For question 7, I will analyze the D-score calculation. The article states, "Gymnasts earn credit for their eight hardest skills." This implies that the calculation is always based on 8 skills. The question asks for the minimum number of skills needed to achieve a certain score. Since the formula requires 8 skills, that is the minimum number needed for the calculation.

For question 8, I will look for the deduction values for a wobble and for an insufficient split. The article gives a value for a "slight balance check" (0.1) and a "fall" (1.0), but not a maximum for a wobble. It mentions deductions for insufficient splits but does not provide a numerical value. Without these values, the maximum combined deduction cannot be calculated.

For question 9, I will repeat the calculation from question 5 but with the new dismount. The known skills are a switch leap (D=0.4) and a double tuck (D=0.4). The other 6 skills are A-rated (0.1). The total skill value is 0.4 + 0.4 + (6 * 0.1) = 1.4. The minimum D-score is 2.0 + 1.4 = 3.4.

For question 10, the question identifies the dismount as a "full-twisting double tuck" and asks for its highest possible rating. The article explicitly states this skill has a G rating. A skill's rating is fixed, so the answer is G.</other>
