<other>I will now answer the questions based only on the provided article. I will ensure each question is answered in order and that the format is followed precisely.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>A single shot of TIPs may keep H.I.V. at low levels permanently, whereas it may be difficult to ensure people keep up with the twice-yearly shots required for lenacapavir.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It might make it harder for people to transmit H.I.V. to others.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Doctors can obtain consent from patients receiving the treatment, but they cannot receive consent from anyone else who might be infected with TIPs by that patient.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The mechanism of TIPs allows for a potentially permanent effect from a single shot, while protease inhibitors require daily doses.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The fact that TIPs become a permanent part of a patient's body and may not be removable if they have unexpected side effects.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>They were engineered to do a better job of entering protein shells, resulting in the release of three times more TIPs than H.I.V. viruses from an infected cell.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>If the TIPs have unexpected side effects, it may not be possible to remove them.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Other viruses might also be vulnerable to the same strategy.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>It makes it impossible to get consent from other people who might be infected with TIPs by a treated patient.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>TIPs act as a molecular mimic that invades a cell and steals essential proteins from H.I.V., while protease inhibitors attack the virus itself by preventing a specific protein from activating it.</answer>
