<answer>The finding that the primate vocal tract was "speech ready" challenged the previous assumption, argued by Philip Lieberman, that apes were unable to speak due to the anatomy of their vocal tract.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Julia Fischer suggested that the sound might be a standard chimpanzee pant-grunt, and that the apes simply combined two of these sounds and were rewarded, rather than learning a human word.</answer>

<answer>Philip Lieberman</answer>
<other>The question asks which scientist's death *potentially influenced* the shift. The article states Philip Lieberman, who argued for the vocal tract theory, died in 2022. While the article attributes the shift in focus to a 2016 study, Lieberman was the primary proponent of the theory being challenged, making his death relevant to the evolution of the debate.</other>

<answer>The analysis found that the vocalizations had a "very particular, very unique acoustic profile" which, according to Mr. Ekstrom, could not be mistaken for something else, challenging the idea that it was a standard chimpanzee sound like a pant-grunt.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The concept of "speech readiness" in the vocal tract suggests that the anatomy is capable of speech, which implies that the ability to combine consonants and vowels is related to a different factor, such as the brain's capacity to send coordinated commands to the jaw and throat.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>It challenges this notion by providing an example of chimpanzees appearing to learn a new sound ("mama") from humans, suggesting the ability is not unique to humans.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The analysis showed that the chimpanzees could produce wordlike sounds by combining a consonant and a vowel, which, according to psychologist Michel Belyk, suggests that ancient apes might have already possessed some of the mental requirements for speech and that their brains were not entirely lacking essential building blocks.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The concept of sending coordinated commands is what may have allowed the combination of consonants and vowels; the discovery that chimpanzees could say "mama" (a consonant-vowel combination) suggests they may have some ability to send such commands.</answer>
