<answer>Repsol's strategy of retrofitting its refineries is a direct response to the European Union's regulations, enabling the company to produce the mandated increasing proportions of sustainable aviation fuel and other biofuels in a cost-effective manner by using existing facilities.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The paradox is that the plant's main advantage is its flexibility to use various types of waste as feedstock, but this advantage is undermined by the fact that these same waste ingredients have become scarce and limited commodities.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The contradiction is that biofuels are perceived as a practical solution for reducing emissions, but the logistical need to transport scarce ingredients from around the world creates its own emissions, which partially counteracts the intended environmental benefit.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The requirement for 70% sustainable aviation fuel by 2050 creates the complex challenge of sourcing a sufficient and ever-increasing supply of feedstock, which is already described as scarce and limited, to meet the mandated production volumes over several decades.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The irony is that while customers can acquire "green credentials with little effort" by simply purchasing the fuel, this ease for the consumer masks the immense, complex, and challenging global effort required by producers like Repsol to find and transport the scarce raw materials.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Repsol's strategy is to transform and retrofit its existing refineries to produce greener fuels, whereas some of its competitors have chosen to close their traditional oil refineries.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The potential challenge is intense price competition from imports of cheap biodiesel, particularly from China, which depresses market prices and threatens the profitability and competitive edge Repsol gained from being an early entrant.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that Repsol's biofuel production is fundamentally constrained by the availability of waste ingredients, as their scarcity is a "potential stumbling block" that can limit production volumes and increase costs.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The potential contradiction is that while the biofuels are claimed to be a practical solution for reducing emissions, the logistical necessity of sourcing scarce ingredients from across the globe generates significant transport emissions, which undermines the overall environmental benefit of the fuel.</answer>
