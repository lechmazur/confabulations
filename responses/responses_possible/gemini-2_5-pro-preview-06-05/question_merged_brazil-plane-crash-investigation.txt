<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The mention that the manufacturer has improved the de-icing system since a 1994 crash involving the same model could suggest the problem was fixed, potentially diverting attention from the possibility that the improved system failed or was not activated.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>By stating that the plane's speed did not drop far enough to cause a stall unless the condition of extremely severe icing was present.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The pilots' ability to descend to a lower altitude where warmer air (evidenced by the 63-degree ground temperature) would have melted the ice challenges the icing theory because this standard procedure for system failure was not used.</answer>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The plane's recorded speed was not low enough to cause a stall on its own, which challenges the theory by requiring that another factor, severe icing, must have been present to alter the wing's aerodynamics.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The pilots did not communicate with air traffic controllers or declare an emergency, which conflicts with the standard protocol of alerting controllers before descending to a lower altitude to escape icing.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The official warning issued by Brazilian officials about the potential for severe icing where the plane was flying.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The improved de-icing system, which complicates the investigation by adding more variables to consider, such as whether the crew activated it or if the improved system itself failed.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The description of the de-icing system as consisting of rubber tubes on the wings that inflate and deflate to break up ice.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The fall from 17,000 feet, an altitude where icing can be severe, combined with the lack of pilot communication, suggests a rapid, unexpected event rather than a gradual accumulation of ice that pilots would have had time to manage.</answer>
