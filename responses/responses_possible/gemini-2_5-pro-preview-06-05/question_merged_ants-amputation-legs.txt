<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Because a thigh injury reduces the flow of hemolymph, making it more difficult for bacteria to move from the wound into the body, which increases the chance of a successful amputation.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The presence of many hemolymph-pumping muscles in their thighs.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Amputations are effective when the wound is closer to the body but do not work when the wound is further away.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It saves the colony an enormous amount of energy that would otherwise be spent producing 10 to 20 percent more ants to compensate for the loss of injured members.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The time window for a successful amputation is narrow for lower leg injuries.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>When a thigh is injured, the many muscles in it reduce the flow of hemolymph, making it more difficult for bacteria to move from the wound into the body.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Amputation is effective when bacterial movement into the body is slowed by reduced hemolymph flow (thigh injuries) but ineffective when bacteria can penetrate the body very quickly (lower leg injuries).</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Amputations are successful on the thigh, which is where many hemolymph-pumping muscles are located.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The high survival rate of amputees saves the colony an enormous amount of energy by not having to produce 10 to 20 percent more ants to compensate for losses.</answer>
