<other>First I will read the article carefully and understand the context of each question.</other>
<other>For question 1, I need to find the event that made the CEO re-examine practices despite denying policy changes. The TikTok video and customer complaints seem to be the trigger.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>May TikTok video and customer complaints on social media</answer>
<other>For question 2, I need to find how "shrinkflation" relates to customer perception. The article mentions shrinkflation in the context of rising food costs and customer allegations, suggesting it influences perceptions.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>rising food costs and general trend of shrinkflation</answer>
<other>For question 3, I need to see how "generous portion" is connected to the response. The CEO links it to brand equity and mentions retraining to ensure consistency.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>re-emphasizing training and coaching for consistency</answer>
<other>For question 4, I need to find the implied impact of retraining. The article suggests it's for customer satisfaction and brand reputation, but the outcome is uncertain.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>potential improvement in customer satisfaction and brand reputation</answer>
<other>For question 5, I need to find an executive statement contradicting the analyst.  After re-reading, I don't see a direct contradiction. The CEO denies policy change, the analyst finds variation. Not a direct contradiction. So, N/A.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>For question 6, I need to see how the analyst's method challenges a complaint. The online vs in-store order comparison directly challenges the complaint about size discrepancies.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>ordering bowls both in-store and online</answer>
<other>For question 7, I need to see how inspection policy timing relates to analyst's portion size findings. The avocado price jump due to inspection policy is mentioned in the context of the study, but not directly related to portion size findings. So, N/A.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>For question 8, I need to find employee response supporting CEO's claim. Employee refusal to serve filming customers is about stress, not directly supporting portion policy claims. So, N/A.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>For question 9, I need to see how analyst's online order finding contradicts customer perception. Finding online orders slightly heavier contradicts the complaint about online orders being smaller.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>online orders were slightly heavier</answer>
<other>For question 10, I need to find supply chain aspect contradicting price increase impact. CEO mentioning sourcing avocados from Peru contradicts the assumed impact of Mexican avocado price increase.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>majority of avocados are sourced from Peru</answer>
<other>I have answered all questions based on the article and used the correct format. I will now submit the response.</other>
