<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>They were never designed to do math; they are designed for determining probabilities, not rules-based calculations.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Despite being trained on vast amounts of data including math problems, their proficiency in math remains a shortcoming.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Traditional computing systems are programmed with rigid rules for accurate calculations, while A.I. chatbots predict likely words based on vast data, leading to variability and errors in math.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It reflects a shift from computing being primarily defined as "math on steroids" to A.I. being more focused on language and probability, marking a break from computing's past emphasis on calculation.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>A.I.'s struggle with math shows that current A.I. is not primarily about calculation, unlike the traditional definition of computing as "math on steroids."</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>It has become a focal point for class discussions to sharpen students' critical thinking by comparing their answers to the chatbot's and determining accuracy.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>It shifts the perceived strengths of A.I. from traditional computational accuracy to language fluency and probability-based reasoning.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>It adds to the debate about whether focusing solely on large language models is sufficient for advancing A.I., with some arguing for broader approaches beyond just data and computing power.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>It challenges the traditional distinction by showcasing A.I.'s strength in language-related tasks (liberal arts) while revealing limitations in mathematical accuracy (STEM).</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>He finds A.I. impressive for language skills but notes its lack of accuracy, emphasizing the need for rule-based software for critical applications requiring precision.</answer>
