<answer>The unexpected formations, including immense terraces and teardrop-shaped divots, challenged the assumption that melting smooths out the topography of underwater ice.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The use of dead reckoning for navigation under the ice shelf led to only about half of Ran's missions being completely successful.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The seals observed by the researchers could have potentially caused Ran to become disoriented, leading to its loss.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The findings revealed complex structures and indentations that persist, contradicting the assumption that melting smooths out underwater ice topography.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The primary reason the scientists were unable to survey the Thwaites Glacier was that too much sea ice was in the way.</answer>
