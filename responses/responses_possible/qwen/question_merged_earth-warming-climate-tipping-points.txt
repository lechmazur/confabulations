<answer>Greenland's melting ice infuses the North Atlantic with immense new flows of freshwater, upsetting the balance of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and potentially causing it to stall.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>As the surface of the ice loses height, more of it sits at a balmier altitude, exposed to warmer air, which makes it melt even faster.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The infusion of freshwater from Greenland's melting ice makes the North Atlantic less salty and less dense, which can disrupt the sinking of water that drives the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Thawing permafrost releases carbon dioxide and methane, which are greenhouse gases that worsen the heat and the fire and the rain, intensifying the thawing.</answer>

<answer>A shutdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation could upend weather patterns for billions of people in the tropics.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Greenland's melting ice sheet adds immense new flows of freshwater to the North Atlantic, which can disrupt the balance of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and potentially cause it to slow down or stall.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Thawing permafrost releases carbon dioxide and methane, which are greenhouse gases that worsen the heat and the fire and the rain, intensifying the thawing and leading to a self-propelling cycle of climate change.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Permafrost, if destabilized, could potentially release greenhouse gases that would exacerbate the very conditions causing its own breakdown.</answer>
