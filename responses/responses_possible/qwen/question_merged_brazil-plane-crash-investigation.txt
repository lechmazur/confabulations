<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The article mentions that the ATR 72-500 model had its de-icing system improved after a 1994 crash, which could lead to the assumption that the de-icing system was not a factor, potentially distracting from other possible causes.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The article states that the plane's speed dropped sharply before the crash, but it did not drop far enough to cause a stall unless icing was extremely severe, creating a conditional statement that depends on the severity of icing.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The plane's anti-icing system, which consists of rubber tubes on the wings, and the crash location's temperature of around 63 degrees, challenge the primary theory of severe icing, as the temperature suggests conditions were not extremely cold.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The plane's trajectory, described as spinning slowly and falling almost directly on its belly, contradicts the standard expectation of a stall-induced crash, which typically involves a more rapid and uncontrolled descent.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The plane's last recorded speed of roughly 325 miles per hour, which did not drop far enough to cause a stall under normal conditions, challenges the primary theory that icing alone caused the crash.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The pilots' lack of communication with air traffic controllers just before the crash conflicts with standard protocol, which would involve alerting controllers to descend to a lower altitude if severe icing was encountered.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The crash location's temperature of around 63 degrees contradicts the expert's statement that icing conditions were severe, as such a temperature is not typically associated with severe icing.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The de-icing system improvements implemented after the 1994 American Eagle crash paradoxically complicate the current investigation, as it raises questions about why the improved system did not prevent the crash.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The plane's wingspan of 89 feet becomes crucial when considering the icing theory, as the size of the wings could affect how ice accumulates and impacts the plane's aerodynamics.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The plane began to fall from 17,000 feet, which challenges assumptions about gradual ice accumulation, as such a high altitude might suggest a more sudden and severe icing event.</answer>
