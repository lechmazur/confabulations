<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Humans have already altered the planet, heating the climate with greenhouse gases. To repair the climate and return it to a more pristine state, we may need to take even more drastic action and engineer the stratosphere.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Keith believes the risks of solar geoengineering are well understood and small compared to the benefits, while Dr. Pierrehumbert considers it a grave threat to human civilization and believes that even researching it is dangerous.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Keith's 1992 paper raised questions about who should authorize the use of geoengineering technologies and who is liable if something goes wrong, which are governance concerns that critics of solar geoengineering continue to raise.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Keith's observations of natural climate changes, such as the shrinking glacier he saw on his birthday hike, reinforce his belief that drastic action, including solar geoengineering, may be necessary to address climate change.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Keith's personal windfall from the sale of Carbon Engineering was about $72 million, while the funding for his new academic program at the University of Chicago could reach as much as $100 million.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Keith's birthday hike in the Canadian Rockies, where he observed a dramatically shrunk glacier, served as a visual reminder of the impacts of global warming and reinforced his motivation to pursue solar geoengineering.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Keith agrees that nations should stop burning fossil fuels, but he also believes that solar geoengineering could help reduce global temperatures and prevent millions of heat-related deaths.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Dyslexia prevented Dr. Keith from learning to read until late in 4th grade, but once he overcame this, he became a voracious reader and eventually pursued a career in experimental physics.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Keith acknowledged that the protests against the Scopex experiment taught him that if he were to conduct similar research again, he would be less open about it.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Raymond Pierrehumbert stated that termination shock could result in a potentially massive temperature rise over a matter of five to 10 years, hitting the Earth's climate with something it probably hasn't seen since the dinosaur-killing impactor.</answer>
