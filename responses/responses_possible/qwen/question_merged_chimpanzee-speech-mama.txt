<answer>The "speech ready" vocal tract of primates challenges the assumption that the anatomical differences in the vocal tract between humans and apes are the primary reason apes cannot speak.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The pant-grunt sound serves as a potential counterargument because it suggests that Johnny and Renata might have been making a standard chimpanzee vocalization rather than a human-like word.</answer>

<answer>The analysis of Renata's and Johnny's vocalizations shows that they could add a vowel after a consonant, which is more complex than a simple pant-grunt.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Viki's "papa" was limited to consonant sounds without vowels, while Johnny's "mama" included both consonants and vowels, reflecting an evolution in research methodologies that allowed for more nuanced analysis of primate vocalizations.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The "speech readiness" of monkey vocal tracts suggests that the ability to combine consonants and vowels is not limited by the anatomy but may be influenced by brain capabilities.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The discovery of chimpanzees saying "mama" challenges the notion that humans are unique in their ability to learn new sounds from others by showing that apes can also learn and produce human-like sounds.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The analysis of Renata's and Johnny's vocalizations suggests that apes might have some of the mental requirements for speech, challenging the idea that their brains lack something essential for speech.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The discovery of chimpanzees saying "mama" relates to the concept of humans being able to send coordinated commands to the jaw and throat by showing that apes can produce sounds with a similar complexity, suggesting they might have some of the necessary brain functions.</answer>
