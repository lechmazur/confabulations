<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>They were never designed to do it</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>They excel when they have consumed vast quantities of relevant training data, but this does not necessarily translate to accurate mathematical problem-solving</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Traditional computing systems follow step-by-step rules and are accurate in calculations, while A.I. chatbots use probabilistic methods and can struggle with math, leading to the use of external calculators in educational applications</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It reflects a shift from a focus on rule-based, precise calculations to a more flexible, probabilistic approach that excels in language but not always in math</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It challenges the traditional definition by showing that modern A.I. systems, despite being advanced, are not as reliable in mathematical tasks as traditional computing systems</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>It teaches students to critically evaluate information and develop critical thinking skills</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>It reflects a shift from a focus on computational accuracy to a focus on language and pattern recognition capabilities</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>It contributes to the debate by highlighting the limitations of current A.I. approaches and suggesting that a broader, more integrated approach may be necessary</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>It challenges the distinction by showing that A.I. systems can excel in liberal arts tasks but struggle with STEM tasks, blurring the lines between the two fields</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that while A.I. is impressive for language tasks, it lacks the precision required for critical applications, indicating a need for a combination of A.I. and rules-based systems</answer>
