<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Genomic sequencing suggests that infected cows passed the virus on to other species, including cats and raccoons, and that wild birds might be involved in transporting the virus between farms or introducing it to other wild animals.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that the infection may start in the upper respiratory tract before moving to the mammary glands, indicating that the respiratory route cannot be completely ruled out in the virus's progression.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>It complicates the narrative by suggesting that testing milk samples may not be enough to give a full picture of asymptomatic spread, as asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It challenges the assumption by showing that even strict controls on the movement of cows and farm equipment may not be enough to stamp out the outbreak, as the virus can spread to other species that can move freely between farms.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The study implies that wild birds might be involved in transporting the virus between farms or introducing it to other wild animals, as the genomic similarities between viruses found in blackbirds and those on affected farms suggest a potential role in the spread.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Wild blackbirds.</answer>
<question_number>7</answer>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk, challenging the effectiveness of current surveillance methods that may focus primarily on milk samples.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk, contradicting assumptions about milk-based transmission.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>It challenges the effectiveness of farm-focused control measures by showing that the virus can spread to other species, which can then transport the virus to new locations.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses than obviously sick ones.</answer>
