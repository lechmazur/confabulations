<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>A.I. chatbots struggle with mathematical accuracy because they were never designed to do math; they are fine-tuned for determining probabilities rather than following rigid, rules-based calculations.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Despite consuming vast quantities of training data, including textbooks and standardized tests, A.I. chatbots still struggle with mathematical accuracy because their approach is based on predicting likely words or phrases rather than strict logical reasoning.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The article illustrates that traditional computing systems follow step-by-step rules and structured databases for accuracy, whereas A.I. chatbots rely on probabilistic predictions, leading to errors in multi-step math problems. In education, this has led to the use of external calculator programs to improve accuracy.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The evolution of A.I. technology reflects a shift from rigid, rules-based computing to probabilistic, language-based models, which excel in language tasks but struggle with mathematical precision.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The article challenges the traditional definition of computing as "math on steroids" by showing that modern A.I. chatbots, unlike past computers, are more proficient in language tasks than in mathematical accuracy.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The mathematical errors made by A.I. chatbots have become a teaching opportunity by encouraging students to critically evaluate chatbot-generated answers and compare them with their own solutions.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The article reflects a shift in the perceived strengths of artificial intelligence systems by highlighting that modern A.I. excels in language fluency but struggles with mathematical accuracy, unlike traditional computing.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The discussion contributes to the debate by contrasting the dominant view that large language models will lead to artificial general intelligence with the skepticism that a broader approach, incorporating logic and reasoning, is necessary.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The article challenges the traditional STEM-liberal arts distinction by portraying A.I. chatbots as more proficient in language tasks, akin to liberal arts majors, rather than excelling in math like traditional computing systems.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>David Ferrucci highlights that while A.I. chatbots are impressive in language skills, they lack the precision required for critical applications, necessitating the use of structured, rules-based software for essential systems.</answer>
