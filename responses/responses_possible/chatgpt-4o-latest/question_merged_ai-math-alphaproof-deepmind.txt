<answer>Dr. Kohli described the A.I.'s performance as a "phase transition" in the use of A.I. in mathematics, marking a transformative change in the ability of A.I. systems to do mathematics.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Davies noted that mathematics requires a combination of abstract, precise, and creative reasoning, making it a good litmus test for reaching artificial general intelligence (A.G.I.).</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Silver suggested that the A.I.'s ability to tackle I.M.O. problems represents a step-change in the history of mathematics, moving from computers proving very simple things to proving problems that humans cannot.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The A.I. system performed at the level of a silver medalist, solving four out of six problems for a total of 28 points, indicating it is competitive but not yet at the level of the top human competitors.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Silver highlighted that the reinforcement learning algorithm allows the A.I. to learn without a human teacher, enabling it to keep learning indefinitely and potentially surpass human capabilities.</answer>

<answer>Dr. Gowers suggested that if A.I. can solve some hard I.M.O. problems, then a useful research tool for mathematics is not far away.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Gowers speculated that if computers become better and faster at everything mathematicians do, mathematicians might eventually have nothing left to do.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Silver indicated that the A.I.'s ability to solve I.M.O. problems suggests a threshold where computers may eventually prove things that humans cannot.</answer>
