<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Genomic sequencing suggests that infected cows passed the virus to other species, including cats and raccoons, and that wild birds might be involved in transporting the virus between farms or introducing it to other wild animals.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The study suggests that the infection may start in the upper respiratory tract before moving to the mammary glands, contradicting the assumption that sick cows would have more virus in their noses.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The presence of the virus in nasal swabs and urine of asymptomatic cows suggests that milk testing alone may not provide a full picture of asymptomatic spread.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The spread of the virus to cats and raccoons indicates that controlling cow and equipment movement alone may not be sufficient to curb the outbreak.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The genomic similarities between viruses found in blackbirds and those on affected farms suggest that wild birds might be involved in transporting the virus between farms.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Wild blackbirds</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk, suggesting that milk testing alone may not be sufficient for surveillance.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk, contradicting the assumption that milk is the primary medium of transmission.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The genomic analysis shows that the virus spread to multiple species, including wild birds, suggesting that farm-focused control measures may not be enough to contain the outbreak.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses than obviously sick cows.</answer>
