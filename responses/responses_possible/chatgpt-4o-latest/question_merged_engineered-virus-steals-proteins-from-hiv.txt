<answer>One shot of TIPs may keep H.I.V. at low levels permanently, whereas lenacapavir requires twice-yearly shots, which may be difficult to maintain.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It might make it harder for people to transmit H.I.V. to others.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>TIPs insert themselves into the DNA of a patient's immune cells, making them a permanent part of the body, which raises concerns about obtaining consent for unintended transmission.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>TIPs interfere with H.I.V.'s normal life cycle by outcompeting it for essential proteins, whereas protease inhibitors target specific viral proteins.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The potential for TIPs to become a permanent part of a patient's body and the ethical concerns regarding unintended transmission.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>TIPs are engineered to enter viral protein shells more efficiently, leading to the release of three times more TIPs than H.I.V. viruses.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>If TIPs have unexpected side effects, they may not be removable from the patient's body.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>In principle, the approach of using cheating viruses like TIPs could be applied to other viruses.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Doctors can obtain consent from patients receiving TIPs, but they cannot obtain consent from others who might be infected through unintended transmission.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>TIPs act as molecular mimics that interfere with H.I.V.'s replication by stealing essential proteins, whereas protease inhibitors block specific viral proteins.</answer>
