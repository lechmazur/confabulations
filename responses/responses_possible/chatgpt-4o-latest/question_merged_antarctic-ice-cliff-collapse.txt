<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>It provides insights by simulating worst-case scenarios for Thwaites Glacier, showing how ice flow speed prevents runaway ice cliff collapse, which informs understanding of the broader West Antarctic ice sheet's stability.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It helps understand ice cliff collapse by testing what happens when the ice shelf disappears, revealing that increased ice flow speed prevents cliffs from becoming unstable enough for runaway collapse.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that runaway ice cliff collapse may be less likely elsewhere in Antarctica if similar ice flow dynamics apply.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Scientists may miss rapid ice collapses, leading to inaccurate projections of sea-level rise and inadequate coastal preparations.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It challenges the assumption that ice cliff collapse is a likely scenario by showing that increased ice flow speed prevents runaway breakdown.</answer>
