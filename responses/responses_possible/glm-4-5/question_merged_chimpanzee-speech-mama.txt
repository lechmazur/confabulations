<answer>It challenged the assumption that ape vocal anatomy was the limiting factor in their ability to produce speech, as previously argued by Philip Lieberman.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that Johnny and Renata might have been making a standard chimpanzee sound (pant-grunt) rather than actually saying "mama".</answer>

<answer>Philip Lieberman</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It showed that their vocalizations had a structure similar to human words, specifically the ability to combine consonants and vowels, making them more than just simple pant-grunts.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>It reflects an evolution from simply claiming apes could say words to conducting rigorous acoustic analyses and perceptual experiments to determine if vocalizations truly resemble human speech.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that the anatomical capability for speech exists in primates, but the brain function to utilize this capability for combining consonants and vowels might be what's lacking in chimpanzees.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that chimpanzees might have some ability to learn new sounds from humans, challenging the notion that this ability is unique to humans.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that apes might have more brain capability for speech-like vocalizations than previously thought, though their abilities remain limited compared to humans.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that chimpanzees might have some limited ability to send coordinated commands to their jaw and throat, allowing them to produce simple speech-like sounds like "mama".</answer>
