<answer>The ghostlike second reflection could be a pentimento that emerged over time or intentionally left by Whistler, reflecting his approach that paintings are arrangements of "line, form and color first" and that interpretations are up to the viewer: "They are just what you like."</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>

<answer>The potential for a pentimento suggests that the artist's original intentions might allow for or encourage multiple interpretations by viewers over time, as Whistler wanted viewers to interpret elements as they liked rather than providing definitive answers.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Light, specifically the transition from day to night, transforms industrial structures like chimneys and warehouses into architectural marvels like campanili and palaces.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The hidden reflection challenges the viewer's perception of time by suggesting the painting changes over time, introducing a temporal dimension where the artwork itself evolves rather than remaining static.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>

<answer>N/A</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Both involve ambiguity and multiple interpretations - just as Whistler refused to provide definitive answers about figures in his paintings, the pentimento doesn't provide a definitive answer about whether the reflection was intentional or emerged over time.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The painting's static subject matter requiring sustained attention to notice details contrasts with office workers' average of less than a minute on any screen, reflecting the challenge of maintaining focus when accustomed to rapidly changing content.</answer>
