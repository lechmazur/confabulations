<answer>Just one shot of TIPs may keep H.I.V. at low levels permanently, whereas lenacapavir requires twice-yearly shots which may be difficult to ensure people keep up with.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It might make it harder for people to transmit H.I.V. to others.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>TIPs can potentially spread to others, and doctors cannot obtain consent from those who might be infected with TIPs from the treated patient.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>TIPs are an impostor virus that interferes with H.I.V.'s normal life cycle, whereas protease inhibitors directly attack the virus by preventing a protein from activating it.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>TIPs become a permanent part of the patient's body, and if there are unexpected side effects, it may not be possible to remove them.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>TIPs are engineered to do a better job of entering the shells, resulting in infected cells releasing three times more TIPs than H.I.V. viruses.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>If there are unexpected side effects, it may not be possible to remove the TIPs from the patient's body.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Other viruses might also be vulnerable to the same strategy, making it a universal approach to developing antivirals.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Doctors cannot obtain consent from those who might be infected with TIPs from the treated patient.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>TIPs are an impostor virus that interferes with H.I.V.'s normal life cycle, whereas traditional drugs like protease inhibitors directly attack the virus by preventing specific proteins from activating it.</answer>
