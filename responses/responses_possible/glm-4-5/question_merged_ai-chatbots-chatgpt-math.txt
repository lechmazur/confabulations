<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>They were never designed to do math; they are fine-tuned for determining probabilities, not doing rules-based calculations</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>They excel when they have consumed vast quantities of relevant training data like textbooks and standardized tests, having seen similar problems before, despite not being designed for math</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Traditional computing follows step-by-step rules while AI learns by analyzing data and predicting what comes next; in education, Khan Academy sends numerical problems to calculator programs instead of asking AI to solve math</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>From viewing computing as "math on steroids" to creating AI that is more liberal arts major than numbers whiz, representing a sharp break with computing's past</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>AI chatbots struggle with math despite being advanced computing systems, challenging the traditional view that computers excel at mathematical calculations</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Using AI errors as a focal point for discussion, teaching students to critically evaluate answers and understand different problem-solving approaches</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Shift from viewing AI's strength in mathematical computation to language and probabilistic tasks, characterizing it as more liberal arts major than numbers whiz</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>It adds grist to the debate between two camps: those who believe large language models are the path to AGI versus skeptics who advocate for a broader approach like "world modeling"</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>By characterizing advanced AI as having strengths more aligned with liberal arts rather than the mathematical precision traditionally associated with STEM fields</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>AI has impressive language skills but lacks the accuracy needed for critical applications where precision is essential, requiring a combination of language models and structured software</answer>
