<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Thigh injuries have reduced hemolymph flow, making it harder for bacteria to enter the body, which makes amputation more effective.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The presence of many muscles in the thighs.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Amputations work when the wound is closer to the body (thigh) but don't work when it's further away (lower leg).</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It saves an enormous amount of energy on the colony level.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The time window for successful amputation is narrower for lower leg injuries compared to thigh injuries.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>By reducing hemolymph flow when injured, making it harder for bacteria to enter the body.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Bacterial movement is slower in thigh injuries (due to reduced hemolymph flow) but faster in lower leg injuries, making amputation more effective for thigh injuries.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The amputations appear consensual, with the injured ant presenting its injured leg and then the newly amputated wound for cleaning.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Amputations are more successful when the injury is closer to where there are many hemolymph-pumping muscles (thighs) and less successful when the injury is further away from these muscles (lower legs).</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The high survival rate of amputee ants (90%) contributes to the overall energy efficiency of the colony by saving an enormous amount of energy that would otherwise be needed to produce replacement ants.</answer>
