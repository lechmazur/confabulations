<answer>The mention of improved de-icing systems since 1994 might mislead people to think icing couldn't be the cause, when it's still presented as a leading theory.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The plane's speed drop alone wouldn't cause a stall, but severe icing could make that same speed sufficient to cause a stall by changing the wing's aerodynamics.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Even if the anti-icing system failed, pilots could have descended to a lower altitude where warmer air (63 degrees on the ground) would have melted the ice.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The plane's speed wasn't low enough to cause a stall under normal conditions, challenging the theory that icing alone caused the stall unless the icing was extremely severe.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The pilots did not communicate with air traffic controllers or declare an emergency, which conflicts with the standard protocol of alerting controllers before descending to a lower altitude to address icing.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Brazilian officials had issued a warning about the potential for severe icing in the area where the plane crashed, contradicting the assumption that Brazil's climate wouldn't support such conditions.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The improved de-icing system implemented after the 1994 crash paradoxically complicates the investigation because icing is still considered a leading theory despite these improvements.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The plane's anti-icing system consisted of rubber tubes on the wings that inflate and deflate to break up ice, which becomes crucial when considering if the system was activated or if it failed.</answer>
