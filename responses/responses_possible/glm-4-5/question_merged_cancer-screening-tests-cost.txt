<answer>vastly improved treatment for colon cancer and changing diets and exposures to other factors like medications that might decrease risk</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>studies repeatedly failed to show that people live longer if they are screened, and screening barely lowers the death rate from the cancer being screened</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>the increase in screening did not accelerate the decline</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>the effects of cancer screening on mortality are so small that it requires large clinical trials to detect them</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>it represented only a 1 percentage point absolute reduction (from 3% to 2%), and there was no change in the overall mortality rate with screening</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>improved colon cancer treatments might be a more significant factor in the decline of colon cancer death rates than screening, potentially diminishing the perceived value of screening</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>changing diets might decrease the risk of colon cancer, thereby influencing colon cancer death rates independently of screening</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>despite the widespread belief in the effectiveness of cancer screening, studies repeatedly fail to show that people live longer if they are screened, and screening barely lowers the death rate from the cancer being screened</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>while cancer death rates have been plummeting, it's a mistake to attribute this decline solely or mostly to screening, as evidenced by the linear decline in colon cancer death rates even when few were screened in the 1980s, and the increase in screening did not accelerate the decline</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>the decline in cancer death rates might be attributed to vastly improved treatment for colon cancer, changing diets, and exposures to other factors like medications that might decrease risk</answer>
