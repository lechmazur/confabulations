<answer>The social media trend created a sudden demand surge that Iceland's local supply chain couldn't handle, especially given its geographical isolation and reliance on domestic greenhouse production, forcing the country to import cucumbers from the Netherlands.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Iceland's isolation makes importing expensive and difficult, so when the social media trend caused a sudden demand surge, the country's self-sustaining agricultural system couldn't quickly adapt, requiring emergency imports despite normally producing 99% of cucumbers domestically.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Iceland's isolated agricultural system proved vulnerable to external social media influences, as a TikTok trend created a sudden demand surge that overwhelmed domestic production capacity, demonstrating how external factors can disrupt food security in isolated systems.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The cucumber craze illustrated complexities in managing Iceland's food supply by showing how geographical isolation makes importing more expensive, while the country's small population and preference for local produce limit flexibility in responding to sudden demand changes.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Iceland's small population of over 380,000 provides "little wiggle room to handle sudden surges in demand," meaning that even a relatively small trend can overwhelm the food supply system, challenging the country's ability to maintain self-sufficiency.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The TikTok trend hit during "a small lull in the yield of the crop" as farmers grow cucumbers in cycles, and coincided with schools reopening and placing bulk orders, creating a perfect storm of increased demand during decreased production.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Iceland's commitment to reducing carbon footprints led consumers to prefer locally grown foods over imports, which limited the country's ability to quickly supplement domestic supply when the shortage occurred, as importing was seen as less environmentally friendly.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Iceland's reliance on geothermal-powered greenhouses for most of its domestic produce makes it vulnerable to social media-induced food trends because the greenhouse production system operates in fixed cycles and cannot quickly scale up to meet sudden demand surges caused by viral trends.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The cucumber shortage challenged Iceland's reputation for agricultural self-sufficiency by forcing the country to import emergency cucumbers from the Netherlands despite normally producing 99% of its cucumbers domestically in geothermal-powered greenhouses.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The cucumber trend exposed limitations in Iceland's greenhouse-based agriculture by revealing the system's inability to handle sudden demand surges, especially during natural production lulls and when compounded by factors like carbon dioxide shortages and increased institutional demand.</answer>
