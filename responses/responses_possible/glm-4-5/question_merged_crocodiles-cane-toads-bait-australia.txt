<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The lithium chlorine solution made crocodiles nauseous, creating conditioned taste aversion that caused them to avoid eating toxic cane toads, thereby reducing mortality rates.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The chicken necks served as a control by showing that crocodiles' reduced consumption of toads was due to taste aversion rather than general loss of appetite, as they continued eating the chicken necks.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests success varies because each predator needs an aversion strategy fine-tuned to its hunting style, as seen with different approaches needed for crocodiles versus yellow-spotted monitors.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests the conditioned taste aversion may not be permanent and requires ongoing maintenance, as Dr. Johnson states it's "not a one-and-done thing" and "you have to maintain it."</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The Dr. Seuss metaphor relates to the scientific findings because researchers leveraged the lethargic behavior of nauseous crocodiles (similar to the "seasick crocodile" in the metaphor) to train them to avoid toxic cane toads.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The article highlights the importance of experimental controls by describing how researchers used an un-baited river as a control site and chicken necks as a control food item, allowing them to attribute reduced mortality specifically to the taste aversion training.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests the initial enthusiasm was misleading because although crocodiles initially ate equal amounts of toad carcasses and chicken necks, they later developed an aversion to the toads while continuing to eat the chicken necks, showing a long-term behavior change.</answer>

<answer>Cane toads</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The researchers leveraged the physiological response of nausea, which makes crocodiles lethargic and less likely to hunt, to create a conditioned taste aversion to toxic cane toads.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>For crocodiles, researchers used tainted toad carcasses, while for yellow-spotted monitors, they used young, nonlethal "trainer toads" because the monitors actively pursue live prey and the aversion didn't stick with sausages.</answer>
