<answer>500</answer>

<other>To calculate this, first determine the price difference of combs since 2018: $2 (current) - $1 (2018) = $1. Then, calculate the cost of one month's cleaning service: $500. The discount per service would be $1. To lose $500, Xia Charles would need to perform $500 / $1 = 500 services.</other>

<answer>25</answer>

<other>First, determine the price increase of gel since 2018: $25 (current) - $16 (2018) = $9 per jar. One jar is used per month. The cost of one hair dryer is $600. To find out how many months it would take for the gel price increase to equal $600, divide $600 by $9: $600 / $9 = 66.67 months. To convert months into years, divide by 12: 66.67 / 12 = 5.56 years. Since the question asks for a whole number of years and the increase would not equal $600 in a whole year until the 6th year is completed, we round up. However, the exact calculation is not directly provided, but we can infer that it is more than 5 years but the closest answer based on the available data is not directly calculable to a whole number as requested.</other>
