<answer>Dale Dickey</answer>

<other>Dale Dickey is mentioned as having acted in live-action films. Although the article doesn't explicitly state that she acted in animated films, it does mention other actors who have done voice work in animated films, like Jennifer Jason Leigh in "Anomalisa". However, Dale Dickey is the only actor mentioned who has been in live-action films and is a plausible candidate if she were in an animated film not mentioned. But actually, the correct answer can be inferred from the information about "Anomalisa" being an animated film and other actors being in live-action films. The correct answer should be an actor who has done voice work and also been in a live-action film. For example, "Gretchen" in "Anomalisa" is voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh who is also in a live-action film discussed ("Gretchen" is not a live-action film but Jennifer Jason Leigh is). However, the most straightforward answer based on the information given is not directly available.</other>

<answer>Jennifer Jason Leigh</answer>

<other>The correct answer is Jennifer Jason Leigh because she voiced a character in the animated film "Anomalisa" and is also mentioned as being in a context that implies live-action (though not directly stated in the article that she is in a live-action film discussed, she is known to be). However, a more straightforward answer is available with the information that some actors have done voice work. A more accurate answer can be derived: David Thewlis voiced a character in "Anomalisa".</other>
