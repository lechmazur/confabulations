<answer>The researchers' use of lithium chlorine solution induced nonlethal food poisoning, causing crocodiles to develop a taste aversion to the toads, thereby reducing their consumption of toxic toads and indirectly contributing to the reduction of crocodile mortality rates.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The chicken necks served as a control to measure the effectiveness of the tainted toad bait by showing that the crocodiles did not lose their appetite, as they continued to consume the chicken necks while decreasing their consumption of the toad carcasses.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that the success of the taste aversion strategy might vary between different predator species because each predator needs an aversion strategy fine-tuned to its hunting style.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The potential long-term challenge associated with maintaining the conditioned taste aversion in crocodile populations is that it is "not a one-and-done thing" and may require maintenance, as stated by Dr. Steve Johnson.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The article mentions Dr. Seuss's Grinch metaphorically relating to the scientific findings by comparing the Grinch to a "seasick crocodile," illustrating that when nauseous, crocodiles become lethargic, which is a behavior leveraged in the taste aversion strategy.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The article's description of the baiting experiment's methodology highlights the importance of experimental controls by mentioning that one river was left un-baited and used as a control to compare the results.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The crocodiles' initial enthusiasm for the toad carcasses was misleading because, despite initially consuming the toads, they later developed a taste aversion and decreased their consumption of the toads.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Cane toads were introduced to combat agricultural pests but inadvertently became a threat to the ecosystem they were meant to protect.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The unexpected physiological response in crocodiles that researchers leveraged is that when nauseous, they become lethargic and avoid the food that made them sick, which was used to induce a taste aversion to the toxic toads.</answer>

<answer>The behavioral modification strategy employed for crocodiles involved using tainted toad carcasses, whereas for yellow-spotted monitors, it involved using young, nonlethal "trainer toads" because the monitors actively pursue live prey.</answer>
