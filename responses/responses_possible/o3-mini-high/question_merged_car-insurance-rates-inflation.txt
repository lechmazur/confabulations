<other>Using the article’s quantifiable discounts and rates, I interpreted Q1 as the sum of a 10% safe driver course discount plus a 40% or more saving from a $1,000 deductible change, which gives about a 50% reduction relative to the stated pristine driver premium. For Q2, the article notes that improving one’s credit score (from fair to excellent) can reduce premiums by about 49%, which is larger than other individual discounts. Q3 assumes that a driver with one at‐fault accident (normally paying about 43% more than a pristine driver) if mitigated by accident forgiveness and by improving credit, plus adding a 10% safe driver course discount and a 40% deductible discount, would pay roughly 0.9×0.6 = 54% of the baseline premium. Q4 compares a driver who uses all quantifiable premium‐reducing measures (safe driver course 10% and $1,000 deductible 40%) against one who uses none – a maximum difference of around 50%. For Q5, no specific percentage or dollar‐amount is provided regarding the combined effect of joining a monitoring program while reducing liability coverage to state minimums. Q6 uses the provided average premiums – $2,300 for a pristine record versus about $3,300 for one accident – and a safe course discount; if a driver with one accident improves credit (thus eliminating the roughly 49% higher cost from fair credit) and takes a safe driver course (10% off the accident rate), the cost becomes about 90%×$3,300 ≈ $2,970 which is roughly 129% of the pristine baseline. Q7 and Q10 involve factors (monitoring program discounts and the choice of insurer via funny mascots vs. regional insurers) that are discussed qualitatively but not quantified, so the answer is “N/A.” Q8 compares a single driver with fair credit and one accident (assumed about $3,300) to a married driver with excellent credit and a clean record who additionally gets a 10% safe driver course discount (bringing that premium to about $2,070); the difference is about $1,230 – roughly 60% more. Q9 compares a single driver with fair credit and one accident ($3,300) to a married driver with excellent credit and a clean record who instead opts to increase the deductible to $1,000 (assumed to yield a 40% discount, or paying about 60% of $2,300 ≈ $1,380), a difference of approximately $1,920 which is about 140% more relative to the lower premium.</other>
