<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Thwaites’ rapid, accelerated flow after ice shelf loss shows that even in worst‐case scenarios, ice cliffs may not reach runaway heights, informing overall ice sheet stability.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The simulations demonstrated that when the ice shelf is lost, increased glacier flow limits ice cliff height, reducing the chance for a catastrophic collapse.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>It acts as a test case indicating that faster ice flow following shelf loss can curb cliff formation, suggesting similar mitigating processes may occur across Antarctica.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Insufficient observations may lead to missing rapid ice fracture and collapse events, which could result in inaccurate sea‐level rise projections.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The study shows that accelerated glacier flow prevents cliffs from growing tall enough to trigger runaway collapse, challenging earlier views of inevitable catastrophic instability.</answer>

<answer>Observations of how ice behaves when it fractures.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>It assumes that nations will maintain extremely high greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel use.</answer>
