<answer>It shows that primate vocal tracts can produce speech sounds, undermining the idea that anatomical constraints limit ape speech.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that the sounds may simply be combined pant-grunts rather than deliberate word-like utterances.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The recordings reveal clear consonantâ€“vowel patterns matching "mama," which contradicts the notion that they are mere pant-grunts.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>It reflects a move from anecdotal, unexamined recordings to systematic acoustic analysis and volunteer listening tests.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>It indicates that the anatomical setup to combine consonants and vowels is present, with actual speech production relying on neural coordination.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>It demonstrates that chimpanzees can learn and produce new sound patterns, challenging the idea that only humans can learn new sounds.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The word-like vocalizations imply that apes may possess some of the necessary brain capabilities for coordinated speech.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that, like humans, some chimpanzees can generate coordinated commands with their jaw and throat to produce consistent sounds.</answer>
