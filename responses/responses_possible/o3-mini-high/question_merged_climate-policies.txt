<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>They show discrete national reductions (“breaks”) that are measurable locally in the short term, though such near-term, domestic effects may not translate to the global, long-term reductions needed to reach zero emissions.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>They demonstrate that only combinations of policies (both incentives and regulations) yield substantial reductions, countering the idea of a single silver bullet solution.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>They use statistical models and machine learning to link policies to observable emission drops, which provides strong empirical evidence yet is limited by a near-term, domestic focus and missing sectors and countries.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It limits the study’s global scope since underrepresentation—especially with only South Africa from Africa—reduces the accuracy of conclusions about worldwide emissions reductions.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>They provide examples of effective policy-induced drops, but the small total reduction relative to the 23 billion metric tons needed—and the incomplete data—highlight that such “breaks” are insufficient for meeting Paris targets.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>By only measuring national, near-term effects, it overlooks how international cooperation and technology diffusion across borders are essential for global climate mitigation.</answer>
