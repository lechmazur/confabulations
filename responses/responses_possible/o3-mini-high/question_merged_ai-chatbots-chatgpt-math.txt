<answer>Never designed for rules‐based arithmetic; optimized for language probability.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Trained on extensive math examples yet still delivers unreliable, imprecise calculations.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Chatbots generate answers by predicting language and often use external calculators, while traditional systems use strict, step‐by‐step rules.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It marks a shift from precise, rules‐based number crunching to neural network models focused on language prediction, even at the cost of math accuracy.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>By excelling in language while faltering in arithmetic, it contradicts the notion of computing as solely high-precision math.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>They serve as a basis for classroom discussions that foster error analysis and critical thinking.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>It shows a transition from valuing pure math precision to emphasizing language fluency as the A.I.’s core strength.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Its math shortcomings highlight the limits of large language models and support calls for integrating structured, world-modeling approaches.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>It blurs the STEM-liberal arts divide by showcasing strong language abilities alongside weak arithmetic performance.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>That impressive language skills are insufficient for critical applications, which require the painful precision of structured, rules-based systems.</answer>
