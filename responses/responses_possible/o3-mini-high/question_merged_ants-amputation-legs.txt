<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Because thigh injuries experience reduced hemolymph flow, which limits bacterial spread.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Numerous hemolymph-pumping muscles located in the thighs.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Amputations are more successful for injuries closer to the body (thighs) than for those further away (lower legs).</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It reduces the need to produce replacement ants, saving energy for the colony.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Thigh injuries allow a wider window for successful amputation, whereas lower leg injuries have a very narrow window.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>They result in reduced hemolymph flow when injured, which helps limit bacterial invasion.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Slow bacterial movement from thigh injuries (due to reduced hemolymph flow) enhances effectiveness, while rapid bacterial penetration in lower leg injuries undermines it.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The injured ant calmly presents its injured leg for removal and then the wound is presented for cleaning by a nestmate.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Injuries near the concentration of hemolymph-pumping muscles (thighs) correlate with a much higher success rate for amputation compared to distal injuries.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>A high survival rate (around 90%) minimizes the need for costly replacement of ants, improving colony energy efficiency.</answer>
