<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>It creates a misleading link by referencing a 1994 icing‐related crash while noting that de‐icing technology has since improved.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It sets up a condition: a high speed (325 mph) is normally safe, but a sharp drop would only lead to a stall if icing were exceptionally severe.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The anti-icing system’s use of rubber tubes paired with a relatively mild ground temperature (about 63°F) challenges the idea of severe icing.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The plane was observed spinning slowly and crashing almost belly-first, rather than executing the rapid nose-down dive typically expected in a stall.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The fact that the speed drop from 325 mph did not fall below normal stall thresholds implies that only extreme icing could have caused a stall.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The pilots made no emergency communication with air traffic control immediately before the crash.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The crash occurred in conditions with a ground temperature around 63°F, which contradicts the expectation of harsh, icy conditions.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The implementation of an improved rubber-tube de-icing system after the 1994 incident complicates attributing the current crash solely to icing.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The detail that the ATR 72-500 is especially sensitive to ice becomes crucial in evaluating the icing theory.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The fact that the plane began its fall from 17,000 feet suggests an abrupt stall rather than a gradual build-up of ice.</answer>
