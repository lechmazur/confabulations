Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article and follow the strict format. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Primary reason low-resource languages have less digital data?** The article mentions that it's because AI tech development and online engagement are centered in the US and China. So the answer should be that focus is on those regions.

2. **Economic impact if Vietnamese models had same resources as English?** The article says a delay in access could lead to decades of economic delay. If they had the same resources, maybe it would prevent that. The question is hypothetical, but the article implies that avoiding the delay would help, so the answer is avoiding economic delay.

3. **Lelapa's approach vs. Google/Apple?** The article states Lelapa focuses on community-specific solutions and resource-efficient products, unlike big companies which don't target these markets. So the answer is community-specific and resource-efficient.

4. **Why do chatbots match CA views?** The article says because tech is developed there, so their cultural perspective influences the models. Answer is tech developed in California.

5. **Data availability and LLMs for low-resource?** The article says LLMs need large high-quality data which is scarce for low-resource languages. So the answer is inversely related; less data hinders development.

6. **Impact of delayed AI access?** The article mentions potential economic delay of decades. So the answer is leading to decades of economic delay.

7. **Role of governments in disparity?** Examples given are Nigeria supporting Awarri, Iceland and Wales working with OpenAI. So governments back local efforts.

8. **Cultural bias due to exclusion?** The article says exclusion makes chatbots reflect only certain views, so answers might lack diverse perspectives, leading to bias.

9. **Why big companies ignore low-resource?** The article says these languages don't provide enough market value. So answer is insufficient market value.

10. **Inference about tech delay consequences?** Sang Truong said even a few years delay could lead to decades of economic delay. So the answer is causing economic delay for decades.

Wait, let me check each again for exactness. For question 2, the article says a delay "can potentially lead to a few decades of economic delay". So if they have same resources, maybe it would prevent that. The question asks "might this have according to the article?" So the answer is "avoid economic delay" but the article doesn't explicitly say that. Hmm, maybe the article doesn't state the positive, only the negative. The question is hypothetical. Since the article only mentions the negative effect of delay, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "if developed with same resources as English", which would mean no delay. The article's statement about delay leading to economic issues implies that avoiding delay would prevent that. But does the article directly state that? The question is asking what the article says the impact would be if they had same resources. The article's point is that without the resources, there's a delay and economic issues. So if they had the resources, the impact would be the opposite. Since the article's own reasoning implies that, it's a logical inference. So the answer is "avoid economic delay" or "prevent economic delay". The article's exact wording from Truong is that a delay "can potentially lead to a few decades of economic delay". So the reverse would be the positive. So the answer is "prevent economic delay" or similar. The article doesn't state it directly but logically inferred.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is "prevent economic delay" but the question is phrased as "what economic impact might this have". The article's quote says that a delay (due to lack of resources) causes economic delay. So having the resources would remove that delay. So the answer is "prevent economic delay" but the article doesn't explicitly say that. Since the instructions say to infer if possible, then it's okay. So I'll go with that.

Another point, question 8: the article says exclusion of low-resource languages could lead to cultural bias. So the answer is that exclusion causes chatbots to reflect only certain cultures, leading to bias. The exact wording from the article is "cultural bias in A.I. products" because of exclusion. So the answer is "lead to cultural bias".

Question 10: Sang Truong's statement is that a delay "can potentially lead to a few decades of economic delay". So the inference is that a delay causes economic delay. The question asks what can be inferred about the consequences of delay. So the answer is "lead to decades of economic delay".
