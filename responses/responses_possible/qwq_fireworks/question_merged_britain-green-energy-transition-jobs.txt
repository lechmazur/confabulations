Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and strictly follow the instructions. Let's start with question 1.

1. **What is the paradox in the Labour Party's approach to job creation in the renewable energy sector as highlighted in the article?**  
The article mentions that while Labour promises job creation through renewables, there's a risk that cutting oil and gas could lose more jobs than renewables create. The paradox is that the job gains in renewables might not offset the losses in oil and gas. So the answer should be about the potential job loss in oil vs. job gains in renewables.

2. **What is the potential contradiction in the Labour Party's promise of lower bills for families and businesses, based on the article's analysis?**  
The article states analysts warn the proposals might not be cheap and could lead to higher costs passed to consumers. The contradiction is between the promise of lower bills and the risk of increased costs leading to higher bills.

3. **What is the potential discrepancy between the Labour Party's job creation forecast and the current employment figures in the renewable sector, according to the article?**  
The article says Labour forecasts 650,000 jobs but current renewable jobs are 34,000. The discrepancy is the huge gap between current numbers and the forecast.

4. **What is the potential challenge in achieving the Labour Party's renewable energy job creation targets, based on the current state of the industry?**  
The article mentions the UK lacks supply chain for renewables, like in wind, solar, nuclear. That's a challenge because supply chain gaps could hinder job creation.

5. **How does the Labour Party's approach to offshore wind capacity expansion potentially conflict with the current economic focus of the UK?**  
The UK's economy is more focused on finance, not sectors like renewables. So expanding wind (which needs manufacturing) conflicts with current economic focus.

6. **What is the potential impact of the Labour Party's proposals on the cost of electricity for consumers, according to the article?**  
Analysts say costs might be passed on to consumers, so the impact could be higher electricity bills despite Labour's claims of lower bills.

7. **How does the Labour Party's plan for renewable energy infrastructure potentially affect the UK's supply chain for wind and solar development?**  
The article states the UK lacks the supply chain for wind, solar, etc. The plan would need to build this, but the current lack is a problem.

8. **How does the Labour Party's approach to renewable energy job creation potentially conflict with the current employment figures in the oil and gas sector?**  
Current oil/gas jobs are 200k vs. 34k in renewables. Cutting oil/gas could lose more jobs than renewables can create, conflicting with job numbers.

9. **What is the potential impact of higher material and labor costs on the Labour Party's renewable energy goals, as discussed in the article?**  
Higher costs have already caused 40% increase in offshore wind project costs, making goals harder to achieve.

10. **Which former government official described Labour's 2030 clean energy goal as "far ahead of our major economy peers"?**  
The article quotes Chris Stark, former CEO of the Climate Change Committee, making that statement.

Now, check each answer against the text to ensure accuracy. For example, question 3's numbers must be exact. The article says 34,000 renewables jobs vs. Labour's 650k forecast. Yes, that's correct. For question 10, the exact quote is from Chris Stark. All others seem to align with the article's content. I'll format the answers as per the instructions.
