Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I'm only using the information from the provided article. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then check the article for the answers.

1. **Question 1**: The impact of signing with the Dallas Texans instead of the Steelers. The article says he was drafted by both the Raiders (AFL) and Steelers (NFL) but chose the Texans. Since the Texans became the Chiefs, and he became a star there, the impact was that he became a key player in the AFL, leading to his success there. The answer is likely that he became a star in the AFL with the Texans/Chiefs instead of the NFL.

2. **Question 2**: Paradox in his popularity in Dallas and being traded. The article mentions he was very popular in Dallas as "Most Popular Athlete in Big D" but was traded after the Chiefs moved to Kansas City. The paradox is his popularity in Dallas but being traded after moving the team.

3. **Question 3**: Irony in the 1962 coin flip. He chose to kick off instead of receive, thinking "we'll kick to the clock." The game went into overtime, and the Texans won on a field goal. The irony is that his strategy worked despite the risky choice, but maybe the fact that he chose to kick off but still won, making his decision effective?

4. **Question 4**: Contradiction between achievements and racial challenges. The article states he faced racism but was a star on the field. So his on-field success contrasted with off-field discrimination.

5. **Question 5**: College experience foreshadowing AFL actions. At college, he integrated the team and faced racism. Later, he led a protest against discrimination in New Orleans. The foreshadowing is that his college experience with fighting for integration led him to take a stand in the AFL.

6. **Question 6**: Relationship between on-field success and off-field challenges. His success made him a prominent figure, giving him a platform to challenge discrimination, but he faced backlash (like the GM's letter).

7. **Question 7**: Significance of five-TD game. The article says it's a franchise record shared with Jamaal Charles. So it's a record, highlighting his all-around impact.

8. **Question 8**: Impact of choosing Texans over Steelers. Similar to question 1, so the answer is that he became a star in the AFL, leading to his Player of the Year awards and franchise records.

9. **Question 9**: Transition to Zales after football. The article says he took a "refreshing" option and started at Zales after retiring. The significance might be a new chapter post-football, showing he moved on successfully.

10. **Question 10**: After trade to Broncos, specific stat. The article mentions he led the league in kickoff returns in 1965. So that's the stat.

Now, I need to ensure each answer is directly from the text. Let me cross-verify each point.

1. The article says he signed with Texans, became Rookie and Player of the Year. So the impact is his success in AFL. Answer: He became a star in the AFL with the Texans/Chiefs instead of joining the Steelers in the NFL.

2. Paradox: Popular in Dallas but traded after moving to KC. Answer: Despite being popular in Dallas, he was traded after the team moved to Kansas City.

3. Irony: He chose to kick off, but the strategy worked. The irony might be that by choosing to kick, they still won, so his decision didn't backfire. The answer is that his strategy worked as the Chiefs won the game, making his risky decision successful.

Wait, the article says he made a gaffe but the team won. The irony is that despite the gaffe (choosing to kick off instead of receive, which might have been seen as a mistake), they still won. But the question is about the irony in the decision considering the result. Maybe the irony is that his decision was correct because they won, but the article says he made a "costly gaffe," but the team still won. Hmm, the article says "Haynes made a potentially costly gaffe when he won the overtime coin flip and chose to kick off — he famously said, 'We'll kick to the clock' — rather than receive. But the Texans' defense held, and they won, 20-17, on a field goal." So the irony is that despite his mistake (gaffe), they won because defense held. The answer might be that despite his gaffe, the team won due to defense, making the decision's outcome ironic.

4. On-field achievements vs. off-field racism: Yes, he was a star but faced racism. Answer: Achieved success as a star despite facing racism off the field.

5. College experience led to AFL actions: He integrated college team, faced abuse, then led a protest. Answer: His integration of the college team and facing racism there foreshadowed his later leadership in protesting discrimination in the AFL.

6. Relationship between on-field and off-field: His success gave him a platform to challenge discrimination but faced backlash. Answer: His on-field success gave him influence to challenge racial issues, but he faced backlash (e.g., the GM's letter).

7. Five-TD game's significance: It's a franchise record. Answer: Set a franchise record shared with Jamaal Charles.

8. Choosing Texans over Steelers led to AFL stardom. Same as Q1. Answer: It allowed him to become a star in the AFL, leading to multiple awards and records.

9. Transition to Zales: He took a different path post-football. The article says he took a "refreshing" option, so significance is moving into a new career. Answer: Signified a shift to a non-football career after retiring.

10. After trade to Broncos, led in kickoff returns. Answer: He led the league in kickoff returns in 1965.

Wait, let me check each answer against the article again to ensure accuracy.

For Q2, the paradox is that he was popular in Dallas but traded after moving to KC. The article mentions his popularity in Dallas but the trade happened after the move. So yes.

Q3's irony is that despite the gaffe (choosing to kick off), they won. The answer should reflect that his decision didn't backfire because they still won. The article says the gaffe was "potentially costly" but the team held on. So the irony is that the decision worked out despite the risk.

Q6: The contradiction is between his success and the challenges. The article mentions he was told to "keep my mouth shut" after his protest, so the relationship is that his success made him a target for backlash when he spoke out.

All answers must be concise as per instructions. Let me structure them now.
