Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly as per the instructions. Let me start by going through each question and see what the article says.

1. **Question 1**: Scott Becker's role at Archegos. The article mentions that Scott Becker was the former chief risk officer and testified that it was his job to lie to the banks about the size of Archegos's stock holdings and borrowings so they would keep lending. The key here is his role's contribution to borrowing without explicit instructions from Hwang. The answer should be "chief risk officer".

2. **Question 2**: The witness who lied but wasn't instructed by Hwang. The article says Scott Becker was asked on cross-examination if Hwang told him to lie, and he said Hwang never did. So the answer is "Scott Becker".

3. **Question 3**: Trading strategy to influence stock valuations. The article states that Hwang instructed putting in big buy orders at the end of the day to drive up prices. The strategy here is "big buy orders at the end of the day".

4. **Question 4**: The defense's point against fraud allegations. The defense argued that Hwang and Archegos never "cashed out" after building positions, implying no fraud. So the aspect is "never cashed out".

5. **Question 5**: Financial metric manipulated for borrowing. The article mentions that banks used closing prices to determine borrowing. So the metric is "closing price".

6. **Question 6**: How the firm amassed large positions despite being small. The article says they used sophisticated derivatives and borrowed money from banks. The answer is "derivatives and borrowed money".

7. **Question 7**: Witness crucial for prosecution against Halligan. Timothy Haggerty's lawyer said without Becker's testimony, they had no case against his client. So the witness is "Scott Becker".

8. **Question 8**: Evidence beyond witness testimony. The prosecutors used internal emails, texts, and recorded conversations. The answer is "emails and text messages".

9. **Question 9**: What was artificially inflated by Hwang. The prosecutor said Hwang inflated stock prices to pump up Archegos' size. The answer is "stock prices".

10. **Question 10**: Legal action by former employees. The two key witnesses (Becker and Tomita) had pleaded guilty and cooperated. The action is "pleaded guilty and cooperated".

Wait, let me double-check each to ensure accuracy.

For question 7, the defense lawyer for Halligan (Timothy Haggerty) said that without Becker's testimony, they had no case. So the witness crucial for the prosecution's case against Halligan is indeed Scott Becker.

Everything else seems to align with the article. I think all answers are directly from the text, no inferences needed except where explicitly stated.
