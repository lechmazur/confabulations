Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article.

1. **Question 1:** The first question is about how the financial arrangement between Verisk and Hyundai reflects on consumer consent. The article mentions that Hyundai was paid for potential future earnings from customers who opted into the insurance feature. The senators criticized that companies sell data without consent. Since Hyundai's payment was based on opt-in users, the consent here is tied to the opt-in, but the article says Wyden called enrollment processes deceptive. However, the question is about the financial arrangement reflecting on consent's nature. The answer might be that it shows consent was conditional on user opt-in for potential future earnings, but the article states that Verisk paid Hyundai for that, implying consent was part of the agreement. But the exact phrasing in the question is a bit tricky. The answer is probably "Hyundai's payment was based on customers' opt-in consent for insurance features" but the article says "Verisk paid Hyundai for potential future earnings from customers who affirmatively opted into the insurance feature." So the answer would reflect that the financial arrangement relied on users opting in, so the nature of consent is that it's conditional on user opt-in for the insurance feature. But the question is about how this reflects on the nature of consumer consent. The article's letter says automakers should not sell data without consent, implying that here, consent was required (opt-in) but maybe the process was deceptive. However, the question is about the financial arrangement's reflection. The answer might be that it shows consent was tied to potential future earnings via opt-in. But the exact answer from the text says that the payment was for potential future earnings from opt-in customers. So the answer would be "based on customers' opt-in consent for insurance features."

2. **Question 2:** The data broker that's bankrupt and received precise location data from GM cars was Wejo. The article states that Wejo filed for bankruptcy and got data from 10 million GM cars every 1-3 seconds.

3. **Question 3:** Comparing GM's data sharing frequency (every 1-3 seconds) to traffic light changes. Traffic lights typically change every few minutes or so, like 30-60 seconds cycles but actual change intervals vary. The question is about frequency comparison. Since 1-3 seconds is much more frequent than traffic light changes (which are every minute or so), the answer would be "more frequent" but need exact phrasing. The article says "precise location of about 10 million G.M. cars up to every one to three seconds." Traffic light changes are much less frequent, so answer is "more frequent than traffic light changes."

4. **Question 4:** Connection between GM's past (Wejo) and present partners. The article says GM currently shares with a company they didn't identify, but previously had an investment in Wejo. The present partner isn't named, so maybe no direct corporate link. The answer would be "N/A" unless there's info. The article says GM had an investment in Wejo (past), and current partner is unnamed. So no info on current partner's relation to Wejo, so "N/A".

5. **Question 5:** Honda's data sharing was over four years. The average new car loan term is around 6 years (common terms are 60 months). So comparing 4 years to 6, it's shorter. Answer: "shorter than."

6. **Question 6:** Hyundai's agreement was six years. Typical warranty is 3-5 years. So six is longer. Answer: "longer than."

7. **Question 7:** GM now shares anonymized location data without seeking consent, whereas with Wejo they might have shared data but the article doesn't specify consent for Wejo. The article says currently, GM shares anonymized data without seeking consent, and the only opt-out is disabling internet. Previously with Wejo, it's unclear if they needed consent, but the current practice differs in not seeking consent. So the unique aspect is "does not seek customer consent."

8. **Question 8:** The senator (Wyden) called enrollment processes "deceptive" despite requiring opt-in. The companies were GM, Honda, Hyundai. The question asks which company's practices were described as deceptive. The article says "G.M. and Honda customers had to opt in to be included, but Mr. Wyden called the enrollment process 'deceptive.'" So the answer is "G.M. and Honda."

9. **Question 9:** Hyundai earned 61 cents per car. A typical oil change costs around $30-$50. So 61 cents is much less. Answer: "much less than."

10. **Question 10:** The Wejo exec mentioned windshield wipers data indicating weather or road conditions. The article says "We could see windshield wipers are on. Windshield wipers tell a huge story in vehicles." So the insight is that windshield wiper usage indicates rain or need for visibility, which helps in traffic analysis. The answer is "indicate weather conditions or road visibility needs."
