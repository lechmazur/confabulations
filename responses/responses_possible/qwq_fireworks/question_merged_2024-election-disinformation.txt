Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks how the change in the Democratic nominee affected conspiracy theories. The article mentions that after Kamala Harris replaced Biden, conspiracy theories surged. So the answer should be that the change caused an increase in conspiracy theories.

2. **Question 2**: The official facing budget cuts and reusing PSAs. The article says LaVonne Griffin-Valade in Oregon had her budget cut, leading to reusing old announcements and dealing with messages. That's the one.

3. **Question 3**: The tech used by an elections director to analyze misstatements. Justin Roebuck watched "2000 Mules" and took notes. The tech here is the movie itself, but the question is about technology. Wait, the article says he used Logically? Wait no, that's another part. Wait, the question says "technology" so maybe the AI company? Wait no, the question is about the director who analyzed the film. The technology here is the movie, but maybe the answer is the film "2000 Mules" since he watched it to note misstatements. The question is about the technology he used, but the film isn't a tech. Hmm. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The article says Justin Roebuck took notes while watching the film to analyze its misstatements. So the technology here would be the film itself? Or maybe the answer is the film's title. Since the question specifies technology, maybe it's the movie. Or perhaps the answer is "N/A" but the article says he used the film. Alternatively, maybe the AI company Logically is for another official. Wait, the next question mentions Oregon's official using Logically, but this one is about Justin Roebuck. Wait, the question is about the official who reviewed "2000 Mules" so the answer is the film "2000 Mules".

4. **Question 4**: The state where a county clerk had an existential crisis. The article mentions Justin Roebuck in Michigan's Ottawa County. So Michigan is the answer.

5. **Question 5**: The official accused by local Republicans of infringing free speech. The article says in Oregon, LaVonne Griffin-Valade's team hired Logically, and local Republicans (in Washington State?) said it was surveillance. Wait, the article says "local Republicans in Washington State" but the official in Oregon? Wait, the exact text: "Republicans in Washington State said that a similar contract with the secretary of state amounted to..." Hmm, maybe the question is about Oregon's official. The answer should be LaVonne Griffin-Valade in Oregon. Wait, the question says "local members of their own political party". But LaVonne is a Democrat, and the Republicans opposed her. So the answer is her, but the question says "local members of their own political party" which might not fit. Wait, the article says "local Republicans said the team's contract infringed..." so the official is a Democrat (Griffin-Valade) and the opposition is from Republicans, not her own party. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "local members of their own political party". But if the official is a Democrat and the opposition is Republicans, then it's not their own party. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Wait, the question might refer to another instance. Let me check again. The Oregon example: Ben Morris's team hired Logically, and local Republicans in Washington State said similar contracts were problematic. Wait, maybe the question refers to a different case. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the Oregon official, even if the opposition isn't from their own party. The question's wording might be a trick. The article says "local Republicans" opposed her, so the official is a Democrat, so the answer is LaVonne Griffin-Valade. The question says "local members of their own political party" but that's not the case here. So maybe this is a trick question where the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says "Republicans in Washington State said that a similar contract..." So maybe the question refers to the Washington State case, but the article doesn't name the official there. The question asks "which official" so perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, but the Oregon case's official (Griffin-Valade) was accused by Republicans, not her own party. So the answer would be N/A. But maybe I misread. Let me recheck the text. The article says "Republicans in Washington State said that a similar contract with the secretary of state amounted to..." So the official in Washington isn't mentioned here. The question is asking for the official who hired Logically and faced accusations from their own party members. Since in Oregon, the opposition is from the opposing party, then maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the Oregon official, and the "local members of their own political party" is a mistake, but the article says Republicans opposed her. Since the question might have a wrong premise, but the article doesn't mention the official's own party opposing, so answer is N/A. But the article says "local Republicans said the team's contract infringed on voters' free speech" so the official is a Democrat, so the answer is LaVonne Griffin-Valade. The question's wording might be incorrect, but the article's info is there. So answer is LaVonne Griffin-Valade.

6. **Question 6**: The official preparing for their first presidential election, took a certification course, and meets with peers. The article mentions Jazmin Wingert in Illinois. So her name and the state is Illinois.

7. **Question 7**: The state where the secretary refrained from budget requests due to politics. The article says Adrian Fontes in Arizona, a Democrat, mentions understanding the budget politics and refrained from certain asks. So Arizona.

8. **Question 8**: The elections official overwhelmed by conspiracy theories who reviewed Nextdoor forums. The article starts with Tate Fall in Cobb County, GA, who reviewed Nextdoor forums. So Tate Fall, but the question asks for the official's name? Wait, the question says "which elections official" so Tate Fall.

9. **Question 9**: The action taken by a bipartisan group regarding the AI assistant. The article says a bipartisan group wrote to Elon Musk about Grok chatbot providing wrong info. So the action was writing a letter.

10. **Question 10**: The state where a crisis exercise involved AI attacks before election deniers won primaries. The article mentions Arizona's Adrian Fontes did a crisis exercise with AI simulations, and Republicans won primary challenges. So Arizona.
