Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the strict format. Let me start with question 1.

1. The first question asks about the Supreme Court ruling in 2010 that led to super PACs and forced the DNC to adapt. Scanning through the article, I remember a mention of the Citizens United ruling. The text says, "The Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling in 2010 was a jolt for fund-raising. That decision cleared the way for unlimited independent expenditures..." So the answer here is Citizens United.

2. The second question is about the specific software referenced when discussing corporate landlords colluding. In the section about Harris's speech, it says, "Some corporate landlords collude with each other to set artificially high rental prices, often using algorithms in price-fixing software to do it," and adds "possibly a subtle reference to RealPage." So RealPage is the answer.

3. The third question asks what type of organization a professor said has a new lever in politics. The article states, "the money is up everywhere... billionaire donors had a new lever to pull in politics." The professor mentioned is Alvin Bernard Tillery Jr., so the answer is billionaire donors.

4. The fourth question is about the financial assistance initiative facing pushback. The article mentions Harris's proposal of up to $25,000 for first-time home buyers, but notes it's facing pushback because the issue is supply, not demand. So the answer is the $25,000 home buyer assistance.

5. Fifth question: the factor that's a tiebreaker when companies are deadlocked in contributions and lobbying. The expert Tevi Troy talks about CEOs being the decider. The text says, "C.E.O.s can be the decider. They can be the tiebreaker." So the answer is the CEO.

6. Sixth question asks for the tax-exempt organization contributing to mixed messages. The article mentions "tax-exempt 527 organizations" alongside super PACs. The specific type is 527 organizations.

7. Seventh question: which merger is at risk due to Harris's comments. The article states, "the proposed merger between Kroger and Albertsons" might be in trouble because of her comments on price gouging by some grocery chains. So Kroger and Albertsons' merger.

8. Eighth question: the Wall Street exec described as "barely a Democrat" is Jamie Dimon. The text mentions Jamie Dimon's formulation as an example, so his name is the answer.

9. Ninth question: the tech billionaire persona non grata on the left. The article says Elon Musk is going hard for Trump, making him persona non grata on the left. So Elon Musk.

10. Tenth question: the policy Harris spent little time on despite leaks. The leaked idea was about banning corporate price gouging, but she only addressed it briefly. The answer is banning corporate price gouging.
