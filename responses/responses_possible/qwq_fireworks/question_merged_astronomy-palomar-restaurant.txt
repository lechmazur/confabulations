Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the given article. Let's start with the first question.

1. The first question asks how the tradition of dining at the Monastery facilitated interactions between students and established astronomers according to Abhijit Saha. I remember reading that Saha mentioned the meals were a fixed time where they could sit with the "demigods" without an agenda. So the answer is that the meals provided a fixed time for them to interact, which students otherwise couldn't get.

2. The second question is about how dining contributed to professional development. The article says the meals were where knowledge and culture were communicated, even by osmosis. So the answer is that it allowed knowledge transfer and cultural understanding through interaction.

3. The third question is about the tradition bridging generations. The text mentions that the conversations let students absorb the culture from older astronomers, like stories of their predecessors. So the bridge was through passing down traditions and knowledge from older to younger generations.

4. The fourth question asks which astronomer dressed like a British lord but was from Missouri. The article mentions Edwin Hubble as the one who dressed like an old British lord despite being from Missouri. So the answer is Edwin Hubble.

5. The fifth question is about the object used to signal the kitchen, later seen as classist. The cowbell was on the table, and Carolyn Porco hated it as a symbol of old traditions. She later led Cassini, so the answer is the cowbell.

6. The sixth question is about the celestial object observed during an astronomer's last nights. Rudolph Minkowski observed 3C 295, which was a distant galaxy. The celebratory toast was about that. So the answer is 3C 295.

7. The seventh question asks which female astronomer was initially upstairs then allowed downstairs. Virginia Trimble was mentioned as one of the first women, starting upstairs and later allowed downstairs. So Virginia Trimble.

8. The eighth question is about the publication received by Sky & Telescope. The article says the European Southern Observatory's newsletter had menus in Chile. The publication was their quarterly newsletter.

9. The ninth question is the object studied by Minkowski that set a distance record. The article states 3C 295 was the most distant then known, so that's the answer.

10. The tenth question asks which astronomer, who called himself the janitor, shared the bourbon moment. The text mentions Allan Sandage introduced himself as the janitor and recounted the story with Minkowski. So Allan Sandage.

Wait, let me double-check each one against the text to ensure accuracy. For question 10, the story was told by Sandage about Minkowski. The celebratory toast was done by Minkowski, but the one sharing the story was Sandage. The question asks who shared the moment, so the answer should be Allan Sandage. Yes, that's correct.

Everything else seems to match. I need to make sure there's no missing info. The European Southern Observatory's newsletter is the answer for question 8. And the others are all directly from the text. Okay, I think that's all.
