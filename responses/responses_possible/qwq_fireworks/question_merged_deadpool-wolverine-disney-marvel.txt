Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and follow the strict instructions.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks which character's appearance suggests a self-aware nod to the franchise's history of poking fun. The article mentions Chris Evans appearing as Johnny Storm from the 2005 Fantastic Four, noting it's a hint the movie is in on the joke. So the answer should be Chris Evans.

2. **Question 2**: The article says Deadpool's development in the latest film has "sweetened dollops of sentimentality that feel more Disney than Deadpool." The original approach was subversive and less sentimental, so the contradiction here is the added sentimentality.

3. **Question 3**: The plot uses time travel, which Deadpool previously mocked as a deus ex machina. Now it's a central element, so the answer is time travel.

4. **Question 4**: The acquisition by Disney led to the film conforming to Marvel's norms, losing its satirical edge. The article states Disney's influence made it less daring, so the answer is the shift towards Marvel's formulaic approach.

5. **Question 5**: The article references Dolly Parton's "9 to 5" in the background of Deadpool 2, contrasting with the new film's tone. So Dolly Parton is the artist here.

6. **Question 6**: Earlier Deadpool movies joked about not having enough characters due to rights issues. Now they have many cameos like Elektra, Blade, Gambit. The reversal is the abundance of cameos instead of limited ones.

7. **Question 7**: The time travel device was criticized before but is central here. The article mentions "deus ex machina" as the device in question.

8. **Question 8**: The premise involves merging universes via the multiverse and Time Variance Authority, which is about integrating Disney's acquired characters into MCU. The business aspect is the merger of universes for business reasons.

9. **Question 9**: The film is compared to an extended Loki episode, showing it's part of the MCU now instead of being outside. The shift is aligning with Disney+ series like Loki, so the comparison highlights the franchise's integration into Marvel.

10. **Question 10**: Wolverine's return from death via multiverse is a typical Marvel plot device. The article points out his return from Logan's ending using the multiverse, so Wolverine is the answer.

I need to make sure all answers are directly from the text. Let me double-check each against the article:

1. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm is explicitly mentioned as a joke.
2. Sentimentality vs original subversion.
3. Time travel was a criticized device before but used here.
4. Disney's influence leading to formulaic Marvel style.
5. Dolly Parton's song in the background.
6. Cameos contrast with earlier jokes about limited characters.
7. Deus ex machina via time travel.
8. Multiverse and merging universes for business.
9. Comparison to Loki series shows alignment with MCU.
10. Wolverine's return via multiverse is the plot device example.

Everything seems covered. Now format the answers properly without any extra text.
