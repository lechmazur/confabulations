Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. 

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks how a security guard's relationship with "The Potato Eaters" reflects a deeper personal narrative paralleling van Gogh's struggles. The Amsterdam guard mentions they had an accident at 12, couldn't play sports, and found refuge in art, especially van Gogh. Van Gogh's own struggles and the guard's childhood challenges connect here. So the answer should link their personal struggle and refuge in van Gogh's art.

2. **Question 2**: The Paris guard left a stressful graphic design job to work at the museum, admiring Monet's water lilies. The theme is seeking solace in art. The answer should state that the transition reflects finding peace through Monet's nature-focused art after stress from their previous job.

3. **Question 3**: The London guard talks about Gilbert's "Centrepiece" showing the artist's life and English identity, and mentions timeless connections across eras. The answer should note that the guard sees art as a timeless bridge between people, regardless of time or culture.

4. **Question 4**: The Malaga guard mentions wanting to study something else (maybe therapy) but works at the Picasso museum. They relate Picasso's breaking rules to their own aspirations. The answer is that Picasso's rebelliousness mirrors their unfulfilled desire to be a therapist or study emotions.

5. **Question 5**: The New York guard made a paper airplane from tardiness slips. So the answer is the New York Met guard.

6. **Question 6**: The Amsterdam guard saw van Gogh's work as a child and now works there, seeing van Gogh as a "childhood friend." The perspective shift is from initial fascination to a renewed connection through employment.

7. **Question 7**: The V&A guard graduated during the 2010 downturn, struggled to find jobs, but now finds job satisfaction there. The connection is economic hardship post-grad leading to appreciation for their current role.

8. **Question 8**: The V&A guard's job allows learning and inspiration, aligning with their creative goals. The favorite artwork's timeless connection reflects their view that creativity is worthwhile despite life's pressures.

9. **Question 9**: The Amsterdam guard's childhood accident and van Gogh's struggles are linked. The guard found refuge in art during their tough time, similar to van Gogh's own battles.

10. **Question 10**: The Amsterdam guard says "The Potato Eaters" introduced them to van Gogh. So the painting's name is "The Potato Eaters."

Now, check each answer against the text to ensure accuracy and that no external info is used. If any question isn't directly addressed, mark N/A. Let's see:

- All answers except maybe question 1 and 9 need precise phrasing. The article states the Amsterdam guard's accident led them to art, and van Gogh's struggles are mentioned. So yes, they parallel. 

Everything else seems covered. Let's format the answers as per instructions.
