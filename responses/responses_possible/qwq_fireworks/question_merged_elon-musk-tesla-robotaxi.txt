Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions that Tesla reported a 45% drop in second-quarter profit and delayed the robotaxi design unveiling. It also states that Musk is shifting focus to robotaxis. The connection here is that the profit drop might be a reason Musk is emphasizing robotaxis to redirect attention. The article says "It's a convenient reorientation when you're having a hard time selling cars," so the answer is that the profit drop is used as a reason to pivot focus to robotaxis.

2. **Question 2**: The article contrasts Tesla's approach with Waymo. Tesla uses no detailed maps, while Waymo relies on thorough mapping. So the answer is Waymo.

3. **Question 3**: A former Waymo exec, Krafcik, says Waymo could be profitable in markets like SF after accounting for certain costs but not R&D. The financial metric is "profitable this year in markets like San Francisco, after accounting for the cost of vehicles, maintenance, energy, hardware, insurance and personnel." The answer is "profitable this year in markets like San Francisco" excluding R&D.

4. **Question 4**: Musk claims Tesla is close to perfecting robotaxis, but the article says current systems require driver intervention. The contradiction is that the Full Self-Driving option still needs drivers to be ready, so the answer is that drivers must intervene often.

5. **Question 5**: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigated and found the systems didn't ensure driver attentiveness. So the agency is NHTSA.

6. **Question 6**: Robinson mentions if too many cars are in the service, prices drop. The issue is market flooding leading to lower profits. Answer is "flood the market, and prices are going to come down."

7. **Question 7**: The profit drop and delayed robotaxi design (moved to October from August) undermine Musk's narrative of growth through robotaxis. The answer is the delayed unveiling and profit drop.

8. **Question 8**: Waymo got a $5B investment from Alphabet despite unclear business model. The article says Alphabet invested another $5B. Answer is Waymo.

9. **Question 9**: The expert from Carnegie Mellon (Koopman) says Tesla uses cameras instead of lidar. The answer is Tesla uses cameras instead of lidar sensors.

10. **Question 10**: Cruise halted service after an accident, then resumed testing. This shows operational issues, casting doubt. The answer is Cruise's accident and pause in service.
