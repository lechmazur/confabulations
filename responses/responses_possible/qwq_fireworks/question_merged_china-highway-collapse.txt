Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question asks about the effectiveness of China's emergency response system by comparing the resources deployed in the recent collapse to the previous incident. The article mentions that for the recent collapse, they deployed 869 people, 93 vehicles, 41 drones, 20 boats, and a sonar system. The previous incident in May had similar instructions from leaders. The article doesn't directly compare effectiveness, just states resources were deployed. So maybe the inference is that they are taking it seriously, but since there's no direct comparison data, maybe it's N/A? Wait, the question is about an inference based on the resources. Since they used significant resources, perhaps it suggests effectiveness, but the article doesn't say if it was effective. Hmm, maybe the answer is that high-level involvement and resources indicate a strong response effort, but effectiveness isn't assessed. The question is about effectiveness, so maybe N/A? Wait the article says both Xi and Li ordered all-out efforts, similar to the previous. But the previous incident had 48 deaths, and the current one has 12 found and 18 missing. Not sure if that's effectiveness. The question is about the comparison of resources. The article doesn't mention resources from the previous, except that leaders gave similar orders. Wait the May 1st incident only mentions that Xi ordered attention to risks, but not the resources deployed. So maybe there's no direct comparison of resources between the two. Therefore, the answer would be N/A because the article doesn't provide the resources used in the previous incident. So answer 1 is N/A.

2. The involvement of high-level leaders (Xi and Li) suggests that infrastructure failures are politically significant. Since they ordered all-out efforts, maybe it shows that such failures have political implications, possibly affecting their reputation or governance. So the answer would be that it indicates political implications, showing that infrastructure failures are taken very seriously by top leadership, implying political accountability.

3. The article mentions that Xi's father was from a rural area near the tomb of Emperor Qin Shihuang, and Xi spent his teenage years in Shaanxi. The disaster happened in Shaanxi. So the leader's childhood connection is Xi Jinping's. The question is which leader's childhood connection influenced the response. Since Xi is the top leader, maybe his personal connection influenced the response. The answer would be Xi Jinping.

4. The article states that China has rapidly expanded expressways, building twice as many as the US's interstate system in 20 years. The recent failures are in less than three months. So the frequency relates to the rapid expansion, perhaps leading to rushed construction or oversight. The answer would be that frequent failures correlate with rapid expansion, suggesting possible rushed construction or inadequate oversight.

5. China's bridge achievements (81 of top 100 tallest) but vulnerability to extreme weather (like cloudbursts causing disasters). The correlation is that despite construction achievements, extreme weather causes vulnerabilities. So the answer is that high construction achievements coexist with vulnerability to extreme weather events like heavy rains.

6. The article says after the May incident, Xi ordered local governments to pay more attention to identifying risks. So the indirect evidence is the directive after the previous incident, suggesting a shift towards better risk identification. The answer would be the leaders' orders post-previous incident indicate a shift towards better risk identification.

7. The historical period connecting Xi to the region: he went to Shaanxi during the Cultural Revolution starting in 1966 and spent his teenage years there. The Cultural Revolution was from 1966-1976. So the historical period is the Cultural Revolution.

8. The location is in Shaanxi, where Xi'an is. Xi'an is famous for the Terracotta Warriors (ancient history) and Xi's personal connections (modern political). So the answer is it's near an ancient site (Terracotta) and Xi's political background.

9. The timing is during the rainy season (late spring to late summer). The incidents happened during heavy rain. Future planning might consider seasonal factors, so the answer is that incidents during the rainy season may lead to seasonal planning adjustments.

10. The scale of infrastructure (massive) contrasts with vulnerability to natural disasters (floods, landslides). The answer is that despite large-scale infrastructure, natural disasters like floods and landslides still cause vulnerabilities.

Now, let me check each question again for exactness and ensure answers are based solely on the text.

1. The article doesn't compare resources between the two incidents. The previous incident's resources aren't mentioned. So N/A.

2. The leaders' involvement suggests political implications; answer is their involvement shows political significance.

3. Xi's childhood in Shaanxi, so answer is Xi Jinping.

4. Rapid expansion (twice US's) and recent failures indicate correlation. Answer: frequent failures relate to rapid expansion.

5. Bridges achievements vs. extreme weather causing disasters. Answer: correlation between construction achievements and vulnerability to extreme weather.

6. After May incident, Xi ordered attention to risks. So shift in approach is inferred. Answer: orders post-previous disaster suggest shift.

7. Xi's connection via his time during Cultural Revolution. Answer: Cultural Revolution period.

8. Location in Shaanxi near Terracotta and Xi's background. Answer: links to ancient history (Terracotta) and modern politics (Xi).

9. Timing during rainy season may lead to planning adjustments. Answer: rainy season timing may influence future planning.

10. Scale vs vulnerability. Answer: large-scale infrastructure but still vulnerable to disasters.
