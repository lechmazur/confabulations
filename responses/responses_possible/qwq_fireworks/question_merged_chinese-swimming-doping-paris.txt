Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions the IOC demanded a change in Salt Lake City's bid agreement for the 2034 Winter Games, giving them leverage to pull the event if the U.S. continues criticizing WADA. The answer should link the criticism to the IOC's condition for Salt Lake City's hosting rights.

2. **Question 2:** The FBI and Justice Department's investigation is part of the U.S. response to WADA's handling of the Chinese doping cases. The article states that U.S. officials considered withholding funding, so the significance is about accountability and potential sanctions against WADA.

3. **Question 3:** The article connects WADA criticism to geopolitical tensions by noting the U.S. and Chinese rivalry in sports, especially with the FBI's involvement and the IOC's pressure on Salt Lake City, indicating broader political implications.

4. **Question 4:** Withholding funding could undermine WADA's effectiveness. The article says U.S. officials were open to this, implying it might weaken WADA's operations, but the exact consequence isn't detailed beyond the stated intent.

5. **Question 5:** The IOC's role is shown through their demand for Salt Lake City's bid change, using it to manage criticism by tying it to the U.S.'s continued participation, thus balancing pressure between member nations and WADA.

6. **Question 6:** The timing of the IOC's demand is just before the Paris Games, which might be to address ongoing controversies and set a precedent for future Games' conditions, ensuring compliance with their stance on WADA.

7. **Question 7:** The FBI investigation could lead to stricter scrutiny or policy changes in future Olympics, as it highlights systemic issues in doping control, potentially altering how future Games handle anti-doping measures.

8. **Question 8:** The article shows enforcement complexity through inconsistent testing (China tested more but still doubted), athletes' distrust (Dressel's "No"), and WADA's defended but criticized decisions, illustrating challenges in maintaining integrity.

9. **Question 9:** Katie Ledecky's statement about wanting change for the future implies that current controversies may push for stricter policies or reforms in antidoping systems to regain trust.

10. **Question 10:** Caeleb Dressel said "No" when asked about faith in anti-doping systems. The average testing for U.S. swimmers is 6 times. Since "No" is one word and the question asks for the same number of words as the average (6?), wait, the average for U.S. is 6, but the question says "using the same number of words as the average testing frequency". Wait, the average testing frequency for U.S. is 6 times, so the number of words should be 6? But Dressel's answer was one word. Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check the article again. The question says "using the same number of words as the average testing frequency for U.S. swimmers this year". The average testing frequency for U.S. is 6 times. The number of words in his answer must equal 6. But Dressel's answer was "No", which is 1 word. So that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The question is asking which swimmer used the same number of words as the average testing frequency (6) for U.S. swimmers. The article says Dressel answered with one word. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, but the article says "he offered a one-word response: 'No.'" So the answer would be Dressel, but the question asks for the same number of words as the average testing frequency (6). Since 1 â‰ 6, maybe it's N/A? Wait, maybe I missed someone else. Let me check again. The article only mentions Dressel's one-word answer. The other swimmers like Stubblety-Cook and others didn't have their exact word counts mentioned. So the answer must be N/A? Or maybe the question is a trick where "average testing frequency for U.S. swimmers this year" is 6, so the number of words in the answer must be 6. Since no one else is mentioned with a 6-word response, the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "using the same number of words as the average testing frequency". So if average testing frequency is 6 times, does that mean the number of words should be 6? If so, then the answer is N/A because the only response mentioned is Dressel's one-word "No". Therefore, maybe the answer is N/A. But the question might have a different interpretation. Wait, perhaps the average testing frequency is 6 tests, so the number of words in the answer should be 6. Since Dressel's answer was one word, that doesn't match. But maybe the question is asking which swimmer's answer had the same number of words as the average testing frequency (6). Since no one else's answer is specified, the answer is N/A. However, the question might have a different angle. Let me check again. The question says "the same number of words as the average testing frequency for U.S. swimmers this year". The average testing frequency for U.S. swimmers is 6 times. So the number of words in the response should be 6. The only swimmer mentioned with their exact response is Dressel, who said "No" (1 word). Therefore, the correct answer would be N/A. Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe "testing frequency" refers to the number of tests, not the number of words. The question is asking for the swimmer who expressed skepticism with the same number of words as the average number of tests U.S. swimmers underwent. So average tests for U.S. is 6, so the answer must be a response with 6 words. But the article only mentions Dressel's one-word answer. Therefore, the answer is N/A. But the article says "Caeleb Dressel" used one word. The question might be a trick. Alternatively, maybe the question is a play on words. Let me re-read the question again: "Which Olympic swimmer expressed skepticism about anti-doping measures using the same number of words as the average testing frequency for U.S. swimmers this year?" The average testing frequency for U.S. is 6 tests. So the number of words in the swimmer's statement should be 6. Since Dressel used one word, perhaps no one else is mentioned, so the answer is N/A. But maybe the answer is Dressel because the question is asking for the same number of words as the average (6), but he used one word. That doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the exact numbers again. The article states: "Chinese swimmers have been tested on average 21 times since the start of the year, World Aquatics said, compared with an average of four times for Australian swimmers and an average of six times for U.S. swimmers." So U.S. average is 6 tests. The question wants the swimmer who expressed skepticism with a statement that has the same number of words as 6. The only swimmer's response mentioned is Dressel's "No" (1 word). So answer is N/A. But the question might have a different angle. Wait, maybe "average testing frequency" is per swimmer, so the number is 6, and the answer is "Caeleb Dressel" even though it's one word? That wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick where the answer is "No" because it's one word and the average tests for U.S. is 6, but that doesn't align. Maybe the question has a typo? Alternatively, maybe I misread. Let me check the article again for any other swimmer's responses. The article mentions Katie Ledecky saying she hopes others competed clean, but her response isn't word-counted. Zac Stubblety-Cook discussed protests but again no word count. The only exact word count is Dressel's one-word "No". So the answer must be N/A because no swimmer's response matches 6 words. Therefore, question 10's answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe the question is referring to the number of tests (6) and the swimmer used the same number of words (6 words). Since none are mentioned, it's N/A. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a play on numbers, but I can't see it. So the answer is N/A for question 10.
