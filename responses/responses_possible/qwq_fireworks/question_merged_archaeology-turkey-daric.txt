Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I use only the information from the provided article and follow the strict instructions.

1. **Question 1**: If the Notion hoard had been discovered during Alexander's conquest, what would've happened? The article says Alexander and his successors melted down existing gold coins. So the answer is they'd have been melted down.

2. **Question 2**: Why wasn't the hoard retrieved? The article states Dr. Ratte says only the gravest misfortune explains it. So the answer is a disaster or misfortune.

3. **Question 3**: If buried after Athenian evacuation, what events influenced it? The Peloponnesian War and Athenian evacuation are mentioned. So those events likely influenced the decision.

4. **Question 4**: Why not during Xenophon's time? The hoard was buried in 427 or later, but Xenophon's mercenary period was 401-400 BC. The article mentions the hoard was from the time of the Peloponnesian War (431-404 BC), but the exact burial time is before 387 BC when Persia retook the area. Since Xenophon was later, the hoard was already buried by then. So the answer is the hoard was already buried before his activities.

5. **Question 5**: What happened to the soldier? The article implies he faced a disaster preventing retrieval. So the soldier likely died or couldn't return due to disaster.

6. **Question 6**: How does the hoard change understanding of Peloponnesian War alliances? The article mentions the hoard's context helps fine-tune Achaemenid coin chronology, but does it directly relate to alliances? The hoard's presence might show Persian influence or mercenary payments, so maybe indicating alliances between Greeks and Persians during the war. But the article says "helps fine-tune the chronology" not directly alliances. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the article mentions the hoard's time period around the Peloponnesian events, so maybe it shows Athenian expulsion and Persian presence. The question asks how it alters understanding of political alliances. The article states that the hoard might be connected to 427 BC when Athenians expelled Persian sympathizers. So maybe the hoard's presence shows ongoing Persian influence or mercenary activity during the war. The answer might be that it suggests mercenary involvement with Persians during the war, affecting alliances. But the article says "the hoard might have been connected to the events of 427 BC" when Athenians attacked Persian sympathizers. So the hoard's existence could indicate that some mercenaries were pro-Persian, hence altering understanding of alliances. So answer: indicates Persian-allied mercenaries during the war.

Wait, the article says "the Persian sympathizers were then expelled" so the hoard's owner might have been a mercenary who was on the losing side, so the hoard's existence shows that such mercenaries were present. So the discovery might highlight the presence of pro-Persian forces in the area during the Peloponnesian War, thus altering our understanding of alliances. So answer: indicates presence of Persian-allied mercenaries during the Peloponnesian War.

7. **Question 7**: How does Paches' actions relate to Notion's political changes? The article says after Paches expelled the pro-Persian troops in 427 BC, Notion was reorganized under Athenian supervision. So the answer is that Paches' actions led to Athenian control.

8. **Question 8**: Why was the hoard preserved despite turmoil? The article says because of disaster preventing retrieval. So the answer is due to a disaster preventing the owner from returning.

9. **Question 9**: How does the hoard help Achaemenid coin chronology? The article directly states that the hoard's context helps "fine-tune the chronology of Achaemenid gold coinage." So the answer is it helps date Achaemenid gold coins.

10. **Question 10**: How does the hoard's context relate to modern geopolitical tensions? The article mentions the Notion harbor was a departure point for Syrian refugees. So the answer is modern refugee crisis parallels ancient border tensions.

Now, checking each against the text to ensure accuracy.

1. Correct, article says Alexander melted down darics.

2. Correct, Ratte says disaster.

3. The Athenian evacuation was in 427's aftermath? Wait, the article says in 427 BC, Paches attacked Notion and expelled the pro-Persians, then Notion was reorganized under Athenian supervision. Later, in 404 BC (after Peloponnesian War ended in 404?), Athenians were defeated by Spartans. The hoard could have been buried after the evacuation, so events like Athenian expulsion or ongoing conflicts. The answer is the events of the Peloponnesian War (specifically the Athenian evacuation and subsequent insecurity).

4. The hoard was buried in the time of the Peloponnesian War (431â€“404 BC). Xenophon's time was 401-400 BC. The article says the hoard was "tucked away" around the same time as Xenophon's period, but the hoard was found in an older building from the third century BC. Wait, the article says the hoard was buried in the late fifth century BC (when the soldier was there), so around 427 BC or later. Xenophon's activities were in 401-400 BC. The article states "the Notion hoard was tucked away" during the same time as Xenophon's mercenary period (401-400 BC). Wait, the article says "the same time period when the Notion hoard was tucked away. In 387 B.C., within a generation after the Athenians were defeated by the Spartans..." Wait, the hoard was buried in the late fifth century (427 BC era), so the hoard was buried before Xenophon's time (401 BC). Wait the article says "the Notion hoard was tucked away" the same time as Xenophon's period (401-400 BC). Wait, the article says: "Many Greeks fought for the Persian Empire, including the Athenian historian Xenophon, who was an active mercenary for the Persian prince Cyrus the Younger from 401 B.C. to 400 B.C. -- the same time period when the Notion hoard was tucked away."

Ah! So the hoard was buried during the time Xenophon was active (401-400 BC). Therefore, the question asks why it's unlikely the hoard was buried during Xenophon's time. Wait, the question is "Why is it unlikely that the Notion hoard was buried during the time of Xenophon's mercenary activities for Cyrus the Younger?" Wait, the article says that the hoard was buried during the same time as Xenophon's activities. So the answer would be that it actually was buried during that time. Wait, but the question is phrased as "why is it unlikely"? Wait, perhaps a mistake here. Wait, the question says: "Given the historical timeline, why is it unlikely that the Notion hoard was buried during the time of Xenophon's mercenary activities for Cyrus the Younger?" But according to the article, the hoard was tucked away during that time. Therefore, the question is wrong, so the answer would be N/A. Wait, no, maybe I misread. Let me check again.

The article says: "the Notion hoard was tucked away" the same time as Xenophon's period (401-400 BC). So if the question is asking why it's unlikely the hoard was buried during that time, that would be conflicting. Therefore, the correct answer should be that it is likely, but the question is the opposite. Wait, the question is phrased as: "Why is it unlikely that the Notion hoard was buried during the time of Xenophon's mercenary activities for Cyrus the Younger?" But according to the article, the hoard was buried during that time. Therefore, the answer should be N/A because the article says it was during that time. Wait, but maybe the hoard was buried earlier? Let me check again.

The article states: "In 387 B.C., within a generation after the Athenians were defeated by the Spartans..." So the hoard was buried in the late fifth century, which includes the period of Xenophon's activities (401-400). The article says the hoard was buried in the time when the soldier was there, which was in the late fifth century (427 BC or later). The article explicitly says that the hoard was tucked away during the same time as Xenophon's mercenary period. Therefore, the question is asking why it's unlikely, which contradicts the article. Therefore, the answer must be N/A because the article says it was during that time. Wait, maybe the hoard was buried earlier than Xenophon's time? Let me check again.

The article says: "the Notion hoard was tucked away" the same time as Xenophon's period (401-400). Therefore, the question is asking why it's unlikely, which is incorrect. So the answer is N/A. But perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, the article says the hoard was buried in the late fifth century B.C. (the soldier's time), which includes 427 BC (when the Athenian general Paches attacked) and up to 401 BC. The hoard was buried at some point in that period. The question is why it's unlikely to have been during Xenophon's time (401-400). The article says it was during that time. Therefore, the question is incorrect, so answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the hoard was buried before that? The article states that the hoard was buried "in the time of the Peloponnesian War" (which ended in 404 BC). Xenophon's time was after the war's end? The Peloponnesian War ended in 404 BC, so Xenophon's activities (401-400) were during the war's aftermath. The article says the hoard was buried during the war period. Therefore, it could be during Xenophon's time. Therefore, the question's premise is wrong, so answer N/A. Alternatively, perhaps the article says the hoard was buried in 427, so before Xenophon. Wait, the article says the hoard might be connected to 427 BC, but also mentions the same time as Xenophon. Hmm, conflicting? Let me recheck the exact wording.

The article says: "Many Greeks fought for the Persian Empire, including the Athenian historian Xenophon, who was an active mercenary for the Persian prince Cyrus the Younger from 401 B.C. to 400 B.C. -- the same time period when the Notion hoard was tucked away."

Therefore, the hoard was tucked away during that time (401-400 BC). Therefore, the question asks why it's unlikely that it was buried during that time. That's a contradiction. So the answer must be N/A because the article states it was during that time. But the question is phrased as "why is it unlikely", which is opposite. Therefore, the answer is N/A because the article says it was during that time, so the question's premise is wrong. Wait, but maybe the hoard was buried before? The article says "the Notion hoard might have been connected to the events of 427 B.C., or later, with the Athenian evacuation." So the hoard could have been buried in 427 or later, up to 401. The exact time isn't certain, but the article says it was during Xenophon's time. Therefore, the question is incorrect, so answer N/A. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that the hoard was buried before Xenophon's activities (i.e., in 427 BC), so the question is why it's unlikely to have been during Xenophon's time. But the article says it was during that time. Hmm, conflicting. Maybe the article says the hoard was buried during the time of the Peloponnesian War (up to 404 BC), and Xenophon was after 404? Wait, the Peloponnesian War ended in 404 BC. Xenophon's activities were in 401-400, which is during the war's aftermath. The article says the hoard was buried during the same time as Xenophon's mercenary period, so the answer to question 4 is N/A because the article says it was during that time, making the question's premise incorrect. Therefore, the answer must be N/A. Wait, but maybe the question is about the hoard being buried during Xenophon's specific activities (401-400), but the hoard could have been buried earlier (like 427). The article says "the Notion hoard might have been connected to the events of 427 B.C., or later, with the Athenian evacuation." The "later" could include 401-400. Since the article says the hoard was tucked away during Xenophon's time, the question is why it's unlikely, which is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the hoard was buried before the Athenian evacuation, but the evacuation was in 427? The article says after 427, Notion was under Athenian control until 387. The Athenian evacuation might refer to their leaving in 427 after expelling the Persians. So the hoard could have been buried either in 427 or later, but the article's mention of Xenophon's time (401-400) as the same period as the hoard's burial would mean it's possible. So the question is asking why it's unlikely, which contradicts the article. Therefore, the answer is N/A. Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to re-express the answer as N/A because the article states it was during that time. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the hoard being buried during Xenophon's mercenary activities (401-400), but the article says the hoard was buried in the late fifth century (which includes that period). Therefore, the answer to question 4 is N/A because the article says it was during that time, so the question's premise is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the article says the hoard was buried before that. Wait, the article says the hoard was buried in the late fifth century B.C. (the soldier's time), which includes 427 and up to 400. Therefore, the question's premise is incorrect, so the answer is N/A. 

Alternatively, maybe the hoard was buried in 427, so before Xenophon's time (401), making it unlikely. The article says the hoard might have been connected to 427 or later (Athenian evacuation). The "later" could be after 427 but before 400. The exact time isn't specified, but the article links it to Xenophon's period. So the question's answer would be that it's possible, but the question is why it's unlikely. Therefore, perhaps the answer is N/A because the article doesn't state it's unlikely but rather possible. Alternatively, maybe the article says it was buried in 427, so before Xenophon. Then the answer would be that the hoard was buried in 427, before Xenophon's 401-400 period. The article says "the hoard might have been connected to the events of 427 B.C., or later, with the Athenian evacuation." The "later" could mean after 427 but before 400. So the hoard could have been buried in 427 or later, up to 400. Since Xenophon's time is 401-400, which is after 427, the hoard could have been buried in either 427 or in 400. Therefore, it's possible it was during Xenophon's time. The article states it was during that time. Therefore, the question's premise is wrong, so the answer is N/A. 

I'm getting confused here. Let me try to proceed and see if other answers are clear. Maybe I'll come back to this question later.

5. The soldier likely died or couldn't return due to disaster. The article says "only the gravest misfortune can explain the preservation."

6. The hoard's discovery might show Persian mercenaries during the Peloponnesian War, so altering understanding of alliances. The article says the hoard might be connected to 427 when Athenians expelled Persian sympathizers, indicating that Persian-aligned forces existed there, hence alliances.

7. Paches' actions led to Athenian control. The article says after expelling pro-Persians, Notion was reorganized under Athenian supervision. So answer: led to Athenian control.

8. Preservation due to disaster preventing retrieval. The article states disaster.

9. Helps fine-tune the chronology. The article directly says that.

10. The modern refugee crisis parallels ancient border tensions. The article mentions the harbor was a departure point for Syrian refugees, so answer: parallels with modern refugee crisis.

Back to question 4: The article says the hoard was tucked away during the same time as Xenophon's mercenary period (401-400). Therefore, the question asks why it's unlikely, which contradicts the article. Hence, answer is N/A because the article says it was during that time, making the question's premise wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the hoard was buried earlier (427), so the answer is that it was buried earlier (before 401), so the answer would be "it was buried in 427 BC, before Xenophon's activities (401-400 BC)." But the article says it could be connected to 427 or later, so "later" could include 401. Since the article states it was during Xenophon's time, the answer must be N/A. I think the answer is N/A because the article explicitly links the hoard's burial to that time period, making the question's assumption incorrect.

Wait, the question says "Given the historical timeline, why is it unlikely that the Notion hoard was buried during the time of Xenophon's mercenary activities for Cyrus the Younger?" But the article says it was during that time. So the answer is N/A because the question's premise is wrong. The article states it was during that time, so the answer to the question's "why unlikely" is N/A. 

Alright, proceeding with these answers.
