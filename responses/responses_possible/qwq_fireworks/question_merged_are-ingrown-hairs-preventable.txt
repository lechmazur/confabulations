Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by reading through the questions again and then check the article for each answer.

1. **Primary reason shaving causes more ingrown hairs than waxing/plucking?** The article mentions that shaving breaks off hair just under the skin, pushing it into the skin's layers and interfering with growth. So the answer should be about cutting hair too close, causing it to get trapped.

2. **Curly hair using multi-blade razor against the grain?** The article says multi-blade razors cut too close, and curly hair is more prone. Shaving against the grain might increase the chance of ingrown hairs. The likely outcome would be more ingrown hairs.

3. **Coarse hair shaved before full regrowth?** The article states that shaving before hair grows back increases ingrowns, especially for coarse hair. So the answer connects frequent shaving before regrowth with coarse hair leading to more ingrowns.

4. **Razor blade replacement frequency and ingrowns?** The article says to replace blades frequently. So more frequent replacement reduces likelihood, implying that dull blades might cause more ingrown hairs.

5. **Least likely method with occasional regrowth?** The article mentions depilatory creams as less likely to cause ingrown hairs. Laser and electrolysis have occasional regrowth but are more permanent. So depilatory creams?

6. **Mechanism of multi-blade vs electric?** Multi-blades cut too close, pushing hair into skin. Electric razors don't cut as close. The mechanism is cutting too close causing entrapment.

7. **Straight vs curly hair?** Curly hair is more prone because it curls back in. Straight hair might not bend into the skin as much, so less ingrown chance.

8. **Physiological process for shaving vs others?** Shaving cuts hair under skin, causing it to get trapped. Waxing removes from the root, so hair doesn't curl back as much.

9. **Frequent blade changes vs old blades?** Fresh blades cut cleaner, reducing irritation and maybe less chance of hair getting trapped. Dull blades might cause more tugging or uneven cuts, leading to ingrowns.

10. **Waxing infrequently vs daily shaving?** Shaving daily cuts hair close repeatedly, while waxing less often allows hair to grow longer, so less chance of trapped hair each time.

Now, check each answer against the article to ensure accuracy and that there's no missing info. Make sure not to infer beyond the text. For example, depilatory creams are mentioned as less likely, so that's the answer for question 5. Laser/electrolysis have occasional regrowth but are permanent methods, but the question asks for the method that's least likely to cause ingrowns and allows occasional regrowth. Wait, the article says depilatory creams are less likely to cause bumps. Laser/electrolysis have occasional regrowth but the article mentions they are more permanent. The question asks which method is least likely to cause ingrown hairs yet allows occasional regrowth. The article says depilatory creams are less likely. So the answer would be depilatory creams. Wait the article says "depilatory creams, which dissolve the hair and are less likely to cause the bumps". So that's correct for question 5. 

Another check: Question 8 asks for the physiological process. The article says shaving cuts hair under skin, pushing it into layers. So the process is cutting the hair close, causing it to be trapped under skin. 

Question 10: Waxing infrequently vs daily shaving. Since shaving daily cuts hair close each time, while waxing less often allows hair to grow longer before removal, so less chance of ingrowns each time. So the answer is that shaving daily cuts hair too close repeatedly, increasing ingrowns, while infrequent waxing doesn't cut as close each time.
