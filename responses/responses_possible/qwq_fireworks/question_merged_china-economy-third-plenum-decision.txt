Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure each answer is strictly from the text and follows the instructions. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **First question**: The Central Committee's plan mentions expanding consumption mechanisms briefly. The article says they "doubled down on industrial policy" and the consumption part was "brief and cautious". So the underlying message is that industrial policy is still prioritized over consumer spending. Answer should reflect that balance leans towards industrial policy.

2. **Second question**: The emphasis on high-tech manufacturing relates to historical approaches. The article mentions "Made in China 2025 plan" which is a decade-old strategy for high-tech self-reliance. So the current plan continues the historical focus. The answer is that it's a continuation of past strategies.

3. **Third question**: The plan expands local taxes without a real estate tax. Previously, a 2013 plan had a property tax that wasn't implemented. Now they're shifting to central government responsibility. This suggests avoiding the controversial real estate tax and relying more on central funding. The strategy reflects moving away from local property taxes, possibly to avoid backlash or because local governments are in debt.

4. **Fourth question**: Balancing economic recovery with national security. The article states the EU chamber's view that the priority is balancing economic recovery and national security. Xi's statement mentions external suppression, so the plan's focus on security shows they prioritize both together. The answer is that they balance them as immediate priorities.

5. **Fifth question**: Which sector not addressed could undermine the plan? The real estate sector is mentioned as having plunging prices and unfinished apartments, but the plan didn't address it directly. So real estate is the sector not addressed, which could undermine effectiveness.

6. **Sixth question**: The interest rate cut's indirect effect on housing. The rate cut makes borrowing easier, which might help housing indirectly by making loans cheaper, even though the plan didn't mention it directly. The answer is that it could ease borrowing costs, indirectly helping.

7. **Seventh question**: The brief mention of consumption vs the overall focus. The main focus is on industrial policies and investment, so the consumption part contradicts that focus by being minor. The contradiction is that the plan's main thrust isn't on consumption despite the mention.

8. **Eighth question**: Retirement age reform and social stability. The plan mentions raising retirement age cautiously, but social media criticism shows potential instability. The reform is done prudently to maintain stability, so it reflects concern for it.

9. **Ninth question**: National security impacting consumer spending policies. If security is a priority, economic policies might be constrained. The EU statement says they balance both, so security concerns might limit consumer-focused policies. Answer is that security concerns could constrain consumer spending initiatives.

10. **Tenth question**: Connection between consumer spending and strategic industries. The plan promotes strategic industries like high-tech, which might be prioritized over consumer-driven growth. The connection is that promoting industries takes precedence over boosting consumption, so they're linked by prioritizing production over consumption.

Now, check each answer against the text to ensure they're directly supported. Make sure no external knowledge is used. If any question can't be answered, put N/A. Let me verify each point again quickly.
