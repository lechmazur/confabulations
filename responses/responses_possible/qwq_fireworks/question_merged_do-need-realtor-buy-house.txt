Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and answer exactly what's asked without any extra details.

1. **Question 1**: How did Brenda Cea's experience with her real estate agent during the inspection process highlight the potential risks of buying a home without professional assistance?

Looking at the article, Brenda Cea found a damp spot on the ceiling. The seller refused to let a roofer check it, but her agent insisted. The roofer found a cracked roof. Without an agent, she might not have pushed for that inspection, leading to undiscovered issues. The answer should mention the agent's role in getting the roof inspected and the resulting discovery.

2. **Question 2**: What emotional catalyst prompted a homeowner to initially sell items on Facebook Marketplace before listing her entire property?

The homeowner is Joanne Cleaver. The text says she sold items after her daughter moved overseas, taking her grandchildren. The sandbox and play area made her sad, so she started selling those items first. The emotional catalyst is her daughter moving overseas with her grandchildren.

3. **Question 3**: What professional background gave the homeowner who sold without an agent an advantage over typical sellers?

Joanne Cleaver was the former real estate editor of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and authored a book on real estate. That's her professional background that gave her an edge.

4. **Question 4**: What financial instrument is currently unavailable for buyers to cover potential commission costs under the new rules?

The article mentions there's no system for lenders to wrap the commission into the loan. So the answer is that commissions can't be included in the loan.

5. **Question 5**: Which household play area became a catalyst for a major life change described in the article?

Joanne's backyard sandbox and play area for her grandchildren led her to sell items on Facebook, which then led her to sell her home that way. The play area is the catalyst.

6. **Question 6**: How does the article suggest the new commission rules might affect the traditional role of buyer's agents?

The article says some people are suggesting buyers just pay a flat fee to a lawyer, not needing an agent. So the role might be diminished or eliminated for some.

7. **Question 7**: What specific fraud concern related to real estate transactions is mentioned as a growing problem?

The text mentions "title and wire fraud" as a growing problem.

8. **Question 8**: How did the homeowner who sold without an agent ensure the buyer's funds were properly secured before closing?

She used a closing lawyer who put the money into an escrow account.

9. **Question 9**: Which professional organization faced a lawsuit related to the commission structure changes?

The National Association of Realtors was sued by homeowners, as mentioned in the article.

10. **Question 10**: What specific verification method did the homeowner use to research potential buyers found through social media?

Joanne did reverse address searches and checked LinkedIn profiles of potential buyers.

Now, I need to make sure each answer is directly from the text and formatted correctly. Let me check each again quickly.

1. Brenda's agent insisted on the roofer check, leading to finding the crack. So the risk is not having someone push for that inspection. The answer is about the agent's insistence leading to discovery of the roof issue.

2. Daughter moving with grandchildren caused her to sell the sandbox first.

3. Former real estate editor and author.

4. No system to include commission in the loan.

5. Sandbox and play area.
