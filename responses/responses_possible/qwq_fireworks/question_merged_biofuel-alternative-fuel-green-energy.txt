Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question asks how Repsol's strategy of retrofitting refineries correlates with EU regulations on sustainable aviation fuel. The article mentions that EU regulations require increasing percentages of sustainable aviation fuel, starting at 2% in 2025 up to 70% by 2050. Repsol is retrofitting their refineries to produce these biofuels, so the correlation is that their strategy aligns with meeting those regulations. The answer should connect their retrofitting to the EU's requirements.

2. The second question is about the paradox in Repsol's flexibility claim given ingredient scarcity. The article says the plant can use various wastes like used cooking oil, but there's a scarcity. The paradox is that while they claim flexibility, the availability of those ingredients is limited, making it hard to actually use different sources as needed.

3. The contradiction in biofuels being practical despite logistical challenges. The text mentions that biofuels are seen as practical because they use existing infrastructure, but there are issues like sourcing waste and competition from cheaper imports. The contradiction is between the ease of use versus the supply and sourcing problems.

4. The EU's 2050 requirement creates a complex challenge because the targets keep increasing. Repsol has to not only produce more but also handle sourcing and competition, which complicates their production plans. The challenge comes from the escalating targets and the logistical hurdles mentioned.

5. The irony in "green credentials with little effort" versus sourcing challenges. The article points out that while biofuels are easy to use, getting enough raw materials (like cooking oil) is difficult and may require global sourcing, which isn't easy. The irony is that the effort isn't as little as claimed because of sourcing issues.

6. Contradiction in cold-weather performance and sourcing. The plant's fuels work in cold, but if ingredients are scarce or need to be imported, maybe the supply isn't reliable enough to meet demand in regions needing cold performance. The contradiction is between technical performance and the practicality of sourcing enough material.

7. Repsol vs. competitors who closed refineries. The article states that some rivals closed refineries, while Repsol is retrofitting theirs. The difference is their strategy of transforming instead of closing, aiming to stay competitive in the green fuels market.

8. Challenge in maintaining competitive edge with global competition. The article mentions Chinese biodiesel imports depressing prices and Repsol's need to source materials. Competitors like Shell have issues, but Repsol's early start might help. The challenge is competing against cheaper imports and securing supply.

9. Biofuel production affected by waste availability. The article says Repsol prefers Spanish waste but might need to import. Scarcity of ingredients like cooking oil could limit production, so availability directly impacts their output.

10. Contradiction in practical solution vs. logistics. The article states biofuels are practical, but logistical issues like sourcing, transportation emissions, and competition make it harder. The contradiction is between the claimed practicality and the existing logistical hurdles.

Now, I need to ensure each answer is a direct fragment from the text or a logical inference. Let me check each against the article again to confirm.

1. The EU regulations are the reason Repsol is doing this, so the answer is that the retrofitting aligns with meeting the EU's increasing mandates.

2. Flexibility is claimed, but scarcity of waste (like used oil) is a problem, so the paradox is that while they can use various wastes, there might not be enough of them.

3. The contradiction is that biofuels are practical for existing infrastructure, but sourcing and supply chain issues complicate their use.

4. The requirement's increasing targets (up to 70%) combined with sourcing and competition challenges make it complex.

5. The irony is that while they're easy to use, sourcing the materials isn't easy, so the "little effort" part is contradicted by sourcing struggles.

6. The fuels perform well, but getting enough ingredients might be logistically difficult, so even if they work, supply could be an issue.

7. Repsol is retrofitting instead of closing, which is different from competitors who closed.

8. Global competition like Chinese imports with lower prices and possible sustainability issues challenge Repsol's edge.

9. If waste isn't available enough, production is affected, so the answer is scarcity challenges impact production.

10. The contradiction is that while they're seen as practical, the logistical problems (sourcing, transport emissions) undermine that practicality.

All answers seem to be directly from the text or inferred logically. I think that's it.
