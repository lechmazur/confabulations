Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. 

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions Benjamin Kern's motivation includes opposition to his university's investments in weapons manufacturers. So the answer is that his protest was against the university's investments in weapons.

2. **Question 2:** Delia Garza, the Travis County prosecutor, dropped charges because jurors would see protests as First Amendment exercise. That's directly stated.

3. **Question 3:** Benjamin Kern studied hydrology and water resources. The connection is that his academic focus on water resources might relate to broader issues, but the article doesn't explicitly link it to the protests. Wait, the article says he joined to oppose university investments in weapons. His major isn't connected to the protest context, so maybe N/A? Wait, the question asks for a connection between his academic focus and the protests. The article doesn't mention that, so maybe N/A. Wait, but the article says he studied hydrology and water resources, but his protest was about weapons investments. So no direct link. So answer N/A? Hmm, but the question says "connection exists", so maybe there's none. Let me check again. The article says Benjamin Kern was studying hydrology and water resources and joined to oppose university investments in weapons. The connection might be that his field isn't related, so the answer is N/A? Or is there a connection? The question is about the connection between his studies and the protests. Since the article doesn't make that link, answer N/A. Wait, but maybe the protest context is about weapons, so his field is unrelated. So the answer is N/A.

4. **Question 4:** The University of Texas at Austin had state police deployed by Governor Abbott. The article mentions they changed rules and state police were involved. So the answer is University of Texas at Austin.

5. **Question 5:** Delia Garza's reason was issues with evidence and constitutional concerns. Wait, the article says she cited problems with the evidence and that the arrests were "constitutionally dubious." Wait, actually, in the part about Indiana University, the prosecutor there called the arrests constitutionally dubious, but for Texas, the article says the prosecutor dropped charges because of problems with evidence. Wait, the question specifies "southern, Republican-controlled state" which is Texas. The article says the local prosecutor dropped the charges citing problems with evidence. So the answer is problems with the evidence.

6. **Question 6:** The historian is Robert Cohen, who compared the arrests to 1969 Vietnam protests.

7. **Question 7:** The university where students protested against weapons investments and had diplomas withheld is University of Texas at Austin. The article mentions diplomas withheld there.

8. **Question 8:** Robert Cohen's reason for significance despite small size is that arrests are almost comparable to Vietnam protests. The article states Cohen said the arrests are almost comparable, so that's the reason.

9. **Question 9:** The student who said that quote is Benjamin Kern. The article quotes him directly.

10. **Question 10:** The date was June 26 when Ms. Garza announced dropping charges for April 29 arrests. The article says on June 26, she announced dropping charges for April 29.
