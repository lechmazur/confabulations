Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to make sure I only use the information from the article provided. No external knowledge allowed.

Starting with question 1: "What connection can be drawn between Dr. Ruth's advice on keeping certain things private and her criticism of the trend to share everything?" The article mentions she said there are problems with sharing everything, like the doctor who was aroused by cows leading to the "mooooooo" joke. Her advice on privacy directly criticizes oversharing trends. So the connection is that she warns against sharing everything because it can lead to awkwardness or problems.

Question 2: "What parallel can be drawn between Dr. Ruth's advice on sexual performance anxiety and her perspective on surviving the Holocaust?" She told Richard Lewis that finding the right girl would help with anxiety. Her Holocaust experience taught her to turn negatives into positives. The parallel is using past hardships (Holocaust survival) to offer advice on overcoming personal issues like anxiety.

Question 3: "What insight about Dr. Ruth's personal relationships can be gleaned from her advice on turning negative experiences into positive outcomes?" The article says she had unhappy early relationships but found lasting love with her third husband. So the insight is that she transformed her negative past relationships into a successful marriage.

Question 4: "How did Dr. Ruth's perspective on keeping certain fantasies private relate to her broader views on openness in sexual discussions?" She encouraged openness but also said some things should stay private. The example with the Brazilian caller was a fantasy (fantasy about Brazilian soccer players) that's acceptable in private. So the perspective is that while open discussion is good, some fantasies should remain private to avoid embarrassment.

Question 5: "What connection can be made between Dr. Ruth's advice on fantasy and her emphasis on maintaining privacy in relationships?" The fantasy example she gave involved keeping the fantasy private (telling the Brazilian caller to keep her mouth shut but imagine the soccer crowd). So the connection is that fantasies can enhance intimacy but should be kept private to avoid issues.

Question 6: "According to Dr. Ruth, what is the key to making the world a better place, as inspired by her experiences during the Holocaust?" She mentions tikkun olam, repairing the world, using her survival as motivation. The key is turning terrible experiences into productive lives.

Question 7: "What is the 'orgasm gap' referred to in the article, but only describe it in relation to women in heterosexual relationships without mentioning any other group?" The article states a study found women in heterosexual relationships have fewer orgasms than men, creating the gap. Just need to state that.

Question 8: "According to Dr. Ruth, what is the importance of keeping certain things private in romantic relationships?" She mentions problems with sharing everything, like the cow example. So the importance is to avoid embarrassment or awkwardness.

Question 9: "How did Dr. Ruth respond to a caller from Brazil who had difficulties concentrating during sex?" She told the caller to keep her mouth shut but imagine Brazilian soccer players in bed with her.

Question 10: "According to Dr. Ruth, what is the key to overcoming fear and taking risks in life, as inspired by her favorite animal?" She uses the turtle metaphor: sticking your neck out instead of hiding. The key is to take risks by sticking your neck out, not hiding in a shell.

Wait, let me check each answer against the text again to ensure accuracy. For example, question 10's answer is directly from her commencement speech, so that's correct. The orgasm gap is only about heterosexual women, so that's okay. All answers should be direct from the article without inference beyond what's stated. I think that's all covered.
