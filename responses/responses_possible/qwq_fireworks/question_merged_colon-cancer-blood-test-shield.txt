Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and answer exactly what's asked without adding any extra info.

1. **Primary limitation of Shield test compared to other methods?** The article mentions that unlike other tests, it has a poor record finding precancerous growths. So the answer is about detecting those polyps.

2. **Subsequent procedure if test indicates cancer?** The text says if the test suggests cancer or large polyps, a colonoscopy is needed. So colonoscopy is the answer.

3. **Why prefer Shield over others?** The article states it's easier because it's a blood test, unlike fecal tests requiring stool samples or colonoscopies with prep. So the main reason is ease of use.

4. **Performance aspect contradicting screening goals?** The typical goal is prevention by finding precancerous polyps. Since Shield is bad at that, its low detection of polyps contradicts this.

5. **Approval process compromise?** The committee endorsed it despite the limitation because it might get more people screened. The compromise is between more screenings vs. optimal prevention.

6. **Characteristic aligning with current challenges but adding a new limit?** Current methods have issues like prep for colonoscopy or fecal tests. Shield's new limit is poor polyp detection, but it's easier. The aligning part might be that it's another screening option with trade-offs, but the new limit is the polyp issue.

7. **Performance contradicting preventive capabilities?** Since prevention involves stopping polyps from becoming cancer, Shield's low polyp detection (13%) vs colonoscopy's 95% is the contradiction.

8. **Aligns with challenges but creates new obstacle?** Current challenges include patient avoidance. Shield's ease might help, but its failure to find polyps is a new obstacle in prevention.

9. **Main limitation compared to others?** Same as question 1, the poor detection of precancerous growths.

10. **Why did FDA committee recommend it?** Because it might encourage more screenings despite its flaws. The text says they endorsed it for that reason.

Need to check each question again to ensure answers are directly from the text and no inferences beyond what's stated. Also, avoid duplicates. Let me verify each answer against the article text.
