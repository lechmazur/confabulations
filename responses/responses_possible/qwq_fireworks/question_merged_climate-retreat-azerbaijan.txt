Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly as per the instructions.

1. **First question** asks about Emilio Sempris' perspective on military vs climate finance and the tensions between rich and poor countries. The article says he asked why rich countries can afford bombs but not climate, implying they prioritize military over climate. So the answer is that it highlights tensions by pointing out budget priorities.

2. **Second question** is about the Paris Agreement's temporal gap and evolving economic power. The article mentions the Paris list was based on 1990s data, and now countries like China, Singapore, Saudi Arabia are wealthier. So the gap shows how economic power has changed, affecting who should pay now.

3. **Third question** is about the historical definition of rich countries causing contention. The Paris Agreement's list excludes newer wealthy nations like Singapore and Saudi Arabia, which current countries argue is unfair. So the answer is that the old definition excludes now-rich countries, causing disputes.

4. **Fourth question** on "competing interests" and budget priorities. Sempris said rich countries split budgets, investing in "favorite child: power!" So it reflects that other expenses (like military/power) are prioritized over climate.

5. **Fifth question** about "inscrutable title" reflecting complexities. The package is called "New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance," which is jargon. The term shows the negotiations are hard to understand due to technical language.

6. **Sixth question** asks which diplomat from a rainforest nation mentioned military vs climate while eating. The text says Emilio Sempris represents Panama and rainforest nations, and they were dining on lamb. So the answer is Emilio Sempris.

7. **Seventh question** on Russian delegate aligning with a Caribbean rep. Russia's Uskov says donors aren't ready, similar to Caribbean delegates like Barbados' Munro-Knight. Both want rich countries to pay as per agreements. So their positions align despite geopolitics.

8. **Eighth question** connects venue decor, host's politics, and wealth definition. The hotel had portraits of Heydar Aliyev, founder of the ruling family. The evolving wealthy nations list might reflect Azerbaijan's own development since the 90s, showing how host's history ties to current debates.

9. **Ninth question** about the negotiator's age and economic timeline. Rafiyev is 37; the current list is from the 90s. His youth relates to the outdated list since he's younger than the 30+ years since the list was made. So his age shows he's part of a newer generation dealing with outdated economic definitions.

10. **Tenth question** which expelled delegate aligns with vulnerable countries. Russia's Uskov was expelled from the umbrella group after invading Ukraine. He now says donors aren't meeting needed funds, similar to smaller countries. So the answer is Vladimir Uskov.

Wait, let me check each again for exactness. For question 6, the article says Sempris represents Panama and a rainforest coalition. The meal was barbecue lamb. So yes, he's the one. For question 10, Uskov is Russian, expelled from the umbrella group (probably the rich nations group) due to Ukraine. His stance aligns with smaller nations. All others seem covered. I think that's all.
