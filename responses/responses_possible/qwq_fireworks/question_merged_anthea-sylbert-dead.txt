Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the strict formatting rules. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks about the significance of Anthea Sylbert's partnership with Goldie Hawn in the context of Hollywood's gender dynamics. The article mentions that their partnership was notable because the idea of women making films that appealed to women was still unusual in Hollywood at the time. So the answer should reflect that their collaboration was significant as they were breaking gender norms. 

2. The second question connects her work with Roman Polanski to her final days in Greece. The article says she moved to Skiathos in 2002 and died there. However, there's no direct link mentioned between her work with Polanski and her final location. So maybe N/A?

3. The third question asks for a parallel between her costume design for Mia Farrow and her career trajectory ending in Greece. She designed for Farrow in "Rosemary's Baby," where the wardrobe was deliberately bland. The article mentions her moving to Greece later, but there's no direct parallel stated. So probably N/A.

4. The fourth question is about how "Chinatown" influenced her later production choices with Hawn. The article says her partnership with Hawn involved films with female leads. The influence might be her design background leading to strong visuals, but the text doesn't explicitly state a connection between "Chinatown" themes and Hawn's films. So maybe N/A?

5. The fifth question connects her work with Mike Nichols to her Emmy Award. She worked with Nichols on Broadway plays, and her Emmy was for "Truman." The article doesn't link Nichols directly to the Emmy, so N/A.

6. The sixth question asks how her costume design influenced her producing films with female leads. The article says her partnership with Hawn made films that appealed to women, and she fought for her beliefs. This seems directly connected, so the answer is yes, her design experience influenced her producing approach.

7. The seventh question seeks a connection between her work with Polanski and Hawn. Polanski worked on "Rosemary's Baby," and Hawn's films focused on female-centric stories. The article doesn't explicitly link the themes, so N/A.

8. The eighth question connects her Off Broadway work to her Emmy. She started with Off Broadway, then moved to films, later producing, and the Emmy was for a TV movie. So her diverse contributions from theater to TV could be the link.

9. The ninth question asks for the film with Faye Dunaway in a mystery about water rights. That's clearly "Chinatown."

10. The tenth question is the play with Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson. The article mentions "The Tiger Makes Out" as her first film with her husband, but the play might be different. Wait, actually, the article says she worked on "The Prisoner of Second Avenue" on Broadway, but the first film was "The Tiger Makes Out." The question asks about the play, so maybe "The Prisoner of Second Avenue"? Wait, the first film was "The Tiger Makes Out" which is a film, not a play. The play she did on Broadway was "The Prisoner of Second Avenue" and "The Real Thing." Wait, the question is about a play she designed costumes for with Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson. The article says her first film was "The Tiger Makes Out" starring those actors. So the play in question isn't mentioned here. The play she worked on was "The Real Thing" for Mike Nichols, but that's later. The question might be tricky here. Wait, the article says her first film was "The Tiger Makes Out" with Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson. The play would be different. The only other Broadway mention is "The Prisoner of Second Avenue" in 1972. The question might have a mistake, but since the actors are in a film, the answer for the play might be N/A. Wait, the question specifies a play, so maybe "The Prisoner of Second Avenue"? Let me check again. The article says: "Her only other work on Broadway was on Neil Simon's "The Prisoner of Second Avenue" in 1972." So the play with Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson was actually her first film. The play in question here isn't named with those actors. So the answer might be N/A for the play. Wait, the question is asking for the play she designed costumes for that starred those two actors. Since the article states that "The Tiger Makes Out" was a film, not a play, the answer would be N/A. Hmm, this is tricky. Alternatively, maybe the question has a mistake, but per the article, the play isn't named with those actors. So answer is N/A.

Wait, let me recheck each point carefully. Let's go step by step again.

1. The article says about Hawn partnership: "the idea of women making films that appealed to women was still unusual in Hollywood at the time." So that's the significance. Answer: their partnership was notable because it was unusual for women to produce such films. So the answer is that it challenged Hollywood's gender dynamics by producing films for women.

2. Roman Polanski connection to Greece? The article mentions she worked with Polanski on "Rosemary's Baby," but her move to Greece isn't linked to that. So N/A.

3. Mia Farrow's costumes were bland as per Polanski's direction. Her career ended in Greece, but no parallel stated. N/A.

4. "Chinatown" influenced her production choices with Hawn? The themes of "Chinatown" are mystery, while Hawn's films were more comedy/romance. The article doesn't connect the themes. N/A.

5. Emmy for "Truman." Her work with Mike Nichols was on Broadway plays. The Emmy was for a TV movie. The article doesn't link Nichols to the Emmy. N/A.

6. Her experience in costume design influenced her producing approach with female leads. The article says she "fought for what she believed in" and worked with Hawn on films that appealed to women. So yes, her background in design taught her to be assertive and focus on strong visuals or characters. Answer: her design background informed her assertive approach in producing female-centric films.

7. Connection between Polanski and Hawn's projects. Polanski's work involved dark themes, Hawn's were female-driven. No direct theme link stated. N/A.

8. Off Broadway to Emmy. She started in Off Broadway, then films, then producing, leading to Emmy in TV. So her diverse roles in theater, film, TV. Answer: her transition from theater (Off Broadway) to television production.

9. Film with Faye Dunaway in water rights mystery is "Chinatown."

10. Play with Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson. The article says the film "The Tiger Makes Out" starred them, but the play isn't mentioned. So N/A.
