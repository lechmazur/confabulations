Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article provided.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks about a film where Delon's character shows vulnerability in a violent sport he doesn't enjoy. The article mentions "Rocco and His Brothers" where Delon plays a boxer (Rocco) who becomes a boxer despite not enjoying it. The text says he "expresses a rare vulnerability and tenderness." So the answer is "Rocco and His Brothers."

2. **Question 2**: The film from 1969 with Delon and a former co-star/ex-partner. The article lists "Le Samouraï" (1967) and "Le Cercle Rouge" (1970) as Melville collaborations. Wait, maybe "The Leopard" is 1963, but the 1969 film isn't directly mentioned. Wait, looking again, "Borsalino" (1970) is mentioned with Romy Schneider, his ex-girlfriend. Wait, the article says "nine years after 'Purple Noon' (1960), so 1969? The film mentioned there is "Borsalino" (1970?), but the text says "nine years after 'Purple Noon' (1960)" would be 1969, but the film listed is "Borsalino" in 1969? Wait the article says: "Nine years after 'Purple Noon,' Delon and Maurice Ronet faced off again in this slow-burn by Jacques Deray... Delon and his former real-life girlfriend Romy Schneider..." The film's name here is "Borsalino"? Wait, the article says "this slow-burn by Jacques Deray... Delon and his former real-life girlfriend Romy Schneider burn up the screen as a couple lazing around their Provence pool..." The actual title here is "Borsalino" (since the director is Jacques Deray and it's from 1969). The physical feature mentioned is "close-ups of their dewy, golden skin." So the answer is "Borsalino."

3. **Question 3**: Political thriller with mistaken identity during a significant historical period. The article mentions "Mr. Klein" (1976) where Delon's character tracks someone with the same name in 1942 Paris (historically significant period of Nazi occupation). The answer is "Mr. Klein."

4. **Question 4**: Reversal of fortune mirroring a social class's decline. "The Leopard" (1963) has Delon's character Tancredi, part of the rising bourgeoisie, while his uncle (aristocracy) is declining. The social class decline is his uncle's, but the character's role is about adapting. The answer is "The Leopard."

5. **Question 5**: Losing grip on reality while searching for a doppelgänger. Again "Mr. Klein" fits here as he's tracking a namesake and loses grip on reality. The article says he becomes embroiled in a Kafkaesque nightmare, so "Mr. Klein" is the answer.

6. **Question 6**: Recurring directorial collaboration with sun-drenched thriller and clinically sober crime film. The article mentions Jacques Deray directed "Borsalino" (sun-drenched) and "Three Men to Kill" (clinical sobriety). The answer is "Jacques Deray."

7. **Question 7**: Thematic element connecting "Purple Noon" and "The Leopard." Both have Delon's characters as charming, ruthless individuals. "Purple Noon" has a psychopath with lethal charm; "The Leopard" has a ruthless seducer. The theme is "ruthless charm" or "opportunistic characters." The article says in "The Leopard" he's "ruthlessly charismatic," and in "Purple Noon" he's a "conscience-free psychopath." The common theme might be "opportunism" or "charismatic villains." The answer might be "opportunism" or "charismatic antiheroes." Wait, the question asks for a thematic element. The article mentions in "The Leopard" that Tancredi "smells the winds of change" and adapts, while in "Purple Noon" he's a psychopath. Maybe the theme is "ambition and adaptation" but the article doesn't explicitly link them. Alternatively, "the duality of charm and danger" but maybe the answer is "ruthlessness" or "opportunism." Wait, the article says in "The Leopard," "his class needs to adapt if it wants to survive." In "Purple Noon," his character is a psychopath. The common element might be "charismatic characters involved in moral ambiguity or crime." But the exact thematic element? The question might be looking for "crime" or "power dynamics," but perhaps the answer is "the duality of charm and danger." But the article doesn't state that explicitly. Alternatively, since both involve his character's roles in society (criminal vs. aristocrat adapting), maybe "social class dynamics," but "The Leopard" is about class, "Purple Noon" is a crime story. Hmm. Wait, the article says "Purple Noon" is about a psychopath, "The Leopard" is about adapting to social change. Maybe the answer is "power and social adaptation" but not sure. Wait the question says "thematic element connects roles in both films." Alternatively, maybe the answer is "the duality of beauty and menace," since both are noted for his looks and inscrutability. The article starts by saying Delon's beauty and inscrutability are often mentioned, so maybe that's the theme. But the question specifically asks about the two films. Let me check the article again. "The over-the-top spaghetti swashbuckler 'Zorro' (1975) is one of the few such outliers. Instead, Delon will forever remain associated with the bleak thrillers and noirs he focused on after the mid-1960s." Wait, "The Leopard" is a historical epic. The article says in "The Leopard," "Tancredi smells the winds of change favoring the rising bourgeoisie, while his uncle (Burt Lancaster) embodies the waning aristocracy." So the theme here is social class change. "Purple Noon" is about a psychopath, so maybe the connection is "crime and moral ambiguity," but not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "ambition and moral compromise," but I might have to say N/A if not explicitly stated. Wait, the question is asking for a thematic element that connects both roles. Since the article doesn't explicitly state a common theme between those two films, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but the article does say "he was never afraid of silence" and "ruthlessly charismatic" in "The Leopard," while in "Purple Noon" he's a psychopath. Maybe the common theme is "moral ambiguity and charisma." But the question requires the answer to be a thematic element directly mentioned. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is "crime and class" but that's a stretch. Hmm, maybe I should check again. The article says for "The Leopard": "Delon's opportunistic character, Tancredi, smells the winds of change favoring the rising bourgeoisie, while his uncle (Burt Lancaster) embodies the waning aristocracy." So opportunism and class. In "Purple Noon," he's a psychopath, so crime. The connection might be "ambition leading to moral compromise." But since the article doesn't explicitly link them, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "thematic element connects Delon's roles in 'Purple Noon' and 'The Leopard'." The only possible connection is that both roles involve Delon's characters being involved in morally complex situations (crime and opportunism in class shift). But the article doesn't state this as a common theme between the two films. Maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, maybe the answer is "crime and social change" but that's combining both. Alternatively, maybe "the duality of beauty and danger," since both roles are noted for his looks and the dangerous aspects. The article says in "Purple Noon," "his magnetism made the character's dangerous pull... completely inevitable," and in "The Leopard," he's "raffishly charismatic." So the common theme could be "charismatic yet morally ambiguous figures." But the exact wording in the article might not state that. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "crime" but "The Leopard" isn't a crime film. Hmm. Maybe the answer is N/A because there's no explicit mention of a thematic connection between the two films. Wait, the user instructions say to answer based solely on the text. Since the article doesn't explicitly state a common theme between those two films, maybe the answer is N/A. But I might be missing something. Let me think again. The article's intro says Delon is known for bleak thrillers and noirs, but "The Leopard" is a historical epic. However, maybe the theme is "ambition and power," as both involve characters seeking power (Tancredi adapting for survival, Tom Ripley's psychopathic ambition). So maybe the answer is "ambition and power." But the question requires the exact thematic element from the text. Since it's not stated, perhaps N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "the struggle between old and new," but that's only in "The Leopard." Hmm. I'll have to mark this as N/A if there's no direct info. Wait, the article says for "The Leopard": "his class needs to adapt if it wants to survive." So class adaptation. In "Purple Noon," he's a psychopath in a crime context. No direct connection. So maybe N/A. But I'm not sure. Let's tentatively put N/A here.

8. **Question 8**: Film exploring identity and persecution through mistaken namesakes. That's "Mr. Klein" where Delon tracks another Mr. Klein in Nazi-occupied Paris. So "Mr. Klein."

9. **Question 9**: Profession involving chance and strategy, mirroring plot structure. The article mentions "Three Men to Kill" (1980s) where Delon is a poker player. Poker involves chance and strategy, and the film's plot is a conspiracy. So the answer is "Three Men to Kill."

10. **Question 10**: Character's pursuit of honesty clashes with societal/legal systems. "Express himself" or "honest life" is in "Expresso Bar" (1973), where he tries to lead an honest life but is thwarted by a cop. The answer is "Expresso Bar."
