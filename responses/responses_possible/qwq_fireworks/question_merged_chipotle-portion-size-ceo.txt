Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one based strictly on the provided article. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question asks what specific event made the CEO re-examine practices despite denying changes. The article mentions a TikTok video by Keith Lee that went viral, leading to customer complaints. That's the trigger. So the answer is the TikTok video.

2. For the second question, the article says "as food costs increase, many restaurant chains have faced allegations of shrinkflation." This connects economic factors to customer perceptions. So shrinkflation is the link here.

3. The CEO called "generous portions" a core equity and said they'll ensure consistency. The response to complaints ties back to maintaining that core value. So the connection is the company's response is to uphold their core equity.

4. The article says retraining outliers might improve satisfaction and reputation. The CEO is committed to investing in this, so the implication is positive impact if successful. But the question is about what the article implies, so it's that retraining could help.

5. The third-party analysis by Wells Fargo found online orders only differed by an ounce, but customers thought there was a big difference. The CEO didn't directly contradict this, but the analyst's findings might. Wait, the question says which executive's statement contradicts the analysis. The CEO's denial of any policy change might not contradict the analysis. The analyst found variation but not the online vs in-store. The customer complaints about online vs in-store were debunked by the analysis. The CEO's statement about no directive to reduce portions doesn't contradict the analyst's findings. Hmm, maybe the question refers to the CEO's statement about portion policies not changing, but the analyst found variation. Maybe the answer is the CEO's denial contradicts the analyst's finding of inconsistency. Wait, the question says "third-party analysis regarding portion sizes". The analyst found that portion sizes varied a lot (the biggest was twice as small as the smallest). The CEO said there was no directive to reduce, but the analyst's findings show inconsistency. So maybe the CEO's statement contradicts that there was a policy, but the analysis shows variation exists, so the CEO's denial of policy change doesn't directly contradict the analyst's findings. Wait the question says "which executive's statement contradicts the findings of a third-party analysis regarding portion sizes?" The analyst's findings were that there was variation but online vs in-store wasn't the main issue. The CEO's statement was about no policy change. Maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, no. Let me re-read. The article says the analyst found that the biggest bowl was nearly twice as heavy as the smallest, but online vs in-store wasn't the issue. The customers had complained about online orders varying, but the analyst found that online orders were only slightly heavier. The CEO's statement didn't address the variation but denied a policy to reduce portions. The third-party analysis found variation exists, but the CEO says there was no directive. So the CEO's statement doesn't contradict the analyst's findings about variation, because the CEO is talking about policy, not actual portions. Hmm, maybe the question is asking which executive's statement contradicts the analysis? The article doesn't mention any executive contradicting the analyst. The CEO didn't comment on the analysis directly. So maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question is phrased as "which executive's statement contradicts..." Since the article doesn't mention any executive contradicting the analyst's findings, maybe it's N/A. Wait, but the question might be referring to the CEO's denial of shrinkflation, but the analyst's findings showed variation. But shrinkflation is about reducing portions to save costs. The CEO said food costs went up but they sourced avocados from Peru, so maybe the analyst's findings about avocado prices? Let me check the article again. The analyst noted avocado prices increased, but the CEO said they source from Peru so it didn't affect them. The CEO's statement about sourcing might contradict the idea that avocado prices affected them, which relates to shrinkflation. Wait, the third-party analysis is the Wells Fargo analyst's study on portion sizes. The CEO's statement about sourcing avocados from Peru might contradict the idea that the price increase affected their portions. So the answer to question 10 is about that. But for question 5, the executive's statement contradicting the analyst's portion size findings: the analyst found variation, but the CEO says there was no directive. Maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, maybe the CEO's statement that "there was never a directive to provide less" contradicts the analyst's finding that some portions were smaller? Because the analyst's findings showed variation, but the CEO says they didn't intentionally reduce. The CEO's statement doesn't contradict the existence of variation, just the policy. So maybe the answer is N/A here. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me move on and come back.

6. The analyst's method involved buying 75 bowls, half in-store and half online. The customer complaint was that online orders were smaller. The analyst found online was slightly heavier. So the methodology (buying both) challenged the customer's complaint about online being smaller. So the answer is that the analysis showed online orders were slightly heavier, contradicting the customer's perception of them being smaller.

7. The article mentions that avocado prices jumped 60% due to suspension of U.S. border inspections. The analyst's findings on portion sizes were noted in the context of that price increase. So the timing of the border inspection suspension relates to the avocado price increase, which the analyst noted when discussing the study. So the answer is the suspension of U.S. border inspections caused avocado prices to rise, which the analyst mentioned.

8. Employees refusing to serve customers filming them could be seen as a response to the stressful situation created by customers recording. The CEO says there was no policy to reduce portions, so employees not serving those filming might indirectly support that they're not intentionally serving less. But the question says which employee response supports the CEO's claim. Alternatively, the article says employees called it stressful and dehumanizing, but the CEO's claim is about portion policies not changing. Maybe the answer is that employees refusing to serve customers filming shows they are resisting the recording, implying that the portions weren't intentionally reduced (since they don't want to be caught on camera if portions were smaller). Alternatively, maybe the fact that employees are being retrained to ensure correct portions is the response. Wait, the question asks for employee response to customer behavior. The employees refusing to serve those filming is their response, which indirectly shows they might be confident portions are correct, so they don't want to be filmed (maybe because they know portions are adequate). The answer is employees refusing to serve customers filming.

9. The analyst found online orders were slightly heavier by less than an ounce, contradicting the customer perception that online was smaller. So the answer is the online orders were slightly heavier.

10. The CEO mentioned that most avocados are sourced from Peru, so the U.S. border inspection suspension affecting avocado prices (which were from the U.S.?) didn't impact them. So the aspect of the supply chain is sourcing avocados from Peru, contradicting the impact of U.S. price increases. So the answer is sourcing avocados from Peru.

Back to question 5: The analyst's findings showed variation in portion sizes. The CEO didn't say portions didn't vary, just that there was no directive to reduce. So maybe no executive's statement contradicts the analysis. So answer N/A? Wait, the article says "contrary to one common customer complaint online that the size of their online orders varied from in-store orders, they found barely any difference." The analyst's findings contradict the customer's complaint. The question is about an executive contradicting the analyst. Since the CEO didn't comment on the analyst's findings directly, the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "third-party analysis regarding portion sizes". The analyst's analysis found that there was variation (some were small, some large). The CEO's statement that there was no directive to reduce portions doesn't contradict the analyst's findings of variation. The CEO's statement is about policy, not actual portion sizes. So maybe the answer is N/A here. Alternatively, maybe the CEO's denial of any policy change implies that portions should be consistent, but the analyst found inconsistency. However, the CEO says they are retraining to fix outliers. So maybe the CEO's statement doesn't contradict the analysis, because he acknowledges some inconsistency. Therefore, the answer is N/A for question 5.

Hmm, but the question says "which executive's statement contradicts the findings of a third-party analysis regarding portion sizes?" If the analyst found that portions varied a lot, and the CEO said they were going to fix the outliers, then the CEO's statement doesn't contradict the findings. The CEO's statement about no directive to reduce doesn't contradict the analysis either. So maybe there is no executive's statement contradicting the analysis. So N/A.

Wait, maybe the CEO said "Generous portion is a core brand equity... always will be." The analyst's findings showed some portions were small. So does that contradict? The CEO's statement is about the policy, not the actual portions. The variation might be due to inconsistency, not policy. So the CEO's statement doesn't contradict the analyst's findings. Hence N/A.

Alright, proceeding with that.
