Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article and follow the strict format. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks which economic phenomenon Acemoglu's paper aligns with despite his perspective on AI. The article mentions the "productivity paradox" linked to the growth slump in OECD countries. Since his paper is skeptical about AI's impact, it must align with this existing paradox. So the answer is "productivity paradox".

2. **Question 2**: If Acemolo's prediction (AI adds 1% over a decade) is right, how does that affect Nvidia? The article says developed countries need productivity boosts due to aging workforce. If AI doesn't help much, maybe Nvidia's A.I. chips might not be as crucial. So the strategy might shift, but the answer should be about needing to adjust since their tech's impact is limited. The answer would be "Nvidia may need to reassess its strategic focus on A.I. chips if productivity gains are minimal".

Wait, but the question says "how might it affect the strategy of a company like Nvidia". The article says Acemoglu thinks AI won't reverse stagnation. If his prediction is correct, companies relying on AI for growth (like Nvidia selling AI chips) might face less demand. So the answer is "Nvidia may see reduced demand for its A.I. chips if productivity improvements are minimal".

3. **Question 3**: Gratton's optimism vs Acemoglu's view. Gratton says it's too early to tell, but Acemoglu's view is that AI can only do 5% of tasks. The article mentions that Gratton is optimistic but wants to see it in the workplace. The metric Acemoglu mentions is if AI can automate 40% of tasks. So Gratton's view would align with his if the metric of automation percentage (40%) isn't met. The question is what needs to change for her optimism to align with his. So the answer is "The percentage of tasks A.I. can automate (needs to stay below 40%)".

4. **Question 4**: Sullivan & Cromwell's approach evaluating applicants for anti-Israel protests might conflict with productivity goals. The article says their approach could reject applicants for participating in protests. Productivity goals via AI aim to reduce inefficiencies, but if they're excluding candidates based on past behavior, that might limit workforce diversity or talent, hindering productivity. So the answer is "It could reduce workforce diversity, hindering productivity".

5. **Question 5**: Commonality between Biden's age concerns and David Novak's CEO performance. The article mentions Biden's age being discussed, and Novak says CEOs should keep attacking the job like their first year, not get complacent. The commonality is age-related leadership effectiveness. So the answer is "The impact of age on leadership effectiveness and decision-making".

6. **Question 6**: Peter Crist's CEO characteristic that might contribute to productivity paradox. Crist says a CEO's cognitive capabilities and keeping up with pace are key. If a CEO is doing well, they're hard to dislodge. If they stay too long, maybe they hinder innovation, leading to the productivity paradox. So the answer is "Long tenure of successful CEOs leading to complacency".

7. **Question 7**: Tessa West's observation about employees being spread too thin vs Acemoglu's AI estimates. Acemoglu thinks AI can free workers for complex tasks. But West says employees saying "throw it all at me" is a red flag, implying they can't handle more. This contradicts the idea that AI would help with productivity. The answer is "Employees overcommitting to tasks undermines the potential productivity gains from A.I.".

8. **Question 8**: Commonality between Buffett's leadership and Acemoglu's AI projections. Buffett is over 67, so continuity in leadership (as per Novak's point about continuity aiding performance) might support his role. But Acemoglu's view is AI's limited impact. The factor is "Continuity in leadership and innovation stagnation".

9. **Question 9**: Applying Edmondson's CEO retirement criteria to AI companies. Edmondson's criteria include when a CEO stops wanting to learn, etc. If applied, maybe AI CEOs would retire sooner, affecting productivity gains. So the answer is "Slower adoption of A.I. innovations due to earlier leadership transitions".

10. **Question 10**: Lauren Hirsch's contribution influencing AI strategies. The article mentions she contributed reporting, but the last part says her input might affect strategies by considering emotions. The answer is "Greater emphasis on emotional factors in A.I. design to improve workplace morale".

Wait, need to ensure all answers are strictly from the text. Let me check each again.

1. **Q1**: The article says Acemoglu's paper is about the productivity paradox. So the answer is "productivity paradox".

2. **Q2**: If Acemoglu is right, then AI won't help productivity much, so companies relying on AI (like Nvidia selling chips) might see less demand. Answer: "Reduced demand for A.I. solutions".

3. **Q3**: Gratton is optimistic but wants to see it in the workplace. Acemoglu says if automation reaches 40%, he'd change his view. So for her to align with him, maybe the automation percentage must stay low. The question asks what metric would need to change. The metric is the automation percentage. Answer: "The automation percentage of tasks needing to remain below 40%".

4. **Q4**: Sullivan's approach might exclude some candidates, possibly reducing talent pool, which could hurt productivity. Answer: "Reduced talent pool, hindering productivity".

5. **Q5**: The commonality is age-related leadership concerns. The article links Biden's age to leadership questions, and Novak mentions needing to keep up with the job. So the commonality is "Leadership effectiveness and age-related performance concerns".

6. **Q6**: Crist says if a company is doing well, it's hard to dislodge the CEO. Long tenure might lead to complacency, contributing to productivity issues. Answer: "Long tenure of successful CEOs hindering innovation".

7. **Q7**: West says employees taking on too much is a red flag. Acemoglu thinks AI can free workers for complex tasks. If workers are overburdened, AI's benefits won't materialize. Answer: "Overextension of employees undermines A.I.'s productivity potential".

8. **Q8**: Buffett's tenure is long, and continuity is good per Novak. But if he's too old, maybe innovation is slow, conflicting with Acemoglu's AI limitations. The common factor is "Continuity in leadership vs. innovation stagnation".

9. **Q9**: Edmondson's criteria for retirement (like not wanting to learn) applied to AI CEOs might lead to more frequent leadership changes, possibly slowing AI adoption. Answer: "Earlier leadership transitions could slow A.I. innovation adoption".

10. **Q10**: Hirsch contributed reporting. The article's last part mentions emotions matter for productivity. So her input might push AI to consider emotional aspects. Answer: "Incorporating emotional well-being into A.I. workplace applications".

Now, ensuring all answers are in the required format and using only the text.
