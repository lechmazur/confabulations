Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. Let me start by reading through each question and then searching the article for the answers.

1. **Question 1**: How did the increase in autism diagnoses correlate with changes in workplace accommodations at large companies like Microsoft?  
   The article mentions that as autism diagnoses rise, companies like Microsoft are working to support autistic workers. The CDC stats show increasing autism rates, and this is linked to companies making changes. So the answer is that the rise in diagnoses led companies to implement more accommodations.

2. **Question 2**: Relationship between Microsoft's neurodiversity program and workplace culture.  
   The article says Microsoft's program improves workplace culture and well-being. Neil Barnett mentions that accommodations don't hurt productivity but improve culture. So the answer is that the program improves culture and well-being.

3. **Question 3**: Relationship between "masking" and accommodations.  
   Masking is described as hiding one's traits. The article suggests accommodations (like flexible schedules) reduce the need to mask. So the answer is that accommodations allow employees to avoid masking.

4. **Question 4**: Diagnosed individual who transitioned from music to software via a program modeled after a German firm.  
   The article mentions Natalie Worden-Cowe switched from music to software through Microsoft's program, which was modeled after SAP (German). So the answer is Natalie Worden-Cowe.

5. **Question 5**: Accommodation for the person who chews fingers during meetings.  
   The person is Murphy Monroe. The article says he was shadowed by a colleague to pick up social cues. The specific accommodation here is a trusted colleague helping him. So the answer is being shadowed by a trusted colleague.

6. **Question 6**: Doctor of Education degree holder who met coworkers one-on-one.  
   That's Chelsia Potts. She has a doctorate and preferred one-on-one meetings. So the answer is Chelsia Potts.

7. **Question 7**: Company with 300 neurodivergent employees since 2015.  
   Microsoft's program brought in 300 employees. The answer is Microsoft.

8. **Question 8**: German software firm that inspired Microsoft's program.  
   The article says SAP, so the answer is SAP.

9. **Question 9**: Company with "focus rooms" for sensory needs.  
   Microsoft has focus rooms, as mentioned in the article. Answer is Microsoft.

10. **Question 10**: Author's name for the New York magazine essay.  
   The article states Mary H.K. Choi. So that's the answer.

I need to make sure all answers are directly from the text. Let me double-check each one quickly:

1. Yes, the first paragraph links rising diagnoses to companies' actions.
2. Neil Barnett's quote supports the culture improvement.
3. Masking is about hiding, accommodations reduce the need.
4. Natalie Worden-Cowe is explicitly mentioned with the career switch and SAP reference.
5. Murphy Monroe's shadowing is in the text.
6. Chelsia Potts has the doctorate and one-on-ones.
7. Microsoft's 300 employees are stated.
8. SAP is the German company.
9. Microsoft's focus rooms are mentioned.
10. Mary H.K. Choi is correct.
