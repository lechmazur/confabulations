Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the strict formatting instructions. Let me start by going through each question and finding the relevant parts of the article.

1. **Primary reason AI chatbots struggle with math**: The article mentions that chatbots are designed for probabilities, not rules-based calculations. Kristian Hammond says they weren't designed for math. So the answer is about their design focusing on probabilities.

2. **Paradox between training data and math skills**: The article states that AI's proficiency improves with relevant data (textbooks, etc.), but math accuracy is still a shortcoming. So even with lots of data, math isn't as strong, creating a paradox.

3. **Difference in problem-solving approaches in education**: Khan Academy uses a calculator program for math instead of AI. Traditional systems were rule-based, while AI uses prediction. The example here shows traditional uses structured data, AI uses probabilistic methods.

4. **Shift in computing understanding**: The article contrasts old computing as "math on steroids" with AI's focus on language. The shift is moving away from pure calculation to probabilistic models, so the evolution shows computing isn't just math anymore.

5. **Challenge to "math on steroids"**: Since AI struggles with math despite being a core part of computing's past, this directly challenges the old definition. The article says AI is more liberal arts, so that's the answer.

6. **Teaching opportunity from errors**: The math teacher uses errors as discussion points to teach critical thinking. The article mentions groups comparing answers and discussing who's right.

7. **Shift in AI's perceived strengths**: The article says AI is more liberal arts than math whiz, so the shift is from numerical strength to language/artistic strengths.

8. **Contribution to AI research debate**: The article mentions two campsâ€”those believing in large language models vs. others like LeCun wanting world modeling. The math issues fuel this debate on the best path.

9. **Challenge to STEM vs. liberal arts**: The article says AI is like a liberal arts major, not a math whiz, so it blurs the lines between STEM and liberal arts fields.

10. **David Ferrucci's perspective**: He says AI's language skills are impressive but not for accuracy in critical areas. His startup uses both AI and rules-based systems for precision. So the insight is that language skills don't ensure accuracy in critical tasks.

Now, I need to make sure each answer is concise and directly from the text. Let me check each question again to ensure I didn't miss anything.

For question 2, the paradox is that even with lots of training data, math is still a problem. The article says "proficiency is getting better, but it remains a shortcoming" and that they excel with relevant data but math isn't there. So the paradox is that more data helps in other areas but math isn't fixed.

Question 4's shift is moving from calculation-based to probabilistic, hence the fundamental understanding changed.

Question 9: The article explicitly states AI is more liberal arts, challenging the traditional STEM distinction.
