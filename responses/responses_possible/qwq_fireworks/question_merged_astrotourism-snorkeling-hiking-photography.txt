Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and answer precisely.

1. **Question 1**: The primary reason astrotourism is a growing economic driver. The article mentions DarkSky International's role and that Susan Serven says it's seen as an economic driver. The reason given is protecting night skies from light pollution, which attracts tourism. So the answer should be about DarkSky's efforts or the protection leading to economic growth. Wait, the question asks for the primary reason despite the natural beauty. The text says "Now it's seen as a growing potential economic driver, as well." The "as well" might refer to the connection with humanity and cosmos, but the next part mentions factors like Hubble photos, Northern Lights, light pollution awareness. The exact reason given in the text for the economic aspect is probably the work of DarkSky International and their programs like DarkSky Approved Lodging. So the answer is "DarkSky International's designation of dark sky areas and programs."

2. **Question 2**: Nocturnal activity with domesticated animals and a natural satellite. The goat hikes at Bradley Mountain Farm involve goats (domesticated) and the full moon (natural satellite). So the answer is "goat hikes under the full moon."

3. **Question 3**: Traverse terrain guided by living creatures and a celestial body. The goat hikes use goats (creatures) and the moon's light. The answer is "full-moon goat hikes."

4. **Question 4**: Phenomenon mirroring the night sky during an aquatic excursion. The Secret Bay snorkeling mentions bioluminescence creating a blue glow like the cosmos above. So "bioluminescence" is the answer.

5. **Question 5**: Location with both bioluminescence and celestial observations. Secret Bay in Dominica has the bioluminescence during snorkeling and the night sky mentioned. The answer is "Secret Bay, Dominica."

6. **Question 6**: Use artificial light then extinguish for a natural phenomenon. The Secret Bay snorkeling uses diving lights first, then turn them off to see bioluminescence. So the activity is "night snorkeling at Secret Bay."

7. **Question 7**: Float on water while gazing at celestial objects. The Sunriver Resort's river float in kayaks/canoes under the stars and Milky Way. The answer is "full-moon river float."

8. **Question 8**: Close encounters with Earth creatures and celestial observations. Enchantment Resort's stargazing allows seeing stars and maybe the moon, but the article mentions the astronomer showing celestial objects. The activity is "stargazing at Enchantment Resort," but also the goat hikes involve both goats and moon. Wait, the question is about both Earth-bound and celestial. The Secret Bay activity has marine life and the sky. But the question says "experience involves both close encounters with Earth-bound creatures and distant observations of celestial bodies." So Secret Bay's snorkeling (marine creatures) and the night sky? The answer would be "Secret Bay's night snorkeling and celestial observation," but the exact activity is the snorkeling trip which includes both. The answer is "Secret Bay's night snorkeling excursion."

9. **Question 9**: Use artificial light for observing marine life, then rely on natural light for navigation. The Sunriver Resort's float uses headlamps but the moon as guiding light. Wait, the question says artificial light for observing, then extinguish for natural. The Secret Bay trip uses lights first, then turn them off for bioluminescence. The answer here is the same as question 6. But the question here specifies "terrestrial navigation" which might be the Sunriver's moon-guided float. Wait, the Sunriver's activity uses the moon as the guiding light, so they start with headlamps (artificial) but the moon is the main guide. Hmm, maybe the answer is "Sunriver Resort's full-moon river float," where they have headlamps but the moon is the guide. But the question says they use artificial light first, then rely on natural (moon) for navigation. So that fits. Alternatively, the Secret Bay trip uses lights to see marine life, then turn them off for bioluminescence, but that's more about the phenomenon than navigation. The question mentions navigation, so maybe the river float. The answer would be "Sunriver Resort's full-moon river float."

10. **Question 10**: Use water as both transport and reflection of celestial objects. The goat hike ends at a lake where the moon reflects on the water. The answer is "Bradley Mountain Farm's full-moon goat hike."

Wait, let me check each again carefully.

1. The question asks the primary reason astrotourism is considered an economic driver despite the natural beauty. The article says "Viewing our starry night sky... allowed us to form a deep connection... Now it's seen as a growing potential economic driver, as well." The following sentence lists possible catalysts: Hubble photos, Northern Lights, light pollution impact. But the direct reason linked to economic driver is likely DarkSky's designation of areas and lodging program. The answer should be "DarkSky International's designation of dark sky areas and programs."

2. The activity with domesticated animals (goats) and natural satellite (moon) is the goat hikes. So "goat hikes under the full moon."

3. The activity where terrain is traversed guided by creatures (goats) and celestial (moon). The same as question 2, so "full-moon goat hikes."

4. The phenomenon mirroring the sky is bioluminescence in the water, like the cosmos above. So "bioluminescence."

5. Secret Bay has both bioluminescence and the night sky (they mention the cosmos above). So "Secret Bay, Dominica."

6. Using artificial light (diving lights) then extinguishing to see bioluminescence. The activity is the Secret Bay's night snorkeling. So "Secret Bay's night snorkeling."

7. Floating on water (kayak/canoe) while gazing at stars/Milky Way. "Sunriver Resort's full-moon river float."

8. Close with Earth creatures (goats or marine life) and celestial. The Enchantment Resort's stargazing doesn't involve Earth creatures. The goat hike has goats and moon. The Secret Bay has marine life and stars. So "Secret Bay's night snorkeling."

9. Artificial light (headlamps or diving lights) then natural light (moon) for navigation. Sunriver's float uses moon as guiding light, so they might start with headlamps but rely on moon. The answer is "Sunriver Resort's full-moon river float."

10. Water as transport (kayaking) and reflecting moon. The goat hike's lake reflects the moon. So "Bradley Mountain Farm's full-moon goat hike."

Wait, the Sunriver's float is on water, and they look at the stars. The reflection might be in the river, but the article doesn't mention the moon reflecting there. The Bradley's lake does have the moon bouncing off it. So question 10's answer is Bradley's hike.

Now, check each question again for exactness.

For question 9: The activity where they use artificial light to observe nature (like marine life) then extinguish for a natural phenomenon. That's Secret Bay's snorkeling where they use lights to see creatures, then turn them off to see bioluminescence. The question mentions "rely on natural light for terrestrial navigation"—maybe not navigation, but the phenomenon. The answer might still be Secret Bay's activity. But the wording says "terrestrial navigation" which is different. The Sunriver's activity uses the moon as guiding light (natural), so maybe that's the answer. Hmm, tricky. The question says "use artificial light to observe nature, then rely on natural light for terrestrial navigation." The Sunriver uses headlamps (artificial) but the moon is the main guide. So maybe they start with headlamps, but the main guide is the moon. The extinguishing part isn't mentioned there. The Secret Bay turns off the lights to see bioluminescence, but that's not navigation. So perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait the question says "rely on natural light for terrestrial navigation"—maybe the moon guiding the float. The answer would be Sunriver's activity. So I'll go with Sunriver.
