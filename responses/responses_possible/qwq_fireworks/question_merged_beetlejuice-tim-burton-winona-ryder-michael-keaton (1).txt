Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article and follow the strict format. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question is asking for a specific event that shows Tim Burton's personal journey influenced the sequel's timing. The article mentions Burton saying, "I understand all these things a bit more because of my own strange journey." So that's the key point here. The answer should be that quote or the fact that he mentioned his journey.

2. The next question asks which character's evolution reflects Burton's Hollywood experiences. The article states, "You're absolutely right. I've been through all this stuff, so it's quite cathartic. I identified with Lydia then and now." So Lydia's arc mirrors his experiences.

3. For practical effects contributing to authenticity, the article says Burton mentions using real sets and makeup, which helps the creative process. The answer is about practical effects vs CGI allowing actors to interact with real props and effects.

4. Michael Keaton's approach in the sequel mirroring his original role. The article mentions that the schedule for the sequel was similar to the original, with Keaton being there less time, and they agreed not to overdo Beetlejuice's screen time. So the answer is the same schedule and "less is more" approach.

5. Lydia's career in the sequel parallels Burton's reflections. The article says Lydia's career is exploited by unscrupulous people, and Burton relates this to his own Hollywood experiences. So the answer connects her career struggles to his reflections.

6. The actor who regretted a performance directed by Burton. Keaton mentions he "sucked in 'Dumbo'" and felt he let Burton down. So Michael Keaton is the answer.

7. The sequel's effects mirroring Keaton's original involvement. The article says the sequel's schedule mirrored the first, where Keaton was there for a short time. The effects approach (practical) might tie into that, but the question specifically asks about Keaton's involvement. The answer is the similar short filming schedule.

8. Lydia and Delia's relationship showing personal growth. The article states their relationship is less antagonistic now, having grown together. Burton mentions they've grown up together, reflecting personal growth themes.

9. Original film's success differing from blockbusters. The article says it wasn't a huge hit initially but had a strong "afterlife" through VHS, unlike typical blockbusters that peak quickly. The answer is its delayed success through VHS.

10. Winona Ryder's off-screen activities and the original's music. The article mentions Ryder was on the Free Leonard Peltier committee with Harry Belafonte, who was in the original's "Day-O" scene. So the connection is her activism with Belafonte, who was in the song scene.

Now, I need to ensure each answer is directly from the text and follows the rules. Let me check each again quickly to avoid mistakes.
