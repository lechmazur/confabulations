Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and answer exactly based on that. Let me start by going through each question and finding the relevant parts in the text.

1. **Paradoxical commercial advantage of California's narrow grape choices?**  
The article mentions that California's focus on a few grapes like Cabernet and Chardonnay, even though limited, gives them a marketing edge because consumers prefer familiar options. The exact phrase was something about "commercial advantage... especially among consumers who choose not to pursue esoteric options." So the paradox is that their narrow selection is actually good for sales.

2. **Land ownership and costs contributing to price disparity?**  
The article says European small estates often own land passed down through generations, so they don't have mortgages. California producers might be mortgaged, needing higher returns. Also, organic farming costs more here. The answer should combine land ownership history and costs.

3. **Marketing impact on consumer choices?**  
The author contrasts California's marketing focus (on big grapes) vs. Europe's diversity. Marketing simplifies choices, making consumers stick to known grapes like Pinot Grigio instead of trying others. The article says marketers prefer simplicity over diversity.

4. **Author's view on tradition in Europe vs. California?**  
Europe uses tradition and heritage, while California bases choices on sales. The text says European producers take pride in heritage, whereas California picks grapes for market potential. So the answer is about tradition vs. market-driven.

5. **Terroir's influence on California wines' identity?**  
The article states California wines have their own identities shaped by American terroir, different from Europe. They're inspired by European traditions but have unique terroirs. The key is that their identity is shaped by local terroir, making them distinct.

6. **Author's view on marketing's role in wine diversity?**  
Marketing reduces diversity by pushing popular grapes. The author says marketers want to eliminate less-known grapes to focus on a few, which limits consumer options. The article mentions this as a sad trend because it diminishes choices.

7. **Consequences of simplifying marketing by focusing on popular grapes?**  
The author thinks it would destroy local traditions and reduce choices. The exact quote was about "destroying local traditions and diminishing choices." So the consequence is loss of tradition and diversity.

8. **Why under $20 CA wines aren't recommended?**  
The author says most aren't good compared to other regions. The first part of the article states that while there are many under $20, they aren't as good as those from elsewhere. The main reason is quality, not quantity.

9. **Winemaker using neglected vineyards with same grape but different technique?**  
Looking at the list, Broc Cellars does Cabernet, and another producer? Wait, the question says same grape but different technique. Let's check the list. For example, Florez and Margins both do Chenin Blanc but with skin fermentation? Wait, Margins' Chenin is skin-fermented (orange wine), while Sandlands' Chenin isn't mentioned that way. Wait, the question says "primary grape variety with another producer but different technique." Let me check the specific entries. The answer might be Margins and Florez? Wait, Florez has a Sauvignon Blanc, but Margins has Chenin Blanc. Wait, the question says "shares its primary grape variety with another recommended producer but uses a different winemaking technique." So looking for two producers with same grape but different methods. The article mentions Margins' Chenin Blanc is skin-fermented (orange wine), while another Chenin, maybe Sandlands? Wait, Sandlands' Chenin is described as "bright and floral" but not skin-fermented. Alternatively, the answer might be Broc Cellars (Cabernet) and another Cab? But the only other Cab mentioned is Pax's Syrah. Wait, maybe the question refers to another grape. Wait, the question says "primary grape variety with another recommended producer but uses a different winemaking technique." Let me recheck. The article mentions Margins makes Chenin Blanc skin-fermented, and Sandlands also does Chenin but not skin-fermented? Or maybe another? Wait, the article says "Florez Redwood Valley Upton Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc" and "Sandlands Clarksburg Chenin Blanc". Wait, maybe the two Chenin Blancs? Margins and Sandlands both have Chenin, but Margins uses skin fermentation (orange wine), while Sandlands does not. So the answer would be Megan Bell (Margins) because they both use Chenin but different techniques. Wait, the question says "the winemaker... produces a wine that shares its primary grape variety with another recommended producer but uses a different winemaking technique?" So the answer is Margins (Megan Bell) since another producer (Sandlands) also has Chenin, but Sandlands doesn't use skin fermentation. So the primary grape is Chenin, and the technique difference is skin-fermented vs not. So the answer is Megan Bell.

10. **Characteristic uniting cheapest and most expensive wines?**  
The cheapest is Broc Cellars at $23, the most expensive is Lady of the Sunshine at $39. The article mentions both are made with organic or natural methods? Wait, the cheapest is Broc, which uses natural wines (since they collaborate with Selection Massale, a natural wine importer). The most expensive is Lady of the Sunshine, which uses biodynamic or organic grapes. The commonality might be organic/biodynamic farming. Alternatively, both are "singular identities" or made with attention to tradition. Wait, the article's conclusion says the 10 wines have singular identities shaped by terroir. The question asks what unites the cheapest and most expensive. The cheapest is $23 (Broc) and the most expensive is $39 (Lady). Looking at their descriptions: Broc's is "natural wines" and "vivid with fruit and lively acidity". Lady's is "biodynamically or organically" and "lively, beautiful sauvignon blanc". The commonality might be organic/biodynamic practices. Alternatively, both are from small producers focusing on unique methods. The article's intro says these bottles "are superb with singular identities". So the uniting factor is their singular identity shaped by unique practices. The answer would be "singular identities" or "organic/biodynamic farming". The exact text says "they are superb with singular identities" in the first paragraph, so that's probably it.
