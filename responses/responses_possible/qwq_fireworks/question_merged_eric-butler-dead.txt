Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and answer each exactly as per the instructions.

1. **Question 1:** How did Eric Butler's personal background and upbringing influence his ability to connect with emotionally closed-off teenagers?

   The article mentions he was raised by a single mother in a housing project, which might have given him empathy. Also, he had piercings, a baseball cap, etc., which made him relatable. The answer should tie his background to his ability to connect. The text says he "had a knack for getting hostile young people to open up" because of his background. So the answer is his upbringing in a similar environment allowed him to relate.

2. **Question 2:** How did Eric Butler's method of beginning sessions with an apology to young people for adult wrongdoings contribute to his success?

   The article states that his apology "often broke through to teenagers." The answer is that the apology helped build trust or broke through their defenses.

3. **Question 3:** Significance of "We don't have a kid problem, we have an adult problem."

   This quote is presented as part of his approach. The significance is that it shifted blame from the kids to adults, aligning with restorative justice principles. The article says this statement broke through to teens, so the significance is reframing the issue to adult responsibility.

4. **Question 4:** How did the mother of Lanell's killer influence Eric's perspective?

   The text describes a scene where the mother of the killer came to apologize to his family, leading him to let go of revenge. This event reinforced restorative justice principles for him. The answer is that her visit showed forgiveness, changing his view.

5. **Question 5:** Paradoxical statement about problems in youth-adult interactions.

   The article says he stated "We don't have a kid problem, we have an adult problem." The paradox is that adults are the problem, not the kids, which is a contradiction to traditional blame on youth.

6. **Question 6:** Personal experience illustrating authenticity's importance?

   The article mentions he always told the story about how kids can sense inauthenticity, and his authentic love for them was key. The answer is his own story about kids detecting inauthenticity.

7. **Question 7:** What commonality did he encourage prosecutors to find with offenders?

   The text says he asked prosecutors to recall times they were harmed or harmed others. The commonality is shared experiences of being both victim and offender.

8. **Question 8:** Contrast Butler's approach in Selma with the state's legal stance?

   Selma allows corporal punishment (like paddling by pastors). Butler promoted restorative justice instead. So the contrast is his methods vs. legal corporal punishment.

9. **Question 9:** How did his work address the school-to-prison pipeline without mentioning it?

   The article notes that suspension is an early step in the pipeline, and his methods reduced suspensions (like 51% drop at Bunche High). So the answer is by reducing suspensions/expulsions.

10. **Question 10:** Paradoxical effect of Hurricane Katrina on his career?

    He moved to Oakland after Katrina, where he started his work, then returned to New Orleans. So the paradox is that the disaster (Katrina) led him to opportunities in Oakland that shaped his career, thus indirectly boosting his work.

Now, check each against the article to ensure accuracy. For example, question 4's answer is directly from the Lanell story. Question 5's paradox is the quote itself. Make sure all answers are directly from the text, no external info. Any that aren't mentioned get N/A, but I think all are covered.
