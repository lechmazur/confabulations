Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information from the text and not infer anything beyond what's stated.

1. The first question asks about a leadership quality from Niccol's Chipotle days that's challenged by Starbucks' labor issues. The article mentions his handling of a labor dispute at Chipotle where they offered an "insulting" wage increase and a legal issue with union formation. So maybe his approach to labor relations there is the key. The question is about what quality might be challenged, so perhaps his past handling of unions is the answer. The answer should be his approach to labor relations or union issues.

2. The second question is about the difference in backgrounds between Niccol and Narasimhan. The text says Niccol has restaurant experience (Chipotle, Taco Bell), while Narasimhan came from Reckitt (consumer goods). So the difference is Niccol's restaurant industry experience versus Narasimhan's non-restaurant background. That's the main point here.

3. The third question is about an aspect of Niccol's success at Chipotle that might not apply to Starbucks regarding activist investors. The article mentions Starbucks' stock soared after his appointment, but the key point here is his focus on drive-throughs and loyalty programs. However, Starbucks might need different strategies for activist investors. Wait, the question says which aspect of his leadership (like the loyalty program) might be less applicable. Maybe the loyalty program isn't the issue here? Wait, the question is about what led to stock increase (his focus on drive-through and loyalty program) but might not help with activist groups. Maybe the expansion strategies (like drive-throughs) are not the same as dealing with activists. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the loyalty program's effectiveness in a different context. The text doesn't directly say, but maybe the answer is his focus on drive-throughs since Starbucks might need something else. Or perhaps the loyalty program is already a big part of Starbucks, so that's not it. Wait, the question is about what's less applicable. Maybe the drive-through expansion isn't the key for Starbucks' current issues with activist investors. I think the answer here is the drive-through focus, as Starbucks might not need that as much, but the question specifies activist investors. Alternatively, maybe the loyalty program isn't the right approach for Starbucks' specific challenges. The article says Starbucks' stock went up after the leadership change, but the question is about what might not apply. Maybe the answer is his expansion strategies (like drive-throughs) because Starbucks might need something else. Let me check the text again: "Much of that growth has stemmed from Mr. Niccol's focus on opening more drive-through options and expanding the company's loyalty program." So the two factors were drive-through and loyalty. The question is which of these might be less applicable to Starbucks due to activist groups. The article mentions Starbucks has activist investors pushing for changes, but it's not clear if drive-throughs are relevant here. Maybe the loyalty program is already a big part of Starbucks, so that's not the issue. Alternatively, maybe the drive-through expansion isn't the key for Starbucks' market struggles. Hmm. Maybe the answer is the drive-through focus because Starbucks might have different needs. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the loyalty program. Not sure yet, but I'll need to look again later.

4. The fourth question asks how Niccol's drive-through expansion at Chipotle might be a red herring for Starbucks' strategy. Starbucks might not need drive-throughs as much, maybe because they are more about sit-down experiences. The article mentions Starbucks' struggles in US and China. Maybe drive-throughs aren't the solution there. The answer could be that Starbucks focuses on in-store experiences, making drive-throughs less relevant.

5. The fifth question is about Niccol's loyalty program success at Chipotle being misleading for Starbucks. Starbucks already has a well-established loyalty program (like their app), so maybe his approach there isn't needed. The answer might be Starbucks already has a strong loyalty program, so his experience might not add much.

6. The sixth question is about Niccol's food safety retraining at Chipotle being a misleading indicator for Starbucks' sales decline. The article says Starbucks' sales are weak in US and China, but the food safety issue was specific to Chipotle. Maybe the sales decline isn't due to food safety, so his experience there isn't directly applicable. The answer would be that Starbucks' sales issues aren't food safety-related, so his focus there isn't the main problem.

7. The seventh question asks which executive's tenure had an 800% stock increase at a company with food safety issues. The article says "Chipotle's stock price has increased about 800 percent since he took over in early 2018." And that when Niccol took over, there was a food safety crisis from 2015-2018. So the answer is Brian Niccol at Chipotle.

8. The eighth question is about an action taken by the incoming CEO (Niccol) at a previous company conflicting with Starbucks' labor progress. The article mentions that at Chipotle, he faced criticism for offering an insulting wage increase and the NLRB case where they closed a union store. Starbucks under Narasimhan made progress towards bargaining. So the action would be the wage offer or store closure. The question says "specific action," so maybe the wage increase offer or the store closure. The answer is the "insulting" wage increase.

9. The ninth question is which leader's actions regarding store closures impact Starbucks' union relations. The article says Chipotle under Niccol closed a store in Augusta, Maine, that tried to form a union, leading to a legal case. So that's Niccol's action at Chipotle. The answer would be Brian Niccol's closure of a union-seeking store.

10. The tenth question is about an executive's stance on third-party involvement conflicting with Starbucks' negotiations. The article states that Niccol said "I really don't think we need a third party to get between our restaurant teams and our company," which conflicts with Starbucks' progress in bargaining with unions. So his stance against third parties (like unions) contradicts Starbucks' recent steps. The answer is Niccol's opposition to third-party involvement (unions).
