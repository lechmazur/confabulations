Okay, let me start by going through each question one by one, making sure I only use the information from the provided article. 

1. The first question asks how the FBI's investigation timing affects the Paris Olympics, considering elite athletes involved. The article mentions that 11 swimmers who tested positive are again on the team and favorites for medals. The investigation's shadow will hang over the games. So the answer is that it will cast a shadow over the Paris Olympics.

2. The second question is about how FBI involvement challenges international sports bodies' jurisdiction. The article says the Rodchenkov Act allows U.S. to prosecute doping internationally. WADA is against this because it's extraterritorial. So the answer is the Rodchenkov Act allows U.S. jurisdiction, overriding international bodies.

3. The third question on Rodchenkov Act's extraterritorial jurisdiction complicating response. The article states WADA's concern that the U.S. is overstepping, so the answer is the Act's extraterritoriality causes concern over jurisdictional overreach.

4. Legal precedent is the Rodchenkov Act itself, as it's the law enabling this. The article says it's the first time under this act, so answer is the Rodchenkov Act.

5. The question about which official's testimony might avoid grand jury. The article mentions Nowicki was given a subpoena and working to schedule a meeting to obviate testimony. So answer is Brent Nowicki.

6. Timing of Nowicki's appointment (June 2021, just before China's decision) could affect credibility. The article notes he took the post days before the notification, so the timing might make World Aquatics seem complicit, thus impacting credibility.

7. Travis Tygart's criticism and meeting cancellation. The article says WADA canceled a meeting because leaders didn't want to go due to the investigation. Tygart's deputy was on the call where the reason was given. So the connection is that WADA cited the investigation, which Tygart criticizes, leading to cancellation.

8. Extraterritorial jurisdiction relates to WADA's "one set of rules" criticism. The article says WADA argues the Act compromises their global rules, so the answer is the Act's jurisdiction undermines WADA's unified system.

9. China's notification timing and Nowicki's appointment. The article states Nowicki started days before China informed WADA. So the connection is that his appointment was just before the decision, possibly linking his role.

10. "One set of rules" relates to WADA's objection to Rodchenkov Act. The article says WADA thinks the U.S. jurisdiction disrupts their global rules. So the answer is the Act allows U.S. jurisdiction, conflicting with WADA's uniform rules.
