Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to make sure I only use the provided article and answer strictly based on that. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks how the article implies niche streaming services like Brown Sugar might achieve profitability compared to larger services. The article mentions that name-brand services are struggling with profits and trying bundling, while niche ones like Brown Sugar focus on specific audiences. The key point here is that niche services curate specialized libraries for a target audience, which is why they're successful. So the answer should be about curating specialized libraries for a specific demographic.

2. The second question is asking which service contradicts the struggles of big brands by catering to a cultural demographic. The article starts by introducing Brown Sugar as the example, so the answer is Brown Sugar.

3. For the third question, it's about the genre combination in "Joshua" that influenced a QT film. The article says "Joshua" combines blaxploitation and spaghetti westerns, which inspired "Django Unchained." So the answer is blaxploitation and spaghetti westerns.

4. The documentary in question is "Hoop Dreams." The article states it challenges conventional sports movies by showing real-life setbacks and not just dramatic successes. The answer should mention that it uses patience and real-world outcomes to contrast with typical sports movie theatrics.

5. The film that reunites personnel from a previous Black cinema success is "Hit!" which reunites Sidney Furie and Billy Dee Williams and Richard Pryor from "Lady Sings the Blues." The genre shift here is from a drama to an action film like "The French Connection." So the answer is "Lady Sings the Blues."

6. The content evolution of the service moved from 70s blaxploitation to include contemporary genres like rom-coms, action, dramas, etc. This reflects changing audience preferences beyond just classic films. The answer should note broadening from 70s era to contemporary offerings.

7. The film whose production mirrors its themes is "Hoop Dreams," as they filmed over five years tracking the kids' journeys, which parallels the long-term aspirations and real outcomes in the documentary. The answer is "Hoop Dreams."

8. "Hit!" subverts expectations because the previous collaboration (with Furie and Pryor/Williams) was "Lady Sings the Blues," a drama, but "Hit!" is an action film. So the answer is shifting from drama to action.

9. "Joshua" is compared to "McCabe & Mrs. Miller" in the snowy third act. The article mentions the setting evokes that film's snowy, windy environment. So the connection is to "McCabe and Mrs. Miller."

10. The curation strategy is specificity (focused on Black experience/creators) but also inclusivity because it covers various genres (rom-coms, action, etc.) within that demographic. The answer should mention specificity in Black culture but inclusivity across genres.
