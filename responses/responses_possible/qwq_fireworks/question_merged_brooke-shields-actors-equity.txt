Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article and answer exactly what's asked without adding any external knowledge.

1. **Question 1**: How does Brooke Shields's experience with Broadway performances relate to her current advocacy for fair compensation in developmental work?  
   The article mentions she had foot surgeries from dancing in Broadway shows and that she's advocating for fair compensation in developmental work because "people aren't being compensated fairly." So her personal experience with physical strain from Broadway might connect to valuing fair treatment. But the article directly links her advocacy to the union's stance on fair pay, not her personal injury. Wait, the question is about her experience with Broadway performances leading to her advocacy. The article states that the union's strike is about fair compensation, and Shields is part of that. But her Broadway experience (like surgeries) might not be directly stated as the reason. Hmm, maybe the answer is that her Broadway experiences led her to understand the physical demands, hence advocating for fair pay. But the article says her advocacy is part of the union's action, so maybe the answer is "N/A" unless it's explicitly connected. Wait, the article says she mentions the union's stance on developmental work not compensating fairly. Her Broadway roles' physical toll isn't directly tied to that specific advocacy. So maybe the answer is "N/A" because the article doesn't explicitly connect her Broadway experience to that advocacy. Wait, the article says she was in shows with no training, leading to surgeries, but the fair compensation is about developmental work. Maybe not directly. The answer might be "N/A".

2. **Question 2**: How does her approach to learning parliamentary procedure reflect her strategy for handling new responsibilities?  
   She mentions she's learning it but says if it's her weakness, she can learn or have someone else do it. So her strategy is delegating or learning as needed. The answer would be that she relies on learning or delegation.

3. **Question 3**: How does her past casting in Broadway without training influence her views on inclusivity?  
   The article says she was cast without training, and the theater community supported her. She wants to give back because they were welcoming. So her experience of being accepted despite lack of training makes her value inclusivity.

4. **Question 4**: How does her company's experience with personnel decisions prepare her for adversarial negotiations?  
   She mentions in her company she had to let people go and say no, which she practices for negotiations. So the answer is that her experience in making tough decisions (like layoffs) in her company helps her handle adversarial situations.

5. **Question 5**: How do her replacements in Broadway roles inform her views on inclusivity and support?  
   She was often replacing principals in shows, which required quick integration. The theater community supported her, so her perspective is that the community is inclusive and supportive, which she wants to preserve.

6. **Question 6**: How does her company's personnel decisions prepare her for union leadership?  
   Similar to question 4, but the question is about union leadership challenges. The answer is the same: handling tough decisions (like layoffs) in her company prepared her for leadership challenges.

7. **Question 7**: Relationship between past roles and advocacy for fair compensation?  
   Same as question 1. The article links her advocacy to the union's stance, not her personal roles. So maybe N/A unless it's implied. The article says she was in shows that required quick integration, but not about pay. So N/A?

8. **Question 8**: How does her statement about the welcoming community relate to her goals as president?  
   She wants to make the union kinder and more inclusive, so the answer is that she aims to maintain that supportive environment, hence her goals include fostering inclusivity and kindness.

9. **Question 9**: Underlying reason for her interest in helping the theater community?  
   The article says the community supported her when she needed to jump into shows quickly. So her reason is gratitude for their support.

10. **Question 10**: How does her parliamentary procedure experience relate to her fashion industry experience?  
    The article doesn't mention her fashion industry experience influencing her learning of parliamentary procedure. She was a model early on, but the article doesn't link that to her current learning. So N/A.

Now, checking each answer against the article to ensure accuracy. Need to make sure each answer is directly from the text or logically inferred.

1. The article states she advocates for fair compensation in developmental work because "people aren't being compensated fairly." Her Broadway experiences led to surgeries, but that's not directly tied to her advocacy for developmental work. The question asks how her Broadway experience relates. Since the article doesn't connect her personal injury to that specific advocacy, answer N/A.

2. She says she can learn or delegate parliamentary procedure. So "relies on learning/delegation" is correct.

3. Yes, her lack of training and being supported led to her views on inclusivity. Answer is that her experience influenced her to value inclusivity.

4. She mentions handling tough decisions (like layoffs) in her company to prepare for adversarial situations. Correct.

5. She was often replacing others, and the community supported her, so her perspective is informed by that support. Answer is that it informs her view that the community is supportive and inclusive.

6. Same as 4 but framed for union leadership. Correct.

7. Same as 1. N/A.

8. Her goal is to keep the union kind and inclusive, so the answer is to maintain a supportive community.

9. The article says the theater community supported her when she needed to jump into shows, so the reason is gratitude.

10. No link between fashion and parliamentary procedure in the text. N/A.
