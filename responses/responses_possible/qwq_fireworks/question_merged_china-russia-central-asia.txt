Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and answer strictly based on that. Let me start by reading through the questions again and then check the article for each.

1. **First question:** Modi's absence at the summit reflecting India's concerns. The article mentions Modi skipping the summit to go to Moscow, and it says India is concerned about China's rising clout and Russia's waning influence. So the answer should link his absence to those concerns.

2. **Second question:** Strategic advantage from the new rail line. The article says the rail line gives China a shortcut for trade with Iran, Afghanistan, etc., and a southern route beyond Russia's. That's the key point here.

3. **Third question:** Belarus as a member countering China. The article states Belarus's inclusion is a minor victory for Russia. Since Belarus is Putin's ally, this helps Russia balance China's dominance in the SCO.

4. **Fourth question:** Russia's economic dependency affecting influence. The article says Russia relies on China to stay afloat, making direct competition futile, so they can't assert influence as before.

5. **Fifth question:** Economic and security interplay. The article mentions both countries wanting stable authoritarian regimes (security) and economic ties. Russia uses migrants and trade via Central Asia to bypass sanctions, so that's the mix.

6. **Sixth question:** Significance of the Astana summit. The summit is a platform for China and Russia to showcase their ambitions against US-led order, and it's where they push their agendas.

7. **Seventh question:** Implications of China's growth on Russia's sphere. The article says Russia accepts China's ties as they can't compete, so it's a shift from Russia's traditional control.

8. **Eighth question:** Challenges Russia faces. The article mentions economic gap, reliance on China, and Russia's symbolic actions like attending events, so their main challenge is economic inferiority.

9. **Ninth question:** India's evolving concerns. The article notes India joined at Russia's urging but now has chilly relations with China post-border issues. Modi's earlier closer ties vs. current issues show the shift.

10. **Tenth question:** Shift in SCO power dynamics. The article says Beijing dominates the group, and Russia is a junior partner now. Belarus's inclusion is minor, while India's distance shows China's ascendancy.

Wait, let me check each answer again to ensure they are directly from the text. For example, question 9: The article mentions India's relations with China have cooled since 2020 skirmishes and Modi's earlier favor towards closer ties. So that shows the evolution.

Also, question 10: The SCO was started by China and Russia, but now Beijing dominates, and Russia is junior. So the shift is China leading more, Russia less. The answer should reflect that.

I need to make sure each answer is a direct fragment, not a full sentence, and use N/A if not in the text. Let me go through each again quickly.

1. Answer is about India's concern over China's rise and Russia's decline. The article states that explicitly, so not N/A.

2. The rail line's strategic advantage is the shortcut for trade routes beyond Russia. The article says exactly that.

3. Belarus's membership is a minor victory for Russia, so yes.

4. Economic dependency makes competition futile, so Russia can't assert as before.

5. The article mentions both economic and security aspects (economic ties, security cooperation against terrorism, etc.), so that's covered.

6. The summit is their platform to push against US order, as stated.

7. Russia accepts China's growing ties, so traditional influence wanes. The article says that.

8. Economic gap and reliance on China, so challenges are economic inferiority.

9. India's shift from closer ties to now concerns over China's clout. The article mentions this evolution.

10. China's dominance vs. Russia's junior role. The article says so.

All answers are present in the text. None should be N/A.
