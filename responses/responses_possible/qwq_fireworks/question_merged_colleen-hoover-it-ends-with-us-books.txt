Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by reading through the questions again and then cross-referencing each with the article.

1. **First question**: If the Blake Lively movie ("It Ends With Us") were delayed a year, how does that affect Hoover's transition from self-publishing to mainstream success? The article mentions that the movie is the first adaptation and that her mainstream success started with self-publishing over a decade ago. The movie's release date change might delay the film's impact but the transition timeline (self-publishing to now) isn't tied to the movie's release. The article doesn't link her transition timeline to the movie's release date, so the answer is N/A.

2. **Second question**: Which novel has a cruise ship doctor who becomes one after his wife's murder and meets the heart recipient? The article mentions "Reminders of Him" where Dr. Nic Joshi's wife is murdered, and he meets Jess, the heart recipient. So the answer is "Reminders of Him".

3. **Third question**: Which novel combines Bollywood, magical realism, and organ donation? The same book as question 2, "Reminders of Him", is described as Bollywood-inspired with magical realism and the heart transplant. So same answer here.

4. **Fourth question**: What connection derails vengeful plans in a Sapphic Medusa retelling? The article mentions "Medusa" retelling where Lex plans revenge on Luna's family, but their connection (unexpected) stops her. The answer is an "unexpected connection" or "unexpected attraction" as per the text.

5. **Fifth question**: Shared experience in "Reminders of Him" and "Before I Let Go"? "Before I Let Go" is about a divorced couple with co-parenting and chemistry. "Reminders of Him" involves grief over a dead spouse. The shared trauma is loss of a spouse/partner. The article says both deal with loss and grief. So shared experience is "grief over a lost spouse/partner".

6. **Sixth question**: Author of "Reminders of Him" (Hoover) shares a profession with the protagonist of her basketball-themed romance. The article says the basketball book is "Long Shot" by Jenny Ryan, and the protagonist there is an NBA player. Wait, but the question is about the author of "Reminders" (Hoover) and the protagonist of the award-winning NBA book. Wait, the article says "Ryan's award-winning romance 'Long Shot' set in the NBA". The author is Jenny Ryan. The protagonist's profession would be NBA-related, but the question is about the author's profession vs the protagonist's. Wait, the question says the author of "Reminders of Him" (Hoover) shares a profession with the protagonist of Ryan's book? Wait, no. The question says "the author of 'Reminders of Him' share with the protagonist of her award-winning..." Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check the article again. The article says: "Sports fans may also enjoy Ryan's award-winning romance 'Long Shot,' set in the N.B.A." So Ryan wrote that. The author of "Reminders of Him" is Hoover. The question is about Hoover and the protagonist of her own book? Wait no, "her" refers to Ryan? Wait the question says "the author of 'Reminders of Him' (Hoover) shares a profession with the protagonist of her award-winning..." Wait, maybe the question is about Hoover and the protagonist in Ryan's book? No, the wording is confusing. Wait the question says "the author of 'Reminders of Him' and the protagonist of her award-winning basketball-themed romance". Wait, "her" would refer to Hoover, but "Long Shot" is by Ryan. Hmm, maybe the article says that Hoover's co-published book? Wait the article says "Ryan's award-winning romance 'Long Shot'". So maybe the question is a trick here. Since Hoover isn't the author of "Long Shot", the answer would be N/A. Wait, the question is about the author of "Reminders of Him" (Hoover) sharing a profession with the protagonist in her (Hoover's) award-winning basketball book. But the article doesn't mention Hoover having a basketball-themed book. It mentions Ryan's book. Therefore, the answer is N/A? Or maybe the question is mixing up authors. Since the article says Ryan wrote "Long Shot", which is NBA-themed, and the author of "Reminders" is Hoover. So Hoover doesn't share a profession with the NBA protagonist. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The article says "Ryan's award-winning romance 'Long Shot,' set in the N.B.A." So the author of that book is Ryan. The question is about the author of "Reminders of Him" (Hoover) and the protagonist of her (Hoover's) award-winning book. Since Hoover didn't write that, the answer is N/A. So the answer is N/A.

7. **Seventh question**: Shared trauma in "Before I Let Go" (divorced couple with loss) and "Reminders of Him" (loss of spouse). Both involve loss of a spouse/partner. So the shared trauma is "loss of a spouse" or "grief over a spouse's death".

8. **Eighth question**: Profession linking male protagonists in "It Ends With Us" and the cruise ship novel. "It Ends With Us" has Ryle as a neurosurgeon. The cruise ship doctor is from "Reminders of Him" (Dr. Nic Joshi). Both are doctors. So the profession is "neurosurgeon" and "doctor" but the question asks for the shared profession. Since both are doctors, the answer is "doctor" or "physician".

Wait, Ryle is a neurosurgeon, and Nic is a cruise ship doctor. So their shared profession is "doctor".

9. **Ninth question**: Shared experience in female protagonists of "Slammed" (Layken) and "It Ends With Us" (Lily). Both are young women dealing with past trauma and romance. The article says Layken is 18 trying to hold her family together after her father's death, and Lily has a troubled past. Maybe their shared experience is being in a forbidden or intense romance while dealing with family issues. The article says "Layken... forbidden romance" and Lily's story involves her past trauma. The shared experience might be "intense forbidden romance" or "dealing with family trauma". Wait the article says for "Slammed": "forbidden romance between 18-year-old Layken... and her new neighbor... poet named Will." For Lily in "It Ends With Us": "Lily... painful moments from her childhood... Ryle's charm belies an explosive temper... Atlas reappears." The shared experience is maybe both are in relationships with men from their past (Will vs Atlas?), but not sure. Alternatively, both are young women navigating complex relationships while dealing with past trauma. The article says Layken is dealing with her father's death and Lily's childhood trauma. The shared experience could be "dealing with past trauma while in a romantic relationship". But the exact wording in the article? The article says for both characters, their past trauma affects their present. So the shared experience is "dealing with past trauma affecting present relationships".

10. **Tenth question**: Profession shared by the author of "Slammed" (Colleen Hoover) and the protagonist of "Mad About You". Wait, "Mad About You" isn't mentioned in the article. The article lists "Slammed" as Hoover's first YA novel. The question asks about the author (Hoover) and the protagonist of "Mad About You". Since "Mad About You" isn't in the article, the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe "Mad About You" is a typo? The article mentions "Long Shot" by Ryan and "Slammed" by Hoover. So "Mad About You" isn't referenced. So answer is N/A.
