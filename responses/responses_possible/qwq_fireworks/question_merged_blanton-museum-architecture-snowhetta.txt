Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each question precisely as per the instructions.

1. **Question 1**: The significance of the petals in relation to the museum's architecture and the cityscape. The article mentions the petals reference the arched loggia, the Capitol dome, and Kelly's building. So their significance is connecting the museum's design elements and the surrounding landmarks.

2. **Question 2**: The architectural element that conducts heat and directs rainwater. The petals' hollow shafts do both. The text says their stems conduct heat and the shafts direct rainwater.

3. **Question 3**: Connection between the petals' designer and Simone Wicha's previous role. The designers are from Snohetta, and the founders include Craig Dykers, who got his degree at U.T., where Wicha worked. So the connection is that Dykers and Elaine Molinar (another partner) studied at U.T., where Wicha was deputy director.

4. **Question 4**: Artist whose work references local architecture, flora, and is a pun. Carmen Herrera's murals use local buildings and plants. The pun might be the Michener Gallery's upside-down arch, but the question specifies the artist. Wait, the text says Carmen Herrera's work draws from local buildings and plant life. The pun is the upside-down arch for the Michener Gallery, but that's Snohetta's design. Wait, the question asks for the artist whose contribution does this. The article says Carmen Herrera's bright green loggia abstractions reference local elements. The pun is the upside-down arch, which is part of the architecture, but the artist here is Carmen Herrera for the loggia. Maybe the pun is not hers, but the question says the artist's contribution does all three. Hmm, maybe the answer is Carmen Herrera.

5. **Question 5**: Architectural feature that inverts a design element to indicate primary function. The Michener Gallery has an upside-down arch, indicating it's the main viewing space. So the inverted arch.

6. **Question 6**: Element addressing climate, natural forms, and echoes a nearby landmark. The petals provide shade (climate), mimic natural forms, and reference the Capitol dome. So the petals again.

7. **Question 7**: Element referencing multiple architectural features and natural environment. The petals reference loggia, Capitol, Kelly's curves, and natural forms. So petals again.

8. **Question 8**: Element referencing local architecture, practical function, and Kelly's "Austin". The petals reference Kelly's building (since they reference Kelly's curves) and the Capitol (a local landmark). The practical function is shade and heat conduction. Wait, the question also mentions a feature of Kelly's "Austin". The petals reference Kelly's curves, so maybe the petals fit here.

9. **Question 9**: Purpose of hollow shafts in petals. The text says they direct rainwater into soil.

10. **Question 10**: Artist who did the "Hi." mural. That's Kay Rosen.

Wait, let me check each again for accuracy:

1. The petals frame the loggia, Capitol, and Kelly's building. So their significance is to connect the museum's design with surrounding landmarks (Capitol) and other structures (Kelly's). Answer should mention those references.

2. The stems conduct heat, hollow shafts direct rainwater. So the element is the petals' stems/ shafts. The question asks for the element, so "petals" or the stems? The text says "Their hollow shafts also help direct rainwater...". The element is the petals' hollow shafts, but the question might just want "the petals" or "fiberglass petals". The exact wording says the stems conduct heat, and the shafts direct water. The answer should be the petals, since the question asks for the element, which is the petals.

3. The designers (Snohetta's founders) include Dykers and Molinar who studied at U.T. where Wicha was deputy director. So the connection is that Dykers and Molinar are alumni of U.T., where Wicha worked. The answer is that the designers (Dykers and Molinar) are U.T. alumni, which is where Wicha's previous job was.

4. Carmen Herrera's work uses local buildings and flora, and the pun might be the upside-down arch, but that's part of the architecture, not her mural. Wait, the text says "Carmen Herrera (whose bright green loggia abstractions draw from local buildings and plant life), Kay Rosen..." So the artist here is Carmen Herrera for the local references, but the pun is the upside-down arch by Snohetta. The question asks which artist's contribution does all three. Maybe the answer is Carmen Herrera for local architecture and flora, but the pun part might not be hers. Wait, the question includes "serves as a visual pun for the building's function". The upside-down arch is a pun indicating the gallery's main function. But that's Snohetta's design, not an artist's. Wait, maybe the question is referring to the Michener Gallery's arch. The text says "the Michener Gallery's arch is upside-down, wryly indicating that it is the complex's main art-viewing space." But that's part of the architecture, not an artist's contribution. The artist here for the loggia is Carmen Herrera. The pun isn't hers. Hmm, maybe the answer is Carmen Herrera for the first two parts (local architecture and flora), but the visual pun part might not be. Wait, the question says "references local architecture, flora, and serves as a visual pun for the building's function". The visual pun is the upside-down arch, but that's part of the architecture. So perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait no, the question says "artist's contribution". The artist's part is Carmen Herrera's mural. Maybe the "visual pun" is not part of her work. So maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is Carmen Herrera for local architecture and flora, but the pun is separate. Wait the question says "contribution simultaneously references..." So maybe the answer is Carmen Herrera for the first two, but the pun isn't part of her work. Then the answer would be N/A? Wait the text says the Michener Gallery's arch is the pun. That's part of the architecture by Snohetta, not an artist's work. So maybe the question's answer is N/A. But the options are in the text. Let me check again. The question says which artist's contribution does all three. The only artist mentioned with a mural that references local elements is Carmen Herrera. The "visual pun" part must be part of her work. Wait, the upside-down arch is part of the architecture. The question might be mixing elements. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is Carmen Herrera for the first two, but the pun isn't hers, so the answer is N/A. Wait, perhaps the answer is the Michener Gallery's arch, but that's not an artist's contribution. Hmm, this might be tricky. Alternatively, maybe the "visual pun" is part of the architecture's design, so the artist's contribution is Carmen Herrera, and the question's third part is not applicable. Wait, perhaps the question is combining elements. Maybe the answer is Carmen Herrera because the question allows for the pun being part of the building's design, but the artist's contribution is separate. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question asks for the artist whose contribution does all three. Since Carmen Herrera's work references local architecture and flora, but the pun is not hers, the answer would be N/A. But the article says the Michener Gallery's arch is a pun. Since that's part of the Snohetta design, not an artist's work, the answer might be N/A. Wait the question says "artist's contribution". So the answer might be N/A here. Wait, but the question is about the artist's contribution. The upside-down arch is part of the architecture, not an artist's mural. So perhaps the answer is N/A. But that might not be correct. Let me check the text again. The text says "the Michener Gallery's arch is upside-down, wryly indicating that it is the complex's main art-viewing space." That's part of the Snohetta design. So the artist's contribution (Carmen Herrera) doesn't include the pun. Therefore, the answer is N/A? But the question might have a different angle. Alternatively, maybe the visual pun is part of the artist's work. Wait the text says Carmen Herrera's work draws from local buildings and plant life. The pun is the upside-down arch, which is part of the architecture. So the answer is N/A. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me proceed and see if other questions are clearer.

5. The architectural feature that inverts a design element to indicate primary function. The Michener Gallery's upside-down arch indicates it's the main viewing space. So that's the answer.

6. The element that addresses climate (shade), natural forms (petals mimic natural forms), and echoes a nearby landmark (Capitol dome). The petals again.

7. References multiple architectural features (loggia, Capitol, Kelly's curves) and natural forms. The petals.

8. Element referencing local architecture (Capitol?), practical function (shade/heat), and Kelly's Austin (curves). The petals reference Kelly's building's curves, so yes.

9. Hollow shafts' purpose is directing rainwater.

10. Kay Rosen did the "Hi." mural.

Going back to question 4: Since the upside-down arch is part of the architecture, not an artist's contribution, the answer might be N/A. But the question says "artist's contribution". The only artist contributing to the gallery's features would be the ones mentioned. The Michener Gallery's arch is part of the architecture, not an artist's work. So perhaps the question is referring to the Carmen Herrera's work, but her contribution doesn't include the pun. So the answer is N/A? Or maybe the question is mixing elements. Alternatively, maybe the "visual pun" is part of the building's design, so the artist's contribution (Carmen Herrera) is separate. So the answer is N/A here. Wait but the question says "serves as a visual pun for the building's function". Since the pun is the upside-down arch, which is part of the architecture, the artist's contribution isn't that. So the answer is N/A. But the question might have a different angle. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Carmen Herrera, but the third part is not hers, so N/A. Hmm, I'll have to check again. The question asks for an artist's contribution that does all three. Since the pun is not part of any artist's work, maybe the answer is N/A. But maybe I missed something. Let me see the text again: "the Michener Gallery's arch is upside-down, wryly indicating that it is the complex's main art-viewing space." That's part of the Snohetta design. The artists mentioned are Carmen Herrera (loggia), Kay Rosen (Hi), Gabriel Dawe (Plexus). So none of their works include the pun. Thus, the answer is N/A. But the question is in the text, so maybe I'm missing it. Wait the question says "references local architecture, flora, and serves as a visual pun". The local architecture and flora are from Carmen Herrera's work, but the pun is from the arch. Since that's not her contribution, the answer would be N/A. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Carmen Herrera for the first two parts and the pun is part of the building's design, but the question specifies the artist's contribution must do all three. So N/A. I'll proceed with N/A for Q4.

Wait, but the text says Carmen Herrera's work "draws from local buildings and plant life". The visual pun is part of the arch, not hers. So the answer for Q4 is N/A.

Proceeding with that, let's list the answers:

1. <answer>reference arched loggia, Austin's Capitol dome, and curves of Kelly's building</answer>

2. <answer>petals</answer> (since their stems and shafts do both)

3. <answer>designer Craig Dykers and Elaine Molinar are University of Texas alumni</answer>

4. <answer>N/A</answer> (since the pun is not part of an artist's work)

5. <answer>Michener Gallery's upside-down arched vault</answer>

6. <answer>petals</answer>

7. <answer>petals</answer>

8. <answer>petals</answer>

9. <answer>direct rainwater into surrounding soil</answer>

10. <answer>Kay Rosen</answer>

Wait, for question 3: The designer of the petals is Snohetta, whose founders include Dykers and Molinar, both U.T. alumni. Since Wicha worked at U.T. as deputy director, the connection is that the designers are alumni of her institution. So the answer is that the designers (Dykers and Molinar) are U.T. alumni, where Wicha worked. So the answer would be "designers Craig Dykers and Elaine Molinar are University of Texas alumni".

Alternatively, the question asks for the connection between the designer (Snohetta) and the institution where Wicha worked. Since Dykers and Molinar studied there, the answer is that they are alumni of U.T.

So question 3's answer is correct as above.

For question 4, since the pun is part of the architecture's design and not an artist's contribution, it's N/A.

Proceeding with these answers.
