Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks about how the tariffs by Canada, the U.S., and the EU might affect the market share of Chinese-made Teslas in Canada, considering subsidy data. The article mentions that in 2023, 25% of federal subsidies went to Chinese imports, mostly Teslas from Shanghai. Since tariffs are being imposed, this could reduce their competitiveness, thus lowering their market share. The answer should reflect that the tariffs would likely decrease their market share.

2. **Question 2**: The historical arrest of Meng Wanzhou led to a diplomatic fallout, including China's arrest of Canadians and canola import restrictions. The article states that relations sank after her arrest, and the current tariffs might strain relations further. The significance here is that past incidents show how actions affect bilateral ties, so the arrest illustrates the ongoing tensions that complicate trade relations now.

3. **Question 3**: The only zero-emission vehicle in Canada is a GM delivery van. This shows Canada's limited domestic production, so the tariffs aim to protect this limited industry. The significance is that the tariffs are to support domestic manufacturers like GM, given their minimal current production.

4. **Question 4**: The leader implementing both tariffs (100% on EVs and 25% on steel/aluminum) is Justin Trudeau, as he announced these measures. The article states Canada is aligning with the U.S. on EV tariffs and adds steel/aluminum tariffs.

5. **Question 5**: The event in 2018 was the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, which led to strained relations. The article mentions her arrest in 2018 as a low point in Canada-China relations.

6. **Question 6**: The agricultural product was canola. The article says China temporarily blocked canola imports, citing insects, but Canada saw it as retaliation.

7. **Question 7**: The Prime Minister who shifted from improving relations to straining ties is Justin Trudeau. He took office in 2015 promising renewal but saw relations worsen after the Meng Wanzhou incident.

8. **Question 8**: The vehicle is a General Motors delivery van. The article explicitly states this is the only zero-emission vehicle currently made in Canada.

9. **Question 9**: The percentage in 2023 was 25%, up from 2%. The text directly states this figure.

10. **Question 10**: The action was a lobbying firm for BYD working to sell passenger cars in Canada. The article mentions BYD's lobbying as the trigger for increased calls for tariffs.

I need to ensure each answer is directly from the text and avoid any assumptions beyond what's written. Let me check each answer again for accuracy and adherence to the instructions.
