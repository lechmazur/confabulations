Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to be careful to only use the information given and not make any assumptions beyond that.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks how the decline in MMR vaccination rates and increased measles outbreaks illustrate the impact of Covid vaccine skepticism on public health. The article mentions that Covid vaccine skepticism has bled into childhood vaccines, leading to lower MMR rates and more outbreaks. The answer is likely "Covid vaccine skepticism contributed to lower MMR rates, leading to more measles outbreaks."

2. **Question 2**: The health economist (William Padula) said that vaccine programs pay for themselves through savings. The article states that the savings figure dwarfs the cost of developing the vaccines. The relationship here is that proper infrastructure leads to immediate economic savings. So the answer is "Infrastructure creates immediate economic savings exceeding vaccine development costs."

3. **Question 3**: The decline in trust during the pandemic is linked to vaccine hesitancy. The article says that the healthcare system's failure to build trust led to hesitancy, especially with parents not getting MMR vaccines. The answer would be "Declining trust during the pandemic led to increased vaccine hesitancy for childhood immunizations."

4. **Question 4**: The article mentions indirect effects like parental work absences contribute to savings. The total savings with indirect effects is $2.7 trillion, while direct savings are $540 billion. The question asks the percentage attributed to indirect effects. The difference is $2.7T - $0.54T = $2.16T. So (2.16 / 2.7)*100 = 80%. But the question is about the percentage of the total savings that's indirect. So answer is "80%".

5. **Question 5**: The article states $540 billion saved over preventing 1.1 million deaths. To find per death: 540,000 million divided by 1.1 million deaths. That's $490,909 per death. But the question says "average cost savings per prevented death". The answer would be "$490,909" but maybe rounded? The article might not specify, so maybe N/A? Wait, the total savings are $540 billion from preventing deaths, hospitalizations, and illnesses. Wait, actually, the $540 billion is total savings from all prevented cases, not just deaths. The question asks specifically for the average savings per prevented death. The article doesn't break down how much of the $540B is from deaths vs hospitalizations vs illnesses. So the answer would be N/A because we can't calculate it without that breakdown.

6. **Question 6**: The savings ($540B) dwarfs the cost of developing the vaccines. But the exact percentage compared to development costs isn't given. The article doesn't mention the cost of developing the vaccines. So we can't compute the percentage. Answer is N/A.

7. **Question 7**: The question asks what percentage of U.S. GDP the indirect savings ($2.7T) represent. The article doesn't mention GDP figures, so this can't be answered. Answer N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Similar to question 5, the $540B includes savings from hospitalizations. To find per hospitalization: 540,000 million divided by 32 million hospitalizations. That's $16,875 per hospitalization. But again, the total savings include all prevented costs (deaths, hospitalizations, illnesses), so without knowing the portion from hospitalizations, this can't be precisely calculated. The article doesn't specify, so answer N/A.

9. **Question 9**: The number of measles outbreaks went from 4 in 2023 to 13 in 2024. The percentage of kindergartners not fully vaccinated is 7% (since 93% were immunized). The question asks in what year outbreaks will exceed that percentage. But without knowing the trend's rate, we can't project. The article doesn't provide future data. Answer N/A.

10. **Question 10**: The article says the $540B includes initial infection costs and managing later conditions. But it doesn't split the percentage between initial and later conditions. So can't determine. Answer N/A.
