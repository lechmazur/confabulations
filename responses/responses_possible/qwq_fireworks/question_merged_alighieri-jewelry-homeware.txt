Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and answer exactly what's asked without any extra info. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks about the implicit relationship between Borgo dei Conti's historical inspiration and Alighieri Casa's modern reinterpretation. The article mentions Borgo dei Conti is inspired by Umbria's history and the Place of Wonders preserves Italian craftsmanship. Alighieri Casa uses traditional methods like sand casting and references their lion medallion. So both are taking traditional elements and reinterpreting them in modern contexts. The answer is that both involve preserving tradition through modern reinterpretation.

2. Next, Amanda Williams' "CandyLadyBlack" and Place of Wonders' mission. Place of Wonders preserves craftsmanship. Williams' work references childhood memories tied to community and Black neighborhoods. The cultural preservation here is similar in preserving cultural heritage through art. So the connection is preserving cultural heritage through art.

3. Spices in Daru's cocktails and "Social Abstraction's" techniques. The exhibition uses abstract mediums to convey Black narratives. Daru uses spices in new cocktail ways, similar to how the artists use abstract methods to express cultural stories. The parallel is using traditional elements (spices/materials) in innovative ways to tell cultural stories.

4. Preservation at Borgo dei Conti and "Social Abstraction's" mission. Borgo preserves history and craftsmanship, while the exhibition explores Blackness abstractly. The theme is preserving and reinterpreting cultural identity through their mediums. So the connection is preserving and reinterpreting cultural identity.

5. Traditional craftsmanship at Borgo and Alighieri's reinterpretation. Both use traditional methods (handwoven fabrics, sand casting) but apply them to modern items. The connection is traditional craftsmanship adapted for contemporary use.

6. Lazaro's design philosophy and "Social Abstraction." The article says Lazaro used Berber carpets, Greek ceramics, etc., to create a tactile backdrop inspired by travels, similar to how the exhibition uses diverse mediums to tell cultural stories. The approach is blending cultural elements to tell a story.

7. Artist in "Social Abstraction" inspired by childhood and 80s R&B. The text mentions Amanda Williams' "CandyLadyBlack" references Cameo's 1986 song "Candy" and childhood memories. So the answer is Amanda Williams.

8. Alighieri's item that's both utensil and jewelry. The article says bottle openers shaped like lobsters and seahorses are worn as necklaces. So the answer is lobster or seahorse bottle openers.

9. Artist critiquing oversimplification via color palette. Williams uses Jolly Rancher hues to counter a "matte Black" flattening. Her work critiques through color. So Amanda Williams again.

10. Connection between Alighieri's bestseller and housewares. Their bestseller is the lion medallion pendant. The housewares include a lion's paw candlestick. So the lion motif connects them.
