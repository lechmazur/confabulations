Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the given article. Let me start with question 1. The question asks how the Canadian team's technical routine theme illustrates the tension between thematic creativity and physical demands. The article mentions the Canadian team's theme was "Forest Magicians," aiming to capture forest vibes with feathers. The tension comes from balancing the theme's creativity with the physical challenges. So the answer is probably that the theme requires both creativity (forest, feathers) and physical effort (acrobatics, lifts). 

Question 2: The sport that uses a dessert substance on hair and needs deep-sea diver lung capacity. The article says artistic swimmers use gelatin (used in desserts) on their hair and need lung capacity like deep-sea divers. So the answer is artistic swimming.

Question 3: The element contradicting physical strain. The article mentions they have to look effortless and happy despite the strain. So the answer is maintaining a beaming smile or happy expressions.

Question 4: Post-routine behavior difference between artistic swimmers and marathon runners. The text says marathon runners might collapse or show fatigue, but swimmers have to stay composed, swim decorously, and not show pain. The answer is swimmers must stay composed and not show fatigue, unlike runners.

Question 5: The taboo comedic sketch. The article mentions a 1984 SNL sketch with bad synchronized swimmers. The answer is the Saturday Night Live sketch with Martin Short and Harry Shearer.

Question 6: The technique for buoyancy with a breakfast food name. The eggbeater is mentioned as the tread to stay afloat when heads are up. So eggbeater.

Question 7: The role shared with cheerleading. The article compares acrobatic lifts to cheerleading, mentioning "flyer" and "base." The answer is flyer or base. The question asks for the role title, so "flyer" or "base." The question says "shares a title," so probably flyer or base. The text says "flyer" like in cheerleading, so flyer.

Question 8: Cinematic figure narrating a water-themed routine. The US routine had Jason Momoa (Aquaman) narrate "I Am Water." So Jason Momoa.

Question 9: Rock band's song about a mythical location. Spain's routine used Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven," which mentions the mythical place. So Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven."

Question 10: Forest profession using celestial energy. The Canadian theme was "Forest Magicians," taking energy from sun, moon, solar system. The profession inspired is "magicians" as per the theme. So the answer is magicians.
