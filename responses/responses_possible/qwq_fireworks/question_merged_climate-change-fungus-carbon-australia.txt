Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked and avoid any external knowledge.

1. **Question 1:** The critical factor according to Alan Richardson. Let me look for Alan Richardson's quote. The article says he mentioned that fungi would work only if applied yearly to build carbon over many years. So the key factor is applying fungi annually. The answer should be that farmers must apply the fungi year after year.

2. **Question 2:** Dr. Jackson's point about conflict between new tech and fossil fuels. He said these techs "can't be used as an excuse to continue burning fossil fuels." So the conflict is using them to justify continuing fossil fuel use.

3. **Question 3:** Australian farmer whose ancestors started tilling in the same year Brazil abolished slavery. Brazil abolished slavery in 1888. The article mentions Stuart McDonald's ancestors started in 1888. So Stuart McDonald.

4. **Question 4:** Farmer with a contract length matching family generations. Tegan Nock is a sixth-generation farmer. The article says Steve Nicholson signed a 25-year contract. Wait, but 25 years vs generations? Wait, maybe another farmer? Wait, looking again: Steve Nicholson has a 25-year contract. The question says "matches the number of generations his family has been farming." Tegan Nock is sixth-gen, but she's a co-founder, not a farmer in the contract. The farmer with a 25-year contract is Steve Nicholson. The article doesn't mention his family's generations. Wait, maybe Neil Westcott? No, he has 25% of his land with fungus. Wait, the only one mentioned with a contract length is Steve Nicholson's 25-year. The question is if that number (25) matches the generations. The text says Stuart McDonald is fifth-gen. So 25 years vs 5 generations? Not matching. Wait, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says "Tegan Nock, the co-founder of Loam Bio, is a sixth-generation farmer." But her contract isn't mentioned. Steve Nicholson has a 25-year contract. The question is about a farmer whose contract length (in years) matches the number of generations. Since the text doesn't mention Nicholson's generations, maybe it's Stuart McDonald? The article says Stuart is fifth-gen. If his contract was 5 years, but he didn't have a contract mentioned. The only contract length is Nicholson's 25 years, but no info on his generations. Hmm. Maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "the number of generations his family has been farming in Australia". Let me check again. The text says Stuart is fifth-gen. Steve Nicholson's contract is 25 years. 25 vs 5? Not matching. Maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, maybe I missed someone else. Let me check again. The only other farmer mentioned with a contract is Steve Nicholson. Since there's no info on his generations, the answer is N/A? Wait, the question might be referring to Tegan Nock? But she's a co-founder, not a farmer in the contract. Hmm, maybe the answer is Stuart McDonald? But his contract isn't mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Steve Nicholson's 25-year contract and he's a sixth-generation farmer? Wait, the text doesn't say that. The only info is Tegan Nock is sixth-gen. So perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "farmer's contract length matches the number of generations". Since no farmer is explicitly stated to have a contract length equal to their generations, maybe N/A. Wait, perhaps the answer is Stuart McDonald? Let me recheck. The article says Stuart's ancestors started in 1888, and he's a fifth-generation farmer. If he had a 5-year contract, but he didn't. The only contract mentioned is Steve Nicholson's 25-year. Since 25 doesn't match any generations mentioned, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "which farmer", implying there is an answer. Let me check again. Wait, maybe the answer is Neil Westcott? No, he's 64, but his contract isn't mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the number of years since they started? Not sure. Hmm, maybe I missed something. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Stuart McDonald because his family started in 1888, and the current year is 2023, so generations would be around 4-5 generations (each about 25 years), but that's an inference. But the question specifies the same year Brazil abolished slavery (1888). Stuart's family started in 1888, so the answer for Q3 is Stuart McDonald. But for Q4, the contract length matching generations. Since Stuart is fifth-gen, but his contract isn't mentioned. The only contract is Steve's 25-year. Since 25 isn't 5, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick. Let me see the article again. Wait, the article says "Tegan Nock, a sixth-generation farmer, agreed." She's a co-founder, but not the one with the contract. Steve's contract is 25 years. If he's a sixth-generation farmer, then 25 vs 6? No. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A. I'll have to mark this as N/A unless I missed something.

5. **Question 5:** Farmer's past attempt with a substance sharing a characteristic with oceans (which are mentioned as the second-largest carbon store). The article mentions that soils are second to oceans. The farmer's past attempt: Stuart McDonald used Sydney's sewage waste. The substance here might be organic matter. But the oceans are mineral? Wait, the more stable carbon is attached to minerals. The article says some farmers used sewage waste (organic), others planted trees. The volcanic rock companies use minerals. The question is which farmer's past attempt involved a substance that shares a characteristic with oceans (which store carbon via minerals?). Maybe the volcanic rocks, but that's not Stuart's attempt. Alternatively, the sewage waste is organic like soil's organic carbon. Not sure. Wait, the article says "volcanic rocks that absorb carbon" which is mineral-based, like the stable carbon attached to minerals. Stuart's attempt was sewage (organic), which is similar to the volatile carbon. The oceans store carbon in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the answer is someone who used volcanic rock? But the question refers to the farmer's past attempt. The only past attempts mentioned are sewage and trees. The article says "some farmers planted trees... soil carbon increased for a few years..." The volcanic rock is a current method by other companies. The question is about a farmer's past attempt. The sewage is organic, which is similar to the soil's organic carbon (which is volatile). The oceans store carbon in a different form, but maybe the key is that the stable carbon is mineral-based. The sewage doesn't share that. Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article mentions that the more stable carbon is attached to minerals. If a farmer used something with minerals, but the only past attempt mentioned is sewage (organic) and trees (organic). So maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Stuart McDonald's use of sewage because the article says "solid waste from Sydney's sewage to fertilize his fields" and "soil carbon... in the form of highly volatile organic matter". The oceans' carbon isn't organic, but maybe the article doesn't specify. Alternatively, maybe the volcanic rock is part of the current methods, but the question is about past attempts. Since the only past attempt with a substance is sewage (organic), which is similar to the soil's organic carbon, which is volatile. The oceans' carbon storage isn't directly mentioned beyond being the second-largest. Maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Stuart McDonald because the sewage's carbon is organic, similar to the ocean's organic matter? Not sure. I'll have to think again. The question says "shares a characteristic with oceans mentioned in the article". The oceans are the second-largest carbon store. The article says soils can store more than 5 gigatons, which is less than oceans. The characteristic might be being a carbon store. But the substance's characteristic? Maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, the volcanic rocks (mineral) are part of current methods, but the past attempt was sewage. Maybe no match. Hmm. Let me check again. The question is which farmer's past attempt used a substance that shares a characteristic with oceans' mention. The oceans are a carbon store. The farmer's substance (sewage) is organic, which is part of soil's carbon. The article says oceans are the largest, then soil. The characteristic might be being a carbon store, but that's too broad. Maybe the answer is N/A.

6. **Question 6:** Farmer's approach to carbon credits that contradicts previous criticisms. The criticism was that credits were given for seasonal fluctuations, not real changes. The article says some farmers' credits were for weather fluctuations. The question is which farmer's approach avoids that. The article mentions Steve Nicholson is having his carbon measured at peak dry season (February) to get a baseline, and will be re-measured next year. This method might avoid the seasonal issue because they take measurements at the same time each year. So Nicholson's approach is using consistent measurement times, which contradicts the previous criticism of using seasonal changes. So the answer is Steve Nicholson.

7. **Question 7:** Farmer's gambling statement related to soil carbon measurement challenges. The article says Steve Nicholson called his contract a "very, very good gamble" and mentions that Loam's technicians measure baseline carbon and will check again. The gambling relates to uncertainty in measurement success. So the answer is Steve Nicholson.

8. **Question 8:** Dr. Jackson on agriculture's global GHG emissions. The article says "agriculture itself creates a climate problem, accounting for a fourth of the world's greenhouse gas emissions." A fourth is 25%, so the answer is 25%.

9. **Question 9:** Ms. Nock's expected stable carbon per hectare. The article says "Ms. Nock... tells her customers they can expect to store one to two tons of stable carbon in every hectare." So the answer is 1 to 2 tons.

10. **Question 10:** Dr. Jackson's drawbacks of fungi. The article says Jackson was skeptical about whether the fungal additives in field tests could have a statistically significant effect on working farms. He also mentioned needing to touch billions of acres. So the drawbacks are uncertain effectiveness and needing vast areas. The question asks for drawbacks or limitations. The answer would be "statistically significant effect in field tests" and "require billions of acres". But the question says "some potential drawbacks or limitations", so the answer combines both points. The exact quote is "he was skeptical about whether the promise of the fungal additives in field tests could have a statistically significant effect on working farms. 'We would need to touch billions of acres to make a real difference,' he said." So the drawbacks are lack of statistical significance and the scale required. The answer should include both points.
