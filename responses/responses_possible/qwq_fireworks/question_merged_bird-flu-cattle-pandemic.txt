Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and answer exactly what's asked without adding any extra details.

1. **Primary reason bird flu is a threat to humans despite low infection rate?** The article mentions that the longer the virus circulates in cattle, the more chances it has to mutate and cause a pandemic. So the answer is about the potential mutations leading to a pandemic.

2. **Consequence for poultry if outbreak continues?** The text says the virus from dairy cattle infected poultry, leading to culling and worker infections. The answer is likely the poultry industry being harmed, maybe "the poultry industry is going to sink" as per a quote.

3. **Federal department with dual mandate complicating response?** The article states the Agriculture Department handles both regulating and promoting agriculture, which complicates the response. So the USDA or Agriculture Department.

4. **Transmission method paradox making containment easier/harder?** The article says H5N1 isn't spreading through respiratory pathways but via contaminated objects. This makes it easier because it's mechanical transmission, but harder because controlling all objects is tough. The answer combines both aspects.

5. **Animal not typically on farms complicating reservoir?** The virus was found in wild birds like waterfowl and mammals such as house mice, cats, raccoons. So maybe "wild birds" or "house mice" etc. The question specifies "not typically associated with farms"â€”maybe wild birds like waterfowl.

6. **US cattle movement vs. other countries?** The article says other nations don't move animals between farms as much as the US, leading to the outbreak's uniqueness. So the answer is the US moves cattle more between farms.

7. **Industry suffering losses due to H5N1 in cattle?** The poultry industry is mentioned as being affected because the virus spread from cattle to poultry, leading to culling. So poultry industry.

8. **Genetic data contradicting multiple bird-to-cattle events?** The article states genetic data suggest a single spillover event from birds to cattle. So the data shows it's a single spillover, not multiple.

9. **Counterintuitive vaccination approach?** The article mentions vaccinating cattle might be better since animal vaccines can be more effective. So vaccinating cattle instead of humans.

10. **Discovery involving blackbirds challenging focus on cattle?** The virus was found in blackbirds in Texas, meaning they can spread it to new farms. So blackbirds carrying the virus to farms.
