Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article provided. Let me start by reading through the questions again and then go back to the text to find the answers.

1. **Question 1:** How does Amy Tan's experience with the great horned owls illustrate her broader philosophy on observing and understanding birds?

Looking at the article, there's a part where she talks about the owls. She mentions that a mother and her male offspring stayed for months and were "reliable every single day." She also says that their presence made her feel lucky. Her philosophy includes "being the bird" and observing their behaviors. The experience with the owls shows her dedication to being a witness and asking questions, which aligns with her approach of observing and understanding through prolonged interaction. The answer here is probably about her philosophy of being a witness and asking questions, which the owls exemplify.

2. **Question 2:** Which species of bird, described as "reliable every single day", prompted the author to inquire about its presence each morning?

The article mentions the great horned owl's offspring and mother were "reliable every single day." The author (Amy Tan) would ask her husband each morning if "Junior and Mom" were out there. So the species here is the great horned owl.

3. **Question 3:** How did Amy Tan's method of developing avian characters in her book mirror her approach to fictional character creation?

The text says she uses the same method for both: imagining herself as each individual. So her approach to creating fictional characters is mirrored by "Be the bird," which is her method for the avian characters.

4. **Question 4:** Which architectural feature of Amy Tan's new home inadvertently contributed to her increased bird-watching opportunities?

Her new home is described as having a dining room with a view of the garden's birdlife. She moved her workspace there because of the view. So the architectural feature is the dining room's location offering a good view.

5. **Question 5:** What seemingly contradictory trait did Amy Tan observe in the smallest avian visitors to her garden?

The smallest birds, like pygmy nuthatches, are described as the most fearless. They signal others to come to the feeders. The contradiction might be that despite their small size, they're bold. The article says "Why is it the tiniest birds that seem to be the most fearless?" So the answer is their fearlessness despite being tiny.

6. **Question 6:** Which daily routine did Amy Tan alter as a direct result of her newfound ornithological interests?

She shifted her workspace from her office to the dining room for the better view. So the altered routine is moving her work space to the dining room.

7. **Question 7:** Which avian visitors served as inadvertent alarm systems for locating specific nocturnal birds in Amy Tan's garden?

The corvids (scrub jays and crows) would scream at the owl's location. She followed their pointing bills to find the owls. So the answer is the corvids (scrub jays and crows).

8. **Question 8:** What unique perspective did Amy Tan adopt when creating illustrations for her book that differed from traditional bird guides?

Traditional guides have precise portraits like Sibley's. Her illustrations are more like portraits of individuals who looked at her, with some having thought bubbles. The unique perspective is creating portraits of individuals who acknowledged her, not precise field guides.

9. **Question 9:** What unexpected parallel did Amy Tan draw between avian social dynamics at her feeders and human childhood interactions?

She compared it to a kindergarten playground, where they determine leaders, bullies, etc. So the parallel is likening it to a kindergarten's social dynamics.

10. **Question 10:** What unexpected limitation did Amy Tan impose on herself when counting bird species in her garden?

She only counts birds that enter the garden or fly in the vertical space above it, not those farther off like cormorants over the bay. The limitation is excluding birds seen in the distance but not in the garden area.

Now I need to make sure each answer is directly from the text and matches exactly. Let me check each again quickly.

1. The experience with owls shows her philosophy of being a witness and asking questions. The article says she's a witness and questioner, so that's correct.

2. Great horned owl is correct as per the text.

3. "Be the bird" mirrors her fictional character method.

4. Dining room's view is the architectural feature.

5. Fearlessness in tiny birds is the contradiction.

6. Moving workspace to dining room.

7. Corvids (scrub jays and crows).

8. Portraits of individuals who looked at her, not precise guides.

9. Kindergarten playground comparison.

10. Only counts birds in garden or vertical space, not distant ones.

All answers are directly from the article. No need for N/A here since all are addressed.
