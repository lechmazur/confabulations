Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and answer exactly what's asked without any extra details.

1. **First question**: Which philanthropic initiative supported by Darren Walker aligns with the artistic medium of the first Black composer at the Metropolitan Opera? The article mentions that Ford helped underwrite the Met's first production by a Black composer, Terence Blanchard's "Fire Shut Up in My Bones". The initiative related to the arts and diversity in the arts is mentioned in the context of the Metropolitan Opera's production. The specific initiative might be part of the Ford Foundation's broader efforts in arts equity. Wait, the question is about the initiative name. The article says Ford supported the Metropolitan Opera's first Black composer's production through their general efforts in fostering equity in the arts, but there's no specific named initiative here. Hmm, maybe the question is referring to the opera itself? But the answer should be the initiative. Wait, the article says "Ford has gone to great lengths to foster greater equity in the arts. In 2018, Ford, with the Walton Family Foundation, committed $6 million toward diversifying the curators and management at art museums. It helped underwrite the Metropolitan Opera's first production by a Black composer..." So the specific initiative here is the $6 million with Walton for art museums, but the opera underwriting isn't named. The question is about the initiative that aligns with the artistic medium (opera). Maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the article doesn't name a specific initiative for the opera production beyond the general support. Alternatively, maybe the "Art for Justice Fund" but that's about criminal justice. Wait, no. The opera's underwriting is part of Ford's arts equity efforts, but there's no named initiative for that specific production. So maybe the answer is N/A? Or perhaps the question is asking for the name of the opera's production, but that's the second question. Let me check the second question first. 

2. **Second question**: The name of the opera production is "Fire Shut Up in My Bones" by Terence Blanchard. So the first question is asking for the initiative that aligns with that. Since the article says Ford "helped underwrite" that production, maybe the initiative is part of their arts equity work, but since it's not named, perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, but the first question says "philanthropic initiative" supported by Walker. The article mentions "Ford has gone to great lengths to foster greater equity in the arts. In 2018, Ford, with the Walton Family Foundation, committed $6 million toward diversifying the curators and management at art museums." That's a specific initiative, but that's about museums. The opera underwriting isn't tied to a named initiative. So maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick where the answer is the opera's name, but the first question is about the initiative. Hmm, maybe I missed something. Wait, the question says "aligns with the artistic medium of the first Black composer at the Metropolitan Opera." The artistic medium here is opera. The initiative that supports opera? The article says Ford supported the Met's production through their arts equity efforts, but there's no named initiative for that. So perhaps the answer is N/A. But maybe the question is looking for "the Metropolitan Opera's first production by a Black composer" as the initiative? No, that's the production's name. Maybe the answer is N/A. I'll note that and come back.

3. **Third question**: Who said "He's never personal when he pushes an institution or a leader to think differently about something" about Darren Walker? The article states that Bryan Stevenson, the founder of the Equal Justice Initiative, said this. So answer is Bryan Stevenson.

4. **Fourth question**: The program at Rockefeller Foundation for rebuilding New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina was called "Rebuild New Orleans initiative". The article mentions "overseeing programs like the Rebuild New Orleans initiative after Hurricane Katrina". So the name is "Rebuild New Orleans initiative".

5. **Fifth question**: The company he joined the board of, which was discordant, is PepsiCo. The text says he joined the board of PepsiCo, which some found discordant due to their lobbying against public health laws.

6. **Sixth question**: The artist whose exhibition was postponed due to KKK figures is Philip Guston. The article mentions the controversy over an exhibition of Philip Guston's work with KKK images.

7. **Seventh question**: The university that cracked down on pro-Palestinian protests was Columbia. The article says he was pressured to decline an honorary degree from Columbia due to their handling of pro-Palestinian protests.

8. **Eighth question**: The museum that got funding for diversity initiatives? The article mentions the Metropolitan Opera's production, but museums: "Ford, with the Walton Family Foundation, committed $6 million toward diversifying the curators and management at art museums." But the specific museum isn't named. Wait, the article also says "supported diversity initiatives at the School of American Ballet, the training academy of New York City Ballet." Wait, the question asks for a museum. The article doesn't name a specific museum, just mentions art museums in general. So perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "the School of American Ballet" is part of NYC Ballet, but that's a ballet school, not a museum. The question is about a museum. Since the $6M was for art museums in general, not a specific one, the answer would be N/A.

9. **Ninth question**: The ballet company with funding for diversity is New York City Ballet, as the School of American Ballet is its training academy. The article states Ford supported diversity initiatives at the School of American Ballet, which is part of NYC Ballet. So the answer is New York City Ballet.

10. **Tenth question**: His salary as president of the Ford Foundation was $1.4 million. The article states "compensation package of about $1.4 million".

Now going back to question 1: Since the opera's underwriting is part of Ford's arts equity efforts but there's no specific named initiative, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting the name of the opera's production as the initiative? But that's the answer to question 2. So question 1's answer is N/A. Let me confirm the text again. The article says Ford "helped underwrite the Metropolitan Opera's first production by a Black composer, Terence Blanchard's 'Fire Shut Up in My Bones'". There's no named initiative here, so the answer must be N/A.

So final answers:

1. N/A

2. Fire Shut Up in My Bones

3. Bryan Stevenson

4. Rebuild New Orleans initiative

5. PepsiCo

6. Philip Guston

7. Columbia

8. N/A

9. New York City Ballet

10. $1.4 million (as president of the Ford Foundation)
