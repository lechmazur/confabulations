Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article provided. Let's start with the first question.

1. The question is about how the cucumber shortage shows the impact of social media trends on local food supply chains, considering Iceland's geography and agriculture. The article mentions that the TikTok trend caused a cucumber shortage because Iceland's supply couldn't keep up. The country relies on local geothermal greenhouses, but when demand spiked, they had to import from the Netherlands. So the answer should link social media's role in creating sudden demand, and Iceland's isolation and reliance on local production leading to shortages.

2. Next, the second question asks how the craze highlights challenges in maintaining a self-sustaining system in an isolated place. The article says Iceland prides itself on self-sufficiency but had to import cucumbers. Their greenhouses usually supply 99% locally, but the shortage shows that sudden demand can overwhelm this. So the answer would be that the self-sustaining system can't handle sudden spikes, leading to reliance on imports which are harder due to isolation.

3. The third question is about vulnerabilities of isolated agricultural systems to external influences. The cucumber trend is an external influence (social media) that caused a shortage. The isolation makes it hard to quickly import, so the answer is that external trends can disrupt supply because imports are costly and slow.

4. The fourth question is similar to the first but focuses on managing food supply in a geographically isolated country. The timing of the trend hit a lull in cucumber production cycles and a CO2 shortage. Plus, schools reopening added demand. So the answer would mention the combination of production timing and external demand overwhelming their system.

5. The fifth question is about challenges in maintaining self-sufficiency in a small population. The article states Iceland has a population of ~380k, so a small surge affects supply more. The answer is that a small population has less demand variability, so sudden increases (like from TikTok) can't be absorbed, leading to shortages.

6. The sixth question asks about the timing of the TikTok trend with Iceland's greenhouse cycles. The article says the craze hit during a lull in cucumber yield cycles. So the answer is that the trend coincided with a low point in greenhouse production.

7. The seventh question is about Iceland's carbon footprint commitment contributing to scarcity. The article mentions they prefer local produce to reduce carbon, so they didn't import even when needed, exacerbating the shortage. The answer is their commitment to local foods meant they couldn't quickly import, worsening the shortage.

8. The eighth question connects geothermal power (used in greenhouses) to vulnerability. Since greenhouses rely on geothermal, but CO2 shortages (a key part of greenhouse production) contributed to the problem. Wait, the article says there was a slight CO2 shortage, which is part of greenhouse production. So the geothermal supports greenhouses, but CO2 issues (maybe related to geothermal? Not sure) but the direct link is that geothermal allows local growth, but external factors like CO2 shortages (not directly geothermal) affect it. Hmm, maybe the article says CO2 is a key element, but not linked to geothermal. The answer might be that geothermal supports greenhouses, but when CO2 (a necessary input) was in short supply, it reduced production, making them vulnerable to trends.

9. The ninth question is about challenging Iceland's self-sufficiency reputation. The shortage shows that even with local production, sudden demand can cause gaps, so the answer is the shortage exposed that their system isn't fully resilient to sudden trends.

10. The tenth question is about limitations of greenhouse-based agriculture. The trend showed that even with greenhouses, they can't scale up quickly if there's a production lull and external factors like CO2 shortages. The answer is the system can't adjust rapidly to demand spikes due to fixed production cycles and dependencies like CO2.

Now, I need to check each answer against the article to ensure accuracy and that I'm not adding external info. Let me go through each question again quickly.

1. The article says the social media trend caused the shortage, and Iceland's isolation made importing expensive. So the answer is correct.

2. The article states self-sustaining agriculture but couldn't handle the surge, needing imports. Correct.

3. External trend (social media) causing shortage due to isolation's import issues. Correct.

4. Timing hit a lull in production plus CO2 issues and school orders. Correct.

5. Small population means little room for demand spikes. Correct.

6. Hit during a lull in yield cycles. Correct.

7. Their preference for local foods meant they couldn't easily import, contributing to shortage. Correct.

8. Geothermal supports greenhouses, but CO2 shortage (a key element) limited production. The CO2 issue is mentioned as a separate factor, so the geothermal isn't directly the cause, but the greenhouse system's dependency on CO2 (which is separate from geothermal) is part of it. The question links geothermal to vulnerability. Maybe the answer is that geothermal-powered greenhouses are their main source, but external factors like CO2 shortages (which might be due to other issues) affect them. The article says "slight shortage of carbon dioxide, she said, a key element of greenhouse production." So geothermal provides the heat, but CO2 is another input. So the vulnerability is that even with geothermal, they rely on CO2 which had a shortage. So the answer connects geothermal (their main method) but CO2 issues made them vulnerable when the trend hit. So the answer is that geothermal greenhouses are their main system, but CO2 shortages (a dependency) limited production during the trend.

9. The shortage showed their self-sufficiency isn't foolproof. Correct.

10. Greenhouse system can't quickly adapt to demand spikes due to cycles and CO2 issues. Correct.

All answers should be in the article. Let me check for any N/A. None seem to be N/A as all questions are addressed in the text. Now, phrasing the answers as per instructions: sentence fragments, no extra info, directly from the text.

Now, format each answer with the question number tags and answer tags. No explanations, just answers.
