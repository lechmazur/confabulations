Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I use only the information from the article provided. Let me start by going through each question and see what the article says.

1. **Question 1:** The implication of Dr. Schiff's statement, "It's not OK to know this and to do nothing," relates to the study's findings that some patients are aware. The article says he wants more research into how these patients might communicate, so the implication is that action is needed to help them.

2. **Question 2:** Dr. Schiff calls the condition "cognitive motor dissociation." The article mentions this term when describing the condition where patients can't show responses but have brain activity.

3. **Question 3:** The article says brain implants might help patients with disorders of consciousness communicate, similar to how an ALS patient used one. The connection is that these implants could be a future solution for dissociation patients.

4. **Question 4:** The article states that long-term survivors might be more resilient, which could mean they're more likely to stay aware. Schiff mentions resilience as a possible factor in their awareness.

5. **Question 5:** The parallel is that a recent ALS patient used a brain implant to communicate, so maybe similar tech can help those with cognitive motor dissociation.

6. **Question 6:** The study estimates up to 100,000 patients in the U.S. might have some consciousness, so the implication is that's the number.

7. **Question 7:** Using both fMRI and electrodes strengthens the findings by providing more data types, making results more reliable than earlier studies which might have used only one method.

8. **Question 8:** The article says Schiff thinks some dissociation patients could master implants, implying BCI development could let them communicate.

9. **Question 9:** Schiff mentions "tens of thousands" who might benefit from implants.

10. **Question 10:** Schiff says they might be missing some people because the tests are tough, but the article doesn't give an exact number. So it's N/A.

Wait, for question 10, the user asked for an estimated number, but the text only says "some patients" might be missed. Since there's no number provided, the answer should be N/A. Let me confirm each again.

1. The answer is that action is needed to help them communicate.
2. Cognitive motor dissociation.
3. Brain implants could help them communicate like the ALS case.
4. Resilient survivors more likely to retain awareness.
5. The ALS patient's use of an implant shows potential for dissociation patients.
6. Up to 100,000 in the U.S.
7. Combining methods increases reliability over earlier studies.
8. BCIs might let them communicate.
9. Tens of thousands.
10. N/A because no number is given.

I think that's all. Now I'll format the answers as per the instructions.
