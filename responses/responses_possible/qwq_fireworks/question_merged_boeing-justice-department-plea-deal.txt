Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly what's asked without any extra details. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **What condition in the 2021 agreement did Boeing allegedly violate, leading to the current plea deal?**
   - The article mentions that Boeing failed to "design, implement and enforce" an ethics and compliance program to prevent fraud. That's the condition they violated.

2. **What aspect of the plea deal do the families argue is inconsistent with typical treatment of criminal defendants?**
   - The families say the deal gives Boeing concessions that other defendants wouldn't get. The quote from Paul Cassell mentions "sweetheart deal" and "concessions."

3. **Total amount Boeing spent because of crashes including fines, payments to families, reimbursements to airlines, etc.?**
   - The article states Boeing has spent about $20 billion total.

4. **How much will Boeing invest over three years to strengthen compliance and safety?**
   - The figure given is $455 million.

5. **Percentage of Boeing's 2023 revenue from U.S. government contracts?**
   - It says nearly 40%.

6. **Who said the government's agreement with Boeing is "clearly not in the public interest"?**
   - Paul G. Cassell, the lawyer for the families.

7. **What program is Danielle Kaye part of, mentioned as for early career journalists?**
   - The David Carr Fellow program, specifically the 2024 one.

8. **How many months was the global ban on 737 Max jets?**
   - The article mentions a 20-month global ban.

9. **Who appoints the independent compliance monitor?**
   - The Justice Department appoints them.

10. **Name of the company involved in a nearly two-decade outsourcing experiment?**
    - Spirit AeroSystems, which Boeing agreed to buy.

Wait, let me double-check each answer against the text to ensure accuracy. For question 10, the article says Boeing bought Spirit AeroSystems, ending a nearly two-decade experiment in outsourcing. That's correct. All others seem to align with the details provided. I think that's all.
