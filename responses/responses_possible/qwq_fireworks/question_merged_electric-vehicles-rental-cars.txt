Okay, I need to go through each question one by one and find the answers strictly from the article provided. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks how the rapid depreciation of Tesla vehicles specifically impacted Hertz's financial performance in the first quarter. The article mentions that in the first three months of the year, the diminished value of Hertz's electric fleet lowered its profit by $195 million. Since Tesla is the leading EV manufacturer, this depreciation likely refers to their vehicles. So the answer is $195 million loss.

2. The second question is about Elon Musk's actions affecting resale values. The article states that Musk cut Tesla prices last year, which pushed down used Tesla prices. So his price cuts caused the resale value drop.

3. The third question compares Polestar and Tesla charging. The article says Tesla renters use the Supercharger network, which only works for Teslas. A Polestar user had to find other chargers, leading to difficulty. So the answer is that Polestar couldn't use Tesla's network.

4. Tesla's price cuts on new models caused used EVs to lose value faster, which hurts rental companies relying on resale. The article mentions this directly, so the answer is rapid depreciation in used market.

5. The paradox is that promoting EVs (to boost adoption) led to financial losses because of lower resale values. The article says rental companies tried to promote but faced losses, so the paradox is promoting led to losses.

6. The individual here is Elon Musk again, whose price cuts caused Tesla values to drop, leading to Hertz's losses. The article says "Elon Musk opens his mouth and the industry takes a dive" from the individual (James Iovino's comment). So Musk's actions caused losses.

7. Tesla's Supercharger exclusivity meant non-Tesla renters had to use different chargers with various apps, making it harder. The Polestar example shows this, so the effect was requiring different apps and less access.

8. The manufacturer here is Tesla. Their price cuts affected the financial calculus (resale values) for rental companies. The article says Tesla's actions caused resale issues, so Tesla's actions impacted their financials.

9. Musk's actions (price cuts) caused the chilling effect. The article says Hertz's experience (due to Musk) had a chilling effect on the industry. So Musk's actions led to that effect.

10. The decline in EV sales to rental companies is because of the rapid depreciation and financial losses. The article states that after Hertz's issues, companies are selling EVs at discounts and buying fewer now, so the primary reason is the depreciation leading to financial losses.
