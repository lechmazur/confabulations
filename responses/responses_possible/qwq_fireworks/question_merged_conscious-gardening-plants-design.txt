Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article provided and answer each question exactly as asked.

1. **Question 1:** Which gardener's approach aligns most closely with early Quaker beliefs about observing nature?  
   The article mentions Nicole Juday realizing her garden connects to Quaker beliefs in observing natural objects. So the answer is Nicole Juday.

2. **Question 2:** How does James Corner's private garden design philosophy parallel his work on the High Line?  
   The text says both require moving through the space to experience them. So the answer is that you must move through the space to experience it fully.

3. **Question 3:** How does Nicole Juday's current gardening approach differ from her earlier attempts to emulate others?  
   She now creates distinct areas like alpine troughs instead of copying others. The answer is creating "little, complete universes" in different parts.

4. **Question 4:** How does Craig Wakefield's garden design contrast with the architectural style of his house?  
   His house is midcentury modern (minimalist), but the garden has abundant plants. The contrast is between minimalism and abundance.

5. **Question 5:** Which gardener's mission involves creating multiple distinct ecosystems within a limited space?  
   Nicole Juday's garden has alpine, carnivorous plant, dry, tropical, etc. So she's the one.

6. **Question 6:** How does the concept of time manifest in James Corner's private garden design?  
   The garden changes with time of day/year and seasons. Also, the experience changes as you move through it.

7. **Question 7:** How does Suzanne Penn's gardening approach reflect her understanding of art conservation?  
   She sees gardening as an art form that's never finished/static, like art conservation which involves ongoing care.

8. **Question 8:** What unexpected connection did Nicole Juday discover between her gardening style and religious beliefs?  
   Her Quaker beliefs about observing nature to find divine patterns.

9. **Question 9:** How does Charles Cresson's use of pronouns reflect his perception of the garden's legacy?  
   He uses "we" when talking about the garden, showing it's a family legacy.

10. **Question 10:** How does Nicole Juday's current gardening approach reflect a synthesis of personal beliefs and horticultural interests?  
   She combines her Quaker beliefs with horticulture by nurturing diverse plants in small spaces to observe nature's patterns.

Now I need to check each against the article to ensure accuracy and that I didn't infer beyond the text. Let's confirm each point quickly.

1. Yes, Nicole Juday's Quaker connection is explicit.  
2. James Corner's garden and High Line both require moving through them.  
3. Juday's current approach is her own "universes" instead of copying others.  
4. Wakefield's contrast is minimalism vs abundance.  
5. Nicole Juday's multiple ecosystems.  
6. Time is mentioned in seasons and experience over time.  
7. Suzanne Penn's art as unfinished.  
8. Juday's Quaker beliefs.  
9. Cresson uses "we" for family legacy.  
10. Juday's approach ties Quaker beliefs to horticulture.

All answers are directly supported. No N/A needed here except maybe check for exact wording. The article says Juday's approach now is "little universes" and her Quaker beliefs. The tenth question asks about synthesis of personal beliefs and horticultural interests, which matches her combining Quaker observations with her gardening.
