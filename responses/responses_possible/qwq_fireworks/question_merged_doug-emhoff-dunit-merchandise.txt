Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which social media platform was instrumental in popularizing the photo leading to the merchandise. The article mentions Megan Burk posted the photo on X (formerly Twitter), which got 2.2 million views. The Harris campaign then made merchandise from it. So the answer should be X.

2. **Question 2:** The film that inspired feminism discussions contrasted with Doug's support is mentioned in the context of Greta Gerwig's "Barbie." The text says "Barbie" inspired countless discussions of feminism. So the answer is Barbie.

3. **Question 3:** The generation fed up with gendered politics is Gen Z. The article states, "particularly resonant with Gen Z, because they are so incredibly fed up..." So Gen Z is the answer.

4. **Question 4:** Doug's ex-wife who defended him is Kerstin Emhoff. The text says his ex-wife Kerstin issued a statement defending him. So her name is Kerstin Emhoff.

5. **Question 5:** The sales figure for Miu Miu is mentioned as "halfway to $1 billion in sales for 2024." So the answer is $1 billion.

6. **Question 6:** The senator criticized for "childless cat ladies" comment is JD Vance. The article mentions Senator JD Vance of Ohio as part of the Republican ticket and his comments.

7. **Question 7:** The media strategist who analyzed the photo is Florie Hutchinson. The text quotes her analysis of the image's appeal.

8. **Question 8:** The politician's wife who left her job is Usha Vance. The article says Mrs. Vance (Senator Vance's wife) stepped away from her job to focus on the campaign.

9. **Question 9:** The fashion journalist preferring the real-life Ken is Amy Odell. She's the one mentioned comparing to the "real-life version of Ken."

10. **Question 10:** The SoulCycle location is West Hollywood. The article states Emhoff learned about Biden's exit after a workout there.

Now, I'll check each against the text to confirm. All answers are directly from the article except where it's N/A. Let's ensure none are inferred beyond the text. For example, Miu Miu's sales are stated as halfway to $1B, so $1B is the figure mentioned. All others are direct names and terms from the text. No N/A needed here except if any question isn't addressed. Let me recheck each question again quickly.

5. $1 billion (correct)
6. JD Vance (correct)
