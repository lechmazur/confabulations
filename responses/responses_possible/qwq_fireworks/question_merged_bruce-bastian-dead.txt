Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure each answer is directly from the text and follows the instructions strictly. Let's start with the first question.

1. **Question 1**: The significance of 1994 in WordPerfect's business and Bruce's career. The article says in 1994, Bastian and Ashton sold their company to Novell for $1.4 billion. That's the key point here. So the answer is the sale to Novell.

2. **Question 2**: The legal battle over gay marriage's impact on their relationship. The text mentions they became adversaries in the legal battle over gay marriage. So the answer is that it made them adversaries.

3. **Question 3**: Mormon Church's stance on Proposition 8 affecting his relationships. The article states that in 2008, the Mormon Church supported Prop 8, and Ashton contributed $1M, while Bastian opposed it, leading to him feeling betrayed. So the impact was a rift due to opposing sides on Prop 8.

4. **Question 4**: How Amsterdam revelation changed his life. The text says he kissed a man there, leading him to come out, leave Mormonism, and focus on LGBTQ activism. The answer is that it led him to come out and change his life path.

5. **Question 5**: Influence of personal experiences on his professional and philanthropy. He funded LGBTQ causes after coming out. So his experiences led him to support LGBTQ causes through his foundation.

6. **Question 6**: Which founder advocated conflicting with partner's beliefs. Bastian became an LGBTQ advocate, while Ashton supported Prop 8, opposing same-sex marriage. So the answer is Bruce Bastian.

7. **Question 7**: Music education and software career. He wrote a program with Ashton for choreographing band performances. So his music background led to early software work.

8. **Question 8**: Political issue causing rift after selling the company. The Prop 8 issue in California caused the rift. The question mentions it's after selling the company (which was in 1994), so Prop 8 is correct.

9. **Question 9**: Personal revelation in Amsterdam. The revelation was realizing he was gay after kissing a man, leading him to come out and change his life. So the answer is realizing he was gay.

10. **Question 10**: Programming task from college extracurricular. The article says he and Ashton wrote a program to help choreograph band performances. So the task was choreographing band performances.

Now, check each answer against the text to ensure accuracy and that there's no missing info. Make sure all answers are direct and not inferred beyond the text. If any question's answer isn't explicitly stated, mark N/A. But from the text, all answers seem covered except maybe question 3. Wait, question 3 asks about both personal and professional relationships. The article mentions the betrayal in their relationship, so that's covered. Alright, all set.
