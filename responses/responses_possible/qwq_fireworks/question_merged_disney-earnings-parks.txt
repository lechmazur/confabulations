Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by going through each question and cross-referencing the article.

1. **How does the recent performance of Disney's ESPN division illustrate the company's ability to navigate the challenges of the domestic and international markets?**  
   Looking at the article, ESPN's performance is mentioned: operating income increased 4% to $1.1B, with most growth overseas. Domestic ad sales rose 17%, but domestic operating income only up 1%. So the answer should reflect both domestic and international performance. The question is about illustrating their ability to navigate, so maybe the international growth despite domestic challenges. Answer: "ESPN's operating income increased 4% globally, with overseas growth offsetting domestic cost pressures."

2. **How has the shift in consumer behavior due to economic factors specifically impacted Disney's theme park revenue and operating profit in the last reported quarter?**  
   The article states revenue increased 2% to $8.4B but operating profit fell 3% to $2.2B. The reason given was "moderation of consumer demand" and higher costs. So the answer is the specific numbers and the reasons. Answer: "Revenue rose 2% but operating profit fell 3% due to reduced consumer spending and higher costs."

3. **Which division that contributed 70% of Disney's operating profit last year is now showing signs of weakening demand?**

5. **What streaming milestone did Disney achieve earlier than anticipated, coinciding with the quarter where its traditional profit center showed signs of strain?**  
   The article says Disney's streaming division (Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+) turned a profit, which they achieved earlier than the expected later this year. Answer: "First profit for its direct-to-consumer division."

6. **Which Disney film released after the reported quarter helped offset concerns in another business segment that historically funded the company's streaming expansion?**
