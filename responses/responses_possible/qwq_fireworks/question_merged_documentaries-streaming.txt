Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I use only the information from the provided article and follow the strict format. Let me start by reading each question carefully and then finding the relevant parts in the text.

1. **Question 1**: The irony in the Enola Gay pilot's perspective. The article mentions that Paul Tibbets Jr. spoke about Hiroshima and Nagasaki as a "classroom experiment" for bomb studies. The broader narrative of "The Atomic Cafe" is about how officials downplayed the horrors. The irony here is that he's treating the destruction as a learning tool, which is callous given the devastation. So the answer should reflect that irony between his casual attitude and the reality.

2. **Question 2**: How "A Still Small Voice" uses boundaries. The text says Rev. Fleenor warns Mati about setting boundaries, especially on her days off. The film shows her struggling with this during the pandemic, highlighting the emotional toll. The answer should mention the boundary issue as part of exploring their emotional stress.

3. **Question 3**: "Bombshell" and women's contributions. Hedy Lamarr's scientific work (frequency hopping) was overshadowed by her fame from "Ecstasy." The film comments on how her contributions weren't recognized financially, showing the theme of appearance over talent. So the answer connects her appearance vs. her scientific work being undervalued.

4. **Question 4**: Film showing natives welcoming Americans. The article says "The Atomic Cafe" has a propagandistic excerpt where Bikini Atoll natives are portrayed as welcoming the Americans. The "sick joke" is part of the description here, so the answer is "The Atomic Cafe."

5. **Question 5**: The military officer's statement. The officer in "The Atomic Cafe" says if you get enough radiation to cause sterility or sickness, you'd be killed by blast, heat, etc. This statement downplays protection, highlighting futility. The exact quote is in the text.

6. **Question 6**: Invention by someone in a controversial 1933 film. Hedy Lamarr is in "Ecstasy" (1933) and invented frequency hopping, which led to Wi-Fi/GPS. The invention is frequency hopping, but the question asks for the modern communication tech, so Wi-Fi or GPS. But the article says "secure Wi-Fi and GPS," so the answer is frequency hopping, but the question says "crucial to modern communication" which is Wi-Fi/GPS. Wait, the invention itself is frequency hopping, but the question says "developed by someone..." so the invention is frequency hopping, but the answer should be the modern tech? Let me check the text again. The article states "the technology provided the eventual basis for secure Wi-Fi and global positioning systems." So the invention is frequency hopping, but the question asks for the modern tech. Hmm. The question says "invention crucial to modern communication" so the answer should be frequency hopping, but the article mentions Wi-Fi/GPS as the result. Wait, the question says "developed by someone..." so the invention itself is frequency hopping. The answer is frequency hopping. Wait, the question says "crucial to modern communication" so maybe the answer is Wi-Fi or GPS, but the invention was frequency hopping. The question might be looking for the invention, not the modern tech. Let me check the exact wording. The article says "she devised a radio 'frequency hopping' system that could enable American naval vessels to guide torpedoes... the technology provided the eventual basis for secure Wi-Fi and global positioning systems." So the invention is frequency hopping, which is the basis. The question asks for the invention crucial to modern communication, so the answer is frequency hopping. But the question says "developed by someone better known for their appearance in a controversial 1933 film (Ecstasy)." So the answer is frequency hopping. Wait, but maybe the answer expects the modern tech like Wi-Fi? Let me think again. The question says "invention... developed by someone...", so the invention is frequency hopping. The answer should be frequency hopping.

7. **Question 7**: Song lyrics in "The Atomic Cafe" referencing a post-apocalyptic scenario. The article mentions Bill Haley & His Comets singing of a "Strangelovian fantasy in which a hydrogen bomb leaves '13 women and only one man in town.'" The lyrics about 13 women and one man after a bomb fit the question. The song's title is "13 Women and Only One Man in Town," so the answer is that line.

8. **Question 8**: Subject with espionage, Hollywood, science, no money. Hedy Lamarr's story includes espionage (her first marriage to a munitions magnate, fleeing him), Hollywood fame, and her invention (science) but didn't get money from the patent. So the answer is "Bombshell" or Hedy Lamarr? The question asks which documentary's subject, so the film is "Bombshell."

9. **Question 9**: Film showing dissonance between nuclear power and nonchalant attitudes. "The Atomic Cafe" is about how officials downplayed the horrors, like the officer's statement and the pilot's comments. The answer is "The Atomic Cafe."

10. **Question 10**: Subject challenging gender stereotypes. Hedy Lamarr was a Hollywood star (stereotypically feminine) but excelled in science (stereotypically male). The answer is Hedy Lamarr's story in "Bombshell," so the documentary is "Bombshell."

Wait, let me double-check each:

1. Irony in Enola Gay pilot's perspective: The article says Tibbets spoke of Hiroshima/Nagasaki as a "classroom experiment." The broader film's angle is how officials downplayed the horror. So the irony is that he treats the destruction as an experiment, showing nonchalance despite the devastation. So the answer is "treating the destruction as a classroom experiment."

2. Boundaries in "A Still Small Voice": The chaplain's supervisor warns about setting boundaries (not answering phone on days off), which the film shows as part of the emotional toll during the pandemic. The answer is "the warning about setting boundaries."

3. "Bombshell" and women's contributions: The film shows her contributions were overshadowed by her appearance. The answer is "her scientific contributions overshadowed by her fame."

4. Film with natives welcoming Americans: "The Atomic Cafe" has the Bikini Atoll example. Answer: "The Atomic Cafe."

5. Officer's statement: The exact quote is "if you receive enough gamma radiation... you'll be killed by blast, flying debris or heat anyway." Answer is that statement.

6. Invention: frequency hopping, but the question asks for the invention crucial to modern communication. The article says the tech is basis for Wi-Fi/GPS, so maybe the answer is frequency hopping. The question says "invention developed by someone..." so frequency hopping is the invention. The answer is "frequency hopping."

7. Song lyrics: "13 women and only one man in town."

8. Subject with espionage, Hollywood, science, no pay: Hedy Lamarr. The film is "Bombshell."

9. Cognitive dissonance film: "The Atomic Cafe."

10. Challenging gender stereotypes: Hedy Lamarr's story in "Bombshell."
