Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article and follow the strict format.

1. **Primary reason multifamily loans are stronger despite defaults?** The article mentions that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can step in if other lenders back away. So the answer is their government backing providing a safety net.

2. **Refinancing challenge difference between fixed and floating?** The article says fixed-rate owners might struggle when refinancing into higher rates, while floating rates already have rising payments. The key difference is that fixed-rate borrowers face higher refinance rates when their loans mature.

3. **Role of Fannie/Freddie creating safety net?** The text states they can take more business if others pull out, which other sectors lack. So their ability to provide government-backed financing is the unique safety net.

4. **ZMR Capital's Brandon property example?** Their mortgage had a floating rate, leading to a 50% increase in interest payments, causing inability to repay. That's the risk of floating rates in high-rate environment.

5. **Significance of multifamily on watch lists despite lower delinquency?** Even though delinquency is lower than offices/hotels, the growing concern shows potential future risks, so analysts are monitoring them more.

6. **Population shift during pandemic's effect?** Developers built too many luxury apartments expecting持续 demand, but migration slowed, leading to oversupply. That's the key link.

7. **Government entities providing safety net?** Clearly stated as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

8. **Region for multifamily concerns vs. offices?** Offices are in Northeast/West Coast, multifamily in Sun Belt.

9. **Most concerning mortgage type?** Floating rate mortgages, since they've had rising payments already.

10. **Firm expanding from $2B to $6.5B?** Tides Equities.

Now, check each against the article to ensure accuracy. Let me confirm each point again quickly.

1. Yes, the article says Fannie/Freddie provide a fail-safe others don't.
2. Fixed-rate loans will need to refinance into higher rates, while floating are already affected. Correct.
3. Same as 1, so answer is correct.
4. ZMR's case had a floating mortgage leading to default. Correct.
5. The article mentions multifamily is on watch lists despite lower delinquency, indicating emerging risks. Right.
6. Post-pandemic migration slowdown led to oversupply. Yes.
7. Fannie and Freddie. Yes.
8. Sun Belt vs. offices in Northeast/West Coast. Correct.
9. Floating rate mortgages. Yes.
10. Tides Equities. Correct.

All answers are directly from the text. None need "N/A".
