Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each question precisely.

1. The first question asks about the specific logistical improvement that could have helped Luka Lefevre and Charlotte Collet. The article mentions they had trouble using their phones to pay and had to use cash. The article also states that China promised to link WeChat and AliPay to international credit cards. So the answer should be linking super apps to international credit cards.

2. The second question is about how China's openness conflicts with domestic policies. The article mentions the counterespionage law expansion and state propaganda about foreigners being security risks. This contrasts with their efforts to appear open. So the answer is the expanded counterespionage law.

3. The third question on digital infrastructure being a double-edged sword. The super apps are convenient but menus and platforms are in Chinese, creating a language barrier. So the answer is the super apps' menus and platforms being in Chinese.

4. How visa-free benefits China more. The article says visitors can conduct business, so the benefit is allowing business activities.

5. Domestic narrative conflict. The article says China claims reports of xenophobia are Western spin, but their policies (like security apparatus) might contradict that. The answer is the claim that xenophobia reports are Western spin.

6. Legal change deterring visitors. The counterespionage law revision is mentioned, which might make foreigners wary.

7. Forbidden City challenge. The article states it requires advance reservations via platforms like WeChat in Chinese. So language barrier in reservation systems.

8. Government action boosting economy and countering criticism. The visa-free programs aim to attract tourists (economy) and show openness (counter criticism).

9. Technological feature with language barrier. The super apps (WeChat, AliPay) require Chinese interfaces.

10. Economic indicator influenced. The article mentions slowing economy and deflation fears, so the indicator is deflation.

Wait, let me check each again to ensure accuracy. 

Question 4: The article says the 15-day visa-free allows business, so yes. 

Question 10: The article says China needs money due to slowing economy and deflation fears, so they're targeting deflation by attracting tourists to boost spending. So the indicator is deflation.

I think that covers all. Now format them properly without extra text.
