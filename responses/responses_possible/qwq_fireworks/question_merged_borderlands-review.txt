Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then cross-referencing the article for answers.

1. **Primary reason for the 3-year delay**: The article mentions that the delay might be linked to the script. It suggests that the co-writer Joe Crombie might be a pseudonym because he has no other credits. So the answer could be the script issues or the pseudonymous writer.

2. **Kevin Hart's role challenging expectations**: The article says when Hart is the straight man, you know they're throwing everything. Maybe his character is a contrast to others, like his gothy Stormtrooper outfit. So the answer is that he plays the straight man in a chaotic cast.

3. **Design element as visual and plot device**: The masks with glow-in-the-dark features and pixelated faces are mentioned. They’re part of the design and used in the plot (maybe for disguise). So the masks and digital face tech.

4. **Aesthetic vs narrative coherence**: The style is described as maximalist, but the plot is cluttered. So the aesthetic might overshadow the plot, leading to incoherence.

5. **Digital disguise as metaphor**: The article says the digital tech lets people wear others' faces. This might mirror the film’s approach of borrowing from other works (like Star Wars), so the metaphor is about imitation or borrowing themes.

6. **Humor as strength and weakness**: The jokes are seen but don’t land, but there's some neat design. So the humor attempts are there but ineffective, hence both.

7. **Blanchett's tonal shifts and narrative style**: The article says she has to pivot tones, causing dizziness. This reflects the film’s inconsistent style or lack of coherence.

8. **Maximalist aesthetic critique**: The maximalist style is mentioned alongside the film feeling salvaged, so it's a critique that too much style causes incoherence.

9. **Treatment of Blanchett mirroring characters**: She endures nonsense like her character. The article says she carries it like a kitschy warrior, so her role mirrors the film’s struggle.

10. **Visual element nodding to source and critical reception**: The Princess Leia holograms reference the game's first-person shooter roots but might symbolize the film being derivative (criticized for borrowing).

Wait, need to check each again for exactness. Let me go through each question again step by step.

1. The article says the delay and the pseudonym question are possible reasons. So the answer is "script issues" or "pseudonymous co-writer". The question asks for the primary reason based on indirect clues. The article doesn't explicitly state the reason for the delay but suggests the script might be haphazard. So maybe the answer is the haphazard script, but the question mentions authorship and production. So combining both, the answer is the script's haphazard nature due to possible pseudonymous writer.

2. Kevin Hart’s role as the straight man in a chaotic cast. The text says when Hart is the straight man, you know they’re throwing everything. So the answer is that he plays the straight man in a chaotic ensemble, challenging expectations by being serious in a wild cast.

3. The masks with glow-in-the-dark slits and pixelated faces. The article mentions these as design elements, and the digital tech for faces could be a plot device (maybe disguise in missions). So the specific element is the masks and pixelated faces.

4. The aesthetic (maximalist, Chernobyl chic) is described, but the plot is cluttered. So the implication is that the style overloads the narrative, causing incoherence. Answer: The maximalist style overshadows the plot, leading to incoherence.

5. The digital disguise tech allows wearing others' faces. The article says the film borrows from others (like Star Wars), so the metaphor is imitation or lack of originality. Answer: It reflects the film's derivative nature, imitating other works.

6. The jokes don’t land (weakness) but there's some neat design (strength). The humor attempts are there but ineffective. Answer: The humor is attempted but inconsistent, serving as both.

7. Blanchett’s tonal pivots make the audience dizzy, reflecting the film’s inconsistent tone. Answer: The shifts highlight the film's tonal inconsistency.

8. Maximalist aesthetic (overdone visuals) makes the film feel salvaged, a critique of its coherence. Answer: The maximalism leads to incoherent visuals and narrative.

9. Blanchett’s character endures nonsense, like the film forces her to. The article says she carries herself despite the nonsense. Answer: Her role mirrors the film's struggle with its material.

10. The Leia holograms nod to the game (source) and symbolize the film's derivative nature (criticized). So the holograms are the element. Answer: The hologram messages reference the game and symbolize derivative storytelling.
