Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. The user wants answers strictly based on the article provided, so I need to make sure I don't bring in any external knowledge. Let me start by rereading the article to get a clear understanding of the key points.

First question: The author finds blooper reels more engaging than the original shows despite watching all episodes of those shows. The article mentions that the author doesn't enjoy the conflict, cruelty, or bleakness in shows like Breaking Bad, etc., and finds bloopers comforting because they show people being friends and having fun. The primary reason given is that bloopers highlight real joy and friendship, contrasting with the shows' grim content.

Second question: Gabriel Macht's bloopers in Suits are described as showing his imperfection and humor. The metaphor here is that his struggle with lines and giggles represent the beauty of human imperfection, which the author values over the scripted perfection of the show. So the answer should link his specific behavior to the broader view.

Third question: The author never watched full episodes of Suits but likes the bloopers. This reflects a critique that TV shows focus too much on conflict and drama, which the author finds unappealing. The bloopers, without the show's content, offer comfort, suggesting the author dislikes how TV portrays conflict as essential.

Fourth question: The author offers money for a Succession blooper reel but not the show. Succession is known for its bleakness. The willingness to pay shows they prefer the authentic, joyful moments (bloopers) over the fictional cruelty of the show, indicating they value real human moments over scripted darkness.

Fifth question: The Suits blooper reel's value comes from its raw, unscripted humor. The article states the author finds bloopers richer than the show itself, challenging the idea that only polished content is valuable. So the answer is that it shows value in imperfection and spontaneity.

Sixth question: The "childlike state" refers to the author reverting to a simpler, joyful mindset when watching bloopers. This critiques adult entertainment that's overly serious or bleak, suggesting that such content is less authentic or enjoyable compared to lighthearted, unfiltered moments.

Seventh question: The preference for bloopers over shows suggests the author finds scripted interactions less authentic. Bloopers capture real, unscripted interactions, which the author finds more genuine than the artificial conflict in TV dramas.

Eighth question: Bloopers counter the "soul-destroying viciousness" by showing joy and camaraderie. The author uses them to contrast with the grim narratives, providing a more positive, authentic experience.

Ninth question: Bloopers from dark shows disrupt their intended bleakness. The author enjoys seeing the cast laugh or fail, which undermines the shows' serious tone, making them less impactful emotionally as intended.

Tenth question: The author's preference shows they believe TV's bleakness is fictional. Since bloopers reveal real joy, they argue that the cruelty in shows isn't real, just a construct, so they prefer the authentic moments over the scripted negativity.

Now, I need to check each answer against the article to ensure they're directly supported. Let me verify each point again quickly. For example, question 1's answer is supported by the author's dislike of conflict and preference for bloopers' comfort. The metaphor in question 2 is explicitly about human imperfection. The rest follow similarly. I'll format each answer as per the instructions, using "N/A" only if there's no direct info, but in this case, all answers are directly supported.
