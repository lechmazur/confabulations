Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and not any external knowledge. Let me start with question 1.

1. The question asks about the primary reason Bronfman's bid might face regulatory scrutiny despite Fortress being a red herring. The article mentions that Fortress is partly owned by Mubadala Investment Company, a UAE sovereign wealth fund. Critics worry about foreign ownership because Paramount owns CBS. So the answer is foreign ownership concerns due to Mubadala's involvement.

2. For question 2, the NFL's private equity involvement relates to Bronfman's investor challenges. The article says NFL owners struggle to find limited partners, similar to Bronfman needing backers. The connection is that both face difficulties securing investors, so the answer is the difficulty in finding limited partners.

3. Question 3 is about the breakup fee's influence. The text states that if Paramount picks another suitor, they owe Skydance a $400M fee. This makes the committee cautious because switching could be costly. So the answer is the $400 million breakup fee.

4. The fourth question is about Bronfman's insider trading conviction affecting perception. The article says his 2011 conviction under French law casts a shadow, so the answer is his 2011 insider trading conviction.

5. Question 5 asks which executive's bid pits a software mogul's son vs. a liquor tycoon's grandson. Bronfman is the grandson of Samuel Bronfman (Seagram), and David Ellison is Larry Ellison's son (Oracle). The answer is Bronfman's bid.

6. The sixth question links a conviction under French law to a Hollywood studio battle. Bronfman's conviction is mentioned in the context of his bid for Paramount. So the answer is Edgar Bronfman Jr.'s bid for Paramount.

7. The Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund (Mubadala) complicates approval. The article says Fortress's ownership by Mubadala raises foreign ownership issues. The answer is potential foreign ownership concerns due to Mubadala's stake in Fortress.

8. Question 8 asks which former official's speech uses techniques like media pitches. The article mentions Biden's delayed speech and social media strategies, but the example given is Obama's joke. However, the question specifies a political convention speech. The article references Obama's joke at the Democratic convention, so maybe Obama? Wait, the question says "former government official" and the article mentions Barack Obama's speech. So the answer is Barack Obama.

9. Question 9 is about media exec dinner meetings mirroring sports ownership. Bronfman met with Paramount CEOs like Cheeks, Robbins, McCarthy. The NFL section talks about team ownership negotiations. The answer is Edgar Bronfman Jr.

10. The final question compares shareholder dilution in Skydance deal to NFL limited partners. The article states Skydance's deal requires share dilution, and NFL owners struggle to find limited partners. The answer is shareholder dilution from Skydance's deal vs. NFL's difficulty in finding limited partners.
