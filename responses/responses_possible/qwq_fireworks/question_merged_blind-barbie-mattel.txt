Okay, I need to answer these 10 questions based solely on the given article. Let me go through each question one by one and check the article for the answers.

1. **Question 1**: How does the tactile satisfaction of the blind Barbie's clothing relate to the experiences of a specific Mattel brand ambassador mentioned in the article?

The article mentions Lucy Edwards, a brand ambassador who lost her sight at 17. She commented that the textures of the doll's clothes are important to her, similar to how she chooses her own clothes. The answer should connect the tactile testing to her experience. The article says the clothes were tested with blind kids, and Lucy talked about texture. So the answer is that the tactile satisfaction relates to her preference for textures when choosing clothes.

2. **Question 2**: How does the design of the blind Barbie's cane reflect both practical functionality and symbolic representation?

The cane has a marshmallow roller tip (practical for safe use) and is part of the design. The article also mentions that the cane is a symbol, so maybe the presence of the cane itself symbolizes inclusion. Wait, the article says the cane is red-and-white with a marshmallow tip, and the doll has bendable arms for using it. The practical part is the tip and bendable arms. The symbolic might be just having a cane as part of the doll's accessories, representing the experience of using one. So the answer combines both aspects.

3. **Question 3**: How does the article illustrate the potential impact on self-perception of individuals with sight loss via a British org spokesperson?

Debbie Miller from RNIB in the UK said that having this doll when she was younger would have made her feel more confident and less different. So the impact is making them feel confident and not feel the need to hide their condition.

4. **Question 4**: How does the article show the doll can foster conversations about disability, using a specific individual's experience?

The article mentions Tameka Simmons and her daughter Evely. The sisters talked to Evely about the cane like hers, so that's a conversation starter. The answer is that the sisters explained the cane to Evely, thus initiating conversation.

5. **Question 5**: Which doll's accessories were selected based on tactile testing with a specific group of children?

The blind Barbie's clothes and accessories were tested with blind and low-vision children. The answer is the blind Barbie.

6. **Question 6**: What characteristic of the Black Barbie with Down syndrome represents a genetic feature?

The article says the dress has three arrows on hearts, representing the third 21st chromosome (since Down syndrome is trisomy 21). So the three arrows symbolize the extra chromosome.

7. **Question 7**: Which influencer who lost sight as a teen praised the texture?

Lucy Edwards, as mentioned earlier.

8. **Question 8**: Design elements of a doll's dress and chromosomal makeup?

The Down syndrome Barbie's dress has three arrows representing the third 21st chromosome. So the three arrows on the dress relate to the chromosomal feature.

9. **Question 9**: Packaging accommodating the target demographic?

The blind Barbie's box has Braille lettering. That's for blind children to read.

10. **Question 10**: Doll released with blind Barbie that shares a name with a historical figure in another line?

The article mentions a previous Helen Keller doll in the Inspiring Women Series. The new Black Barbie with Down syndrome is the one released alongside the blind Barbie. Wait, the question asks which doll released alongside the blind Barbie shares a name with a historical figure. Wait, the new dolls are the blind Barbie and the Black Barbie with Down syndrome. The historical figure would be Helen Keller, but the new one isn't Helen Keller. Wait the article says the blind Barbie is new, but there was a Helen Keller Barbie in 2021. The question is which new doll shares a name with a historical figure? Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A because the new ones are not named after historical figures. Wait, the question says "shares a name with a historical figure previously featured in a different Mattel product line." The blind Barbie is new, but the previous Helen Keller was in Inspiring Women. The new Black Barbie with Down syndrome's name isn't mentioned as a historical figure. Wait, maybe the answer is that the blind Barbie is named after Helen Keller? No, the article says the new blind Barbie is part of Fashionistas, and the Helen Keller was part of the Inspiring Women Series. The question is asking which of the two new dolls (blind Barbie and the Down syndrome Barbie) shares a name with a historical figure previously in another line. Since the Down syndrome Barbie isn't named after anyone, and the blind Barbie isn't named after Helen Keller but the previous one was, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait the article says the new blind Barbie is the first in Fashionistas, but the Helen Keller was a previous blind Barbie. The question is about a doll released alongside the blind Barbie (so the Down syndrome one) that shares a name with a historical figure. Since the Down syndrome one's name isn't mentioned as a historical figure, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe the question is a trick because the new blind Barbie isn't named after Helen Keller, but the article mentions Helen Keller as a previous doll. The question is which of the newly released dolls (the two new ones) shares a name with a historical figure previously in another line. Since neither is named after a historical figure, the answer would be N/A. Wait, but maybe the Black Barbie with Down syndrome's name is a historical figure? The article doesn't name her. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the fact that the blind Barbie's design is similar to the previous Helen Keller one, but the name isn't the same. So the answer might be N/A. Alternatively, maybe the Down syndrome Barbie has a name that's a historical figure, but the article doesn't say. The article only mentions "Black Barbie with Down syndrome", no name. So the answer is N/A. Wait the question says "shares a name with a historical figure previously featured in a different Mattel product line." The previous Helen Keller is a historical figure in another line. The new blind Barbie isn't named Helen Keller. The other new doll (Down syndrome) isn't named after anyone. So the answer is N/A. Wait but the question is asking which doll, released alongside the blind Barbie, shares a name with a historical figure. Since the Down syndrome Barbie isn't named after a historical figure, the answer is N/A. Hmm, but maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The article says: "the blind doll was released alongside Mattel's first Black Barbie with Down syndrome..." So the two new dolls are blind Barbie and the Down syndrome Barbie. The question is, which of these two shares a name with a historical figure previously in another line. The previous blind Barbie was Helen Keller, but the new one isn't named that. The Down syndrome one's name isn't given. So answer is N/A. Wait but maybe the question is a trick where the name isn't the same, but the Down syndrome Barbie's name is the same as a historical figure? Not mentioned. So the answer is N/A. Wait, but the article mentions the Down syndrome Barbie's dress has three arrows. The question might be referring to the fact that the Down syndrome Barbie's name is the same as someone else? No. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the blind Barbie, but since the previous one was Helen Keller, but the new one is just "blind Barbie", not named after her. So I think the answer is N/A.
