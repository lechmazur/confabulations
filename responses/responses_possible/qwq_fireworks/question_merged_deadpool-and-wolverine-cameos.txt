Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the given article and follow the strict format. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question is about how Jon Favreau's character confirms Deadpool's integration into the MCU. The article mentions Favreau plays Happy Hogan, who's part of the MCU, especially from Iron Man. Since Happy is an MCU character, his presence here shows Deadpool is now in that universe. So the answer should be Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan.

2. Blake Lively is Ladypool, and the article says her real-life spouse is Ryan Reynolds. At the premiere, she wore a costume mimicking Ladypool, linking her role to their relationship. The meta-narrative here is her real-life marriage to Reynolds, the star. So the answer is Blake Lively's role as Ladypool, but the question asks how the casting creates a meta-narrative. The answer would be her real-life marriage to Reynolds and the premiere's nod.

3. The article mentions Channing Tatum never played Gambit in a feature film but talked a lot about it. He was attached to a movie that didn't happen. So the answer is Channing Tatum as Gambit.

4. The first cameo mentioned as a letdown and joke is Chris Evans as Johnny Storm (Human Torch), not Captain America. The article says this is intentional letdown and dastardly joke. So the answer is Chris Evans as Johnny Storm.

5. Blake Lively's role as Ladypool, and since she's married to Reynolds, that's the spouse part. The premiere foreshadowed her look. So the character is Ladypool, played by Blake Lively whose spouse is Reynolds.

6. The Blade character, played by Wesley Snipes, mentions there will only be one Blade, but Marvel is still moving forward with a remake starring Mahershala Ali. So Snipes' character contradicts his own line. Answer: Wesley Snipes as Blade.

7. The Void references discarded characters from various universes, and the Void was first introduced in the Disney+ series Loki. The cameo here would be the characters in the Void, but the question asks for a specific cameo. The article says the Void comes from Loki, so maybe the TVA soldier? Wait, the article mentions the TVA in the context of Danny DeVito's character. Wait, the article says "the Void, a wasteland of unwanted superpowered individuals first introduced in the Disney+ series 'Loki.'" So the cameo that connects to Loki (Disney+) is the presence of the Void. But the question asks for a specific cameo. Looking back, the article mentions Danny DeVito is credited as an unnamed TVA soldier. Since the TVA is from Loki, his appearance connects to the series and the Void. So the answer is Danny DeVito as the TVA soldier.

Wait, the question is about a cameo that connects to the Disney+ series (Loki) and references discarded characters (the Void). The Void's existence is tied to Loki, so the appearance of the Void itself might be the answer, but the question asks for a character's appearance. The article says "the Void... first introduced in the Disney+ series 'Loki.'" So any character from the Void might reference that, but the specific cameo that directly connects is the TVA soldier. The article mentions Danny DeVito as a TVA soldier, part of the Loki universe. So his cameo does that. So answer: Danny DeVito as TVA soldier.

8. The question is about a character whose appearance references a less successful part of the actor's career. The article mentions Jennifer Garner as Elektra, which was not well-received, and Ben Affleck's Daredevil isn't there, leading to a joke. So Jennifer Garner's Elektra role is the answer. The answer is Jennifer Garner as Elektra.

9. The cameo that connects to the multiverse and the actor's personal life. The article mentions that Matthew McConaughey's voice is in Cowboypool. The article also notes that he's done superhero roles less, but the personal life part? Wait, the article says he's known for other roles, so maybe not. Wait, the article says Blake Lively's appearance was tied to her marriage. The question is about a cameo connecting to the multiverse and the actor's personal life. The Cowboypool's voice is McConaughey, who's not in superheroes much. The article says "notice a particular drawl... Matthew McConaughey, an actor who has otherwise largely avoided the superhero frenzy." So his cameo subverts expectations because he's not known for superheroes. Wait, but the question is about connecting to multiverse and personal life. Alternatively, the Reynolds-Lively family cameos: their kids are in roles. The question is about an actor's personal life. The article mentions that Cowboypool's voice is McConaughey, but his personal life isn't mentioned here. Wait, the article says "many members of the Reynolds-Lively brood show up in the credits." Their kids are listed as Screaming Mutant, Kidpool, Babypool. So maybe one of them, but the question is about a cameo (actor), not a family member. Alternatively, the question might refer to Reynolds and Lively's real-life relationship as part of the meta-narrative. Wait, the question is "which cameo connects to the broader Marvel multiverse while referencing the actor's personal life?" The answer might be Blake Lively as Ladypool, since her real-life marriage to Reynolds is part of it. But question 2 already covers that. Alternatively, Matthew McConaughey isn't connected to personal life. Wait, the article says Danny DeVito is part of TVA, but that's more about the series. Wait, maybe the answer is Matthew McConaughey because he's a well-known actor outside superheroes, so his cameo subverts expectations, but the question's second part is about personal life. Hmm. Alternatively, the answer is Blake Lively again, but the question is about a cameo (actor), so maybe the answer is Matthew McConaughey's cameo as Cowboypool, since he's known for other roles and the article notes he's avoided superheroes. Wait, the question says "referencing the actor's personal life." The article mentions that McConaughey "has otherwise largely avoided the superhero frenzy," which is about his career, not personal life. Maybe the answer is the Reynolds-Lively kids, but the question asks for an actor. Alternatively, the answer is the actor who played TVA, but that's Danny DeVito, and the article doesn't link him to personal life. Wait, the article mentions Danny DeVito's connection via Wrexham with Reynolds and McElhenney. Wait, the article says "The 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia' star is credited as an unnamed soldier for the TVA... He's also a good pal of Reynolds: Together they own the U.K. soccer team Wrexham A.F.C." So Danny DeVito's cameo connects to his personal relationship with Reynolds (part of his personal life) and the multiverse via the TVA (Loki's Void). So the answer is Danny DeVito as TVA soldier. But the question says "referencing the actor's personal life," which is his friendship with Reynolds. So that fits. So question 9's answer is Danny DeVito as the TVA soldier.

Wait, but the article says Danny DeVito is the TVA soldier. Let me check again: "The 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia' star is credited as an unnamed soldier for the TVA â€” the Time Variance Authority, a Marvel institution that apprehends those who fiddle with timelines. He's also a good pal of Reynolds: Together they own the U.K. soccer team Wrexham A.F.C." So the actor is Danny DeVito. His personal life is the friendship with Reynolds, hence the cameo connects to the multiverse (TVA) and his personal life (being friends with Reynolds). So the answer is Danny DeVito as TVA soldier.

10. The question is about an actor playing multiple versions of their character, with one exception. The article mentions that Wolverine is played by Jackman in different costumes, but there's a version played by Henry Cavill (DC's Superman). So the actor is Hugh Jackman, who plays Wolverine in various forms, except when it's Cavill. So the answer is Hugh Jackman as Wolverine with Henry Cavill's cameo as an exception. The question asks which cameo involves an actor playing multiple versions, with one exception. The answer would be Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, with the exception being Henry Cavill's Wolverine. So the answer is Hugh Jackman (the actor) playing multiple Wolverines, with Cavill's appearance being the exception. The question asks for the cameo (the exception?), but the question wording is a bit tricky. Wait, the question says "which cameo involves an actor playing multiple versions..." but the actor in question is Jackman, but the cameo is Cavill's. Hmm. The article says "Most of these are played by Jackman in different costumes. At one point, however, Deadpool encounters a Wolverine played by Henry Cavill..." So the main actor (Jackman) is playing multiple versions, but the exception is Cavill's cameo. The question is about the cameo that involves an actor (Jackman) playing multiple versions except one. Wait, maybe the answer is Hugh Jackman, as the actor who plays multiple Wolverines, with the exception of Cavill. But the question says "which cameo involves an actor..." so the cameo is Henry Cavill as Wolverine. The answer might be Henry Cavill as Wolverine, since he's the exception. The question says "playing multiple versions of their character, with one notable exception." The main actor (Jackman) is the one playing multiple, but the exception is Cavill. So the cameo that is the exception is Henry Cavill's Wolverine. But the question is phrased as "which cameo involves an actor..." so perhaps the answer is Hugh Jackman, as the actor who plays multiple versions except when Cavill does. But the question might be looking for the actor who has the exception, which is Jackman, but the cameo is Cavill. The article says "the primary Wolverine is played by Jackman in different costumes, but there's an exception with Cavill." The question is about the cameo that is the exception. The answer would be Henry Cavill as Wolverine. So the answer is Henry Cavill as Wolverine.

Let me verify each answer again quickly:

1. Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan. Correct.

2. Blake Lively as Ladypool (her spouse is Reynolds, and the premiere nod). Correct.

3. Channing Tatum as Gambit. Correct.

4. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm. Correct.

5. Blake Lively as Ladypool (spouse is Reynolds). Correct.

6. Wesley Snipes as Blade. Correct.

7. Danny DeVito as TVA soldier (links to Loki's Void). Correct.

8. Jennifer Garner as Elektra (less successful film). Correct.

9. Danny DeVito as TVA soldier (due to friendship with Reynolds). Correct.

10. Henry Cavill as Wolverine (the exception to Jackman's multiple versions). Correct.

Wait, but question 10's answer is Henry Cavill's cameo as Wolverine, since he's the exception. So the answer is Henry Cavill as Wolverine.
