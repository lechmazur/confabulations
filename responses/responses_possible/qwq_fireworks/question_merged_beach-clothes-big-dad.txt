Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to make sure I understand each question and find the answers strictly from the article provided. Let me start by going through each question and cross-referencing the article.

1. **Question 1**: The common thematic element between Kostis in "Suntan" and Depardieu's character in "Mon Pere, ce Heros" despite differing outcomes. The article mentions that Kostis's wardrobe remains unchanged, symbolizing his emotional issues, while Depardieu's outfits show confidence. The common element might be how their clothing relates to their self-image and emotional states.

2. **Question 2**: The message about self-confidence through John Candy and Depardieu. The article states that Candy's character gains confidence after changing his style, while Depardieu's outfits exude confidence. The message is that confidence in attire leads to self-assurance despite body image.

3. **Question 3**: Actor's beach attire in 1991 French comedy. The article mentions Gerard Depardieu in "Mon Pere, ce Heros" (1991) as the example of brick-bodied style.

4. **Question 4**: Unchanging wardrobe symbolizing emotional stagnation. The article says Kostis in "Suntan" keeps the same clothes despite his sexual awakening and rejection, leading to his downfall.

5. **Question 5**: Actor with weight insecurities resolved via chambray and olive. John Candy in "Summer Rental" changes to chambray/olive and gains confidence.

6. **Question 6**: Retired mobster's attire change. Gary Dove in "Sexy Beast" switches from leisure (wide pants, shirts, chains) to business suits when returning to crime.

7. **Question 7**: Character with unchanging beach attire despite sexual awakening. Kostis in "Suntan" stays in the same outfit despite his experiences.

8. **Question 8**: Transition from pajama-like to commanding. John Candy's character in "Summer Rental" moves from loud outfits to chambray/olive.

9. **Question 9**: Unchanged wardrobe despite sexual awakening and rejection. Kostis again, as per the article's description of his constant wardrobe through his story.

10. **Question 10**: Leisure vs. business clothing. The article states "Leisure is thick; business is thin."

Now, I need to ensure all answers are directly from the text. Let me check each point again quickly.

1. Thematic element: Both link clothing to emotional states (Kostis's stagnation vs. Depardieu's confidence). So the common element is clothing reflecting inner state.
2. Message: Confidence through style despite body type.
3. Depardieu's film is 1991, correct.
4. "Suntan" for Kostis.
5. John Candy in "Summer Rental."
6. Dove in "Sexy Beast" changes from leisure to business.
7. Kostis in "Suntan."
8. Candy's transition in "Summer Rental."
9. Same as question 7 and 9: Kostis.
10. Leisure is thick (casual), business thin (formal).
