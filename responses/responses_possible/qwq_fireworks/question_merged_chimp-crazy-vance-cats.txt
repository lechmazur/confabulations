Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer strictly based on that. Let me start by going through each question and see what the article says.

1. The first question asks about the underlying societal critique from JD Vance's comments and Tonia Haddix's depiction. The article mentions Vance's "childless cat ladies" comment positioning them against traditional families. "Chimp Crazy" shows Haddix loving chimps more than her kids, so the critique is probably about how society judges caregiving roles. The article might be pointing out the hypocrisy in valuing certain caregiving over others.

2. The contradiction about women's caregiving expectations. The article talks about Haddix neglecting her human kids for chimps and the anonymous mom struggling with a baby and cat. The contradiction is likely the pressure on women to prioritize family (children) but also the judgment when they choose pets, showing conflicting societal expectations.

3. Societal perception of women choosing pets over kids. Vance's comments frame "childless cat ladies" as adversaries, implying they're seen as not fulfilling traditional roles. Haddix's story shows society's view of such women as neglectful or deviant, maybe even mocked for their choices.

4. Societal value on caregiving forms. Haddix's extreme devotion to chimps vs. the mom's struggle with a baby. The article might suggest that caring for pets isn't valued the same as children, but both show caregiving's labor is undervalued, especially for women.

5. Caregiving and personal fulfillment. Haddix finds fulfillment in her chimps, even neglecting her son. The anonymous mom feels guilt over not loving her cat after the baby. The implication might be that societal expectations of endless love cause personal conflict, making fulfillment depend on unrealistic standards.

6. Societal perception of caregiving as labor. The article mentions caretaking is labor with limits. Haddix's case shows misdirected labor, while the mom's essay shows the strain. The perception might be that caregiving is seen as innate (not labor) leading to burnout and neglect when it's actually work needing support.

7. Impact of societal expectations on caregiver-dependent relationships. Haddix's son resents her favoring chimps; the mom neglects the cat. The expectations pressure caregivers to meet impossible standards, leading to harm for both dependents (pets/children) and the caregiver's mental state.

8. Role of societal expectations in caregiving perceptions. The stories of Haddix and the mom show how society judges caregiving choices. Vance's comments and the essay's backlash imply society holds rigid views on what caregiving should look like, leading to conflict when people don't fit those norms.

9. Figure embodying contradictions in private care and divine selection. The article says Haddix believes God chose her to be a caretaker. She's the one with the chimps instead of focusing on her kids, so that's her.

10. Treatment of Lucky the cat and caretaking issues. The mom neglects Lucky after the baby, thinking love isn't finite. The article implies that societal expectations make her feel she can't meet both, leading to Lucky's neglect, showing how emotional capacity and labor are mismanaged under pressure.

Now, I need to check each answer against the article text to ensure accuracy. Let's go through each again quickly.

1. The critique is about contradictions in family care ideals. The article says Vance's comments and Haddix's case reveal "hidden contradictions of family life" and the "psychic battle for adult recognition." So the critique is societal judgment vs. reality, maybe hypocrisy in valuing traditional family vs. non-traditional caregiving.

2. The contradiction is expecting women to be primary caregivers (like mothers) but also criticizing them if they prioritize pets over kids. Haddix neglects her son, and the mom struggles, showing conflicting expectations.

3. The perception is that women choosing pets (or not having kids) are seen as adversaries to traditional family (Vance's comments). Haddix's portrayal shows society's view of such women as neglectful or obsessed, which is judged harshly.

4. The article says caretaking is labor with limits. Haddix's over-the-top care for chimps vs. the mom's struggle show that society may value child care more, but both highlight that caregiving is hard work not adequately supported.

5. Personal fulfillment comes from caregiving (Haddix is happy with chimps) but at the expense of others. The mom's guilt shows that societal expectation of endless love causes internal conflict, making fulfillment dependent on unrealistic standards.

6. Caregiving as labor: The article states caretaking is labor with limits. The essay's mom feels she can't love both, implying society sees it as emotional rather than work, leading to neglect when it's actually labor needing structure.

7. Societal expectations pressure caregivers to meet impossible standards, leading to harm. Haddix's son resents her, and the cat is neglected because the mom can't handle both under societal pressure.

8. Expectations shape caregiving perceptions by judging choices. Vance's comments and backlash against the mom show society enforces norms, leading to conflict when people don't fit (like Haddix or the mom struggling post-baby).

9. Haddix says God chose her to be a caretaker, so that's the answer.

10. Lucky's treatment shows caretaking labor's limits. The mom neglects the cat, thinking love isn't enough, highlighting that emotional capacity and labor aren't properly supported, leading to neglect when expectations clash with reality.

I think all answers are covered. Let's ensure none are N/A. The article provides all needed info except maybe question 10? Wait, question 10 is about Lucky the cat and broader issues. The article says the mom's treatment of Lucky reflects her overwhelmed state, and the article implies that societal expectations make her feel she can't care for both, so the answer is about emotional capacity and labor limits. So yes, all answers are present except maybe some, but I think all are covered.
