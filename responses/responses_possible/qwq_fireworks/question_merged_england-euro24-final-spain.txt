Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the strict instructions. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks how the historical precedent involving the Labour Party's 1966 victory creates a misleading expectation considering differences in political/social contexts. The article mentions that in 1966, Labour's landslide under Harold Wilson preceded England's World Cup win. Now, with Labour's recent victory, there's a similar hope. But the article also notes the 58 years of disappointments and current social issues like racism. So the misleading part is the assumption that a Labour win guarantees soccer success, ignoring the different contexts like post-pandemic, Brexit, and social movements. But the question is about how the precedent is misleading. The answer should be that the 1966 precedent suggests Labour's election leads to soccer success, but current context (like post-pandemic, Brexit, racism) shows it's not a direct link.

2. The second question is about which political figure's stance on players kneeling is contrasted with the current government's approach. The article says in 2021, some Conservative politicians criticized players for taking a knee, and Priti Patel didn't condemn the booing. Now, Labour shows little interest in politicizing soccer. So the figure is Priti Patel, as her stance (not condemning) is contrasted with Labour's non-politicizing approach.

3. The third question links Keir Starmer's campaign style to criticisms of Southgate's management. The text says Starmer ran a "hyper-cautious campaign" and fans compared Southgate to him. So the link is that both were seen as overly cautious, leading to criticism.

4. The historical precedent cited is the 1966 World Cup win after Labour's election. The article directly states that as the precedent.

5. The bicycle-kick goal against Slovakia was by Jude Bellingham.

6. Rio Ferdinand's response to the 2021 racist backlash was his social media post: "Where are the racists now???? Probably still celebrating!!!!"

7. The "Dear England" letter was written by Gareth Southgate.

8. King Charles III's message after the Netherlands win was wishing success and hoping they avoid penalties, mentioning the nation's stress.

9. The penalty kicker who also scored earlier against Switzerland was Bukayo Saka.

10. Priti Patel refused to condemn the crowds booing the players taking a knee.

Now I need to check each against the article to ensure accuracy and that there's no missing info. Let me verify each point quickly.

1. Yes, the article mentions the 1966 precedent and current differences like post-pandemic, Brexit, social issues. The expectation is that Labour's win leads to soccer success, but those factors make it a misleading expectation.

2. Priti Patel is mentioned as not condemning the booing, while Labour's approach is non-politicizing. Correct.

3. Starmer's cautious campaign compared to Southgate's management style. The article says fans likened Southgate to Starmer due to caution. So yes.

4. The 1966 World Cup after Labour's election is the precedent.

5. Bellingham's bicycle kick is stated.

6. Rio Ferdinand's exact quote is in the text.

7. Southgate wrote the letter.

8. Charles's message is quoted, including the part about avoiding penalties.

9. Saka's penalty and earlier goal are mentioned.

10. Priti Patel's refusal to condemn is there.

All answers are directly from the text. I think that's all. Now format them as per instructions.
