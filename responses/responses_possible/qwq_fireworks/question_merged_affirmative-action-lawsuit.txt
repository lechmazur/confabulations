Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. 

1. **Question 1:** The lawsuit's allegations claim Northwestern discriminates against white males. The scholars mentioned (Volokh and Young) didn't have hard feelings and weren't involved. So maybe the lawsuit is motivated by a political agenda rather than genuine discrimination claims. The article mentions the group wants to "restore meritocracy," which could be a front for opposing affirmative action. The answer might be that the lawsuit is politically motivated, especially since the lead lawyer (Mitchell) has a conservative background.

2. **Question 2:** The Federalist Society's involvement in the hiring cycle example shows that even a white male (a Federalist Society member) wasn't hired, complicating the race/sex narrative. The complaint says they made a deal to support a Black professor and another candidate's wife in exchange for backing the Federalist Society member, but he wasn't hired because of opposition to white males. This suggests that the lawsuit's claims of race/sex bias might be inconsistent, as the example shows non-racial factors (like political affiliation or other deals) also played a role.

3. **Question 3:** The article mentions Eugene Volokh, a UCLA professor, who was denied an interview despite having stellar credentials. The lawsuit says he's a white man, not homosexual or transgender, implying those were factors. So the answer should be Eugene Volokh.

4. **Question 4:** The group is called "Faculty, Alumni and Students Opposed to Racial Preferences." The article states they formed to "restore meritocracy in academia."

5. **Question 5:** The complaint says there was a deal involving the Federalist Society member (a white gay male) who should have passed muster, but wasn't hired because of opposition to white males. However, Paul Gowder, the Black professor, was hired. Gowder recalls no such deal, so the lawsuit's claim contradicts his recollection. The contrast is that the lawsuit claims a deal was made, but the professor denies it, showing inconsistency.

6. **Question 6:** Ernest A. Young, a Duke professor, was a friend of the former dean. He attributes his non-hiring to factors like age, being male, right-leaning, and not having a Ph.D., not the lawsuit's race/sex claims. So the answer is Ernest A. Young.

7. **Question 7:** The lawsuit accuses a professor of using a publicly available exam question because she was "too lazy," which they use to critique hiring practices. This suggests they think unqualified people (based on their performance) were hired over more qualified candidates, even if those candidates are from other groups. The example shows they criticize the quality, not just demographics.

8. **Question 8:** The complaint is by a group similar to Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), which led to the Supreme Court's affirmative action decision. The parallel is that the current lawsuit is following SFFA's approach, aiming to challenge discrimination policies.

9. **Question 9:** The article states that over three years, 21 job offers were made, with only 3 to white men. So the demographic group with few offers is white men.

10. **Question 10:** The complaint says left-wing faculty and administrators "thumb their noses at federal anti-discrimination statutes and openly discriminating on account of race and sex." So the accusation is that they are openly violating federal laws by discriminating based on race and sex.

Now, I need to make sure each answer is directly from the text, no inferences beyond what's stated. Let me check each again.

1. The motivation: The scholars weren't involved, and the group's goal is meritocracy, led by a conservative lawyer. So the motivation is political/ideological to oppose affirmative action, not genuine discrimination claims. The answer should reflect that it's politically motivated.

2. The Federalist Society example shows that even a white male (their member) wasn't hired because of race, complicating the narrative since the lawsuit claims race/sex bias but here race wasn't the only factor. The involvement shows that other factors (like political alignment or deals) might be at play, making the discrimination claims more complex.

3. Eugene Volokh is explicitly named as the scholar with better credentials denied an interview.

4. The group's name is given.

5. The lawsuit claims a deal was made, but Gowder says he had no idea, so their account contradicts.

6. Young's own explanation is the answer here.

7. The "too lazy" comment is part of the lawsuit's critique of the professor's competence, implying they hired less qualified people for diversity.

8. The group is a successor to SFFA, which led to the Supreme Court case, so the parallel is the SFFA legal challenge.

9. White men received 3 out of 21 offers, so that's the group.

10. The exact quote says they thumb their noses at federal laws by discriminating on race/sex.

All answers should be concise as per instructions. Let me format them now.
