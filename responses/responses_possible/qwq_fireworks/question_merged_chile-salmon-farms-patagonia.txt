Okay, I need to answer these questions based solely on the article provided. Let me go through each question one by one and find the answers in the text.

1. **Question 1**: The primary reason Mr. Antezana thinks the environmental impact is hard to assess. The article mentions he said baseline studies that would monitor effects were never done. So the answer is about the lack of baseline studies.

2. **Question 2**: Why colder waters might not prevent issues. The article says Antezana thinks bacteria metabolism is slower there, so decomposition is slower. Also, the cold might trap water in micro-basins, leading to organic matter buildup. So the answer relates to slower decomposition and trapped water.

3. **Question 3**: The paradox in expanding to Magallanes. The industry claims it's cleaner, but the article says moving there might just shift the same problems. The paradox is that expansion there could recreate the same issues as before.

4. **Question 4**: Contradiction between industry portrayal and concerns. The industry says it's pure and sustainable, but environmentalists and Indigenous groups say it's causing contamination and harm to their land. The contradiction is between "pure" vs actual negative impacts.

5. **Question 5**: Irony in the purity claim. The article mentions that when companies left Los Lagos, they left trash, implying that "pure" waters might get polluted as happened before. The irony is that the Magallanes could become polluted like the north.

6. **Question 6**: Unique factor in Magallanes causing organic matter buildup. The text mentions cold water's higher density could trap water in micro-basins, leading to accumulation. So the answer is the cold water's density causing trapped water.

7. **Question 7**: Positive attribute that's ironic. The industry says pure waters from glaciers, but the cold might trap organic matter, leading to issues. The purity is the positive, but it's the cold that's the problem. Wait, the question says the industry's portrayal. The industry might say cold is better for fish health, but the cold causes other issues. The answer is the cold waters, which they think help reduce disease, but could cause organic accumulation.

8. **Question 8**: Genetic transfer process. The article mentions horizontal gene transfer for antibiotic resistance. That's the exact term used by Dr. Cabello.

9. **Question 9**: Water temp slowing decomposition. Antezana said bacteria metabolism is lower in cold, so decomposition is slower. So the answer is lower bacterial metabolism.

10. **Question 10**: Project falling short. The Yelcho Project is mentioned as a public-private effort, and recent data shows antibiotic use higher than when it started. The answer is the Yelcho Project.

Now, check each answer against the text to ensure accuracy and that they are directly stated or logically inferred without external info. Make sure to use "N/A" only if the question can't be answered. All answers here are supported by the article.
