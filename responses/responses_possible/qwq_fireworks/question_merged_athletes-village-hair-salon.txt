Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the strict format. Let me start with the first question.

1. Which athlete got a service hidden during competition but did it for style? The article mentions Daina Moorehouse, the Irish boxer, who had her nails done. Her nails would be hidden under gloves, but she did it because it's a peak moment. So the answer is Daina Moorehouse.

2. The free styling services relate to the sports mantra "look good, feel good, play good." The Latvian coach's mandate is mentioned as part of this, so the answer connects the free services to that saying. The article says the services help athletes relax and feel confident, supporting the mantra.

3. The hairstylist noted that all athletes want the same style, like a fade. Cordinier said they all have the same style, so the similarity is they all want fades.

4. The Latvian coach's mandate (look good to play good) connects to Dimba's visit. She mentioned the coach's philosophy when explaining her salon visit. So the link is both are based on the "look good, play good" idea.

5. The rower Kristi Wagner called her salon visit a form of meditation. So her sport is rowing, and she views it as mental prep. So answer is Kristi Wagner.

6. The athlete with past experiences is Aphiwe Dimba. She mentioned in India/China, hairdressers struggled with her curls, so she was concerned. So answer is Aphiwe Dimba.

7. The athlete acknowledging irony is Daina Moorehouse. She laughed about her nails being hidden in gloves but still did it for style.

8. The stylist Sabrina Derkaoui works with stars, so she's used to celebrities and thus doesn't get flustered by athletes. The link is her usual clients (stars) mean she's professional with athletes.

9. The athlete concerned about photos is Dimba. She said you never know who's taking pictures, so she gets a cut for confidence. So the link is her photo concern led to salon visits.

10. The athlete with both personal choice and coaching is Zigmars Raimo. The coach mandated grooming, and he got a beard trim before a game. So he follows both coach and personal preference.

Wait, let me check each again for accuracy.

Question 10: The question asks for an athlete whose choices reflect both personal preference and coaching influence. Raimo's coach mandated grooming, and he went to the salon before a game. That's both coach's mandate and his own action. So yes, Zigmars Raimo.

Double-checking all answers against the text to ensure they're directly supported. For example, the boxer's nails being hidden is explicit. The fade comment by Cordinier is there. The meditation part is from Kristi Wagner. All others seem to fit. I think that's all.
