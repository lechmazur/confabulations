Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to make sure I understand each question and then find the exact information from the article to answer them. I'll go through each question step by step.

1. **Question 1:** The underlying issue with measuring success of interventions, according to David Rand. Let me look for David Rand in the article. The article says, "It's actually way more complicated." He mentions that platforms could just remove false stuff, but it's more complex. So the issue is that it's more complicated than it seems. The answer should be that it's more complicated than expected.

2. **Question 2:** The paradoxical effect of social media platforms burying political posts on Ruth Quint's efforts. The article states that her content once had many views but now struggles as platforms bury political posts. The paradox is that while she's trying to educate, the platforms' actions reduce her reach. So the effect is her content gains less traction.

3. **Question 3:** How political polarization complicates fighting misinformation in elections. The article mentions that concepts like true/false are political minefields and voters are checking out. Polarization makes these concepts divisive, so the fight is politicized. The answer is that it makes concepts like truth political minefields.

4. **Question 4:** Relationship between disinformation peddlers' motivations and researchers' challenges. The article says peddlers have sophisticated schemes, making defenses weak. So their evolving tactics make interventions harder. The answer is that peddlers' sophisticated schemes bypass weak defenses.

5. **Question 5:** Effectiveness of warning labels vs scale of misinformation. The megastudy found 5-10% improvement but pales vs scale. So the effectiveness is low compared to the problem's size. Answer: warning labels' improvements are small compared to the scale.

6. **Question 6:** Challenges in engaging the public, especially voters. The article says many voters, except the engaged, check out. So disengagement is a problem. Answer: many voters mentally check out.

7. **Question 7:** Energy to produce vs refute misinformation. Brandolini's Law states more energy needed to refute. So the paradox is refutation takes more energy. Answer: refuting takes more energy than producing.

8. **Question 8:** Accuracy nudges' effectiveness vs scale. The article says interventions improved by 5-10% but pale against scale. So effectiveness is limited. Answer: effectiveness is limited compared to the scale.

9. **Question 9:** Misinformation countermeasures related to a volunteer's hobby. Ruth Quint is a horticulturist, and the article compares her efforts to using a garden hose against a forest fire. So the relationship is compared to using a garden hose. Answer: compared to wielding a garden hose against a forest fire.

10. **Question 10:** Brandolini's Law and educators' experiences. Educators face Sisyphean tasks, citing Brandolini's Law. The law explains why their efforts are hard. Answer: refuting takes more energy than producing, making their task Sisyphean.

Now, I'll check each answer against the article text to confirm. Let me verify each point again quickly.

1. David Rand's quote says it's more complicated, so that's correct.

2. Platforms burying posts leading to less traction for Quint's content is directly stated.

3. The article says true/false are political minefields due to polarization.

4. Peddlers' sophisticated schemes bypass defenses, as per the text.

5. The study's 5-10% vs scale is correct.

6. Voters checking out except the engaged is in the article.

7. Brandolini's Law is exactly about energy required.

8. Same as question 5, so correct.

9. The garden hose analogy is there for Quint's efforts.

10. Educators' Sisyphean task linked to Brandolini's Law.

All answers are directly from the article. I don't see any that require inference beyond what's stated. None of the questions have missing info here. So the answers should all be filled.
