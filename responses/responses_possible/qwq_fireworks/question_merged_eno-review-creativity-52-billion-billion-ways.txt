Okay, I need to answer these questions based strictly on the article provided. Let me go through each question one by one and see what the article says.

1. The first question asks: If a version of "Eno" focused solely on Eno's work with U2, what thematic focus would likely be diminished? The article mentions that different versions have different focuses. One version discussed his work with U2's "Pride (In the Name of Love)", while another version talked about identity or creativity. The answer here might be that the theme about identity or the process of creativity would be less present if U2 is the sole focus.

2. The second question is about the relationship between the film's generative structure and the audience's experience of mood and character. The article states that traditional films are edited to control mood and character, but "Eno" leaves some to the audience's brain. So the answer is that the generative structure reduces control over mood and character, relying on the audience's interpretation.

3. If viewed linearly, what aspect of Eno's approach is compromised? Since the film's generative nature is part of Eno's own methods, a linear format would lose the element of randomness and generative art, which is central to his work. So the answer is his use of randomness or generative art principles.

4. The primary reason for using a code-based decision tree over AI? The article says generative AI is derivative (trained on existing works), while the film's method uses code with rules, not AI. So the answer is to avoid dependence on existing works and use human-coded rules instead.

5. Technological innovation in Eno's music similar to the film's method. The article mentions Eno used technologies for randomness in his music. The film uses code-based systems, so maybe "Oblique Strategies" cards or his "generative music" tools like ambient music systems. The article specifically mentions "Oblique Strategies" as a tool for experiments, so that's the answer.

6. Connection between the film's generative nature and a musical collaboration. The U2 collaboration is mentioned in an archival sequence where they wrote "Pride". Since the film's structure allows different focuses, maybe the collaboration's creative process is highlighted through the generative structure. The answer might be that the film's variable structure mirrors the collaborative, experimental process seen in the U2 session.

7. Variability relates to a specific musical project. The article mentions one version included discussion of the Microsoft Windows jingle. So the answer is that the variability allows inclusion or exclusion of topics like the Windows theme, showing how different projects are covered based on version.

8. Concept central to both film and Eno's approach illustrated by an archival sequence. The U2 scene shows collaboration and creativity, which ties to generative art's reliance on process and audience input. The concept here might be "generative creativity" or "collaborative process".

9. Connection between film's generative nature and an artistic tool of Eno's. The article mentions "Oblique Strategies" cards as a tool for arbitrary experiments, which are encoded in the film's structure. So the answer is "Oblique Strategies".

10. Concept illustrated by a YouTube anecdote. The article says Eno showed YouTube clips that shaped him. The generative aspect here is how the audience's brain connects these clips, similar to how the film's structure lets viewers find patterns. The concept is "audience's brain filling in patterns" or "creative interpretation".

Now, checking each against the article to confirm:

1. The article says one version focused on identity, another on creativity. If U2 is only focus, then identity or creativity themes would be less. The U2 part was in one version that also had overlapping sections. The question states "focused solely on U2", so other themes like identity (from another version) would be diminished. Answer: the theme about art and identity.

2. The article says traditional films control mood, but Eno's film leaves it to the audience. So the structure reduces control over mood and character, making the audience's role more active. Answer: reduces control over mood/character, relying on audience's interpretation.

3. Linear format would remove the generative aspect, so the aspect compromised is his use of randomness/generative processes.

4. The article states generative AI is derivative, while their code is rule-based. Answer: to avoid dependency on existing works (or use code with human rules).

5. Eno's Oblique Strategies are mentioned as part of his experiments, so that's the tech innovation similar to film's code. Answer: Oblique Strategies.

6. The U2 collaboration's creative process is shown in an archival sequence, which the film's generative structure allows different versions to highlight. So the connection is that the film's variability mirrors the collaborative creativity of that session. Answer: the film's variable structure reflects the collaborative, experimental process seen in the U2 session.

7. The Microsoft Windows jingle discussion is in one version. The variability relates to inclusion of different projects. Answer: the variability allows inclusion of projects like the Windows theme.

8. The U2 scene shows creation through collaboration and process, illustrating generative creativity. Answer: generative creativity or collaborative process.

9. The tool is Oblique Strategies, mentioned as part of his methods encoded in the film's structure. Answer: Oblique Strategies.

10. The YouTube anecdote shows Eno sharing influences, and the film's generative nature lets viewers connect ideas. The concept is the audience's role in pattern-making, as per Eno's quote. Answer: the concept is the audience's brain "cooking" or finding patterns.

Now, making sure all answers are in the correct format and using exact terms from the article where possible.
