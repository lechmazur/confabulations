Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and answer exactly what's asked without any extra details. Let's start with the first question.

1. The first question asks how Rebecca Hoffman's involvement in both the Aspen Art Fair and Intersect Art and Design illustrates a strategic shift. The article mentions that Hoffman co-founded the Aspen Art Fair but also was the director of Intersect before starting her own. Some exhibitors followed her, so maybe this shows a shift where a key figure splits off to create a new fair, indicating competition or diversification. The answer should be that it shows a strategic shift through a key figure branching out, creating competition.

2. The second question is about the relationship between Aspen's real estate resilience and art market stability as per Doug Leibinger. The article states that even during a downturn, Aspen's real estate has record sales, and Leibinger says their market is separate from the rest. Since the art market's stability is tied to wealthy residents, the answer would be that the real estate's resilience indicates the art market's stability because the same wealthy population fuels both.

3. The third question asks which artist with current exhibitions at major museums was at the fair in an unconventional role. The article mentions Zanele Muholi, who has solo shows at Tate Modern and SF MoMA, and was an artist-in-residence at the fair. So the answer is Zanele Muholi.

4. The fourth question: which gallery brought an artwork priced higher than the recent real estate record sale? The real estate record was $77 million, but the article says a Picasso at Galerie Gmurzynska was priced at $3.5 million. That's lower, so maybe I misread. Wait, the record was $77M, but the next sale was even higher? Wait, the article says "the record was broken again with another Aspen deal just a week later." So the first record was $77M, then another higher. The Picasso is $3.5M, which is less than both. Hmm, maybe the question is a trick? Or perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, the question says "higher than the recent real estate record-breaking sale in Aspen." The first record was $77M, but the next one was higher, but the article doesn't specify the amount. The Picasso is only $3.5M, so no gallery brought something higher. Then the answer would be N/A. Wait, but the question might refer to the initial $77M sale. The Picasso is $3.5M, which is less. So the answer is N/A.

5. The fifth question: which artist's work was displayed in a way that conflicted with the exhibitor's sleeping arrangements? The article mentions Rusha & Co. had a piece by Sienna Shields on a bed, and the owner slept in the same room, pushing it aside. So the artist is Sienna Shields.

6. The sixth question: connection between the artist whose work was a bedspread and the gallery with a painting over a toilet. The bedspread was by Anne von Freyburg at K Contemporary. The toilet painting was also at K Contemporary. So the connection is they're the same gallery. Answer: same gallery (K Contemporary).

7. Seventh question: how does the Picasso's price compare to combined booth costs? The booth rentals were up to $30k per, with 22 galleries. Let's see: if each booth is $12k to $30k, but the exact total isn't given. The Picasso is $3.5M. Without knowing the total booth costs, can't compare. So answer N/A.

8. Eighth question: which gallery brought an artist with solo shows contrasting the fair's intimate setting. Zanele Muholi's solo shows at major museums (Tate, SF MoMA) contrast with the fair's setting. The gallery was Galerie Gmurzynska. So answer Galerie Gmurzynska.

9. Ninth question: number of bedrooms in the record home (8) vs. number of galleries (22). So 8 bedrooms vs. 22 galleries. The comparison is 8 vs. 22, so the home has fewer bedrooms than galleries. Answer: fewer.

10. Tenth question: connection between the fair's location (Hotel Jerome) and collectors' focus. The collectors mentioned later, like the Hoffmans, focus on Black artists. The article doesn't directly link location to their focus. The fair's location is about the setting, but the collectors' focus is their personal choice. So maybe N/A? Or perhaps the location's luxury attracts collectors who have the means to focus on specific art. The text says they focus on Black artists, but the location's connection isn't stated. So answer N/A.
