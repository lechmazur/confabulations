Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the given article. I need to make sure I only use the information provided and follow the strict format.

1. **Question 1**: Which film features a protagonist who shares a profession with the director of "Anomalisa"?  
   - The director of "Anomalisa" is Andrew Ahn. The article mentions Andrew Ahn's debut film "Anomalisa". The protagonist of "Anomalisa" is David Cho, who works in a Koreatown restaurant. Wait, no, actually, the article says David Cho works in his immigrant parents' restaurant. The director here is Andrew Ahn, so his profession is a director. But the question is about the protagonist's profession matching the director's. Hmm, maybe I need another angle. Wait, "The Benefactor" is directed by Andrew Renzi, and its protagonist is a philanthropist. Wait no, the director of "Anomalisa" is Andrew Ahn. Looking for a film where the protagonist's job is the same as the director's. The article says "Anomalisa" is directed by Andrew Ahn, and David Cho's job is working in a restaurant. The director's profession is filmmaking. The only other director mentioned is Charlie Kaufman for "Eternal Sunshine..." but the question is about the protagonist. Maybe "The Benefactor" is directed by Andrew Renzi, but the protagonist is a philanthropist. Not sure. Wait, maybe "The Benefactor" is directed by Andrew Renzi, and the protagonist is a philanthropist. The director's job is director, so not matching. Wait, maybe "Eternal Sunshine..." director is Charlie Kaufman, but the protagonist's job? The main character is a depressed motivational speaker. Wait, the director's job is screenwriter/director, so not matching. Hmm, perhaps "Aftersun" is directed by Charlotte Wells, and the protagonist is a father (Paul Mescal) who's divorced. Not matching. Maybe "Hail Satan?" is directed by Penny Lane, and the documentary's subject is The Satanic Temple. Not a profession. Wait, maybe "The Benefactor" is directed by Andrew Renzi, and the protagonist is a philanthropist. The director's job is director, so no. Wait, maybe "Anomalisa" director Andrew Ahn's job is director, and the protagonist works in a restaurant. Not matching. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Wait, "Anomalisa" is directed by Andrew Ahn, and the protagonist's job is working in a restaurant. The director's job is a director, so no match. Maybe the answer is N/A? Or perhaps I misread. Wait, the article says "The Benefactor" features Richard Gere as a philanthropist. The director of "Anomalisa" is Andrew Ahn, whose job is director. So no profession match. Maybe I'm missing another film. Let me check again. Maybe "Eternal Sunshine..." the director is Charlie Kaufman, and the protagonist's job? The depressed motivational speaker. The director's job is filmmaker, so no. Hmm. Maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "The Benefactor" is directed by Andrew Renzi, and the protagonist is a philanthropist. The director's job is director, so no. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe "Aftersun" is directed by Charlotte Wells, and the protagonist is a father, but director's job is director. Not matching. I'll have to mark this as N/A for now, but maybe I'm missing something. Wait, the director of "Anomalisa" is Andrew Ahn, and the protagonist's job is working in a restaurant. The director's job is director, so no match. So answer is N/A?

2. **Question 2**: Which film's protagonist shares a characteristic with the subject of the documentary that closed theaters in 1972?  
   - The documentary mentioned is "Amazing Grace", which was shelved due to technical difficulties and later released. The subject here is Aretha Franklin's recording. The characteristic would be something related to the documentary's subject. The film that shares a characteristic with the subject (Aretha Franklin) might be "The Benefactor"? No. Wait, the documentary is "Amazing Grace", which was initially shelved. The question is about the subject of the documentary (Aretha Franklin) and a film's protagonist who shares a characteristic with her. Aretha Franklin's characteristic here is being a singer, but the films' protagonists don't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the documentary's subject is the Satanic Temple in "Hail Satan?"? No, the documentary about the Satanic Temple is "Hail Satan?". Wait, the article mentions "Amazing Grace" was shelved in 1972. The question is about the subject of the documentary that closed theaters (but "Amazing Grace" didn't close theaters; it was shelved). The subject is Aretha Franklin. So the film's protagonist must share a characteristic with her. The only possible link is maybe "The Benefactor" has a wealthy protagonist, but Franklin was a singer. Alternatively, maybe "Eternal Sunshine..." has a depressed character, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe "Aftersun" has a father-daughter relationship, but Franklin's characteristic is being a singer. Hmm, perhaps "Anomalisa" has a character who is a father, but not matching. Alternatively, maybe "The Benefactor" has a wealthy character, but Franklin's wealth isn't mentioned. Alternatively, maybe "Aretha Franklin's" characteristic is her recording, so the film's protagonist is someone who records something? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe "Amazing Grace" was shelved, so the subject (Aretha) had a delayed release. The film protagonist with a delayed something? Not sure. Maybe "The Benefactor" has a protagonist who discovers something late? Not clear. Maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the documentary in question is "Amazing Grace", which was shelved. The subject is Aretha Franklin. The film's protagonist must share a characteristic. Maybe the age? Aretha was 32 when she recorded it (1972). Looking at film protagonists: "Anomalisa" has an 18-year-old David Cho. "Aftersun" has an 11-year-old daughter. "Eternal Sunshine..." has a depressed adult. "The Benefactor" is about a wealthy man. Not matching. Hmm, maybe the characteristic is being a performer. The only protagonist who is a performer might be Aretha herself, but the films' protagonists aren't performers. So N/A?

3. **Question 3**: What link exists between the filming techniques used in "Aftersun" and "Amazing Grace"?  
   - "Aftersun" is described as using "brief but affecting flash-forwards" and "a tour-de-force of instinctive, emotional filmmaking". "Amazing Grace" was filmed live in a church with Sydney Pollack directing. The article mentions that "Amazing Grace" was recorded live over two days. "Aftersun" uses flash-forwards and observational style. Maybe both used real locations? Or both involved live performances? Or "Aftersun" uses a close observational style, while "Amazing Grace" was a live recording. The article says "Aftersun" has "tight close-ups" in "Anomalisa" (Wait, no, "Anomalisa" uses stop-motion, while "Aftersun" is described as "languid and mellow" with close-ups in "Anomalisa" is actually in "Anomalisa", but the question is Aftersun and Amazing Grace. The article says "Amazing Grace" was filmed live over two days. "Aftersun" uses "tight close-ups" in "Anomalisa" no, sorry. Wait, "Anomalisa" is directed by Andrew Ahn? No, "Anomalisa" is directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson. Wait, "Aftersun" is directed by Charlotte Wells. The article says "Aftersun" has "tight close-ups" in "Anomalisa" no, actually, "Anomalisa" is stop-motion. Wait, looking back: "Anomalisa" is directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson, using stop-motion. "Aftersun" is described as "languid and mellow" with "tight close-ups" mentioned in "Anomalisa" no, that was in "Anomalisa"? Wait, the article says "Andrew Ahn's debut feature... Ahn's camera keeping his protagonist in tight close-ups". Wait, "Anomalisa" is directed by Charlie Kaufman, so that's different. Wait, the article says Andrew Ahn's film is "Anomalisa"? Wait no, let me check again. The article: "Charlotte Wells writes and directs this stunning memory play..." (Aftersun). Then "Stream it on Amazon Prime Video. The surrealist screenwriter and filmmaker Charlie Kaufman... directed this puppet-populated comedy-drama with Duke Johnson" (Eternal Sunshine...). Then "Andrew Ahn's debut feature grapples with..." (Anomalisa). Wait, no, the article's structure: The films are listed with their streaming services. The first film is Aftersun (Netflix). Then Amazon Prime: Eternal Sunshine (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind?), then Hulu. Then "Faye the widow" film on Max. Then "Beth" on Netflix. Then Amazon Prime: Anomalisa? Wait, the article says: "Eighteen-year-old David Cho (Joe Seo)... Andrew Ahn's debut feature grapples with... It's a subtle picture, quietly observational in style, but operatic in emotion. Stream it on Amazon Prime Video." So Anomalisa is directed by Andrew Ahn. Wait, but the first film is Aftersun, then "Stream it on Amazon Prime Video. The surrealist..." which is Eternal Sunshine (Charlie Kaufman). Then later, "Andrew Ahn's debut feature..." is Anomalisa? Wait, the article's structure is a bit confusing. Let me parse again. The article lists several films:

   - Aftersun (Netflix)
   - Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind? (Amazon Prime Video)
   - Faye's film on Max
   - Beth on Netflix
   - Anomalisa (Amazon Prime Video, directed by Andrew Ahn)
   - The Benefactor (Hulu and Prime)
   - Hail Satan? (Max)
   - Amazing Grace (recorded in 1972, released later)

   So "Aftersun" uses "languid and mellow" style, while "Anomalisa" (directed by Andrew Ahn) uses tight close-ups. The question is between Aftersun and Amazing Grace. The article says "Amazing Grace" was filmed over two days in a church. "Aftersun" uses flash-forwards and observational style. Maybe both films were filmed in real locations or used live performances? Or "Aftersun" uses close-ups? Wait, "Aftersun" is described as "capturing the carefree dreaminess of vacation" with "brief but affecting flash-forwards". "Amazing Grace" was a live recording. The only possible link is both were filmed in real settings (church vs. vacation setting), but not sure. Alternatively, maybe both use non-traditional filming techniques? Or "Aftersun" uses a documentary-like style? The article says "Aftersun" is a memory play with flash-forwards, while "Amazing Grace" is a live recording. Maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "Amazing Grace" was filmed by Sydney Pollack's crew. "Aftersun" uses "tight close-ups" in Anomalisa? No. Hmm. Maybe the answer is that both were filmed in real locations? Not certain. Maybe the article says "Aftersun" uses "instinctive, emotional filmmaking" and "Amazing Grace" is a live recording. I can't find a direct link, so maybe N/A?

4. **Question 4**: Which film features a protagonist whose age mirrors that of the Satanic Temple at the time of the article's writing?  
   - The Satanic Temple was founded in 2013. The article's current time is when it was written, presumably 2023 (since the article mentions "46 years later" for Amazing Grace from 1972). So the Satanic Temple is 10 years old. The film's protagonist must be around 10 years old. Looking at films: "Aftersun" has an 11-year-old daughter. So the answer is "Aftersun".

5. **Question 5**: What link can be drawn between the production challenges of "Amazing Grace" and the narrative structure of "Aftersun"?  
   - "Amazing Grace" had technical difficulties leading to shelving. "Aftersun" uses flash-forwards and a non-linear structure. Maybe both involve delays or disruptions in their timelines? The article says "Amazing Grace" was shelved due to technical issues, so production challenges. "Aftersun" uses flash-forwards to contrast past and present. The link might be that both involve a delayed or fragmented presentation (technical delay vs. narrative structure). So answer: Both involve delays/disruptions in timelines.

6. **Question 6**: What commonality exists between the themes explored in "The Benefactor" and the mission of the organization featured in "Hail Satan?"?  
   - "The Benefactor" is about a wealthy philanthropist discovering what money can't buy. The Satanic Temple's mission is to push back against the erosion of separation between church and state. The commonality might be challenging societal norms or questioning power structures. The article says "The Satanic Temple was founded... to push back against the erosion of the separation of church and state." "The Benefactor" deals with wealth and power limitations. So the common theme is challenging societal norms/power structures.

7. **Question 7**: Which actor mentioned has portrayed characters in both animated and live-action films discussed in the article?  
   - Richard Gere is in "The Benefactor" (live-action). Paul Mescal in "Aftersun" (live). Frankie Corio (Aftersun). David Thewlis and Jennifer Jason Leigh in "Eternal Sunshine" (stop-motion, which is animated). So David Thewlis and Jennifer Jason Leigh voiced characters in "Eternal Sunshine" (animated) and maybe other live-action roles? The article mentions David Thewlis voices the depressed speaker in "Eternal Sunshine" (animated). Does he have a live-action role in another film? The article mentions him only in that role. Jennifer Jason Leigh's other roles? The article doesn't mention her elsewhere. Aubrey Plaza is in "Beth" (live-action). Molly Shannon and John Reilly in "Beth" (live). The only actor with both is maybe David Thewlis if he has another role, but not listed here. Wait, the article mentions "Wes Studi" in Faye's film, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe "Eternal Sunshine" is stop-motion, so that's animated. Any actor in both? The article doesn't mention any actor in both types except perhaps David Thewlis and Jennifer Jason Leigh only in animated. So maybe no one? Or maybe "Anomalisa" is stop-motion, and if an actor is in another film. Wait, "Anomalisa" is directed by Charlie Kaufman, and the protagonist is a depressed motivational speaker voiced by David Thewlis. The article doesn't mention him in a live-action film in the text. So perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says "Jennifer Jason Leigh (voiced)" in "Eternal Sunshine" (animated). Does she have a live-action role elsewhere? The article mentions her only there. So no. Therefore, answer N/A.

8. **Question 8**: Which film features a protagonist whose age is closest to that of Aretha Franklin during the "Amazing Grace" recording?  
   - Aretha Franklin was born in 1942, so in 1972 she was 30 years old. Looking at film protagonists: "Aftersun" has an 11-year-old. "Anomalisa" has an 18-year-old David Cho. "Eternal Sunshine" protagonist's age? The depressed speaker is an adult, but exact age not given. "The Benefactor" is Richard Gere playing a wealthy man, presumably middle-aged. "Hail Satan?" is a documentary. The closest is David Cho at 18 (12 years difference) or the adult roles. The 30-year age is closest to someone in their 30s. The article doesn't specify ages for adults except David Cho (18), Paul Mescal's character (divorced father, so maybe 30s). The article doesn't state his exact age. So maybe the closest is David Cho (18, difference of 12) vs. an adult in their 30s (difference of 0). Since the article doesn't specify the father's age, but David Cho is explicitly 18, perhaps the answer is "Anomalisa" (David Cho is 18, but 30 is older). Wait, but maybe the father in "Aftersun" is around 30. The article says he's divorced and the daughter is 11, so he might be in his 30s. Since the exact age isn't given, but the closest specified age is David Cho (18), which is further from 30. The next is the protagonist of "The Benefactor" (wealthy man, maybe 50+?), so further. So the closest is the father in "Aftersun" (assuming mid-30s), but since the article doesn't state his age, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says David Cho is 18, so his film is "Anomalisa". Aretha was 30, so 18 is 12 years off. The next is the father in "Aftersun" (maybe 35?), but since it's not stated, the only specified age is 18. So the answer would be "Anomalisa" (18), but that's further than an unspecified adult. Since the question requires the closest, but we can't know the father's age, maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, since the only specified age is 18, and the next is adult (like 30s), the answer would be "Anomalisa" but it's not close. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe "The Benefactor" has a protagonist of similar age? The article says Richard Gere plays an ultrawealthy man. Gere was born in 1949, so in the film's timeline, maybe similar to his real age? But the article doesn't state the character's age. So N/A?

9. **Question 9**: What link can be drawn between the production techniques of "Anomalisa" and the filming style of "Aftersun"?  
   - "Anomalisa" uses stop-motion animation. "Aftersun" is live-action with "languid and mellow" style and "tight close-ups" (wait, no, "tight close-ups" are in "Anomalisa"? Wait, the article says "Andrew Ahn's debut feature... Ahn's camera keeping his protagonist in tight close-ups". Ah, "Anomalisa" is directed by Andrew Ahn? Wait no, the article says "Anomalisa" is directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson. Wait, the article structure is confusing. Let me check again. The article's sections:

   - Aftersun (directed by Charlotte Wells)
   - Eternal Sunshine (Charlie Kaufman & Duke Johnson)
   - Faye's film (Max, directed by Max Walker-Silverman)
   - Beth (Netflix, directed by Jeff Baena)
   - Anomalisa (directed by Andrew Ahn): "Andrew Ahn's debut feature grapples with homosexuality, financial insecurity and immigrant culture..."

   So "Anomalisa" uses stop-motion (since it's by Charlie Kaufman? Wait, no, Charlie directed "Eternal Sunshine". Wait the article says "Eternal Sunshine" is directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson. "Anomalisa" is directed by Andrew Ahn. The article says "Anomalisa" is a stop-motion film? Wait, the article says "Eternal Sunshine" is stop-motion. "Anomalisa" is described as "a subtle picture, quietly observational in style". So "Anomalisa" is live-action? Wait, the article says "Eternal Sunshine" is a puppet-populated comedy-drama with stop-motion. "Anomalisa" is Andrew Ahn's film, which is about David Cho working in a restaurant. So "Anomalisa" is live-action. The production techniques of "Anomalisa" (live-action) vs. "Aftersun" (also live-action). The article says "Aftersun" uses flash-forwards and "tight close-ups" in "Anomalisa" is not— actually, the "tight close-ups" are in "Anomalisa"? The article says Andrew Ahn's film uses "tight close-ups". Wait, the article says about "Anomalisa": "Andrew Ahn's debut feature... Ahn's camera keeping his protagonist in tight close-ups that convey his aching discomfort..." So both "Aftersun" and "Anomalisa" use close-ups? Or "Aftersun" has "languid" style while "Anomalisa" uses close-ups. The question is about filming techniques link between the two. The article says "Anomalisa" uses tight close-ups, while "Aftersun" has "languid" and "flash-forwards". So maybe both use close-ups? Or different techniques. The only link might be observational style? "Anomalisa" is "quietly observational", and "Aftersun" is "languid and mellow". So perhaps both use observational techniques. The answer could be "observational style".

10. **Question 10**: Which actor mentioned has portrayed characters in films that span the widest range of release years discussed in the article?  
    - The actors mentioned with their films:  
      - Paul Mescal: "Aftersun" (streaming now, so recent, say 2022)  
      - Frankie Corio: same as above.  
      - David Thewlis: "Eternal Sunshine" (2002?), but article doesn't state release years except "Amazing Grace" recorded in 1972.  
      - Jennifer Jason Leigh: same as above.  
      - Aubrey Plaza: "Beth" (2020?)  
      - John C. Reilly and Molly Shannon in "Beth".  
      - Richard Gere in "The Benefactor" (recent, 2020s).  
      - Dale Dickey in "Faye" (recent).  
      - Penny Lane directed "Hail Satan?" (2019?).  
      - The article mentions "Amazing Grace" was recorded in 1972 and released 46 years later (2018).  
      - Aretha Franklin's "Amazing Grace" is from 1972.  
      - The documentary "Hail Satan?" is about the Satanic Temple (founded 2013).  

      The actors involved in films with the widest release years:  
      - David Thewlis and Jennifer Jason Leigh in "Eternal Sunshine" (2002) and if they have roles in older films? The article doesn't mention their other roles except in these.  
      - Richard Gere has a third-act career, but the article says "The Benefactor" is one of his recent films.  
      - The oldest film mentioned is "Amazing Grace" (1972). Aretha is the subject, not an actor.  
      - The only actor in a film from 1972 is Aretha Franklin, but she's not listed as an actor in other films here.  
      - The next is "Eternal Sunshine" (2002?), but the article doesn't state the release year. The article's films are all recent except "Amazing Grace".  
      - The widest span would be an actor in a film from 1972 and another from 2020s, but no actor is mentioned in both.  
      - The only possible is if Richard Gere's "The Benefactor" is recent and he's been in older films. The article says he has "knotty, difficult character turns in under-the-radar independent films" but doesn't specify release years.  
      - The article mentions "Amazing Grace" was recorded in 1972, but Aretha is the subject, not an actor in another film here.  
      - Therefore, the widest span is between 1972 (Amazing Grace) and recent films, but no actor is in both. The next is actors in films from the 2000s and now. "Eternal Sunshine" is from 2002 (assuming), so David Thewlis or Jennifer Jason Leigh could have that span. If their other roles are in recent films, then their span is 20 years. Richard Gere might have roles from older times but not mentioned here. Since the article only lists their roles in the mentioned films, the widest is between 1972 (if someone was in that) and now, but no. So the widest is between 2002 and recent (20 years). The answer would be David Thewlis or Jennifer Jason Leigh. Since the article doesn't specify other roles, maybe they are the only ones with a film from 2002 (if "Eternal Sunshine" is 2002). The article says "Eternal Sunshine" is directed by Charlie Kaufman, which is the 2004 film. So release year 2004. If another film they're in is recent, their span is 20 years. The article doesn't mention their other films, so we can't know. Therefore, maybe the answer is N/A? Or the question is about the films listed here. Among the films listed in the article, the release years are:  
        - "Aftersun": recent (2022?)  
        - "Eternal Sunshine": 2004  
        - "Faye" (2020s)  
        - "Beth" (2020?)  
        - "Anomalisa" (Andrew Ahn's debut, maybe 2020?)  
        - "The Benefactor" (recent)  
        - "Hail Satan?" (2019?)  
        - "Amazing Grace" (released 2018, recorded 1972).  

      The actor in "Eternal Sunshine" (2004) and another film from, say, 2020 would have a 16-year span. The widest is between 1972 (Amazing Grace) and 2022 (Aftersun), but only Aretha is in that, but she's not an actor in other films here. So the next is David Thewlis or Jennifer Jason Leigh in "Eternal Sunshine" (2004) and another film from, say, 2022 (if they're in another film here). The article doesn't mention their other roles beyond that, so we can't confirm. Thus, the answer might be N/A. Alternatively, if the question considers the filming year of "Amazing Grace" (1972) as part of the film's release, then the widest would be between 1972 and recent. But the actors in that film are only Aretha, not listed elsewhere. So the answer is N/A.
