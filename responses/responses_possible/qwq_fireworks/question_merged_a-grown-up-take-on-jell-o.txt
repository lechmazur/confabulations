Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1:** The interviewee's theory about matte skin relates to their choice of makeup products for events. The article mentions that the interviewee believes matte skin makes you look older, so for events, they avoid it. They use products that make them look dewy instead. The answer should connect their preference against matte to using dewy products.

2. **Question 2:** The product named after a Danish summer dessert. The article mentions "Rodgrod med flode" as a Danish pudding that Mette Hay associates with summer. So that's the name.

3. **Question 3:** Cool-girl look products. The interviewee mentions using MAC Lipstick in Ruby Woo with a finger and Glossier Skywash for eyes. That's the combo for the cool-girl look.

4. **Question 4:** Scent on sheets. The interviewee uses Frederic Malle Body Butters, which the text says leaves scents on sheets. So the answer is Frederic Malle Body Butters' scent.

5. **Question 5:** Connection between Tu Tu' Tun's materials and Bes exhibition. The main lodge uses grass cloth walls inspired by Tututni weavings. The Bes exhibition includes artists' works related to parenthood, but the question asks about materials. Wait, maybe the grass cloth (a natural material) and the exhibition's tactile pieces (like Erica Recto's textured sculptures) both use materials that invite touch? Hmm, maybe that's stretching. The article says the main lodge's grass cloth walls are inspired by weavings, and the exhibition has tactile pieces. So the connection is natural materials and tactile elements.

6. **Question 6:** How Gelee's production mirrors glass cabins. Gelee uses freeze-dried fruits pulverized into powder. The glass cabins were designed by a mirror house company (Ood) which might involve glass production techniques. Not sure. Wait, the cabins are made with mirrored glass walls. The process of Gelee involves freeze-drying and pulverizing, which is a specific production method. The question is about mirroring an element of the cabins. Maybe both use innovative materials or processes? The article says the cabins are designed by Ood, known for mirror houses. Gelee's process is a new take on Jell-O. Maybe the innovation aspect? The question says "mirror an element"—maybe the use of powder (Gelee) vs. glass (cabins) isn't directly related. Wait, maybe the glass cabins use mirrored glass, and Gelee uses powdered ingredients. Not sure. The article doesn't explicitly link their production methods. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, the glass cabins are a new addition (like Gelee is a new product), but the question is about production process. Hmm, maybe N/A? Wait, the glass cabins are designed by Estonian mirror house production company Ood. The production process of Gelee involves freeze-drying and pulverizing. Maybe both involve specialized production techniques? The question asks how Gelee's process mirrors an element of the cabins. Not sure, maybe N/A. Wait, the cabins are made with mirrored glass, which is a specific material. Gelee uses non-GMO whole-fruit powders. The element might be using natural ingredients/materials in a processed form. But the question is about the production process. Maybe N/A? Or perhaps the innovation aspect? The article says Gelee took three years of testing, similar to the cabins being a new addition. Not sure. Maybe I need to check again. The question says "how does the production process of Gelee mirror an element of the glass cabins". The glass cabins were designed by Ood, a company known for mirror houses. Maybe the production involves precision or specific techniques. Alternatively, both use a form of transformation (freeze-drying into powder vs. glass into mirrored structures). Not sure. Maybe the answer is N/A here, but the article might have something. Wait, the glass cabins are part of the lodge's addition, so maybe the process of creating something new from traditional materials? The Gelee uses traditional Jell-O but in a new way. That's a stretch. Maybe the answer is "freeze-dried and pulverized whole-fruit powders" mirroring the innovative use of materials in the cabins. Hmm, but the question is about the production process. Maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, the production process of Gelee involves a method that's similar to the glass cabin's design (like both use specialized techniques). Since I can't find a direct link, perhaps N/A. Wait, the article says "the property added 12 glass cabins designed by the Estonian mirror house production company Ood." So Ood's specialty is mirror houses, so their production involves creating mirrored glass structures. Gelee's production involves freeze-drying fruits into powder. Not directly related. So maybe N/A. But the question says "mirror an element"—perhaps the use of innovative materials? The article mentions Gelee uses non-GMO whole-fruit powders, and the cabins use mirrored glass. Both are innovative uses of materials. Maybe that's the connection. But the question is about production process. Hmm. I'll go with N/A unless I missed something.

Wait, the question is about the production process of Gelee mirroring an element of the glass cabins. Maybe the process involves a specific technique. The article doesn't explicitly state that, so maybe N/A.

7. **Question 7:** Gelee flavor inspired by Tu Tu' Tun's local cuisine. The lodge uses local ingredients like line-caught halibut and Pacific Rogue Wagyu. The Gelee flavors are Guava Nectar, Passion, and Pina Coco. Since the cuisine is local, maybe the Pina Coco (pineapple and coconut) would pair with seafood like halibut. The answer is Pina Coco with seafood.

8. **Question 8:** Product aligning with "Soft Animals" theme. The exhibition's theme involves tactile pieces and the idea of softness. The interviewee's product that's soft or nurturing could be the Eadem Le Chouchou balm, which is a moisturizing balm. Or maybe the Dew Dream Hydrating Cleansing Balm. The article says the exhibition includes pieces that invite handling (like Erica Recto's textured sculptures). The balm is soothing, aligning with the theme of softness and care. So answer: Eadem Le Chouchou balm.

9. **Question 9:** Time in Katie's artwork vs Dyson Airwrap's impact. Katie's work includes a list of unrealized ideas post-parenthood, showing how time is limited. The Dyson Airwrap saves the interviewee an hour and a half, so it saves time, allowing more time for other things. The connection is that the artwork reflects lost time due to parenthood, while the Airwrap gains time. Answer: The Dyson Airwrap saves time, countering the time constraints highlighted in Katie's work.

10. **Question 10:** Skincare product for "Soft Animals" theme. The exhibition's theme includes nurturing and tactile elements. The interviewee's product that's soothing and hydrating would be the Dew Dream Hydrating Cleansing Balm or the Cloud Cushion Moisturizer. The article mentions the Dew Dream makes skin radiant. Alternatively, the Eadem's Milk Marvel Dark Spot Serum? Or the Frederic Malle Body Butters? Wait, "Soft Animals" theme is about tenderness and care. The Le Chouchou balm is a moisturizing balm, which is soft and nurturing. So that's the answer.

Now, let's check each question again to ensure answers are correct and based on the text.

1. Correct, the interviewee avoids matte for events, using dewy products.

2. Rodgrod med flode is mentioned as the Danish summer pudding.

3. MAC Ruby Woo and Glossier Skywash for eyes.

4. Frederic Malle Body Butters' scent stays on sheets.

5. Tu Tu' Tun's grass cloth (inspired by weaving) and Bes's tactile ceramics. So connection is natural materials and tactile elements.

6. Maybe N/A because no direct production process link. The answer might be "freeze-dried whole-fruit powders" mirroring the innovative use of materials in the cabins? But unsure. Alternatively, both involved new designs? Maybe the answer is N/A.

7. Pina Coco with seafood (halibut) makes sense.

8. Le Chouchou balm aligns with softness.

9. Time saved by Airwrap vs lost time in art.

10. Le Chouchou balm or Dew Dream? The article says "Soft Animals" involves care and texture. Le Chouchou is a balm, so yes.

Okay, I'll proceed with these answers, noting where N/A might be necessary.
