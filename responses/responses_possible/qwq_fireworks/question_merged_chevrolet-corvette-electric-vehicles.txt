Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by going through each question and finding the relevant parts in the text.

1. **Strategic decision regarding engine placement**: The article mentions that moving the engine to a mid-engine design was a key change. It says the shift from front-engine to mid-engine helped the Corvette's success. So the answer is moving the V-8 to a midengine design.

2. **Cultural image as ambassador for electrification**: The article states that the Corvette's "cultural familiarity and all-American image" could help promote electrification, especially in regions like the Midwest and South where EVs are less popular. That's the role here.

3. **Chief engineer's concerns about demographics influencing design**: The chief engineer, Tadge Juechter, was worried about the median buyer age rising to 64, which wasn't sustainable. This influenced the decision to redesign to attract younger buyers. The answer should link the age concern to the midengine change.

4. **Counterintuitive strategy leading to popularity**: The article says GM considered keeping both the old (C7) and new (C8) models but realized they wouldn't sell the old ones. So the strategy was stopping the old model and only offering the new midengine C8, which worked despite initial controversy.

5. **Demographic shift from redesign**: The median buyer age dropped from 64 to 55 over six years. That's the shiftâ€”lowering the average age, contrary to typical aging sports car buyers.

6. **Cultural significance influencing EV adoption in regions**: The article mentions the Corvette's all-American image could help in the Midwest/South where EVs aren't as popular. So the answer is using its cultural appeal to boost EV acceptance there.

7. **E-Ray addressing criticism without compromising**: The E-Ray uses a hybrid system with a small battery that doesn't add much weight. The article says the battery is tiny and doesn't need plugging, avoiding the weight issue. So the answer is the small, self-recharging battery.

8. **Powertrain addressing mutual exclusive demands**: The E-Ray combines 655 hp (performance) with better fuel efficiency (24 MPG). The hybrid allows all-wheel drive and efficiency without sacrificing power. So the answer is combining AWD, performance, and efficiency.

9. **Corvette's evolution mirroring GM's challenges**: The article says both need to transition to electrification while keeping traditional customers. The Corvette's hybrid/electric path reflects GM's broader shift towards electrification amid customer resistance.

10. **Sales trajectory challenging enthusiast car trend**: The Corvette's sales increased (near-record) while enthusiast cars overall dropped by half since 2000. So the answer is that Corvette sales grew despite the overall decline.

Wait, let me check each again to ensure accuracy. For question 4, the counterintuitive strategy was moving the engine despite initial resistance, but the article specifically mentions that GM stopped offering the old model, which was a risk but paid off. So that's the key point there. Also, question 7's answer is about the hybrid design using a small battery that doesn't add weight, which the article mentions. Alright, I think that covers all. Now format them properly.
