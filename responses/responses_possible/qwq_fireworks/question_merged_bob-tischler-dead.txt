Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I don't use any outside knowledge and only rely on the text given. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks for the specific event that led to Bob Tischler becoming the head writer of SNL. The article mentions that Dick Ebersol fired Michael O'Donoghue over a sketch where he portrayed Fred Silverman as Hitler, which never aired because NBC thought it was libelous. After that, Tischler became head writer. So the event is O'Donoghue's firing.

2. According to Dick Ebersol's autobiography, the primary reason Tischler was the right leader was that he was steady, calm, and respected. The exact quote says "steady, calm and respected."

3. The impact of his leadership was that the show recovered. The article states the show recovered in large part because of Eddie Murphy and others, but Tischler's role as head writer contributed to that recovery. The answer should be that the show recovered.

4. The significance of his role in the revival is that he was the leader the writers' room needed, as Ebersol noted. The article says he was exactly what the writers needed, so the significance is his steady leadership.

5. Tischler's role in Eddie Murphy's success: the text says he championed Eddie Murphy, who was underutilized before. The answer should mention that he championed Murphy.

6. The producer's departure that coincided with Eddie Murphy's rise (since Murphy's characters were part of the revival). The article says when Lorne Michaels returned in 1985, Tischler left. Michaels was the original producer, so his return caused Tischler to leave. The question asks which producer's departure led to the arrival of the comedy legend (Murphy). Wait, actually, the question might be about when Tischler took over. Wait, the question says "departure from SNL coincided with the arrival of a comedy legend known for portraying Buckwheat and Gumby." The comedy legend here is Eddie Murphy. The article says when Tischler became head writer, Eddie Murphy was underutilized before but then was championed. So the departing producer would be Jean Doumanian, but the exact event leading to Tischler's promotion was O'Donoghue's firing. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to when O'Donoghue left, allowing Tischler to take over, which led to Murphy's success. Alternatively, the answer could be Michael O'Donoghue? Wait, the question says "producer's departure" but O'Donoghue was head writer, not producer. The producer who left might be Jean Doumanian, but the text says after her season, Dick Ebersol replaced her as producer. So maybe the answer is Jean Doumanian? The article says "after five trailblazing seasons under Lorne Michaels, its first producer, it floundered under his successor, Jean Doumanian." Then Dick Ebersol replaced her. So when Doumanian left, Ebersol took over, which led to Tischler's hiring. But the question is about the producer's departure that coincided with the arrival of the comedy legend (Murphy). But Murphy was already on the show; he was underutilized under Doumanian. So maybe the answer is Jean Doumanian's departure, but the text says that when Ebersol took over, he hired Tischler. Hmm, maybe the answer is Michael O'Donoghue? Because his firing led to Tischler becoming head writer, which allowed Murphy to be utilized. The question says "producer's departure" but O'Donoghue was head writer, not producer. The producer at the time was Dick Ebersol. Maybe the question is a bit tricky here. The article says "Mr. Tischler became the head writer early the next year after Mr. Ebersol fired Mr. O'Donoghue". So O'Donoghue was fired (his departure) led to Tischler becoming head writer, which then allowed Eddie Murphy's success. The question asks which producer's departure. Since O'Donoghue was a head writer, not a producer, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question might be referring to the producer who left when Tischler took over. The original producer was Lorne Michaels, then Jean Doumanian, then Dick Ebersol. So when Ebersol became producer, he hired Tischler. The departure of Jean Doumanian as producer allowed Ebersol to take over, leading to Tischler. But the question is about the departure of a producer that coincided with the arrival of the comedy legend. Since Murphy was already there, perhaps the answer is N/A? Or maybe the question is looking for Ebersol's hiring, but that's not a departure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Michael O'Donoghue, but he wasn't a producer. Hmm. This might need to be N/A unless there's a better clue. Wait, the question says "the arrival of a comedy legend known for portraying Buckwheat and Gumby" â€“ that's Eddie Murphy. The article says that Tischler "championed" him, so maybe the key is that when O'Donoghue was fired (his departure as head writer), Tischler took over, which allowed Murphy to be used properly. But the question specifies "producer's departure". Since O'Donoghue was head writer, not producer, the answer might be N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Jean Doumanian, the previous producer. Let me check the article again. "After five trailblazing seasons under Lorne Michaels, its first producer, it floundered under his successor, Jean Doumanian, whose only season was widely considered the show's worst to date. The show's "flinty irreverence gave way a year ago to cheap shocks and worn-out formulas," the reporter Tony Schwartz wrote in The New York Times in October 1981. Dick Ebersol, who replaced Ms. Doumanian as producer..." So when Doumanian left (her departure), Ebersol took over as producer, which led to Tischler's hiring. The arrival of Eddie Murphy as a star might have been under Ebersol's and Tischler's time. But the question is about the producer's departure coinciding with the arrival of the comedy legend. Since Murphy was already on the show, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the departure of O'Donoghue, even though he was head writer, but the question says producer. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A here. Wait, the article says "the show's "flinty irreverence gave way a year ago to cheap shocks and worn-out formulas," the reporter Tony Schwartz wrote in The New York Times in October 1981. Dick Ebersol, who replaced Ms. Doumanian as producer..." So the departure of Doumanian as producer allowed Ebersol to take over, which led to Tischler's hiring. The question is which producer's departure coincided with the arrival of the comedy legend. Since the comedy legend (Murphy) was already there but underutilized, perhaps the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Michael O'Donoghue, but he wasn't a producer. Hmm. This might be tricky. Let me note this and come back.

7. The connection between the producer of "Briefcase Full of Blues" (which was Tischler) and the revival of SNL. The article says that Tischler produced that album for the Blues Brothers, which helped establish his credibility. Then when he became head writer, his experience with the Lampoon and Blues Brothers gave him a comedy background, so that's the link. So the answer is that he produced the album, which established his comedy credentials, leading to his role in SNL's revival.

8. The link between Joe Cocker's concert film and SNL's revival. The article mentions that Tischler cast Christopher Guest in a radio ad for Joe Cocker's "Mad Dogs & Englishmen" film. Guest later joined SNL's cast in 1984-85, contributing to its recovery. So the answer is that Tischler's casting of Guest in the film led to Guest joining SNL's cast during its revival.

9. The SNL producer with chart-topping music and a Humanitas Prize. The article says Tischler produced Blues Brothers albums that reached No. 1 and No. 13, and he won a Humanitas Prize for an episode of "Something So Right". So the answer is Bob Tischler.

10. The razor blade tape editing expertise refers to Tom Malone, who worked on the Blues Brothers albums with Tischler. The article says Malone edited tracks using razor blades, and Tischler was precise with that. But how does that contribute to SNL's revival? The article mentions that Tischler hired Malone as SNL's musical director. So the expertise in editing (via Malone) helped with the music, contributing to the show's revival. The answer would be that Tom Malone's editing skills, as part of Tischler's team, supported the show's music, aiding its revival. But the question asks how an individual's expertise contributed. The individual is Tom Malone, but the question might expect Tischler's role? Wait, the article says "Tom Malone, who played trombone and other instruments in the Blues Brothers band, said in an interview. "There's no single take in there, so all the songs have as many as 30 edits. This was before digital, so you had to cut the tape with a razor blade. And Bob was dead-on with that." So Tischler was the one doing the editing with razor blades. So the answer is that Bob Tischler's razor blade tape editing skills contributed to the Blues Brothers' success, which bolstered his credibility, aiding his role in SNL's revival. Wait, but the question is how did that editing expertise contribute to the revival of the sketch comedy series (SNL). Since Tischler was head writer, maybe his experience in editing (as a producer) helped in shaping the material. Alternatively, the article might link it through his background in audio production. Hmm. The exact connection is that his audio production skills, honed in editing with razor blades, contributed to his ability to manage the writers' room. But the article doesn't explicitly say that. Alternatively, the answer is that Tom Malone's editing skills (as part of Tischler's team) helped the show's music, but the question specifies an individual's expertise. The article says "Bob was dead-on with that" (the razor blade editing). So the answer is that Bob Tischler's expertise in razor blade tape editing (from his work on Blues Brothers albums) contributed to his precision in editing sketches, aiding the revival. So the answer would be Bob Tischler's expertise.

Let me go back to question 6 now. The question is which producer's departure coincided with the arrival of the comedy legend (Murphy). Since Murphy was already on the show, perhaps the answer is the departure of Michael O'Donoghue, but he was head writer. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Jean Doumanian's departure as producer, which allowed Ebersol to take over and hire Tischler, leading to Murphy's better use. So the producer's departure would be Jean Doumanian's. Let me check the article again: "Dick Ebersol, who replaced Ms. Doumanian as producer, had hired Mr. Tischler as a supervisory producer in the spring of 1981... Mr. Tischler became the head writer early the next year after Mr. Ebersol fired Mr. O'Donoghue..." So when Doumanian left (her departure as producer), Ebersol took over, which led to Tischler's hiring and later becoming head writer. The arrival of the comedy legend (Murphy) was under this new regime, so the producer's departure would be Jean Doumanian's. So the answer is Jean Doumanian.
