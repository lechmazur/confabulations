Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the strict instructions given. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** The specific event that made Akin decide against releasing "Crossing" in Georgia. The article mentions that the Tbilisi protests against the foreign influence law in spring led him to do this. The exact phrase was "this spring, when Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, erupted in weeks of protests against a law on foreign influence..." So the answer is those protests.

2. **Question 2:** How Evrim challenges typical portrayals. The actress Deniz Dumanli said that trans women are usually in sad stories ending in murder, but "Crossing" shows them as normal. So the answer is that it portrays them as normal instead of tragic.

3. **Question 3:** Connection between protests and not releasing the film. The article says Akin decided not to release it because of the polarized climate from the protests. He didn't want the film used as fodder in the debate. So the answer is the political turmoil from the protests.

4. **Question 4:** How Istanbul's setting explores anonymity. The text says that in Istanbul, trans individuals can disappear and be anonymous, unlike their hometowns. So the setting shows that anonymity allows them to avoid being known and judged.

5. **Question 5:** Collaboration with Pink Life. The article states Akin worked with Pink Life to create an authentic world. So the significance is authenticity in the film's portrayal.

6. **Question 6:** Which filmmaker's decision was influenced by historical protests and political unrest. That's Levan Akin again, as mentioned in question 1 and the article's context.

7. **Question 7:** Which film sparked violent opposition. The article mentions "And Then We Danced" caused protests when screened in Georgia. That's the one.

8. **Question 8:** Transnational background aiding funding. The article says Akin's background (Swedish, Turkish parents of Georgian heritage) helped him get funding from Sweden and elsewhere. So the answer is Levan Akin.

9. **Question 9:** Proposed legislation addressing medical, legal, and media. The "On Family Values and the Protection of Minors" law includes bans on gender-affirming surgery, legal document changes, and propaganda. So that's the law's name.

10. **Question 10:** Character in a film making a cross-border journey. The film "Crossing" features Lia traveling from Georgia to Turkey to find her niece Tekla. So the answer is Lia.

Now I need to check each answer against the text to ensure accuracy. Let me go through each again quickly.

1. Protests against foreign influence law in Tbilisi – yes, that's correct.

2. Dumanli's comment on normal portrayal – yes, she says "more realistic...normal people".

3. The protests caused the polarized climate, so the decision was linked to that.

4. Istanbul allows anonymity as per Akin's statement.

5. Collaboration with Pink Life for authenticity – yes.

6. Akin's decision influenced by past protests ("don't want that to repeat") and current unrest.

7. "And Then We Danced" caused violent protests.

8. Akin's background as a Swede with Georgian roots via Turkish parents helped funding.

9. The Family Values law covers those areas.

10. Lia's journey in "Crossing".
