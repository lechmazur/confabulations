Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer each question directly. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question asks how a major rock star's casting decision changed the original roles of flamboyant restaurateurs. From the article, it mentions that Bowie wanted to play the lead instead of a supporting role. The original plan was for Bowie and Mick Jagger to play those roles, but Bowie wanted the lead. So the answer should be that he wanted to play the lead instead, altering the original supporting roles.

2. The socio-political climate in LA during release. The article says the film was released when LA had a curfew due to Rodney King protests. That likely caused people not to go to theaters. The answer is the curfew from protests over Rodney King acquittal.

3. Postproduction challenges leading to dissatisfaction. The director had only five weeks, so his cut was a rough assembly. The studio edited without him, causing jump cuts and bad pace. The answer is he had only five weeks, leading to a rough edit without his supervision.

4. The film financed with "mysterious money" and SAG copyright. The article mentions "The Linguini Incident" had financing including mysterious money and SAG claimed the copyright due to residuals. So the answer is "The Linguini Incident".

5. The actress with those roles and collaborating with a rock legend during LA unrest. Rosanna Arquette is mentioned for those movies and worked with Bowie (rock legend) in the film released during LA's unrest. So her name is the answer.

6. Acquisition process related to original financing. The original financing involved multiple sources, leading to scattered rights. To regain rights, they had to track through those companies' bankruptcies and SAG's claim. The answer might be that original financing via multiple sources led to rights being held by SAG after companies failed.

7. European city helping restoration. The article says a Zurich art theater had a print connected to a British distributor. So Zurich is the city.

8. Irony between original budget and reacquiring. The original used "mysterious money" from various sources. To regain rights, they used SAG's claim from nonpayment of residuals. So the irony is that the original financing's issues (nonpayment) led to SAG owning the copyright, which allowed Shepard to buy it back. The answer might be that nonpayment led to SAG claiming rights, which he used to reacquire it.

9. Parallel between original release and restoration. The original had chaotic financing leading to problems. Restoration also had issues with scattered materials and needing to track down rights. The answer is both involved scattered or lost materials due to financial and company issues.

10. Connection between theatrical run and rights reacquisition. The original release was a flop, but the rights were later claimed by SAG. The director used that SAG ownership to buy back the rights. So the answer is the flop led to SAG claiming rights, which he then negotiated to regain.

Wait, let me check each again to ensure accuracy.

1. Yes, Bowie wanted lead instead of supporting roles for restaurateurs. Correct.

2. The curfew in LA during release caused low turnout. Correct.

3. The answer should specify the jump cuts and lack of pacing because he didn't supervise. The answer is "jump cuts, takes too long, no pace" as per the text.

4. The film's name is "The Linguini Incident".

5. Rosanna Arquette.

6. The original financing involved multiple sources leading to company bankruptcies. The acquisition involved tracking through those bankruptcies and SAG's claim. So the answer is that the original financing's scattered sources led to the rights being reclaimed by SAG, allowing them to buy it back.

7. Zurich.

8. The original used mysterious money (nonpayment leading to SAG claim), and the reacquisition used SAG's copyright. So the ironic relationship is that the original financing's nonpayment (mysterious money) caused SAG to get the rights, which Shepard used to regain control.

9. The original release had chaotic financing leading to poor distribution, and restoration had issues with lost materials from same financial problems. So parallel is both faced challenges from the film's financial instability.

10. The original theatrical failure led to rights being held by SAG, which Shepard used to reacquire. So connection is the failure led to SAG ownership, enabling reacquisition.

I think that covers all. Now format them properly.
