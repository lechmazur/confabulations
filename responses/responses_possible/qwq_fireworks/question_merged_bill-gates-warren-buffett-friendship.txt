Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article provided. I need to make sure I don't infer anything beyond what's written and stick strictly to the text. Let's go step by step.

1. **Question 1:** The event that led Buffett to rethink his philanthropy was mentioned when his first wife, Susan, died suddenly. The article says her death in 2004 forced him to revisit his plans. So the answer is her death.

2. **Question 2:** The reason he stopped posthumous donations to Gates Foundation is because he was upset with their operations. The text mentions he found the foundation's bloat and costs problematic, plus issues with their approach and Gates' behavior. The exact reason is the bloat and inflated costs.

3. **Question 3:** The problematic aspect was the "bloat and inflated operating costs" of the Gates Foundation, as stated in the article. That's directly mentioned as his issue.

4. **Question 4:** Buffett's philosophy from Carnegie's essay was about giving away wealth during one's lifetime. He chose Gates because he trusted his competence, aligning with Carnegie's idea of active use of funds. So the answer is trusting Gates' competence to manage the funds actively.

5. **Question 5:** Redirecting donations shows Buffett wanted control over his wealth's use. He chose who to trust (Gates then his family), reflecting control in philanthropy. The article says he picks managers, so control via selecting the right leaders.

6. **Question 6:** The article mentions his four family foundations (Buffett's children's) and that the remaining shares go to a trust managed by them. So the answer is the Buffett family foundations.

7. **Question 7:** Gates' difficulty with small talk and courtesy is mentioned. This could cause tension as Buffett values interpersonal engagement. The trait is his lack of small talk/courtesies.

8. **Question 8:** Gates' luxurious lifestyle (homes, art, cars) contrasts with Buffett's modesty, which aligns with Carnegie's principle of not living lavishly. So the contradiction is Gates' extravagant lifestyle vs. Carnegie's ideals.

9. **Question 9:** The Gates Foundation's growth into a massive, bureaucratic entity (like handling billions, building infrastructure) led Buffett to think they were complacent and not taking risks. The praised growth caused him to redirect funds.

10. **Question 10:** Early praise was their ambition and effectiveness (saving lives, global health), but later, Buffett saw them as complacent. The positive attribute was their effectiveness, which later became complacency.
