Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. 

1. **Question 1:** The phrase "I'm All Ears" is in quotes next to Hetty's name. The article says she leans into corn's sunny hue with mango and halloumi. The nickname might indicate she's attentive to feedback or ideas, but the significance here is probably that she's focused on the recipe. The direct link is that the nickname is part of her name提及, so maybe it's her moniker used in the text. The answer is likely her nickname as mentioned in the article.

2. **Question 2:** The article mentions Prime Day deals for kitchen equipment via Wirecutter. So they reference a shopping event (Prime Day) which is Amazon's, but the article doesn't mention the brand, just refers to the event. The appliance could be an air fryer since it's mentioned in the context of Sue Li's recipe. So the indirect reference is through Prime Day deals for kitchen appliances.

3. **Question 3:** The sheet-pan scallion chicken with bok choy is mentioned. The temperature concern is addressed by using a sheet pan (so less hands-on, maybe oven temp?), and flavor comes from mustard, miso, ginger. The dish itself addresses both aspects.

4. **Question 4:** Angel hair pasta is noted to cook in two minutes. The shape (needle-thin) is linked to the cooking time. The article directly states the cooking time for the shape.

5. **Question 5:** The article says Icelandic cucumber shortage is due to a TikTok trend. So TikTok (social media) caused cucumber shortage in Iceland.

6. **Question 6:** The numerical specificity is "57 sandwiches that define the city" in the NYC section. The number 57 is given as a comprehensive evaluation.

7. **Question 7:** The Beatles connection? The article mentions "summer produce" but not Beatles. Wait, maybe "I'm All Ears" is a Beatles song? No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe a Beatles member's name isn't mentioned. Hmm, this might be N/A. Wait, the article doesn't mention the Beatles. So maybe this is N/A.

8. **Question 8:** Air fryers are mentioned alongside Prime Day deals. So the connection is that Prime Day has deals on air fryers, as mentioned in the text.

9. **Question 9:** The author mentions "my pal Karen" who says there's always room for pie. So personal relationship with Karen is referenced in the context of dessert.

10. **Question 10:** Angel hair's thinness (shape) allows it to cook quickly (2 minutes), linking thickness to efficiency. The article states the cooking time due to the pasta's shape.
