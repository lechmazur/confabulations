Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to make sure I only use the information provided in the article. 

Starting with question 1: How does the East Solano Plan's approach differ from California's past efforts? The article mentions that the state's efforts focus on adding density in existing urban areas. The East Solano Plan is a new city on rural farmland, so the difference is building on the urban edges instead of existing cities. That's probably the answer.

Question 2: How does the plan challenge the "orderly growth" ordinance? The ordinance prohibits large developments outside urban areas. The plan needs voter approval to amend that law, so the challenge is requiring a vote to bypass the ordinance.

Question 3: According to Sramek, how does his plan differ from state efforts? The article says he supports urban core housing but thinks it's too slow. His plan is on the city edges for faster, large-scale housing. So the difference is building on the outskirts vs. urban cores.

Question 4: Relationship between investors and national security threats. The text says neighbors feared the land buys around the air force base might be linked to foreign spies. But the investors are named Silicon Valley billionaires like Hoffman and Powell Jobs. The connection is that the land acquisitions near Travis Air Force Base raised security concerns, but the investors themselves aren't directly linked except through their company's actions.

Question 5: Investor with ties to a social network and political donations. Reid Hoffman co-founded LinkedIn and is a Democratic donor. That's the one.

Question 6: Which congressman's statement suggests a permanent setback? Garamendi called it a "permanent deep freeze," implying more than just a delay.

Question 7: What infrastructure near the site caused suspicion? The article mentions the land surrounded Travis Air Force Base, which is a military installation. So the proximity to the base fueled the national security fears.

Question 8: Land acquisition strategy raising security concerns. The company bought land around the base without revealing backers, leading to fears of foreign involvement. The secrecy and land encircling the base caused the issues.

Question 9: Timeline contrast between voter approval and land buying. The company bought land over years but delayed the ballot to 2026 after initial plans for this year. So the land purchases were done before the delayed vote.

Question 10: Economic promise conflicting with the report? The CEO promised jobs and community investments, but the report says the project needs billions in infrastructure but details are vague. The report's warning about infrastructure costs vs. the promised investments might be the conflict. The answer might be the promise of jobs and investments vs. the report's infrastructure cost concerns.

Wait, let me check the exact quotes. The report says the project requires tens of billions in infrastructure but details are vague. The CEO promised thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions in community investments. The conflict is between the promised jobs/investments and the report's high infrastructure costs? Or maybe the company's promise of jobs vs the report's uncertainty? The question asks which promise conflicts with the report's findings. The report's point is the infrastructure needs and vague details, so maybe the promise of jobs isn't directly contradicted, but the economic promise of affordable housing and jobs vs the report's note that the timing was unrealistic. Wait, the question is about the CEO's promise conflicting with the report. The CEO's statement about jobs and investments vs the report's emphasis on needing infrastructure investment but vague details. The answer might be the promise of jobs and community investments, since the report points out the infrastructure costs but the company's promise might downplay that? Alternatively, the report's warning about the project's impact being hard to assess might conflict with the CEO's claims. Hmm. The question says "economic promise made by the CEO conflicts with the findings of the county-commissioned report". The report's findings include the need for billions in infrastructure but lack of details. The CEO's promise includes creating jobs and community investments. The conflict might be that the report says the infrastructure needs are huge (so maybe the economic viability is in question) but the CEO is promising jobs. Alternatively, maybe the promise of affordable housing vs the report's point about needing infrastructure? The article says the report warned about the infrastructure costs but details were vague. So the CEO's promise of affordable housing and jobs might be conflicting with the report's finding that the project's impact is hard to assess, implying maybe the costs could be too high. But the exact answer needs to be precise. The question is about the economic promise conflicting with the report. The CEO said they'd create thousands of jobs and make hundreds of millions in community investments. The report's findings are that infrastructure is needed but details are vague. The conflict is that the report's findings (high costs and uncertainty) might undermine the economic promises. So the answer is the promise of creating jobs and community investments. But I need to check the exact wording. The question asks for the economic promise that conflicts with the report's findings. The report's main point about the project's infrastructure needs and vague details might question the feasibility of the economic benefits. So the answer is the promise of jobs and community investments, which the report's findings (high costs and uncertainty) might conflict with. The article says the report "warned that details... were so vague it was hard to assess its full impact." So the economic promise (jobs, investments) is what the report's findings make uncertain. The answer should be the promise of jobs and community investments.
