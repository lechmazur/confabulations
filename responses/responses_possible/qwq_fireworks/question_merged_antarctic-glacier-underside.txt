Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and follow the strict instructions.

1. **Question 1**: The formations challenged previous assumptions. The article mentions that scientists assumed melting would smooth the ice, but the structures showed complex features. So the answer is that they showed the topography isn't smoothed, which challenges the old assumption.

2. **Question 2**: Dead reckoning affected mission success. The text says only about half the missions were completely successful because they couldn't communicate with Ran and had to navigate without GPS. So the impact was lower success rate.

3. **Question 3**: Seals might have caused Ran's loss. The article says one theory is a seal disoriented Ran. So the significance is the seals could be why Ran was lost.

4. **Question 4**: Findings showed complex features instead of smooth. Similar to question 1 but phrased differently. The answer is the structures persisted, contradicting smoothing.

5. **Question 5**: Why couldn't they survey Thwaites? The article states too much sea ice blocked access. That's the primary reason.

6. **Question 6**: The robot was named Ran. The text mentions Ran's data captured the formations.

7. **Question 7**: The topography contradicts by having complex features, so the melting doesn't smooth it as thought.

8. **Question 8**: Thwaites Glacier's collapse could raise sea levels by two feet. The article mentions Thwaites as the target but inaccessible, so the answer is Thwaites.

9. **Question 9**: The complex topography means melting patterns might be affected by these features, needing more study. The text says understanding how they affect melting is needed.

10. **Question 10**: The misconception was that the bottom would be flat and featureless. The researchers were happy to see structures, implying that was a risk.

Need to check each answer against the text. Let me verify each point again quickly.

1. Yes, the article says previous assumptions were that melting smoothed, but structures showed otherwise.

2. "only about half of them were completely successful" because of dead reckoning navigation issues.

3. The seal theory is given as a possible reason for Ran's loss.

4. Same as 1, but the question is about the findings contradicting the assumption. So yes.

5. "Thwaites was inaccessible. Too much sea ice was in the way."

6. The robot's name is Ran, lost later but initially used.

7. Same reasoning as 1 and 4.

8. Thwaites is the glacier with the two-foot rise if collapsed.

9. The article states "understanding how they affect overall melting... will require further study" so the impact is that it changes understanding, needing more research.

10. The researchers were happy to see structures because they weren't sure and feared it might be featureless. So the misconception was expecting flatness.

All answers seem to align with the text. None should be N/A except if something isn't there. Let me check again each question:

1. Answered.

2. Success rate impact is mentioned directly.

3. Seals as a theory for loss.

4. Same as 1 but rephrased, so valid.

5. Sea ice blocking Thwaites.

6. Ran is the robot.

7. Same as before.

8. Thwaites is correct.

9. The article says the features affect melting patterns, so answer is valid.

10. The misconception was expecting featureless bottom.

All answers present in the text. No N/A needed here. Need to format each with question number and answer tags.
