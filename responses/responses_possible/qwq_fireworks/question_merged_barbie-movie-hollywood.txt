Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and follow the strict format. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Primary reason studios are hesitant to produce more female-led films despite Barbie's success:** The article mentions that studios are retreating to usual ways, influenced by labor strikes and streaming economics. Also, they see Barbie as a one-off. The key reason might be the industry's retreat to conventional practices and perceiving Barbie as an exception. The exact phrase from the article: "they're like, 'Oh, this is neat and shiny,' and then they go right back to the way they've always been." So the primary reason is that they view it as a singular success and not a model to follow.

2. **Discrepancy between perceived success and actual changes:** The article states that despite Barbie's success, the number of female leads in 2023 is the same as 2010. Also, studios are back to usual ways. The answer is that the same number of female leads as 2010 shows no change, while Barbie's success was supposed to herald a new era.

3. **Economic climate's influence on decisions regarding female-led films:** The article says studios are spooked by a fickle audience and box office down 17%, leading them to question theatrical viability. The economic climate (retrenchment, lower box office) makes them cautious, so they stick to safer bets instead of female-led projects.

4. **Executive who got a symbolic item from a tradition:** The article mentions Warner Bros. gave an original key (tradition from Jack Warner) to Robbie's production company (LuckyChap) leaders: Robbie, Ackerley, and McNamara. The executive who received this would be the ones from the studio, but the question asks which executive. Wait, the studio's co-chairs Pamela Abdy and Michael De Luca signed the deal with LuckyChap. The key was given to the LuckyChap team. The question says "executive" who received the key. The article says "They even gave the trio an original key..." The trio is Robbie, Ackerley, and McNamara. The executive from the studio giving it would be Abdy or De Luca. Wait, the question is phrased as "which executive received a symbolic item..." The answer is the trio (Robbie's team) received it, but the question is about the executive who got it. Wait, no. The article says the studio gave the keys to the production company's leaders. The symbolic item was given to them, not an executive from the studio. Wait, the question says "executive" – perhaps a trick? Let me check again. The article says: "Ms. Abdy and Mr. De Luca [...] did sign an overall deal with Ms. Robbie's production company, LuckyChap, which she runs with her husband, Tom Ackerley, and Josey McNamara. They even gave the trio an original key to the studio, resurrecting a tradition started by Jack Warner..." So the key was given to the trio (Robbie, Ackerley, McNamara). The question asks which executive received it. But they are not executives from the studio; they are from LuckyChap. The question might be a trick. Since the article doesn't mention an executive from Warner Bros. receiving the key, perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, the key was given to the LuckyChap team. The question is about which executive (from the studio?) got it? The article says the studio (Warner Bros.) gave the keys to the production company's leaders. So the executive who received it would be part of LuckyChap, but they are not executives from Warner Bros. The question is phrased as "executive," so maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The article says "the studio [...] gave the trio an original key to the studio, resurrecting a tradition started by Jack Warner, one of the founders of Warner Bros." So the trio (the LuckyChap people) got the keys. The question is about which executive (from the studio?) received it? Since it's given to the production company's leaders, not an executive from Warner Bros., the answer might be N/A. Alternatively, maybe the tradition was revived for the production company, so the answer to question 7 is about that. Wait, question 7 is about the tradition revived for the production company. Let me hold on that and come back.

5. **Argument for larger budget using Wonder Woman as unsuitable comparison:** The article states when arguing for "Barbie's budget, producers were told that "Wonder Woman" wasn't comparable since it was a superhero genre. So the argument was that Wonder Woman was in a different genre (superhero), making it an unsuitable comparison. The answer is that Wonder Woman was a superhero genre, so not comparable.

6. **Most common response to high-concept comedy project:** The article says Amy Baer's project got responses like "We just don't know who it's for." So the answer is "We just don't know who it's for."

7. **Tradition revived for a production company:** The key tradition started by Jack Warner was given to LuckyChap. The tradition was giving keys to the studio. So the revived tradition is giving the original key to the studio, which was a tradition from Jack Warner. The answer is "an original key to the studio" or "the tradition of giving keys to the studio." The question is phrased as "what tradition was revived," so the answer is "giving an original key to the studio" or "the tradition started by Jack Warner of giving keys."

8. **Actor in reimagining of children's franchise by Mattel:** The article mentions Mattel has projects like "Barney" with Daniel Kaluuya and "Polly Pocket" with Lily Collins. The question asks which actor is set to star in a reimagining (Barney or Polly). The answer is either Daniel Kaluuya or Lily Collins. The question says "the same company that gave creative freedom to a director who satirized their flagship product" (Mattel). So the answer is Daniel Kaluuya (for Barney) or Lily Collins (for Polly Pocket). The question asks for the actor, so both are possible, but the first example given is Barney with Kaluuya.

9. **Contractual detail allowing Gerwig and Robbie to avoid sequel commitment:** The article states their contracts didn't have them on the hook for a sequel. The answer is "no sequel obligations in their contracts" or "contracts did not require them to make a sequel."

10. **Number of female directors (excluding Gerwig) with projects active at Warner Bros.:** The article mentions Warner Bros. has three more in active development, including Olivia Wilde, plus Maggie Gyllenhaal's "The Bride!" which is upcoming next year. Wait, the text says: "The studio has three more live-action films starring women from female directors, including Olivia Wilde, in active development. (Also, the upcoming 2027 animated movie "Bad Fairies," [...] is being directed by Megan Nicole Dong.)" So excluding Gerwig (who directed Barbie), there's Maggie Gyllenhaal (The Bride! is upcoming, so maybe in development?), Ishana Shyamalan (her film flopped, but she's a female director), and then Olivia Wilde and Megan Dong. Wait, the article says "three more live-action films [...] including Olivia Wilde," so that's three, including her. Plus Megan Dong's animated film. But the question is about female directors excluding Gerwig, so how many are in active development at the studio? The article says "three more live-action films [...] including Olivia Wilde" (so at least two others?), and Megan's film is animated and upcoming but maybe also in active development. The exact count is tricky. The article says "three more [...] including Olivia Wilde, in active development" plus "Bad Fairies" directed by Megan. So total would be 3 (live-action) plus Megan (animated) = 4? But the question says "excluding the one behind 2023's top-grossing film" (Gerwig). The article mentions Maggie Gyllenhaal's "The Bride!" which is set for next year, so maybe that's one. Ishana Shyamalan's "The Watchers" already opened (flop), so she's not in active development anymore? The studio has three more in development, including Olivia, so perhaps the answer is 3 (including Olivia) plus Megan? Wait, the article says "three more live-action films [...] in active development. (Also, the upcoming 2027 animated movie [...] directed by Megan Nicole Dong.)" The parenthetical might be separate, so Megan's film is also in active development. So total is 3 + 1 = 4? But the question says "excluding the one behind 2023's top-grossing film," so Gerwig is excluded. The answer might be 3 (the three live-action) plus Megan (animated) totaling 4, but the article says "three more [...] in active development" (so including Olivia, perhaps others?), and Megan is an additional one. Alternatively, the three include others, and Megan is separate. The exact count is unclear, but the article says "three more [...] including Olivia Wilde, in active development" and Megan's film is also mentioned as upcoming. The question is asking how many female directors (excluding Gerwig) have projects in active development at Warner Bros. The answer might be 3 (the three live-action) plus Megan, but maybe the animated is counted. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 3 (since the three are live-action, and Megan's is another but maybe not counted as "more"?). The exact number is tricky. Wait, the article says "three more live-action films [...] including Olivia Wilde, in active development. (Also, the upcoming 2027 animated movie [...] is being directed by Megan Nicole Dong.)" The parenthetical might not be part of the three, so Megan is an extra. So total is 3 (live-action) +1 (animated) =4? But the question is about female directors, so Megan counts. The answer would be 4? Or does the "three more" include Megan? The article says "three more live-action films [...] including Olivia Wilde, in active development. (Also, the upcoming 2027 animated movie [...] is being directed by Megan Nicole Dong.)" The animated is a separate project, so Megan is another. So total 4. But the question says "excluding the one behind 2023's top-grossing film" (Gerwig). So the answer is 4? But the article might not explicitly state the count beyond three. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 3 (since the three are in addition to Maggie Gyllenhaal's film which is already in release?), but Maggie's film is upcoming next year. The article says "Maggie Gyllenhaal's 'The Bride!' [...] will be released next year." So it's in production but not yet released. So Maggie is one, plus the three more (including Olivia), plus Megan. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. The exact answer might be 3 (from the three more) plus Megan, totaling 4. Alternatively, the three are the total excluding Gerwig. The question might require the answer as 3, but I need to check the text again. The article states: Warner Bros. has three more live-action films [...] in active development, including Olivia Wilde. So that's three. Megan's film is another, but it's animated and maybe not counted as part of the three. So the answer would be 3 (the three live-action) plus Megan (animated) making it 4? Or is the animated counted as part of the three? The article separates them with "also," so maybe Megan is an extra. But the question is about "projects in active development at the studio that produced it (Warner Bros.)." So total would be 3 (live-action) +1 (animated) =4. But the article says "three more [...] in active development" and Megan's is "upcoming 2027 animated movie [...] in active development." So the answer is 4. Alternatively, maybe the article counts the three plus Megan as 4. However, the exact number might not be specified. The article might only mention three female directors (including Olivia) in the three films, plus Megan. So total is 4. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the question might be referring to the three plus Maggie Gyllenhaal, but her film is already in the pipeline. The article says "The studio has three more live-action films [...] in active development. (Also, the upcoming 2027 animated movie [...] is being directed by Megan Nicole Dong.)" So Megan's is an additional one. So total four female directors (excluding Gerwig). But I need to see if the three already include someone else. The three are "including Olivia Wilde" so at least one. The answer might be 3 (the three) plus Megan, so 4. But maybe the answer is 3. Alternatively, the article says "three more [...] including Olivia Wilde, in active development" – so three directors (including Olivia), plus Megan's film, so total four. Therefore, the answer is 4? But the question says "excluding the one behind 2023's top-grossing film" (Gerwig), so total is 4? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the three are the total, so answer is 3. The article might not explicitly state the total, so perhaps the answer is 3. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 3, since the three are "more" and the article mentions Maggie Gyllenhaal's film as already in the works but not part of the three. This is a bit ambiguous. Maybe I should go with 3 as per the article's explicit mention of three more, and Megan's is separate but not counted in that number. Alternatively, the answer is 3.

Now let me go back to question 4. The question asks which executive received the key. The article says the studio gave the trio (Robbie's production company leaders) the key. The question is about an executive (from the studio?), but the key was given to the production company's people. So the answer would be N/A because the executive in question isn't mentioned as receiving it. The tradition was revived for the production company's team, so the executive who gave it is Abdy or De Luca, but the question is about the one who received it. Since the recipient is not an executive from Warner Bros., the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "which executive received a symbolic item..." The recipients are not executives from the studio but from LuckyChap. So the answer is N/A. Hmm, but maybe the question is referring to the studio's executive who gave it, but the wording is "received." So the answer is N/A.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check the article again: "They even gave the trio an original key to the studio, resurrecting a tradition started by Jack Warner, one of the founders of Warner Bros." The "they" refers to the studio executives (Abdy and De Luca). So the studio's executives gave the keys to the trio. The question is asking which executive received the item. Since the trio received it, not the studio's execs, the answer is N/A. The question is about the executive who got it, but the execs gave it, so the answer is N/A.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should proceed with the answers I can be sure of and come back to tricky ones.

Question 7 asks about the tradition revived. The article says the key tradition was started by Jack Warner, so the revived tradition is "giving an original key to the studio." So the answer is "the tradition of giving an original key to the studio" or "giving an original key to the studio."

Now let me try to write all answers step by step:

1. Primary reason: studios see it as a one-off, not a model. The article says "perceived as a one-off" and "retreated to usual ways." So the answer is "perceived as a one-off success" or "retreat to conventional ways due to industry's economic climate and labor strikes."

Wait the question is asking for the primary reason studios are hesitant. The article says "the consensus seems to be that 'Barbie' is a singular success [...] they go back to the way they've always been." So the primary reason is that they see it as a one-off, so the answer is "perceived as a one-off success."

2. Discrepancy: same number of female leads as 2010 despite Barbie's success. The answer is "the number of female leads in 2023 remained the same as 2010."

3. Economic climate influence: lower box office and fickle audience make studios cautious. The article says "box office is down [...] studios spooked [...] questioning theatrical viability." Answer: "lower box office and economic retrenchment lead to cautious decisions."

4. Executive received key: N/A because the recipients are not studio execs.

5. Argument: Wonder Woman was a superhero genre. Answer: "Wonder Woman was a superhero genre, making it an unsuitable comparison."

6. Most common response: "We just don't know who it's for."

7. Revived tradition: "giving an original key to the studio."

8. Actor in reimagined franchise: Daniel Kaluuya (Barney) or Lily Collins (Polly Pocket). The article lists both projects. Since the question says "reimagining of a children's franchise" developed by Mattel, both qualify. The first mentioned is Barney with Kaluuya, so answer Daniel Kaluuya.

9. Contractual detail: "contracts did not require them to make a sequel."

10. Number of female directors: The article says three more live-action films in development (including Olivia) and Megan's animated. So total 3+1=4, but maybe the three are excluding Megan. The question says "excluding the one behind 2023's top film (Gerwig), so total female directors in active development at Warner Bros. (excluding Gerwig) would be 3 (live-action) plus Megan (animated) =4. But the article says "three more [...] including Olivia Wilde, in active development. (Also, the upcoming [...] directed by Megan Nicole Dong.)" The parenthetical is separate, so Megan is an additional one. Thus, the answer is 4. But the article might not explicitly state that the three are in addition to Megan. Alternatively, the three are the total. The article mentions Maggie Gyllenhaal's film as already in the works (to be released next year), so maybe she's counted. The article states "Warner Bros. [...] has produced two live-action films starring women and with female directors: Ishana Shyamalan's 'The Watchers,' [...] and Maggie Gyllenhaal's 'The Bride!' [...] will be released next year. The studio has three more live-action films [...] in active development [...] (Also, the upcoming [...] Megan Nicole Dong.)" So Maggie's is already in production (upcoming), so maybe the three more are in addition. So total female directors in active development (excluding Gerwig): Maggie (already in pipeline?), but the question is about active development. The three more are in development, plus Megan's. So 3 +1=4. The answer is 4? But the article might not specify. Alternatively, the answer is 3, since the three are explicitly mentioned, and Megan's is separate. The question might consider only the three, so answer 3. I'll go with 3 because the article says "three more [...] in active development," and Megan's is an additional project but maybe not part of the count. Alternatively, the parenthetical might be part of the same sentence, so total four. Hmm. Since the article says "three more [...] including Olivia Wilde, in active development. (Also, the upcoming 2027 animated movie [...] is being directed by Megan Nicole Dong.)" The "also" suggests it's an extra, so the answer is 3 (live-action) plus Megan (1) making total 4. Therefore, the answer is 4. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the article counts only the three, so answer is 3. I'll proceed with 3 as the explicit number given.
