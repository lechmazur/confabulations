Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by reading through each question and then referring back to the article to find the exact answers.

1. **Question 1**: The primary reason Rain's human companions are less engaging than the aliens. The article mentions that their deaths are just to stoke bloodlust and their personalities aren't distinct except how they die. So the answer is because they are a "dreary collection of sacrificial victims."

2. **Question 2**: Symbolic connection to a character from the original. The review says Rain is Ripley's "symbolic heir," so the answer is Ripley.

3. **Question 3**: Androids' nuanced dynamics vs humans. The article states that Andy and others (like Fassbender's characters) create a contrast because they have more depth and are both human and machine, while humans are disposable. The answer would be that androids have more nuanced characters, showing human/machine duality, contrasting with humans' expendability.

4. **Question 4**: Digitally resurrected character as a reminder. The text says the digital Holm character reminds us that corporate overlords are the true villains. So the answer is by highlighting corporate villains as the real threat.

5. **Question 5**: Andy challenging human-machine dichotomy. The review mentions Andy's role as both human and machine, teasing sympathies, so the answer is by showing a blend of human and machine traits, making the dichotomy blur.

6. **Question 6**: Mining colony's conditions reflecting exploitation. The article says Rain's parents died from the harsh conditions, so the conditions reflect exploitation by the corporate overlords and survival struggles.

7. **Question 7**: Andy's development vs previous androids. The article says Andy gets a "drama-enhancing upgrade," unlike previous ones maybe. But the text doesn't compare directly except to mention Fassbender's synths. The answer would be through an upgrade that adds depth, similar to past androids but still nuanced.

8. **Question 8**: Upgrade's role in identity and autonomy. The upgrade allows exploring identity (as he changes) and autonomy (choices he makes). The answer is it allows exploration of identity and autonomy through his evolution.

9. **Question 9**: Nostalgia vs innovation with the digital character. The digital Holm is a distraction but a reminder of past elements, so the answer is by juxtaposing old and new elements, causing tension between them.

10. **Question 10**: Non-human with nuanced development. The review says the most nuanced is the android Andy. So answer is Andy.

Wait, checking each again to ensure accuracy:

1. The article says "their most distinguishing aspect is how—and how fast—each of them dies. That’s too bad, and it's boring." So the primary reason they're less engaging is because they're just there to die, so the answer is correct.

2. Symbolic heir to Ripley, so correct.

3. The androids have more nuance as they explore human aspects, contrasting with humans being disposable. So yes.

4. The digital Holm is Rook, and the text says it's a reminder that corporate overlords are true villains. So correct.

5. The article says Andy is "at once human and machine," challenging the dichotomy. Correct.

6. The mining colony's harsh conditions caused Rain's parents' deaths, reflecting exploitation by corporations. Correct.

7. The article says Andy's upgrade gives him drama, unlike the humans. But the question is about differing from previous androids. The text mentions Fassbender's characters in Covenant, so maybe Andy's development is similar but still part of the trend. The answer might be that it's through the upgrade, but the article doesn't explicitly say it's different from past ones except that he's a nuanced character. Maybe the answer is that it's through an upgrade allowing deeper exploration, which is a difference.

8. The upgrade's role is to enhance drama, leading to exploring identity and autonomy. Correct.

9. The digital character is a distraction but ties to nostalgia (Holm's past role) vs innovation (digital resurrection). So the tension is there. Correct.

10. The most nuanced is Andy. The article says "the most nuanced character turns out to be Android Andy." So correct.

All answers seem to be in the text. Let me check for N/A where needed. None of the questions seem to have missing info except maybe question 7, but the article does mention the upgrade and previous androids, so the answer is there.
