Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and answer exactly what's asked. Let's start with the first question.

1. The first question asks about the specific physiological effect musk in a fragrance might have on a dog. The article mentions that "other scents, such as musk, can negatively affect a dog's physiological functions." So the answer should be that musk can negatively affect physiological functions.

2. For the second question, the article states that changing a dog's scent can cause other dogs to misidentify it, leading to aggression or social rejection. So the interference is through misidentification causing social issues.

3. The third question is about the contradiction between perfumes and dogs' natural preferences. The example given is Dr. Mills mentioning dogs choosing to roll in coyote or fox scat, which is their own choice, versus being sprayed with perfume. That illustrates the contradiction.

4. The fourth question uses the example of dogs choosing scents like fox scat to highlight consent. The article says applying perfume is not the dog's choice, so the example shows lack of consent.

5. The fifth question connects the industry's growth to sensory overload. The article says the industry is growing to $500B, implying more products like perfumes that might overload dogs' senses. The growth could lead to more use of such products, thus contributing to overload.

6. The sixth question asks how the price of Dolce & Gabbana's perfume compares to the industry's daily growth. The article gives the perfume's price as â‚¬99/$109 and the industry's total growth from $320B to $500B by 2030. But the question is about daily growth. The article doesn't provide daily figures, so this would be N/A.

7. The seventh question relates "instrumentalizing" dogs to social rejection. Instrumentalizing means using them for human benefit, which leads to applying scents that cause rejection. The term is from Dr. Mills, so the answer connects using dogs for human purposes (perfumes) leading to social issues.

8. Eighth question: Dr. Mills talks about dogs relying on smell and how perfumes contradict their natural preferences. Using perfumes contradicts their reliance on natural scents for communication, so the behavioral tendency is using smell for social interaction, and perfumes disrupt that.

9. The ninth question contrasts the ad's description of Fefe as "delicate, authentic, charismatic..." with experts saying it causes social issues. The ad's positive traits vs. the experts' warnings about social rejection and confusion.

10. The tenth question asks which expert used a human senses analogy. Dr. Broom compared it to a person in blinding light, explaining why dogs avoid strong scents. So his analogy explains the avoidance of musk.

Let me check each answer against the article again to ensure accuracy and that I didn't miss any details. For question 6, since the article doesn't mention daily growth rate or a comparison between the perfume's price and daily growth, that's N/A. All others have direct references. Okay, that should cover all questions.
