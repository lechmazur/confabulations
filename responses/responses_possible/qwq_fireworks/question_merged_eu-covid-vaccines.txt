Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. I need to be careful to answer exactly what's asked without adding any extra info or assumptions.

1. The first question asks how the court ruling impacts von der Leyen's chances for a second term. The article mentions the ruling comes before a tight vote and that critics have new momentum. So the answer is probably that it undermines her chances. But I need to check the exact wording. The article says the ruling "cast a shadow" and the vote is tight. So the answer is that it weakens her position.

2. The second question links the Commission's vaccine strategy to the rise of far-right politicians. The article states that concerns over transparency and how funds were spent have contributed to distrust among voters, which coincides with far-right gains. So the answer is that the lack of transparency led to distrust, aiding far-right rise.

3. The third question is about how her handling affected her alliances. The Greens, who are part of needed coalitions, are upset with her handling. So she might need their votes but they're incensed. The answer is that it strained alliances, especially with the Greens.

4. The fourth question is similar to question 2 but phrased differently. The article says the secrecy and ordering too many vaccines (leading to waste) contributed to distrust, which is linked to far-right's surge. So the procurement's issues caused distrust, aiding far-right.

5. The fifth question connects the court ruling to far-right rise. The ruling highlights secrecy, which is part of the distrust mentioned alongside far-right gains. So the ruling supports the idea of secrecy, which feeds into the distrust that helped far-right.

6. The timing of the ruling before the vote could influence it. The article says it came just ahead of the vote, possibly making it harder for her. So the answer is that it undermines her just before the vote, making it harder to secure votes.

7. The paradoxical shift in procurement strategy: the EU started slow but later caught up and surpassed others with the Pfizer deal. So the shift is from slow start to later success.

8. The Commission's statement says they had to balance transparency with business interests, but the court ruled they didn't justify redactions. The contradiction is that the Commission claimed they protected business interests, but the court said they didn't prove need for redactions.

9. The NY Times case is a separate FOIA request for text messages. The court ruling supports transparency, which the Times welcomed. So the connection is that the ruling reinforces the importance of transparency, aiding their case.

10. Public perception of the EU's response: the ruling highlights secrecy, which with far-right's rise and distrust, might worsen perception. The answer is that it exacerbates distrust in pandemic response.

Wait, let me check each question again to ensure I didn't miss any details or make unwarranted inferences. The article says the ruling "gives new momentum to critics" of von der Leyen, so that's why question 1's answer is about undermining her chances. For question 2 and 4, the key is linking the vaccine strategy's issues (transparency and over-purchasing) to far-right's rise through distrust. The timing for question 6 is explicitly mentioned as just before the vote. The paradox in question 7 is the shift from slow start to success. The contradiction in question 8 is between the Commission's defense of redactions for business interests and the court saying they didn't justify it. The NY Times case (question 9) is mentioned as a pending case, and the ruling supports transparency, so the ruling's reasoning might help their case. For question 10, the article says the ruling and secrecy issues contribute to distrust, which with political shifts (far-right gains) affects public perception negatively.
