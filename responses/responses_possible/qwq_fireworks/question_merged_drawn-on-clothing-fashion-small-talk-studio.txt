Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the strict instructions. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** Which item sold at Mogmog could be seen as a culinary parallel to the jelly sandals mentioned later in the article?

Looking at the article, Mogmog sells eel dishes for the Doyo no Ushi no Hi celebration. The jelly sandals are a revival of an old trend. The article mentions that the jelly sandals are a comeback of a 1961 design. The eel dishes are part of a traditional celebration, so maybe the traditional aspect is the parallel. The answer might be the eel dishes because they're a traditional item being sold again, similar to the revival of the sandals. So, "eel dishes".

2. **Question 2:** What connection can be drawn between the traditional Doyo no Ushi no Hi celebration and the podcast "Does This Murder Make Me Look Gay?!"?

The podcast is described as campy and part of the queer canon, inspired by murder mysteries with flamboyant elements. The Doyo no Ushi no Hi celebration includes traditional eel dishes. The connection might be that both involve traditional elements (eel for stamina, podcast's campy tradition). The article says the podcast is inspired by campy traditions like "Clue". So maybe the traditional aspect of both? The answer could be "both are traditional celebrations" but the podcast is a modern take. Wait, the question is about a connection. The article says the podcast is inspired by campy murder mysteries in the queer canon. The Doyo celebration is a traditional event. Maybe they both involve traditions but in different contexts. Alternatively, the podcast's campiness and the celebration's tradition both involve cultural practices. Hmm, the article says the podcast is inspired by "Clue" and other campy works. The Doyo is a traditional event. The connection might be that both are traditional events but the podcast is a modern twist. But the question asks for a connection between the two. Maybe the answer is "both involve traditional elements reinterpreted in modern contexts". Wait, the question says "connection can be drawn", so maybe the answer is "both are traditional events with modern interpretations". Alternatively, looking for a direct link. The podcast's title includes a question about appearance and the celebration's eel for stamina. Not sure. Wait, the podcast's theme is about a flamboyant group dealing with a mystery, similar to the communal aspect of the celebration. Maybe not. Alternatively, the answer might be "both are rooted in tradition" but the question requires a connection. Alternatively, the article mentions that the podcast is inspired by campy murder mysteries in the queer canon, which includes "Clue", a movie. The Doyo is a traditional event. The connection is that both are traditional (the celebration) and the podcast's inspiration from traditional campy works. So the answer might be "both draw inspiration from traditional practices or works".

Wait, but the question is about a connection between the celebration and the podcast. The article says the podcast is inspired by campy murder mysteries in the queer canon, like "Clue", which is a fictional movie. The Doyo is a real traditional event. Maybe they both involve traditions but in different domains (culinary vs. storytelling). Alternatively, the answer might be "both involve communal gatherings with specific traditions". Hmm. Alternatively, the eel dishes are part of the Doyo celebration, and the podcast's title has a humorous, campy question. The connection might be that both use traditional elements in a playful way. But the exact wording in the article? Let me check again. The podcast is described as inspired by campy murder mysteries in the queer canon, like "Clue". The Doyo is a traditional event with eel dishes. The connection is that both are traditional events but the podcast is a modern take on a campy tradition. The answer might be "both are traditional events reimagined in modern contexts". But the question says "connection can be drawn", so maybe "both involve traditional elements with modern twists". Alternatively, maybe the answer is "both are traditions that are celebrated with specific cultural practices". Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the article mentions that the podcast's guests are flamboyant, similar to the eel's traditional use for stamina. Not sure. Maybe the answer is "N/A" if there's no direct link. Wait, the article says the podcast is inspired by campy murder mysteries in the queer canon, which includes "Clue". The Doyo is a traditional event. The connection is that both involve traditions but in different areas. Maybe the answer is "both are rooted in tradition but presented in modern contexts". But the exact wording? Alternatively, the article says the podcast's creator aimed for the effect of an old radio play, so maybe the connection is that both the podcast and the Doyo celebration are traditional in origin but updated. So the answer might be "both are traditional practices that have been updated or maintained in modern times". But the question asks for a connection between the two, so maybe the answer is "they both draw from traditional practices in their respective domains". Alternatively, since the Doyo is a specific event and the podcast is a fictional story, maybe there's no direct connection. Wait, the question might be expecting "both involve traditional elements with a modern twist". Let me check again. The article says the jelly sandals are a revival of a 1961 design. The eel dishes are part of a traditional celebration. So maybe the answer to question 1 is eel dishes. For question 2, perhaps the connection is that both the podcast and the celebration involve traditional elements (murder mystery traditions vs. the Doyo celebration) but presented in modern contexts. However, the article doesn't explicitly link them. Maybe the answer is "N/A". Wait, the question says "connection can be drawn", so perhaps the answer is "both involve traditional elements reinterpreted in modern contexts". But since the article doesn't explicitly connect them, maybe it's N/A? Hmm, tricky. Let me think again. The podcast's theme is a murder mystery with flamboyant characters, and the Doyo is a traditional event. Maybe there's no direct connection. The question might be expecting something else. Wait, the podcast's title has a question about appearance, and the Doyo involves eating eel for stamina. Not sure. Maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, the article says the podcast is inspired by campy murder mysteries, which are a tradition. The Doyo is a traditional event. The connection is both draw on traditions. So the answer is "both draw from traditional practices in their respective domains". But the question is about a connection between them. Maybe that's the case. So I'll go with "both are traditional practices with modern interpretations".

3. **Question 3:** What commonality exists between the production method of Camille Beinhorn's jewelry and a specific aspect of Mogmog's business model?

Camille's jewelry is made by hand-selecting stones from artisanal mines and using a workshop in Jaipur that works with the royal family. Mogmog sources sushi-grade fish flown in biweekly and collaborates with local artisans (like Phoebe Ogawa's sweets). The commonality is sourcing high-quality, artisanal products. So the answer might be "artisanal sourcing".

4. **Question 4:** How does the popularity of the Row's Mara sandal mirror a phenomenon described in the podcast section of the article?

The podcast's creator mentions that the show is "how Broadway can we get it?" and uses theatrical elements. The Mara sandal's popularity is because The Row, known for seriousness, made something fun, leading to cult status. The phenomenon in the podcast section is that the podcast is campy and uses Broadway-style elements, which are not serious but meaningful. The mirror is that both are unexpected or fun takes from a serious source (The Row's Mara and the podcast's campy take on murder mystery). The answer might be "unexpected fun from a serious brand/creator".

5. **Question 5:** If the creators of "Does This Murder Make Me Look Gay?!" were to design a hotel based on their podcast's aesthetic, which new French hotel would it most closely resemble?

The podcast's aesthetic is flamboyant, campy, with flamboyant guests and a Hudson Valley setting. Looking at the French hotels: L'Hotel Bleu has a blue theme and cinema room; Le Mas Candille has a spa with terraces and a redesign by Hugo Toro; Hotel du Couvent is in a historic convent with gardens. The podcast's flamboyance might align with L'Hotel Bleu's blue theme and cinema, or Le Mas Candille's design. The article mentions the podcast's guests are "flamboyant" and the setting is a Hudson Valley home. Le Mas Candille's design by Hugo Toro with hand-painted patterns might be more flamboyant. Alternatively, L'Hotel Bleu's blue and cinema room could be seen as theatrical. The answer might be "L'Hotel Bleu" because of the blue theme and cinema room, which could match the campy, theatrical vibe of the podcast.

6. **Question 6:** What similarity exists between the artistic approach of James Rich (Bird Like Dog) and the design philosophy behind L'Hotel Bleu?

James Rich uses postwar American motifs and folk art. L'Hotel Bleu's design is in shades of blue and has a harbor view. The similarity might be the use of traditional or historical motifs. The article says L'Hotel Bleu's design follows its name with blue shades, and James uses postwar motifs. The design philosophy of L'Hotel Bleu is inspired by its name (blue) and location. James's approach uses historical inspirations. So the similarity is "incorporation of traditional or historical motifs".

7. **Question 7:** How does the revival of jelly sandals mirror a trend seen in the drawn-on clothing designs mentioned earlier in the article?

The jelly sandals are a revival of a 1961 design. The drawn-on clothing is a revival of old traditions like senior cords and signed tees. Both are reviving past trends. The answer is "revival of a historical trend".

8. **Question 8:** If Camille Beinhorn were to create a jewelry piece inspired by the podcast "Does This Murder Make Me Look Gay?!", which character would likely influence the design?

The podcast's main character is Vandy Monroe III, voiced by Jonathan Freeman (Jafar). The show has flamboyant characters like the interior designer and the British porn star. Maybe the designer would take inspiration from the flamboyant aspects. The article mentions the podcast's campy style and use of Broadway elements. The character Vandy is the deceased filmmaker, so maybe his role as the narrator with an "arched eyebrow" could be a design inspiration. Alternatively, the cockatoo Angela Lansfairy, voiced by McKinnon, is a character. Since Camille uses ancient Roman and Byzantine designs, maybe a character with a strong presence like Jafar/Jonathan Freeman's role. But the article doesn't specify characters beyond the examples given. The most flamboyant might be the interior designer or the narrator. Alternatively, the cockatoo with a punny name. Maybe the answer is "Angela Lansfairy" (the cockatoo) since it's a playful, campy character. The article says the show features Angela Lansfairy as a cockatoo. That's a funny name, so maybe that's the choice. So the answer would be "Angela Lansfairy".

9. **Question 9:** What parallel can be drawn between the design process of Hotel Le Mas Candille and the creation of Small Talk Studio's custom items?

Hotel Le Mas Candille was redesigned by Hugo Toro with hand-painted patterns. Small Talk Studio works closely with clients on custom items, incorporating distinct references. The parallel is collaboration with clients/designers for personalized touches. The answer might be "customization through collaboration with clients".

10. **Question 10:** How does the naming convention of Mogmog relate to a specific aspect of the jelly sandal trend?

Mogmog's name is Japanese onomatopoeia for eating. The jelly sandals are called "Ancient Greek Sandals" referencing a 1961 design. The naming convention of Mogmog is based on sound (onomatopoeia), while the jelly sandal's brand name references historical origin. The article says the jelly sandals are a revival of a 1961 design by Minoglou's grandfather. The connection might be that both names relate to their origins (Mogmog to eating sounds, jelly sandals to historical revival). Alternatively, the name "Mogmog" is onomatopoeic, and the jelly sandals' name "Ancient Greek" references heritage. Maybe the parallel is that both names reflect their cultural or functional roots. The answer could be "both names reflect their cultural or functional origins".

Wait, but the question is about the naming convention of Mogmog and a specific aspect of the jelly sandal trend. The jelly sandal's name "Iro" is mentioned, but the brand is Ancient Greek Sandals. The trend's aspect is the revival of an old design. The naming of Mogmog is about the sound of eating. The connection might be that both names derive from cultural references (onomatopoeia for Mogmog, historical Greek for the sandals). So the answer is "cultural or historical references in their names".

Now, let's check each answer against the article to ensure they're directly supported.

1. Eel dishes are sold at Mogmog, and the jelly sandals are a revival. The parallel is that both are traditional items being sold again. So "eel dishes" is correct.

2. Both draw on traditional practices (murder mystery traditions for the podcast, Doyo's eel tradition). The answer "both draw from traditional practices in their respective domains" is valid.

3. Camille sources artisanal materials; Mogmog sources artisanal fish and collaborates with local artists. So "artisanal sourcing" fits.

4. The Mara's popularity due to being unexpected fun from The Row's serious image. The podcast's creator aimed for a campy, Broadway-style show, which is also unexpected in its serious context (maybe murder mysteries are usually more grim). So "unexpected fun from a serious brand/creator" works.

5. The podcast's flamboyance aligns with L'Hotel Bleu's blue theme and cinema, or Le Mas Candille's design. The article describes L'Hotel Bleu's blue decor and a private cinema, which might be more in line with the podcast's theatrical elements. So "L'Hotel Bleu".

6. James uses postwar motifs; L'Hotel Bleu uses its name's theme (blue). The similarity is traditional motifs. So "incorporation of traditional or historical motifs".

7. Both revive past trends (jelly sandals from 1961, drawn-on clothing from old traditions). "Revival of a historical trend" is correct.

8. Angela Lansfairy the cockatoo is a character in the podcast. So that's the answer.

9. Hotel Le Mas Candille was designed by Hugo Toro with hand-painted patterns, while Small Talk works with clients for customization. The parallel is "customization through collaboration with clients/designers".

10. Mogmog's name is onomatopoeia (sound), while the jelly sandals' name references historical roots. The parallel is "cultural or historical references in their names".

I think these answers fit based on the article. Now, format them properly.
