Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one, using only the article provided. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then find the answers in the text.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks which founder's quote about neck injuries foreshadowed a tragic event 18 years later. The article mentions Greg Glassman, the founder, who said, "If the notion of falling off the rings and breaking your neck is so foreign to you, then we don't want you in our ranks." Lazar Dukic died in 2023, and Glassman's quote was from 2005. 2023 minus 2005 is 18 years. So the founder is Greg Glassman. 

2. **Question 2:** The question is about how CrossFit's marketing slogans reflect the tension between accessibility and elite competition. The article says they abandoned "Forging Elite Fitness" and returned to the idea that workouts suit everyone, from Olympians to grandparents. The old motto emphasized elite, while the new one is about accessibility. So the answer would be the shift from "Forging Elite Fitness" to the new philosophy.

3. **Question 3:** The athlete who nearly drowned in 2017 was Mat Fraser, as mentioned by his coach Chris Hinshaw. The fatal incident four years later (2021?) would be Dukic's death in 2023? Wait, the article says Dukic died in 2023, so four years after 2017 would be 2021, but Dukic's death was in 2023. Maybe the question is referring to the four years between 2017 and 2021? Hmm, maybe I need to check the years again. The article says the 2023 Games had Dukic's death. The near-drowning was in 2017, so four years later would be 2021, but the fatal event was in 2023. Maybe the question allows "four years later" as approximate? The answer is Mat Fraser.

4. **Question 4:** The reigning champion who withdrew was Laura Horvath, mentioned as the reigning female champion. The founder's original vision included the risky quote, so her withdrawal contradicts that vision by refusing to continue after the tragedy, opposing the "we don't want you if you fear injury" stance.

5. **Question 5:** The seven-time champion is Tia-Clair Toomey. She continued because she thought Dukic would have wanted that, aligning with the founder's emphasis on toughing it out but also the newer message of honoring him, which might fit the evolving brand. Contradiction because continuing could be seen as elite focus, while the new message is more about accessibility and safety.

6. **Question 6:** The athlete's comment about safety of an exercise echoing Glassman's quote. The article quotes Danielle Brandon saying, "What's so safe about putting a heavy dumbbell over your head?" Glassman's original quote dismissed fear of injury, so her comment mirrors that acceptance of risk.

7. **Question 7:** The exercise influenced by CrossFit that shows accessibility and danger. The article mentions kettlebell swings as an example of CrossFit's influence. They can be adapted but also risky if done improperly.

8. **Question 8:** Athlete's safety concerns echoing "Uncle Rhabdo." The mascot was about rhabdomyolysis. Pat Vellner said safety concerns were ignored, which aligns with the mascot's warning about risks.

9. **Question 9:** The Games' purpose as stated by a CrossFit official that contributed to the tragedy. The purpose was to test fitness via "the unknown and unknowable," which led to the open-water swim, a risky event.

10. **Question 10:** Unusual tasks contradicting the "unknown and unknowable" claim. The article states that tasks like leaping hay bales or sledgehammer swings are part of the Games but aren't part of regular CrossFit classes, so they don't prepare athletes for real-world unknowns but are just for competition.
