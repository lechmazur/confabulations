Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and answer each question strictly based on the information given. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Question 1:** How did Arjav's inability to travel influence his approach to understanding wine? The article mentions he had to "fake it" and imagine experiences he couldn't have, like the Santorini beach example. So the answer is about him relying on others' descriptions and imagination.

2. **Question 2:** The legislative change that allowed him to discuss his background is DACA, as mentioned when he applied after it was passed in 2012.

3. **Question 3:** The text says he "presented as an American" and racially ambiguous, which helped him stay hidden. So his racial ambiguity contributed to his ability to blend in, making his experience feel more isolating because he wasn't visibly "other."

4. **Question 4:** He couldn't provide required papers for the paralegal job, as stated after mentioning his aspirations.

5. **Question 5:** DACA allowed him to work legally. The article notes Union Square Hospitality supported him during a delay, arranging stints elsewhere. So DACA enabled his career progression despite temporary issues.

6. **Question 6:** At The Source, he associated wine with success and the American dream through wealthy patrons, even without travel.

7. **Question 7:** The 2012 DACA passage gave him temporary relief.

8. **Question 8:** His family overstaying visas led to him missing the Europe choir trip and needing to hide his status, affecting education and career choices like the paralegal job.

9. **Question 9:** His inability to travel meant he couldn't visit wine regions, impacting his professional development in a field that values such experiences.

10. **Question 10:** His background made him aware of undocumented workers' roles in the industry, as he mentioned their prevalence in harvesting, pruning, etc.

I need to ensure each answer is direct and from the text. Let me check each again for accuracy and that I'm not inferring beyond the article. For example, question 3 asks how racial ambiguity played a role in his perception. The article states he "presented as an American" and racially ambiguous, so this allowed him to blend in, contributing to his experience feeling isolating. That's directly from the text. All others seem to have direct answers except maybe question 3, but the text does connect his racial ambiguity to how his status was hidden. Okay, I think all answers are covered.
