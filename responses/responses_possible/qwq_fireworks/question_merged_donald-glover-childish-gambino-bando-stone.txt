Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. Let me start by reading through each question carefully and then cross-checking the article for answers.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions that "Bando Stone & the New World" explores themes of artistic purpose and existential questions. It also notes that Glover's TV work like "Atlanta" was more cerebral, while his music as Gambino was raw. The album's themes about the purpose of art reflect his personal growth and the contrast between his TV and music careers. So the answer should connect his TV work's cerebral nature with the album's themes.

2. **Question 2**: The article states that "Atlanta" was inspired by frustrations in the music industry and his experiences in network TV as the only Black voice. This influenced the show's themes and creative direction, so the answer is about those experiences leading to creating "Atlanta" with a team of Black creatives.

3. **Question 3**: The album's concept is a musician recording during a global calamity. This mirrors Glover's own exploration of artistic purpose amid life changes (like his father's death and fatherhood). The film and album together explore the meaning of creating art when facing existential threats.

4. **Question 4**: The narrative of the album involves a musician facing calamity while creating his masterpiece. This parallels Glover's journey with challenges in the industry (like legal issues with his label, balancing family and projects). The metaphor is about persisting in art despite obstacles.

5. **Question 5**: The global calamity in the album's story symbolizes existential questioning about the purpose of art. Glover mentions feeling unsure about why he creates, so the calamity reflects his exploration of whether art matters in the face of larger crises.

6. **Question 6**: The article mentions "Derrick," his college troupe that found an audience on early YouTube. The connection to retiring Gambino is his early start leading to now ending the project. The answer is "Derrick" since that's the group linked to his YouTube success.

7. **Question 7**: His stress dreams involved attacking his label head with a bat. The album's theme of a musician facing calamity might parallel his own struggles with the music industry's challenges, so the stress over industry conflicts is the parallel.

8. **Question 8**: Personal growth includes becoming a father and his father's death, leading to a more balanced view (like the "grown-up equanimity" in the album's style). The music's maturity reflects his acceptance and peace.

9. **Question 9**: Early frustrations with the music industry (clashes with Glassnote) and feeling isolated as a Black artist in TV led to themes in "Atlanta" and his music. The final album's themes of artistic purpose and existential doubt echo those earlier struggles.

10. **Question 10**: The production style is described as "stylistically promiscuous" and mixing genres, which mirrors his early mixtapes' unfiltered, genre-blending approach. So the answer is the genre diversity from his early work influencing the new album's style.

Now, I need to check each answer against the text to ensure accuracy and that there's no external info. Let me verify each point again quickly.

1. Yes, the article says the album explores purpose, contrasting with TV's cerebral style.
2. "Atlanta" inspired by music industry frustrations and network TV experiences.
3. The film/album concept ties to his personal life changes and artistic questions.
4. The calamity metaphor matches his industry challenges and balancing life.
5. Calamity reflects existential doubt about art's purpose.
6. Derrick's YouTube success is mentioned, connected to his start.
7. Stress dreams about the label align with the album's themes of struggle.
8. Personal growth (fatherhood, etc.) leading to the album's mature style.
9. Early frustrations with industry and isolation foreshadow themes in the album.
10. Stylistic promiscuity mirrors early mixtapes' eclectic style.

All answers seem supported. Any "N/A"? Let me check each question again to ensure none require specific data not present. For example, question 6 asks for an artist mentioned connected to YouTube success and retiring Gambino. The article mentions "Derrick" as his college troupe on early YouTube, but is that an artist? Wait, Derrick is a troupe, not an artist. The article also mentions Sleigh Bells, Grizzly Bear, Yeasayer as collaborators on early projects. But the question is about an artist who shares a connection with both his YouTube start and retiring Gambino. Maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "artist mentioned in the article", so "Derrick" is a group, not an artist. The article mentions Erykah Badu's album "Baduizm" as something he related to, but not sure. Wait, the article mentions Missy Elliott and Kendrick Lamar in the last paragraphs, but those are in different sections. Wait the question is about an artist mentioned in the article who shares a connection to his YouTube success (Derrick) and retiring Gambino. Since Derrick is his own group, maybe the answer is "N/A" because it's not another artist. Hmm, that's a problem. Let me check again. The article says "his college sketch comedy troupe, Derrick, found an audience on early YouTube in 2006." So Derrick is his own group, not another artist. The question asks for an artist mentioned in the article connected to that. Since the only other artists mentioned in that context are Pitchfork collaborators (Sleigh Bells, etc.), but they aren't connected to retiring Gambino. Maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question might be looking for "Atlanta" as the TV work? But the question specifies an artist. Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm. Let me re-examine the question. "Which artist mentioned in the article shares a connection with Glover's early YouTube success and his decision to retire Childish Gambino?" The article mentions "Derrick" (his own group) as the YouTube success, but that's not an artist. The other artists mentioned in the same context are Sleigh Bells, Grizzly Bear, Yeasayer as collaborators on his early mixtapes, but they aren't connected to retiring Gambino. The only other artist mentioned in the article in the same paragraph as retiring Gambino is his brother Stephen (as part of the "Atlanta" team). But the question is about an artist connected to both his YouTube start and retiring. Since there's no other artist mentioned in the text that fits both, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but the article says "Atlanta" was partly inspired by frustrations with the music business. So maybe "Atlanta" is the TV work, but the question asks for an artist, not a show. Hmm, this might be an oversight. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is "N/A". But the user might expect "Derrick" even if it's a group. The question says "artist", so maybe N/A. That's a possible error. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "N/A".

Wait, the article also mentions "Atlanta" as his TV work, but that's a show, not an artist. The only artists mentioned in relation to his early career are the ones he sampled (Sleigh Bells, etc.), but they aren't connected to retiring Gambino. So perhaps question 6's answer is N/A. But the initial thought was "Derrick", but since it's a group, not an artist, maybe it's N/A. I need to check again. The exact wording of the question is important. The question says "artist mentioned in the article shares a connection with Glover's early YouTube success and his decision to retire Childish Gambino". The only other mention near retiring Gambino is his brother Stephen, who worked on "Atlanta", but that's not an artist connected to YouTube. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the article again for any artist mentioned in both contexts. The article mentions Erykah Badu's "Baduizm" as something he related to in his youth, but that's not connected to retiring Gambino. Kendrick Lamar is mentioned in the last paragraphs as part of a diss war, but not connected to YouTube. Maybe the correct answer is N/A for question 6. But initially, I thought Derrick's YouTube success is connected to retiring Gambino's end. Since the article says "Bando Stone & the New World" is his final album as Gambino, and his YouTube start was with Derrick. The question asks for an artist mentioned who is connected to both. Since Derrick is his own group, maybe it's not considered an "artist" here. So the answer would be N/A. But I might have to check again. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "N/A".

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to "Atlanta" as the TV work that influenced his decision, but that's not an artist. Hmm. Maybe I should mark it as N/A. But I need to be precise. Let me see if any other artist is mentioned in both contexts. The article mentions his brother Stephen as part of the Atlanta team, but that's not an artist. Maybe the answer is N/A. I'll have to adjust that answer then.

Other questions seem okay. Let me proceed, noting that Q6 might need correction.
