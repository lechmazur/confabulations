Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. No external knowledge allowed. Let me go through each question and find the relevant parts in the text.

1. **How does the acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems potentially impact Boeing's ability to address quality issues, considering the recent incident involving a 737 Max 9?**
   - The article mentions that by acquiring Spirit, Boeing can "more easily be able to monitor and change production practices by owning the business." The recent incident with the panel blowing out is linked to quality problems Spirit had. So the answer is that it improves their ability to monitor and change practices, thus addressing quality issues.

2. **In what way does the January incident involving a 737 Max 9 illustrate the potential benefits of Boeing's acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems?**
   - The incident showed issues with Spirit's production (the panel not bolted). The acquisition allows Boeing to have full control, so the benefit is better oversight to prevent such incidents.

3. **How does Boeing's historical reliance on independent suppliers relate to the quality control issues it faces today, as exemplified by the January incident?**
   - The article states that Boeing started outsourcing in the early 2000s to cut costs. The January incident's root cause (like missing bolts) is part of current quality issues stemming from that strategy.

4. **What does the change in Boeing's acceptance criteria for 737 fuselages from Spirit AeroSystems reveal about its approach to quality control?**
   - The text says Boeing now rejects fuselages that don't meet standards instead of fixing later. This shows a stricter, no-tolerance approach to defects.

5. **How does Boeing's plan to reduce traveled work relate to the quality issues identified in the January incident involving a 737 Max 9?**
   - Traveled work (out-of-sequence tasks) can disrupt processes and lead to defects. The article mentions reducing this practice to improve quality, implying that such work contributed to the incident's issues.

6. **How does Boeing's expanded training and increased inspections at its 737 factory relate to the company's broader strategy of reintegrating Spirit AeroSystems?**
   - The integration aims to align production and safety systems. Training and inspections are part of improving quality control, which is part of the broader strategy post-acquisition.

7. **How does the timing of Boeing's acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems align with its internal efforts to improve quality control, particularly in light of recent incidents?**
   - The acquisition was announced after the January incident and internal changes. The timing aligns as a response to those incidents to enhance quality through control.

8. **How does Boeing's historical outsourcing strategy relate to the current challenges it faces with Spirit AeroSystems' quality issues?**
   - The outsourcing in the early 2000s (including creating Spirit by selling divisions) led to reliance on suppliers like Spirit, whose quality issues now are a direct result of that strategy.

9. **What strategic reversal does Boeing's acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems represent in relation to a decision made two decades ago?**
   - The article says the deal reverses a 20-year-old decision to outsource production. The reversal is bringing back in-house what was outsourced, specifically Spirit which was sold in 2005.

10. **What manufacturing practice, considered necessary but potentially disruptive, did Boeing aim to reduce in its quality improvement efforts?**
   - The article mentions "traveled work" (out-of-sequence tasks). It says some is necessary but too much disrupts processes and causes defects, so they aim to reduce it.
