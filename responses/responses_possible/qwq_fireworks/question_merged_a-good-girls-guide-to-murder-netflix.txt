Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. 

1. The question asks about a character whose performance shows panic, regret, and courage. The article mentions Emma Myers as Pip, and her performance "beautifully and poignantly synthesizes this blend of panic, regret, embarrassment, determination, courage, fear and stubbornness." So the answer is Pip/Emma Myers. But the question specifies the character's name, so Pip.

2. The article has a section called "SIDE QUESTS" mentioning Pip and Ravi's marshmallow joke, linking it to Veronica Mars fans called "marshmallows." So the connection is that marshmallows were fans of Veronica Mars, which is their in-joke.

3. The article says seeing Pip behind the wheel of a car startled the viewer because she looked younger. The elements are her driving and her appearing 12. So the answer is her driving a car.

4. The protagonist's appearance that shows maturation is her looking younger (could pass for 12) despite her actions. The unexpected element is her age appearance contrasting with actions.

5. The social activity that becomes serious is sleepovers turning into interrogations. The article says "sleepovers that become interrogations."

6. The juxtaposition is her apparent age (could pass for 12) versus actions like driving or investigations, contributing to her coming-of-age.

7. The skill developed is using Instagram for investigation, aiding both her case and personal growth. The article says her technique revolves around Instagram.

8. The question asks for an alternative platform if Instagram wasn't used. The article doesn't mention other platforms, so this might be N/A. Unless "social media" in general, but specific platforms not listed except others like Hulu, Amazon, etc., which aren't social. So N/A.

9. If no social media, her investigation method would change. Since she uses Instagram, without it, maybe traditional methods. But the question is hypothetical and the article doesn't say, so N/A.

10. Alternative mechanism for maturing instead of crime investigation. The article compares to road trips. So road trip is the answer.
