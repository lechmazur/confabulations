Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks about China's economic strategy focusing on infrastructure despite real estate and consumer issues. The article mentions an "investment-led strategy that focuses on erecting more buildings instead of putting money into consumers' pockets." So the answer is the investment-led strategy.

2. **Question 2**: Local government financial troubles from the real estate crisis influence consumer spending. The text says local governments increased tax collection and fees, which erodes consumer spending power. The answer is that they increase taxes/fees, reducing spending power.

3. **Question 3**: The government's reluctance to redirect funds from state-owned enterprises affects their economic strategy. The article states they don't move money from these firms, so they can't boost pensions/welfare to help consumers. The answer is it prevents increased consumer support.

4. **Question 4**: Changes in local revenue practices (like more taxes and fees) affect consumer spending power. The answer is they reduce it by taking more money from households.

5. **Question 5**: High debt levels, especially in state-owned enterprises, impact economic stability. The article says high debt (higher than the US relative to economy) is a problem. The implication is risk to stability.

6. **Question 6**: The revised first-quarter growth rate was down from 6.6% to 6.1% when annualized. The answer is the first quarter's growth figure.

7. **Question 7**: The trade surplus hit a record $99 billion. The article mentions this exact number.

8. **Question 8**: China's loan limits to developing countries affect construction firms. Zhongmei's overseas projects dropped because clients can't afford them. The answer is reduced overseas projects.

9. **Question 9**: Nomura analysts mention 20 million unfinished homes. The exact number is given here.

10. **Question 10**: The example in Nanchang's Wanshou Palace shows infrastructure over consumer focus. The answer is Nanchang.
