Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article provided and answer each question exactly as asked. Let's start with the first question.

1. **What specific economic and social factors have contributed to the rise in metal thefts since the pandemic, according to the article?**  
The article mentions "economic ills and social malaise lingering since the pandemic and soaring demand for metals, especially for copper" as factors. So the answer should list those two factors: pandemic's economic impact/social issues and increased metal demand.

2. **What is the connection between the global demand for copper and the increase in metal thefts, as described in the article?**  
The article states that copper is crucial for renewable energy and infrastructure, leading to higher demand. This drives theft because thieves can sell stolen copper for profit. The connection is that high demand makes copper valuable, so it's targeted.

3. **What does the article imply about the relationship between metal theft and the economic transition towards renewable energy sources?**  
Since copper is key for energy transition (like electric grids, EVs), the thefts are linked to the increased need for copper in these projects. The article implies that the transition's demand fuels thefts.

4. **How does the article connect the rise in metal thefts to broader economic trends, such as the demand for metals in infrastructure projects?**  
The Biden infrastructure projects and global demand for metals (including copper) are mentioned as factors. The article connects infrastructure spending to higher metal prices, encouraging theft.

5. **How does the article highlight the role of economic incentives in driving metal theft, particularly in relation to the demand for copper?**  
Thieves steal copper because it's valuable and in demand. The article notes scrap companies buying it, giving thieves incentive. The economic incentive is the profit from selling to recyclers.

6. **What does the article suggest about the relationship between metal theft and social issues, such as addiction and poverty?**  
The article says some thefts involve "people struggling with addiction" recruited by criminal groups. So poverty and addiction are linked to people being coerced into stealing for drugs or money.

7. **What does the article imply about the relationship between metal theft and broader economic trends, such as the demand for metals in renewable energy projects?**  
Similar to question 3 and 4, the energy transition's copper demand is a key trend driving theft. The answer would be the same as question 3, but maybe rephrased. Wait, question 3 was about economic transition, so yes, same point.

8. **Which city's infrastructure project, celebrated for its illumination, now stands in darkness due to criminal activity?**  
The 6th Street Bridge in Los Angeles is mentioned as going dark because its wiring was stolen. The article says it was known as the "Ribbon of Light."

9. **What material, crucial for the energy transition, is being stolen from urban landscapes across America?**  
Copper is highlighted as vital for energy transition (batteries, grids, data centers) and is being stolen from streetlights, etc.

10. **Which boxing legend's commemorative item fell victim to thieves at a historically significant cemetery?**  
Joe Louis's commemorative plaque was stolen from Lincoln Memorial Park Cemetery. The article mentions a plaque dedicated by Joe Louis.

Now, check each answer against the article to ensure accuracy and that no external knowledge is used. Make sure all answers are directly from the text or logically inferred. If any question isn't answered, put N/A. Let me verify each one again quickly.

1. The factors are economic ills/social malaise from pandemic and soaring metal demand. Correct.

2. Copper's high demand due to energy transition makes it a target. Correct.

3. Same as 2 but framed towards economic transition. Yes, the article connects copper's role in energy transition to theft.

4. Infrastructure projects (like Biden's) increase metal demand, leading to theft. Correct.

5. Economic incentive is the profit from selling copper to scrap companies. Correct.

6. Theft linked to addiction and poverty via recruitment by criminal groups. Correct.

7. Same as 3 and 4, so answer is same as 3. The article does mention energy transition's role. Okay.

8. 6th Street Bridge in LA. Correct.

9. Copper. Correct.

10. Joe Louis. Correct.
