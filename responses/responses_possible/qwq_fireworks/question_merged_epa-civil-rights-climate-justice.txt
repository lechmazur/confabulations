Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to make sure I read the article carefully and find the exact answers. Let me go through each question step by step.

1. The first question is about how the court's decision impacts the Biden administration's environmental justice strategy. The article says the ruling is a setback because the EPA can't use Title VI for cumulative or disparate harms. So the answer should mention that it limits their ability to use civil rights law for such cases.

2. The second question asks for an environmental attorney's surname that's the same as the EPA administrator. The EPA administrator mentioned is Michael Regan. The attorney quoted is Debbie Chizewer. Wait, that's not the same. Wait, maybe I missed someone else. Let me check again. The article mentions Earthjustice's attorney Debbie Chizewer and the EPA administrator Michael Regan. No, their surnames are different. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, the question says the attorney shares a surname with the EPA administrator. But the EPA administrator is Regan, so maybe there's another person? Wait, the article says "Michael S. Regan, the administrator of the E.P.A." The attorney mentioned is Debbie Chizewer. So maybe there's no such attorney? Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The Earthjustice attorney is Debbie Chizewer. The EPA administrator is Regan. So their last names are different. Then the answer would be N/A? Wait, maybe I'm missing someone else. The article also mentions the judge's name: James D. Cain Jr. But that's not an attorney. Hmm, maybe the question is a trick. Wait, the question says "which environmental attorney, quoted in the article, shares a surname with the EPA administrator..." Since the EPA admin is Regan, and the attorney's name is Chizewer, so no. Therefore the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe I missed another attorney? The article mentions Earthjustice has pursued cases but only names Chizewer. So I think this must be N/A. But the user might have intended something else. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. Wait, the article says "Michael S. Regan, the administrator of the E.P.A." and "Debbie Chizewer". So no, their surnames don't match. So answer is N/A? Wait, the user might have made a mistake here. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick. Let me note that for now.

3. The third question is about the chemical compound used in footwear production targeted by the new rule. The article mentions chloroprene is used in rubber for footwear. So the answer is chloroprene.

4. The fourth question asks for the shared characteristic of communities near the EPA's new rule-affected facilities. The article says those communities are often disproportionately Black or Latino and have health issues. The shared characteristic is they are minority communities (Black/Latino) and have health problems. The question says "as described in both the article's discussion of St. John the Baptist Parish and the rule's impact." St. John is a predominantly Black community, and the rule's impact areas are similarly described. So the shared characteristic is that they are predominantly minority communities (Black/Latino) and have elevated health issues. So the answer is "disproportionately Black or Latino" or "minority communities" but the exact wording? The article states "often disproportionately Black or Latino and have elevated rates..." So the answer should be "disproportionately Black or Latino communities" or "minority communities with elevated health issues". But the question asks for the shared characteristic as per both parts. The article says in the paragraph about the rule: "Communities in proximity to the plants are often disproportionately Black or Latino and have elevated rates..." So the shared characteristic is being "disproportionately Black or Latino" and having health issues. But the question says "shared characteristic", so maybe the key point is the racial aspect. The answer would be "disproportionately Black or Latino".

5. The fifth question is the connection between the EPA administrator's visit to St. John and the regulatory action. The article says that after Regan visited, the EPA issued a new rule. So the visit led to the rule. The answer would be that the visit prompted the new rule.

6. The sixth question asks what harm the EPA can't consider. The court said they can't consider "cumulative or 'disparate' environmental harms". So the answer is "cumulative or disparate environmental harms".

7. The seventh question: if a state petitions the EPA to stop using race, which law is relevant? The article mentions Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. So the law is Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

8. The eighth question: what evidence wouldn't the EPA consider? The court ruled that they can't consider cumulative or disparate impacts, so evidence of such harms wouldn't be considered. The question is about which evidence type isn't considered, so "evidence of cumulative or disparate environmental harms".

9. The ninth question: which region is most affected by the new rule? The article says the affected facilities are in Texas, Louisiana, Gulf Coast, Ohio River Valley, WV. The most affected region would be Texas and Louisiana, so "Gulf Coast" is mentioned first. The answer is "Texas, Louisiana and the Gulf Coast" or "Gulf Coast region".

10. The tenth question: the law allowing EPA to investigate discrimination is Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The article states that Title VI allows the EPA to investigate whether state programs discriminate.

Now, going back to question 2: the attorney's name is Chizewer, EPA admin is Regan. No match. So the answer must be N/A. Wait, maybe I missed another attorney? The article only mentions Debbie Chizewer. So yes, N/A. But maybe the question is a trick? Let me check again. The question says "shares a surname with the EPA administrator mentioned in the article's penultimate paragraph". Wait, the penultimate paragraph is the one about the new rule? Let me check the article's penultimate paragraph. The penultimate paragraph is the one starting with "The rule specifically targets ethylene oxide..." and mentions Michael Regan's visit. So the administrator is Michael Regan. The attorney is Chizewer. So no, so answer is N/A. So I have to put N/A for question 2.
