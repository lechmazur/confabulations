merged_biden-abc-interview-george-stephanopoulos.txt
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article. 

1. **Question 1**: The question asks for the name of the former Democratic strategist who is now a star anchor chosen to interview the president. The article mentions George Stephanopoulos, who was a former Democratic strategist (helped Bill Clinton in the 90s) and is now an anchor at ABC. The reasons given are the network's high viewership and nonpartisanship. So the answer is George Stephanopoulos.

2. **Question 2**: The article compares the current situation to an event in 2020 where Biden's campaign was struggling. The example given is the Feb 9, 2020 interview with Stephanopoulos before the New Hampshire primary. That's the mirror situation here. So the answer is the 2020 interview before the New Hampshire primary.

3. **Question 3**: The article states that ABC preempted a rerun of "Jeopardy! Masters" to air the interview. The specific program mentioned is "Jeopardy! Masters".

4. **Question 4**: The network (ABC) assured they would air the interview in full and without edits. This means any attempt by Biden's team to cut it early would be shown. The assurance is "air the interview in full and without edits".

5. **Question 5**: The key personnel besides Stephanopoulos are Simone Swink (executive producer of GMA) and Rick Klein (political director of ABC News). The text says they are expected to be present.

6. **Question 6**: The interview is taped in Madison, Wisconsin, where the president is making a campaign stop that day. So the location relates to his scheduled campaign activity there.

7. **Question 7**: The communication channel was a text message from Ben LaBolt, the White House communications director, to Stephanopoulos.

8. **Question 8**: The article mentions that the interview's prime-time slot was moved from Sunday's "This Week" to Friday. However, the question is about if the interview is longer than the 2021 one. Wait, the 2021 interview was in August 2021 at the White House. The current interview's length is 15-25 mins, but if it's extended, the network preempted "Jeopardy! Masters" for the prime-time slot. But the question says if the interview surpasses the 2021 duration, what would be preempted. Wait, the article says the prime-time show was preempted regardless. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. The question states "if the upcoming interview...surpasses the duration of his 2021 interview... what event will be preempted?" The 2021 interview's duration isn't mentioned, but the current one's length is 15-25 mins. The article says the prime-time show (the rerun of Jeopardy) was preempted. So the answer is "Jeopardy! Masters" rerun.

9. **Question 9**: Despite the network's assurance, the president's team could try to cut it early, but since it's aired in full, any attempt to stop early would be shown. So the indirect influence is that their attempt to cut early would be captured and shown, so maybe they can't influence content but their actions would be visible. The answer is that any premature termination attempt would be shown, so the action is the president's team trying to cut it early but the network shows that.

10. **Question 10**: The parallel is that both times (2020 and now), Biden is in a dire political moment and relies on Stephanopoulos's interview to revive his campaign. The article explicitly states this in the first and last paragraphs, so the answer is that both involve a struggling campaign and relying on Stephanopoulos's interview to turn things around.
