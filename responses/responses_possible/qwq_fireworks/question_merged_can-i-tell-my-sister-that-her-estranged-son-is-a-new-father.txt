Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. The user wants answers strictly based on the article provided, so I need to make sure I don't bring in any outside knowledge.

Starting with question 1: How does the birthday boy's reaction reflect broader themes of social expectations and personal boundaries? The article mentions the birthday boy was taken aback but didn't comment, then his feelings shifted. The columnist calls him a bit self-centered for begrudging the friend's directness. So the reaction shows tension between expecting tact (social expectation) and the friend's right to set boundaries. Answer might be about conflicting expectations vs. honesty.

Question 2: The aunt suggests family therapy. The article says the columnist suggests this as a way for reconciliation, even though the aunt has issues with her sister. The aunt's own estrangement might limit her role, but therapy is a neutral suggestion. So the answer is that it's a neutral suggestion despite her own issues.

Question 3: The birthday boy's internal conflict after the party. He felt the friend was tactless but maybe he should have been more careful. The columnist says he should let it go, implying complexities in friendship where honesty vs. politeness clash. So it highlights how honesty can complicate friendships and etiquette.

Question 4: The aunt's limited knowledge impacts her mediation. The article states she doesn't know the full story and isn't close to her sister, so she can't mediate effectively. Answer is that her lack of knowledge makes her ill-equipped to mediate.

Question 5: Birthday boy's shift in feelings about honesty. He was upset the friend was direct, but the columnist says he should let it go. The shift shows that while honesty is valued, social expectations might prefer tact. So it reflects that honesty can strain relationships if not handled tactfully.

Question 6: Aunt's uncertainty about the sister knowing the baby complicates loyalty. She feels disloyal not telling but can't without permission. The uncertainty adds to her dilemma between loyalty to sister and support for nephew. Answer is that uncertainty creates conflict between loyalty and responsibility.

Question 7: Fianc√©e's approach to reimbursement. She wants to handle it without tension, so she's cautious but might pay to avoid conflict. Shows understanding that family dynamics require careful handling to maintain relationships. Answer is that she prioritizes family harmony over conflict.

Question 8: Birthday boy's reaction to the refusal shows tension between personal preferences and etiquette. The friend refused because of another guest, but the host expected attendance. The reaction shows personal dislike vs. social obligation to attend. Answer is highlighting that personal preferences can clash with social niceties.

Question 9: Columnist's reference to the dog party reinforces stance on multiple marriages. He says if he can accept a dog's party, he should accept the brother's marriage. So the analogy suggests that personal judgments shouldn't dictate social responses. Answer is that it shows embracing unconventional events supports accepting unconventional life choices.

Question 10: Implicit criticism in the columnist's advice to the aunt. The columnist advises not forcing the issue, implying the host (birthday boy) was too self-centered. The advice to the aunt not to intervene criticizes assuming others' needs. So the criticism is about overstepping in others' conflicts.
