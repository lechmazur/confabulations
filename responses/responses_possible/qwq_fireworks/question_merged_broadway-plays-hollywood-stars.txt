Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and follow the instructions strictly. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. **Primary reason for favoring plays with stars over musicals**: The article mentions that producers think plays with celebrities are more likely to profit than musicals, which are expensive. So the answer is about lower financial risk and better profit chances for plays.

2. **Economic rationale for preferring short-run plays**: The article says musicals cost more (over $20M) and plays less (under half), so lower investment risk. Even if returns are lower, theyâ€™re safer. The answer should link lower costs to higher profitability likelihood.

3. **Clooney's debut timing significance**: The article connects it to Hollywood focusing on franchises and actors seeking challenging roles. So his debut is part of the trend of stars moving to Broadway for better stories and visibility.

4. **Cost vs profitability paradox**: Plays cost less (under $10M vs $20M+ for musicals) but have lower upside. Musicals can return more if successful, but plays are safer. The paradox is lower cost means easier profit, even if max returns are smaller.

5. **Decline in scripted TV and Broadway stars**: The article states that with networks and streaming cutting scripted shows, stars turn to theater for challenging stories. So the connection is that reduced TV options push them to Broadway.

6. **Financial structure and star commitment**: The article mentions stars need to commit at least four months; producers show them recoupment charts. The structure (base + percentage) requires longer runs to be profitable, hence the need for commitment.

7. **Actor playing AI-obsessed author**: The first paragraph says Robert Downey Jr. is doing "McNeal" as an AI novelist. So his name is the answer.

8. **2025 pairing from slacker comedy**: Bill & Ted stars Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter are doing "Waiting for Godot" in 2025. Their pairing is the answer.

9. **Producer doubling down after success**: Greg Nobile's Seaview had success with Jeremy Strong's play and is doing "Romeo and Juliet" and Clooney's play now. So Greg Nobile is the answer.

10. **Financial threshold for musicals**: The article mentions a new musical like "Boop!" (Betty Boop) is capitalized up to $26M. The threshold is over $20M, with the example given as $26M.

Let me check each question again to ensure I didn't miss any details. All answers are directly from the article, no inferences beyond what's stated. If any question requires a specific figure or exact term not present, I should put N/A, but in this case, all seem covered.
