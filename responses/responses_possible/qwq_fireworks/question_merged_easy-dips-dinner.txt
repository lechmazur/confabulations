Okay, let me start by going through each question one by one and check the article for the answers.

1. The first question asks about the primary reason the tomato and yogurt dip is no-cook even if a step might be considered cooking. The article mentions that the bread is toasted, but they asked colleagues who say toasting isn't cooking. So the answer is that toasting bread isn't considered cooking.

2. The second question is about the cheesy green chile bean bake being at the intersection of enchiladas verdes and chile con queso. The ingredients listed are pinto beans, poblanos, salsa verde, cilantro, and Monterey Jack cheese. Salsa verde and enchiladas verdes both use green sauce, while chile con queso is a cheese dip. So the combination is pinto beans, salsa verde, and Monterey Jack cheese.

3. The third question refers to Hetty's tzatziki chickpea salad blurring dip and salad. The article says it's a conundrum because if dip acts as dressing, it's hard to tell where dip ends and salad starts. So the answer is that the tzatziki is used as a dressing for the salad, making it ambiguous.

4. The fourth question connects TikTok cucumber salad trends to Iceland's cucumber shortage. The article states Icelandic news blames the TikTok trend for the shortage. So the implied relationship is that the trend caused increased demand leading to the shortage.

5. Automation in restaurants conflicting with dining experience: The article mentions that while tech promises cost savings, restaurants are about feelings, not just QR codes etc. So the conflict is that automation might reduce the human touch.

6. Melissa Clark's skillet eggs blur meal categories because it's described as dip for dinner but also breakfast. The article says it's dip for dinner and breakfast, so it's used in different meal times.

7. The recipe with least cooking but some heat is the cherry tomato labneh. They simmer tomatoes on stove and then oven for 30 mins. That's minimal cooking compared to others like the bean bake which has more steps. So that's the answer.

8. The ingredient central to both a dip and the TikTok trend is cucumbers, since the shortage in Iceland is due to cucumber salad recipes on TikTok.

9. The labneh dip requires a pot for simmering and oven, but the appliance implied is a stove (for heating olive oil) and oven. The question asks for one appliance, probably the stove.

10. The dish described with two cuisines is the cheesy green chile bean bake, which is at the intersection of enchiladas verdes (Mexican) and chile con queso (Tex-Mex). So the terminology from both cuisines highlights fusion.

Now I need to check each answer against the text to ensure accuracy and that there's no external info. Let me verify each point again quickly.

1. The article says toasting bread isn't cooking per the survey. Correct.

2. The ingredients listed for the bean bake include those mentioned. Yes.

3. The article's wording is exactly about the conundrum of dip as dressing. Correct.

4. Directly stated. Yes.

5. The article says tech can't replace the feelings aspect. Correct.

6. The recipe is for both dinner and breakfast. Yes.

7. The labneh uses minimal cooking steps. Correct.

8. Cucumbers. Yes.

9. Stove and oven, but the question says "implied but not mentioned". The article says "simmer... on stove, then oven". So stove is implied. Answer is stove.

10. Enchiladas verdes (Mexican) and chile con queso (Tex-Mex fusion). Correct.

I think that covers all questions. Now format them properly.
