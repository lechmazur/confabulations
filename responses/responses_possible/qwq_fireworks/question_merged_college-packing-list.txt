Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let's go through each question carefully.

1. The first question asks about an item that's both nostalgic and a communication tool for emergencies. The article mentions an AT&T card as a "kind of sight gag" (nostalgic) and a lifeline for emergencies. So that's probably the answer.

2. The food item linked to safety and community is pizza. The article talks about midnight pizza facilitating community-building by attracting people with its scent.

3. The legal document for teenagers is the health care power of attorney, given as a graduation gift by Shari George Polur. It's usually associated with older adults but suggested here for teens.

4. The personal item that became emotional support was the handwritten notes from Chanel Reynolds. Her son found them and they provided confidence.

5. The problematic parental action that encourages independence might be the "tether to home" mentioned by Julie Lythcott-Haims. But the article says doing too much can hinder independence. Wait, the question says the action is paradoxically suggested as a method. The expert warns against thick tethers, but the article still suggests some items. Maybe the authorized user card? Or the health care forms? Hmm, the example given is the "get-out-of-jail-free" card (AT&T card) which is a parental action that could be seen as supportive but the expert warns against overdoing. Wait, the answer might be the "rain of sadness" via constant calls, but the question is about an action that's paradoxically suggested. The article says to ask for regular calls gently. Wait, the fifth question says "parental action... problematic by expert... suggested as method to encourage independence". The expert says overdoing help is bad, but the article suggests some items. The "authorized user card" might be an example, but the answer might be the "get-out-of-jail-free" card (AT&T card) because the expert warns against too much help, but the article suggests giving the card as a way to encourage them to call first, thus promoting independence by having a safety net. Alternatively, the health care documents could be seen as interfering but necessary. Wait the exact problematic action that's suggested is maybe the "authorized user card" since it's a credit tool but used as emergency. Alternatively, the "AT&T card" with instructions to call first. Let me check the text again. The expert says when the tether is too thick, kids don't form bonds. The article's suggestions include the card that's a "get-out-of-jail-free" card. The action here is giving that card, which could be seen as overstepping but actually encourages them to reach out. So the answer is the AT&T card and the get-out-of-jail-free offer. The question is which action is problematic but suggested. The answer is the "get-out-of-jail-free card" (the AT&T card with the script about calling first). So the answer is the AT&T card and the get-out-of-jail-free offer. The question asks for the action, so maybe "fronting bail money" or the "get-out-of-jail-free" idea. The article says the card can be an "get-out-of-jail free one, too." So the action is providing that, which the expert might see as overstepping but the article suggests it. So the answer is "fronting some bail money or funds for fines" but the question says "parental action... suggested as method to encourage independence". Alternatively, the expert's point is that too much help hinders independence, but the article's advice is to have the card so they call first, which encourages them to take responsibility by reaching out. The action here is providing the card and the script. The question's answer is likely the "get-out-of-jail-free card" or the AT&T card with that offer. The exact wording in the article is "the calling card can be an get-out-of-jail free one, too." So the action is giving that card, which is the answer.

6. The linguistic tool for balancing concern and independence is the "safe word". The article mentions a safe word children can use to signal they want to talk without judgment.

7. The outdated communication method is the pay phone card. The article says buying an old AT&T card as a gag but also a reminder to call first in emergencies.

8. The legal document for end-of-life planning but suggested for young adults is the health care power of attorney. That's the same as question 3, so that's correct.

9. The board game phrase repurposed is "get-out-of-jail-free", used in the context of the card allowing help with legal issues.

10. The intrusive parental action that fosters independence might be leaving handwritten notes (traces of oneself). The expert warns against over-involvement, but leaving notes gives support without being intrusive. Alternatively, the digital documents folder with medical info could be seen as intrusive but helps them manage. The article mentions "traces of yourself" like notes, which are a personal touch but might be seen as intrusive. The question says "parental action described as potentially intrusive, paradoxically recommended to foster independence". The traces of self (notes) are a way to stay connected without overstepping. So the answer is leaving handwritten notes or the digital documents. The article says Chanel Reynolds left notes which her son found, providing emotional support. So the action is leaving traces like notes. The question's answer is "leaving handwritten notes" or "traces of yourself".

Now, checking each question again for exact terms:

1. AT&T card (as pay phone card) is the nostalgic item and the communication tool. The answer is "AT&T card" or "calling card".

2. Pizza.

3. Health care power of attorney.

4. Handwritten notes.

5. The action is giving the "get-out-of-jail-free" card (the AT&T card with the script to call first, allowing bail money). The answer is "fronting bail money" but the question asks for the action. The article says "the calling card can be an get-out-of-jail free one, too." So the action is providing the card with that offer, which is the "get-out-of-jail-free card".

6. Safe word.

7. The outdated method is the pay phone card/AT&T card.

8. Health care power of attorney.

9. "get-out-of-jail-free".

10. The action is leaving handwritten notes or "traces of yourself". The article says leaving notes is the trace, so "leaving handwritten notes".

Let me check each question again:

Question 5: The expert (Lythcott-Haims) says overdoing help is bad, but the article suggests the get-out-of-jail card as a way to encourage them to call, which might help independence. The action is giving that card and script, so the answer is "providing a get-out-of-jail-free card" or "fronting bail money" but the question asks for the action. The article's exact wording for the problematic action is the "tether to home", but the suggested action here is the card. The answer is the "get-out-of-jail-free card".

Question 10: The action is "leaving handwritten notes" as traces of oneself. The article says that's a parental action (Chanel did it) which could be seen as intrusive (if the child feels smothered) but it actually supports their independence by giving emotional support without overstepping. So the answer is "leaving handwritten notes".
