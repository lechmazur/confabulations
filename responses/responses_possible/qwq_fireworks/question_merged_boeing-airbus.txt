Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the strict format.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks about the specific event that led to the management shake-up resulting in Kelly Ortberg becoming CEO. The article mentions "the January incident" where a panel blew off a Max jet. That's the key event. So the answer is the January 2023 panel blowout incident.

2. **Question 2:** If A321XLR hadn't gotten over 500 orders, Boeing's strategic advantage might be their own similar project. The article says Boeing shelved a project like the A321XLR after the Max crashes. So if Airbus didn't have those orders, Boeing's shelved project (the one they canceled) might have been their advantage. But since they canceled it, they don't have that now. The answer would be that Boeing had a similar project before, but since they shelved it, maybe that's the advantage they lost. Wait, the question is hypothetical: if Airbus didn't have the orders, Boeing's advantage would be... the article states Boeing "shelved that project," so if it hadn't been shelved, maybe that's the answer. But the question is about Boeing's current advantage if Airbus's didn't get the orders. Hmm. Alternatively, the answer might be that Boeing had a project before, so if Airbus's didn't have the orders, Boeing could have that as an advantage. The article says "Boeing does not have an answer" now. So the strategic advantage would have been their own similar plane (the one they shelved). So the answer is the shelved project (maybe the 737 Max variant? The article says Boeing was working on a similar plane but shelved it). The exact wording is "Boeing had been working on a similar plane, but the company shelved that project as it dealt with fallout from the Max crashes." So the answer is the shelved project (the similar plane to A321XLR). But the question is phrased as "if Airbus's A321XLR had not secured over 500 orders, what might have been Boeing's strategic advantage..." So the answer is that Boeing had a similar plane project before shelving it. Therefore, the answer is "Boeing's shelved project (similar to A321XLR)" but the article doesn't name it. Wait, the article just says "a similar plane" so maybe the answer is that Boeing had a similar plane project, which would be their advantage. The question is phrased as "strategic advantage in the single-aisle market"â€”so the answer is the shelved project. But since the question is hypothetical, and the article says Boeing shelved it, so the answer is that Boeing had a similar plane (the project they shelved). But the exact name isn't given. The article says "Boeing had been working on a similar plane, but the company shelved that project..." so the answer is that Boeing had a similar plane (the project they shelved) which would have been their strategic advantage. But the question is asking what the advantage would be if Airbus's didn't have those orders. So the answer is the shelved project (the similar plane). Since the article doesn't name it, but refers to it as "a similar plane", the answer is "a similar plane (shelved project)" but maybe the answer is "the 737 Max variant" since that's the plane they were working on? Wait, the Max crashes were on the 737 Max. The article says Boeing was working on a similar plane to the A321XLR, which is a variant of the A321neo. The 737 Max includes variants like the Max 10. The article mentions the Max 10 as Boeing's answer to the A321neo. Wait, the article says: "the Max 10, the largest Max variant and Boeing's answer to the popular A321neo, has yet to be approved". So the Max 10 is their current answer. But earlier, the article says Boeing had a similar plane project but shelved it. Wait, maybe the shelved project is different? Let me check again. The exact sentence: "Boeing had been working on a similar plane, but the company shelved that project as it dealt with fallout from the Max crashes." The "similar plane" to the A321XLR. But the Max 10 is still being worked on. So perhaps the shelved project was another one, but the article doesn't name it. Since the question is about Boeing's strategic advantage if Airbus's didn't get the orders, the answer would be the shelved project, but since the article doesn't name it, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait no, the article says "Boeing had been working on a similar plane" so the existence of that project is the strategic advantage. So the answer is "Boeing's shelved project (similar plane)". But the question is phrased as "if Airbus's A321XLR had not secured over 500 orders, what might have been Boeing's strategic advantage...", so the answer is that Boeing had a similar plane (the shelved project) which would be their advantage. Since the article doesn't name it beyond "similar plane", maybe the answer is "the shelved project" or just "a similar plane project". The exact wording in the article: "Boeing had been working on a similar plane, but the company shelved that project..." So the answer is "the shelved project (similar plane)" but maybe just "a similar plane project". Alternatively, maybe the answer is "the Max 10" because that's Boeing's current answer to the A321neo. But the article says the Max 10 hasn't been approved yet. Hmm. Wait the question is hypothetical: if Airbus's plane didn't have those orders, Boeing's advantage would be... since they shelved the similar project, perhaps they have nothing? But the article says the Max 10 is their answer. The question is phrased as "if Airbus's A321XLR had not secured over 500 orders, what might have been Boeing's strategic advantage..." So maybe Boeing's Max 10 would be their advantage, but since the Max 10 is still pending approval, perhaps the answer is N/A? Or maybe the shelved project was an advantage but they canceled it. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The article states that Boeing's answer is the Max 10, but they shelved another project (the similar plane to the A321XLR). Wait, maybe the A321XLR is a variant of the A321neo, so the Max 10 is Boeing's answer. The article says "the Max 10... has yet to be approved". So if Airbus didn't have the 500 orders, Boeing's advantage would be their Max 10 (if approved), but since it's pending, maybe the answer is N/A? Alternatively, the article says "Boeing does not have an answer" now, implying that without the A321XLR's success, maybe the Max 10 would be their answer. But the question is phrased as "if Airbus's didn't secure the orders, what would Boeing's advantage be?" So the answer would be the Max 10, but since it's not approved, maybe they don't have an advantage. Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe the answer is N/A because the article doesn't state what Boeing's advantage would be in that scenario beyond the shelved project. Alternatively, since the article says Boeing shelved a similar plane, perhaps their advantage would be that project if it wasn't shelved. But the question is about current strategic advantage if Airbus's didn't have the orders. Since Boeing doesn't have an active project (they shelved it and the Max 10 is pending), maybe the answer is N/A. Wait the article says "Boeing does not have an answer" to the A321XLR. So the answer to question 2 is that if Airbus didn't have the orders, Boeing's advantage would be their shelved project. But the article doesn't explicitly say that. Alternatively, maybe the answer is N/A because the question is hypothetical and the article doesn't discuss that scenario. Hmm. Let me check the exact question again. The question is: "If Airbus's A321XLR had not secured over 500 orders, what might have been Boeing's strategic advantage in the single-aisle market?" The article states that Boeing had a similar plane project but shelved it. So if Airbus didn't have the orders, Boeing's advantage would have been their own project (even if shelved?), but they canceled it. Alternatively, maybe the Max 10 is the answer. The article says "the Max 10... is Boeing's answer to the popular A321neo". Since the A321XLR is a variant of the A321neo, the Max 10 would be the answer. So maybe the answer is "the Max 10" even though it's not approved yet. The question is about strategic advantage if Airbus's didn't get the orders. So Boeing's advantage would be their Max 10. The article says they have the Max 10 as an answer, so that's the strategic advantage. Therefore, the answer is "the Max 10". But the article says "has yet to be approved", so it's not yet available. But the question is about strategic advantage, which could be the existence of the project. So the answer is "the Max 10".

3. **Question 3:** The underlying factor connecting supply chain issues for both companies despite differing production rates. The article mentions "the supply chain that supports both can suffer" and "delays in receiving parts from suppliers". The common factor is the supply chain issues with parts and engine shortages, and the pandemic-related worker experience loss. The exact sentence: "the problem is a bottleneck in the delivery of parts, including engines, and industrywide difficulty in replacing the years of experience lost after workers retired early -- or were laid off -- during the pandemic." So the underlying factor is the shared supply chain (parts and engines) and the pandemic's impact on workforce experience. The answer should be "shared supply chain issues (parts, engines, and pandemic-related workforce experience loss)".

4. **Question 4:** The connection between Boeing's quality improvements and meeting FAA's production limit. The FAA limited Boeing to 38 Max jets/month until they proved quality improvements. The article says "Boeing is producing 20 to 30 a month, but has said it aims to reach the F.A.A. limit by the end of the year." So quality improvements are needed to lift the FAA restriction. The connection is that quality improvements are required to meet the FAA's limit. The answer is "quality improvements are required to lift the FAA's production cap".

5. **Question 5:** How does Spirit AeroSystems acquisition align with Boeing's quality strategy? The article says Boeing is acquiring Spirit to gain control over production. The answer is "vertical integration to improve quality control by owning a key supplier".

6. **Question 6:** How does FAA's production limit impact Boeing's competition with A321XLR? Since the FAA restricts Boeing to 38/month but they're making 20-30, they can't produce as much as needed to compete. The A321XLR has 500 orders. So the answer is "limits production capacity, hindering competition with Airbus's A321XLR".

7. **Question 7:** Impact of Spirit AeroSystems acquisition on future plane development. The article says Boeing is working on future planes like the 777-9. Acquiring a supplier would help in developing future planes by having better control. The answer is "enables better control over production for future planes like the 777-9".

8. **Question 8:** Experience loss during pandemic affecting production. The article states "industrywide difficulty in replacing the years of experience lost after workers retired early -- or were laid off -- during the pandemic." So the answer is "loss of experienced workers from pandemic-era retirements/laid-offs".

9. **Question 9:** The aircraft with over 500 orders that Boeing has no answer for. The article says "the A321XLR already has more than 500 orders" and "Boeing does not have an answer". So the answer is "A321XLR".

10. **Question 10:** Main production challenge for both companies. The article says both face "industrywide difficulty in replacing the years of experience lost" and "bottleneck in the delivery of parts". So the main challenge is "supply chain bottlenecks and workforce experience shortages".
