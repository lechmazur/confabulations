Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and don't infer anything beyond what's written.

1. The first question asks about an agricultural product facing economic pressure due to land use. The article mentions Edling Farms, which deals with potatoes. It says farmers are losing leases because solar companies pay more. So the answer is potatoes.

2. The next question is about a material linked to wealth that's diminishing. The article talks about coal's decline. Since coal was once a major energy source, and the town's consumption was in pounds per hour, the answer is coal.

3. The third question refers to a century-old family business losing land to a project using an element in pots and pans. The Edling Farms are mentioned as a family business for over a century. The project is solar, which uses iron in the battery systems. Iron is in pots and pans, so the family is Edling.

4. The fourth question is about a lawn object protesting against a change related to a 40% energy goal. The article mentions a "Save Our Sherco" sign opposing the transition. The 40% comes from the solar goal, so the object is a lawn sign.

5. The fifth question asks a company named after a math symbol (like a variable) installing a system using common elements. Form Energy's name might relate to 'form' but maybe 'Form' as a letter? Wait, the question says a letter symbolizing an unknown variable. 'Form' isn't a letter, but maybe the answer is Form Energy. The system uses iron, water, air, so the company is Form Energy.

6. The sixth question connects an element in both the body and the storage system. The storage system uses iron. Iron is in the human body (hemoglobin), so the answer is iron.

7. The seventh question is a geological feature weighing millions of tons, representing both industry and transition. The article mentions a coal stockpile of 1.9 million tons. That's the feature, so coal stockpile.

8. The eighth question: a company named after precision, central to the transition, closed a fraction of coal units. Xcel Energy's CEO is mentioned, and they closed 24 out of 36 units. Precision might refer to "Excel" as in precision, so Xcel Energy.

9. The ninth question: energy source described with a color and precious metal term (like "black gold") replaced by solar. The article mentions coal as "black gold," so the answer is coal.

10. The last question is about a legal agreement more lucrative with celestial energy companies. Farmers used leases, now solar companies pay more. The agreement is a lease.
