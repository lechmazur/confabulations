Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one based solely on the article provided. Let me start by going through each question and cross-referencing the article to find the answers.

1. **Question 1**: How does the article suggest the relationship dynamics in Otto and Sophie's book parallel gentrification in Brooklyn? The article mentions Otto and Sophie are gentrifiers in Brooklyn. Their marriage's stability crumbles, similar to the gentrifying area. So the parallel is their marriage's instability mirroring the changing neighborhood.

2. **Question 2**: The phrase "Madame Bovary, c'est moi" is used in the context of Flaubert's novel. The article says the novel's appeal is in judging others while recognizing that line, so the phrase shows the universal human aspect of the characters' flaws, making readers see themselves in Emma.

3. **Question 3**: Edward and Florence's wedding night is described as where their pasts and expectations collide. The article states their reflections decades later show exploration of intimacy and expectations through that night's painful realities.

4. **Question 4**: The gentrification theme in Otto and Sophie's story is linked to their marriage's stability. Since they're gentrifiers and their ordered life crumbles, gentrification's instability mirrors their marital issues.

5. **Question 5**: The feral cat bite causes their ordered existence to crumble. The article directly states the bite leads to the unraveling, so it's the catalyst exploring how small events affect marriage stability.

6. **Question 6**: Dr. Guralnik's physical appearance (glossy mane and tiny braids) is a message board discussion point. The article implies her looks contributed to the show's appeal, hence part of the show's success factors.

7. **Question 7**: Shane is a novelist, Eva writes erotica; they reconnect in Brooklyn's Black literary scene. The article mentions they're prey to gossip and pressures from their milieu, showing their professional identities and scene influence their relationship.

8. **Question 8**: The cat bite is the unexpected event that starts their unraveling. The article clearly states Sophie's bite leads to their ordered life crumbling.

9. **Question 9**: The uncle's spice business success in Bangalore changes the protagonist's life, leading to generational bond fraying. The article compares this to gentrification's impact, so the business success parallels economic shifts akin to gentrification.

10. **Question 10**: Dr. Guralnik's hairstyle (glossy mane and braids) is discussed online, similar to the kitchen renovation being a focal point. The question asks which character's hairstyle, so the answer is Dr. Guralnik's.

Now, I need to ensure each answer is directly from the text. Let me check each again quickly.
