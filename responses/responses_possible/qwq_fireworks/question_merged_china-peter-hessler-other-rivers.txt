Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let's start with question 1: What specific aspect of the Chinese political system does Peter Hessler believe must change?

Looking at the article, there's a part where Hessler says, "something fundamental about the country's political system must change." The question asks for the specific aspect. The text mentions that he believes the political system must change because young people are dissatisfied but not ready to initiate change. The answer here is that the political system must change fundamentally.

Question 2: The significance of the Animal Farm characters. The students identified with the donkey (skeptical but silent) and the horse (hardworking but blindly loyal). The article states this reflects their views on the system—willing to work but not resist, so the significance is showing their compliance and silence despite doubts.

Question 3: The paradox is between economic/social changes and political stagnation. The article mentions China's transformation in population, economy, height increase, but politics stayed the same. The paradox is that society opened up while politics didn't.

Question 4: The underlying message on consequences. Hessler says once you break the system without knowing what comes next, you get instability. So the consequence is potential instability.

Question 5: Zero-Covid and evolving perspectives. The text says students were angry about lockdowns and some started to think demonstrations are needed. So their views shifted towards considering protests despite risks.

Question 6: Assigning Animal Farm shows Hessler wants students to reflect on the system. By having them relate to characters, he might be trying to get them to think critically about their political environment.

Question 7: The transformation challenges the idea that economic development leads to political change. The article says China's economy boomed but politics stayed stagnant, so it shows that political change isn't a natural result.

Question 8: The implication of dissatisfaction but no action is that there's a risk of instability if the system doesn't adapt. Hessler mentions that not knowing the future could lead to instability.

Question 9: The 1996 students were part of the "reform generation" believing in competition. The horse (loyal worker) might represent them, but wait, the students in 2020s identified with the donkey and horse. The 1996 students were more hopeful. The article doesn't explicitly link 1996 to a character. Hmm, maybe N/A? Wait, the question asks which character represents the 1996 students. The text says the 2020s students identified with donkey and horse. The 1996 students were the reform generation who believed in hard work. The horse is hardworking, so maybe the horse represents the 1996 students. But the article says the Xi generation (2020s) identified with those characters. The 1996 students might be more like the ones who believed in the system. Wait, the horse is "hardworking but blindly loyal"—maybe the 1996 students were more into the system, so the horse. The donkey is skeptical but silent. Since the 1996 were reformers, maybe not. Hmm, maybe the question is tricky. Since the 1996 students are the reform generation, maybe they don't match the characters mentioned for the later students. The question asks which character represents the 1996 students. Since the text doesn't directly link them to the characters, maybe N/A? But the article only mentions the 2020s students identifying with those characters. So the answer would be N/A? Wait, but the question is asking for the 1996 students. The article doesn't say they identified with any character, so N/A.

Question 10: The paradox between economic transformation and political system is the same as question 3. The paradox is economic growth with stagnant politics. So same as question 3's answer.

Wait, let me check each again.

1. <answer>Fundamental change in the political system</answer>

2. <answer>Reflects their compliance and silent skepticism towards the system</answer>

3. <answer>Economic/social openness contrasted with stagnant/regressive politics</answer>

4. <answer>Potential instability from uncertainty about the future</answer>

5. <answer>Increased willingness to seek rights through demonstrations</answer>

6. <answer>Encouraging critical reflection on the political system</answer>

7. <answer>Showcases that political change isn't inevitable despite economic progress</answer>

8. <answer>Risk of instability if system doesn't adapt despite dissatisfaction</answer>

9. <answer>N/A</answer> (since 1996 students aren't linked to a character in the text)

10. <answer>Economic transformation coexists with unchanging political system</answer>

Wait for question 9 again. The students in 2020s identified with donkey and horse. The 1996 students were part of the reform generation who believed in competition and were rewarded. The article says the Xi generation (2020s) are the ones with the characters. The question is about the 1996 students. Since the article doesn't mention them identifying with any character, answer is N/A. So that's correct.

Okay, I think that's all. Now format each question with tags.
