Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions that Kamala Harris resisted emphasizing the "first woman president" angle, unlike Hillary Clinton in 2016. So the answer is that Harris's campaign doesn't focus on being the first woman, unlike previous candidates.

2. **Question 2:** The article says Harris wore a camel-colored suit and had an "expansive and effusive" energy, contrasting with Trump's style. The attire and her demeanor reflect her campaign's energy as more inclusive and energetic.

3. **Question 3:** The in-room response had Nancy Pelosi with a "We Heart Joe" sign, while Fox News's Sean Hannity called Biden's exit a "political coup." So the contrasting reaction is Hannity's sympathy vs. Pelosi's support.

4. **Question 4:** The article compares Harris's "happy-warrior style" to Biden's "shouty, fierce" style. Wait, the question is about Harris vs. Trump. Wait, no—the question says "incumbent she's running against," which is Trump. The article says Harris's energy is "expansive and effusive" vs. Trump's "brassy and bold." So the answer is Harris's energy is expansive/effusive vs. Trump's brassy/bold.

5. **Question 5:** Mallory McMorrow mentioned "Project 2025" as Trump's blueprint. The article states that directly.

6. **Question 6:** Hillary Clinton compared Harris to herself, noting Trump mocked Harris's name and laugh, which was familiar to her experience.

7. **Question 7:** Biden's speech was "shouty, fierce," while Harris's is "happy-warrior style." So the answer is Biden's was shouty/fierce, Harris's is happy-warrior.

8. **Question 8:** The slogans were "For the People, For the Future," emphasizing newness. The article says the slogans highlighted newness.

9. **Question 9:** Harris's energy is described as "expansive and effusive" compared to Trump's "brassy and bold." So the answer is Harris's energy is expansive/effusive, contrasting with Trump's style.

10. **Question 10:** The song was Beyoncé's "Freedom," mentioned when Harris appeared.

Wait, let me double-check each to ensure all are directly from the text. For question 4, the question specifies the incumbent she's running against, which is Trump. The article says Harris's energy had "a different energy: expansive and effusive rather than brassy and bold" compared to Trump. So that's correct. 

Question 3: The article says Fox News's Hannity called Biden's exit a "political coup," while in the room, Pelosi had the sign. So the answer is Hannity's comment versus the in-room response.

All answers are directly from the text. Let's format them as per instructions.
