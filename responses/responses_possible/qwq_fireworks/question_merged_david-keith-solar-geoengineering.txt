Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the strict format.

1. **Question 1:** The central figure (David Keith) suggests spraying a pollutant (sulfur dioxide) into the sky to block sunlight to return the planet to a preindustrial state. The paradox is using a pollutant to fix climate change. The answer should be spraying sulfur dioxide.

2. **Question 2:** David Keith thinks the risks are manageable and benefits outweigh them. Raymond Pierrehumbert considers it a grave threat and even research is dangerous. The contrast is Keith sees risks as small compared to benefits, while Pierrehumbert sees it as a major threat.

3. **Question 3:** His 1992 paper raised questions about governance (who authorizes, liability), which critics now bring up regarding solar geoengineering's governance issues. The connection is the paper's focus on governance concerns that are still relevant.

4. **Question 4:** His observations of natural changes (like glacier shrinkage) motivate his push for geoengineering. The article mentions his hike seeing a shrinking glacier reinforced his belief in needing drastic action.

5. **Question 5:** His personal gain was $72M from Carbon Engineering sale. His new program at UChicago could cost up to $100M. The comparison is his windfall is part of the program's funding but the program's total is higher.

6. **Question 6:** The birthday hike's glacier shrinkage motivated him more to push solar geo. The text says it confirmed his belief that drastic action is needed.

7. **Question 7:** He supports reducing fossil fuels but also advocates solar geo as a supplementary solution. The stance is he agrees to stop fossil fuels but adds geoengineering as an extra measure.

8. **Question 8:** Dyslexia delayed reading, but once he could read, he became a voracious reader, leading to his academic path. The article links dyslexia to late reading, but his later academic success in physics is mentioned.

9. **Question 9:** After Scopex was called off due to protests, he admitted needing less openness next time. This contrasts with his previous openness, implying he thinks transparency caused issues.

10. **Question 10:** Pierrehumbert says termination shock could cause a sudden temperature rise, like after a meteor impact. The text quotes him mentioning "massive temperature rise over 5-10 years, akin to dinosaur-killing impact."

Need to check each answer against the text to ensure accuracy and that no external knowledge is used. Also, confirm that each question is directly answered without adding extra info.
