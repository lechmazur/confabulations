Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and answer each question exactly as asked without adding any extra details.

1. **Question 1**: How does the expectation of older men in Shanghai for younger partners affect the success rate of women like Ma Guoying and Zhang Xiaolan in finding companionship?  
   The article mentions that older men prefer younger women, and both Ma and Zhang are in their 60s and haven't found men. So their success is hindered because men want younger partners. The answer should be "Their success is hindered."

2. **Question 2**: Economic background influencing approach. Xu Xiaoduo mentions his pension ($1,250) and dancing, Li Zhiming talks about his own apartment and pension. Their financial stability might make them more confident or have specific expectations. The article doesn't explicitly say it influences their approach, so maybe N/A? Wait, the question is about how their economic background affects their approach. Since they mention their pensions and assets, perhaps it's part of how they present themselves. Answer: "They highlight financial stability as part of their profile."

3. **Question 3**: Liu Qiyu's role in illustrating a misconception. The article says Liu isn't looking for a partner himself, just explaining that the park became a spot because parents who helped kids now do it themselves. The misconception might be that everyone is there to find a partner, but some aren't. Answer: "He clarifies he isn't seeking a partner himself, showing not all attendees are actively looking."

4. **Question 4**: People's Park's use to draw parallels between older adults and younger. The park's marriage market for parents helping kids is mentioned, and older adults use the same space. The parallel is both groups are seeking matches, one for kids, one for themselves. Answer: "Parents seek matches for children while older adults seek their own partners in the same space."

5. **Question 5**: Zheng Yue challenging stereotypes about older women. She says women are brave to take the first step, countering the idea that they're not proactive. Answer: "She emphasizes women's bravery in initiating relationships."

6. **Question 6**: Li Zhiming's past decisions impacting current interactions. His ex-wife left him in 1996, so his current loneliness and search stem from that. Answer: "His past divorce drives his current search for companionship."

7. **Question 7**: Volunteer at People's Park mentioning pension and dancing. Xu Xiaoduo is the one who talks about his pension and dancing. Answer: "Xu Xiaoduo."

8. **Question 8**: Ikea participant skeptical of online dating with a smartphone. Li Zhiming says online dating isn't reliable. Answer: "Li Zhiming."

9. **Question 9**: Attendee with distinctive eyewear explaining motivation. Ma Guoying wears large round glasses and mentions staying active to prevent mental decline. Answer: "Ma Guoying."

10. **Question 10**: Participant specifying physical and personality traits. Zheng Yue wants a man who's knowledgeable, sensible, etc., and maybe physical? Wait, the article says she wants someone "knowledgeable, sensible, mature, stable, amiable and kind." No physical traits. Wait, the question asks for both. Hmm. Wait, Li Zhiming wanted a "young and beautiful" woman, which includes physical. Zheng Yue's answer only has personality. The question says "specifies both physical and personality traits". Looking back: Zheng Yue's ideal is all personality. Li Zhiming's desired partner is "young and beautiful" (physical) plus he offers to cook. So Li Zhiming is the one? Wait, the question is about the participant who specifies both. The user might have meant Zheng Yue? Wait, no. The question says "specifies both physical and personality traits in their ideal partner." Zheng Yue's traits are all personality. Li Zhiming's desired partner has physical (young and beautiful) but he's the suitor. Wait, Zheng Yue's ideal is all personality. The article says: "Someone, she added, whom she could 'hold hands with for a lifetime.'" So maybe Zheng Yue's answer is personality. Li Zhiming wants a woman who is young and beautiful (physical) plus maybe he's looking for other traits? The question asks which participant specifies both. The answer might be Li Zhiming, since he wants "young and beautiful" (physical) and perhaps the rest is personality? Or maybe another? Wait, the article says Li Zhiming wanted a woman who was "young and beautiful." So physical. But he also mentions he can cook and take care of her. But the question is about the ideal partner's traits. So Li Zhiming specifies physical traits. Zheng Yue's ideal has no physical. The question asks for someone who specifies both. Hmm. Wait, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says Zheng Yue is looking for a man with those traits (knowledgeable, etc.), which are personality. Li Zhiming is looking for a woman with physical traits. The question is about the participant who specifies both. Maybe no one? Wait, the article says: "Ms. Zheng, ... is looking for a man who is 'knowledgeable, sensible, mature, stable, amiable and kind.' Someone, she added, whom she could 'hold hands with for a lifetime.'" So that's all personality. Li Zhiming says he wants a woman who's "young and beautiful" (physical) plus maybe other things. The question asks for someone who specifies both physical and personality. The only person with both might be Li Zhiming's desired partner (young and beautiful, but that's just physical). Wait, maybe the answer is N/A? But the question says "the participant" so perhaps the person's own traits? Wait no. Wait the question says "their ideal partner". Let me check again. Zheng Yue's ideal partner's traits are all personality. Li Zhiming's desired partner's traits are physical (young and beautiful). So no one specifies both. Therefore, the answer would be N/A? But the question says "the participant at Ikea". Wait, maybe the answer is Zheng Yue? No, she only mentions personality. Wait, maybe the question refers to someone else? Wait, looking back: the article mentions "Li Zhiming, 69, ... wanted to find a woman who was 'young and beautiful.'" So that's physical. But the question asks for someone who specifies both. Since the article doesn't mention any participant specifying both, the answer would be N/A. Wait but the question is part of the given questions, so maybe I missed someone. Let me check again. Zheng Yue's traits are all personality. Li Zhiming's desired partner has physical traits. The article says "Li Zhiming ... promised to cook and take care of her." That's about his own traits, not the partner's. So no, the partner's traits are only physical. So the answer is N/A? Or perhaps the question refers to someone else. Wait the article says: "Zheng Yue ... looking for a man who is 'knowledgeable, sensible, mature, stable, amiable and kind.'" That's all personality. The only person who mentions physical is Li Zhiming. So the answer must be N/A. Wait but the question says "specifies both physical and personality traits in their ideal partner". Since no one does that, the answer is N/A. But maybe I'm missing someone. Wait the question might be referring to Li Zhiming's own traits? No, the question is about the ideal partner. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the participant's own traits. Wait no, the question says "their ideal partner". So I think the answer is N/A. But let me check again. Wait, the question says "specifies both physical and personality traits in their ideal partner". The only one with any is Li Zhiming (physical) and Zheng Yue (personality). So no one has both. So the answer is N/A? But the question is part of the given questions, so maybe I missed something. Wait, the article says "Li Zhiming ... wanted to find a woman who was 'young and beautiful.' In exchange, he promised to cook and take care of her." So he's specifying his own traits (can cook) but the partner's traits are only physical. So the answer is N/A. But the user might have intended a different answer. Alternatively, maybe the question is looking for someone who mentions both their own traits and the partner's? Not sure. Since the instructions say to answer based on the text, I have to go with N/A unless there's a mention. Alternatively, perhaps Zheng Yue's "hold hands for a lifetime" implies longevity, but that's not physical. Hmm. I'll go with N/A for question 10.
