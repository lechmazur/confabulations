Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and follow the instructions strictly. Let's start with question 1.

1. The question asks for the primary reason that selling 7-Eleven to Couche-Tard is like Toyota becoming foreign. The article mentions that 7-Eleven is "one of the best brick-and-mortar retail businesses in the world" and that selling it would be equivalent to Toyota becoming foreign. The analyst's point is about national pride and the company being a cornerstone of society, so the primary reason is their cultural and societal importance in Japan. The answer is that 7-Eleven is a cornerstone of Japanese society.

2. The next question is about why the government would scrutinize the acquisition beyond cultural reasons. The article says Seven & i has businesses beyond convenience stores, like banking and carrier services. So the conglomerate structure leads to more scrutiny. The answer is that Seven & i operates in other sectors beyond convenience stores.

3. The third question is about how 7-Eleven's transition from American to Japanese ownership complicates the acquisition. The article states that 7-Eleven became wholly Japanese-owned in 2005. Since it's now Japanese-owned, a foreign takeover now might face resistance similar to when it was originally American. The answer would be that it's now wholly Japanese-owned, making foreign acquisition harder.

4. The fourth question is about differences in operations. The article contrasts Japanese konbini's product development speed and variety with North American stores focusing on snacks and gas. The fast product turnover in Japan might be a challenge for Couche-Tard's strategy. The answer is that Japanese stores have rapid product development and high product turnover compared to North American stores.

5. The fifth question is about cultural significance as a barrier despite pressure. The article says convenience stores are indispensable and part of daily life, so the cultural attachment makes it hard to sell. The answer is that konbini are indispensable to daily life in Japan.

6. For product replacement rates, the article mentions Japanese stores replace 70% of products annually, while North American ones don't. This difference could affect Couche-Tard's strategy. The answer is that Japanese stores replace 70% of products annually, while North American ones don't.

7. The cultural familiarity of food is mentioned with examples like the 23-year-old preferring familiar taste and the man liking the desserts. So the answer is that Japanese customers have a strong preference for familiar tastes.

8. Historical success in Japan is noted as starting in 1974 and becoming a cultural staple. This success makes the company a national treasure, so the answer is that its historical success makes it a national treasure, making foreign takeover hard.

9. The historical transition to Japanese ownership might make the government protective. Since it's now Japanese, the government might resist foreign takeover. The answer is that it is now wholly Japanese-owned, leading to government protection.

10. The analyst compared it to Toyota becoming foreign, and the company trying to acquire is Couche-Tard. The answer is Alimentation Couche-Tard.
