Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly what's asked without any extra fluff. Let me start with question 1.

1. The first question asks how the A.I. system's performance reflects a "phase transition" according to Dr. Kohli. The article mentions Dr. Kohli called the result a "phase transition" in the use of A.I. in mathematics. The key here is that this term refers to a transformative change, so the answer is about the transformative change in using A.I. for math.

2. Dr. Davies talks about math being a litmus test for AGI. The answer should connect solving IMO problems to AGI, which the article states because AGI requires the combination of abstract, precise, and creative reasoning that math tests.

3. Dr. Silver mentions that the A.I. can solve problems without a human teacher, using reinforcement learning. The article says this allows the system to learn by itself and scale, surpassing previous computer limitations. So the answer is that it shows computers can now tackle complex problems beyond simple proofs.

4. The A.I. got a silver medal level by solving four problems. The article directly states it performed at the level of a silver medalist. So the answer is that it's comparable to a silver medalist's level.

5. Dr. Silver highlights the reinforcement learning aspect, which doesn't need a human teacher. The significance here is that the system can learn independently to solve the hardest problems humans can, possibly going beyond.

6. Dr. Gowers mentions that if A.I. can solve IMO problems, research tools might be near. So the benchmark here is that solving these problems indicates potential for tackling research-level math.

7. Dr. Gowers speculates that mathematicians might have nothing to do if computers surpass them, but he thinks it's still far. The implication is that A.I. could take over but he's not too worried yet. The answer is that it suggests mathematicians might have less to do but he thinks it's a while away.

8. Dr. Silver says the system can solve what humans can and maybe go beyond. The answer is that it shows potential to surpass human capabilities by solving hard problems and possibly exceeding them.

9. The article mentions A.I. uses informal reasoning (like LLMs) and formal systems. It found "magic keys" which might replace human intuition. The challenge here is that the A.I. can find solutions that traditionally rely on human intuition, so the answer is that it can replicate or surpass human intuition through its methods.

10. The article states AlphaProof was developed by Dr. Hubert's team to handle broad math subjects. The other system used was AlphaGeometry, but the question asks for the one beyond geometry, so AlphaProof is the answer.

Wait, let me check each again for exactness. For question 9, the article says the system found "magic keys" which Gowers mentioned. Since human intuition is part of that process, the A.I. challenging that role is the point. The answer should be that it can find solutions traditionally requiring human intuition, thus challenging that role.

Everything else seems to align. Let me make sure none are N/A. All questions have direct answers except maybe question 9? The article says the system found the "magic keys" that unlock problems, which Gowers said. That implies it can do what human intuition does. So it's okay. All answers are in the text.
