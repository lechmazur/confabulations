Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to make sure I only use the provided article and not any external knowledge. Let's go through each question carefully.

1. The first question asks how the music choices like Avril Lavigne and 'N Sync contribute to the commentary on the age and cultural background of the protagonists. The article mentions "needle drops, from Avril Lavigne and 'N Sync to Goo Goo Dolls, AC/DC and Madonna, seem calculated to scratch some itch in brains of a certain age." So the answer here is that the music targets a certain age group, probably the one that grew up with those artists, hence linking to the characters' middle age.

2. The second question is about Deadpool's initial comment on Disney and its significance regarding corporate influence. The article states, "Disney's so stupid," and explains that the film is part of the M.C.U. due to Disney's acquisition. The significance is that Deadpool's joke highlights Disney's role in the film's production despite his criticism, showing corporate influence.

3. The third question is about corporate mergers and intellectual property as meta-commentary. The article mentions the film's narrative about corporate mergers and IP, and since it's a Disney/MCU film, it's a meta-reference to its own production context.

4. The fourth question on middle-aged characters and aging/legacy. The text says both actors are middle-aged, and the characters share trauma. The themes of legacy come from Wolverine's past and Deadpool's struggles, so their age contributes to exploring those themes.

5. The fifth question on humor vs. serious themes. The article says the film is funny but also "genuinely warm-hearted and meatier on a character-rooted emotional basis," so humor balances the serious elements like trauma and redemption.

6. Sixth question on MCU integration reflecting Hollywood trends. The article notes Deadpool was brought into the MCU via corporate merger, showing how franchises expand through such deals, a Hollywood trend of merging properties for synergy.

7. Seventh question on Deadpool admiring Wolverine as a comment on celebrity culture. The article says Deadpool is "a fan" and "reverential" towards Wolverine, which could mock celebrity adoration since Wolverine is a big hero, so it's a take on how celebrities are idolized.

8. Eighth question on self-referential humor critiquing M.C.U. interconnectivity. The article mentions Deadpool breaks the fourth wall and jokes about MCU elements, so his humor critiques the reliance on interconnected plots.

9. Ninth question on music contributing to nostalgia and cultural identity. The songs mentioned are from the past, so the music evokes nostalgia, tying into the characters' cultural background and the audience's shared experiences.

10. Tenth question on distributor treatment and Deadpool's relationship evolution. The article says Deadpool's last solo was in Deadpool 2, now part of MCU. The film's jokes about Disney (like the renaming of the studio) reflect his integration into a larger universe, showing his shift from being outside to part of it, hence the changed relationship.

Wait, let me check each again. For question 1, the exact quote says the music is to "scratch some itch in brains of a certain age," so that's the answer. The rest seems okay. I need to make sure each answer is directly from the text. For example, question 5's answer comes from the part where the article says the emotionality is a subversive element, balancing humor with deeper themes. All right, I think that's covered.
