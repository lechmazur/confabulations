Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the strict answer format. Let's start with the first question.

1. **Question 1:** Which solar company's employee management strategy contradicts the industry's overall approach to overcapacity?

The article mentions Longi Green Energy Technology's strategy. It says they told workers to go back to their farms for harvest and return later when new equipment is ready. The industry's approach is layoffs or pay cuts, but Longi's approach is furloughs with the idea of rehiring. So the answer is Longi Green Energy Technology.

2. **Question 2:** What factor, mentioned in relation to local subsidies, could explain Sunzone's inability to maintain market competitiveness?

The text states that local subsidies are disappearing because local governments are running out of money due to the housing crisis affecting their revenue from land sales. So the factor is the disappearance of local subsidies.

3. **Question 3:** Which aspect of China's solar industry mirrors a challenge faced by its automotive sector, as mentioned by a government official?

The article says the automotive sector is following the solar industry's lead in cutting prices and ramping up exports. The challenge here is overproduction and price cutting. The aspect is price cutting and increased exports.

4. **Question 4:** Which aspect of China's solar industry strategy contradicts the actions of its banks, as described in the article?

The strategy is to let companies compete and fail, but the banks keep lending despite overcapacity. The contradiction is that banks continue lending even as companies struggle, while the strategy allows failure. The aspect is banks continuing to lend despite overcapacity.

5. **Question 5:** If the Biden administration adopted the EU's policy on Chinese solar panels, what action would they take?

The EU is barring use in government projects unless subsidies are disclosed. The article mentions Biden reinstated tariffs on solar products from Southeast Asia using Chinese components. The EU's action is requiring subsidy disclosure for government contracts. So the answer is requiring disclosure of subsidies for government contracts.

6. **Question 6:** Why might Longi furlough instead of layoff permanently?

The article says they do this in preparation for bigger production pushes. The reason is to rehire them when new equipment is ready.

7. **Question 7:** If a company discloses subsidies to get EU contracts, what consequence would they face?

The article says Chinese companies refuse to disclose subsidies. So if they do, they might lose subsidies or face other issues. But the specific consequence mentioned is that the EU bars them unless they disclose, so the consequence is eligibility, but the question asks for a consequence mentioned. Wait, the article says the EU is barring unless they disclose, but if they do, they can be eligible. The problem might be that other countries, like the US, might impose tariffs. The article mentions the US reimposed tariffs because of subsidy concerns. So if they disclose, maybe they avoid EU barriers but face US tariffs. But the question specifies the consequence mentioned in the article. The article says "the West is raising barriers... Europe has begun barring... unless Chinese companies disclose their subsidies, which they refuse to do." So if they disclose, they can get EU contracts, but the question asks for a consequence they would face. Maybe the answer is that they comply, but the article doesn't mention a negative consequence from the company's side. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The question is asking, if they disclose, what specific consequence from the article would they face. The article says the EU requires disclosure to not be barred. So maybe the consequence is avoiding being barred, but the question is phrased as a consequence they would face. Maybe there's another angle. Alternatively, perhaps the consequence is that they have to disclose, but the article doesn't mention a penalty beyond being barred. Maybe the answer is that they would have to disclose subsidies, which they currently refuse. But the question is about a consequence mentioned. Since the EU's action is barring unless they disclose, the consequence of not doing so is exclusion. But the question is if they do disclose, what consequence do they face? The article doesn't mention any negative consequences from disclosure itself. Maybe I missed something. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that they have to disclose, but that's an action, not a consequence. Hmm. Wait, the question says "what specific consequence mentioned in the article would they likely face?" Since the article says Chinese companies refuse to disclose, perhaps the consequence is that they have to give up their subsidies, but that's not stated. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that they would comply, but the article doesn't mention a negative consequence. Maybe the question is a trick and the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says "Europe has begun barring their use in government procurement projects unless Chinese companies disclose their subsidies, which they refuse to do." So if they disclose, they can get the contracts. The consequence of not disclosing is being barred. The question is if they disclose, what consequence would they face. The article doesn't mention a negative consequence. Maybe the question is a trick and the answer is N/A, but I need to check again. Alternatively, maybe the consequence is that they have to disclose, but that's the requirement. Since the question asks for a consequence mentioned, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question is about a specific consequence mentioned. Alternatively, perhaps the fact that the US is imposing tariffs because of subsidies, so if they disclose, maybe the US could use that info to impose tariffs. But the article says the US reimposed tariffs on solar products from Southeast Asia using Chinese components. The EU's requirement is separate. The article doesn't directly link disclosure to facing tariffs, so maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, this is tricky. Let me move on and come back.

8. **Question 8:** If a company pivots like Sunzone's founder to a new industry, what risk based on solar companies' experience?

Sunzone's factory became obsolete and was demolished. The risk is becoming obsolete due to rapid technological changes or overcapacity. The answer is that their previous investments might become obsolete.

9. **Question 9:** Why can Chinese manufacturers still compete despite US tariffs?

The article mentions their prices are cut below cost. So even with tariffs, their low prices might still make them competitive. The answer is their low-cost production.

10. **Question 10:** If China withdrew support, what impact on global supply?

The article says nearly every panel is made by Chinese companies. So withdrawing support would reduce global supply. The answer is a significant reduction in global supply.

Going back to question 7. The article says EU bars unless they disclose. The question is, if a company discloses to get EU contracts, what consequence do they face? The consequence is that they have to disclose, but the question is about a consequence mentioned in the article. Since the article states that the EU requires disclosure to not be barred, the consequence of not disclosing is exclusion. The question is about what happens if they do disclose. The article doesn't mention a negative consequence for disclosing. So maybe the answer is N/A? Or perhaps the consequence is that they have to give up subsidies, but the article says subsidies are disappearing anyway. Alternatively, maybe the consequence is that other countries like the US could use the disclosure to impose tariffs. The article mentions the US reimposed tariffs because of subsidy concerns. If they disclose subsidies, the US might use that info to impose tariffs. The article says "partly because of worries about Chinese subsidies, Biden allowed tariffs..." So if they disclose, that could confirm subsidy use, leading to more tariffs. That's a possible consequence mentioned. The article says "the West is raising barriers... Europe... unless disclose subsidies. ... Partly because of worries about subsidies, Biden allowed tariffs..." So if they disclose, the US could have more grounds to impose tariffs. Therefore, the consequence is facing tariffs from the US. The specific action mentioned is that the US reimposed tariffs on solar products from SE Asia with Chinese components. If a company discloses subsidies, that might lead to similar actions. So the answer is facing tariffs (specifically, the US reimposing tariffs), but the question asks for a specific consequence mentioned. The article mentions the US reimposed tariffs because of subsidy concerns. So the consequence is facing tariffs from the US. The answer would be facing tariffs. But the question is phrased as "what specific consequence mentioned in the article would they likely face?" The article says the US has reimposed tariffs, so if the company discloses subsidies, they might be subject to those tariffs. Alternatively, the EU allows them, but the US might still have tariffs. So the answer is facing US tariffs. The exact wording in the article: "President Biden last month allowed steep tariffs that had expired to go back into force on solar products imported from Southeast Asia that use lots of Chinese components." So the consequence is that the US could impose tariffs on them. Hence, the answer is facing US tariffs.
