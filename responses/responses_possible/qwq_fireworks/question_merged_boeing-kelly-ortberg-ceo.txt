Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the strict instructions given. Let me start with question 1.

1. The first question asks about the sequence of corporate changes leading to Kelly Ortberg's retirement from RTX before his Boeing appointment. The article mentions that Ortberg was CEO of Rockwell Collins until 2018 when it was acquired by United Technologies. Then he stayed in a senior role until the merger with Raytheon in 2020, forming RTX, and retired in 2021. So the sequence is Rockwell Collins acquired by United Technologies in 2018, then merged into RTX in 2020, leading to his retirement in 2021. Got that.

2. The second question is about how Ortberg's experience with Rockwell Collins aligns with Boeing's challenges. Since Rockwell provided avionics for Boeing planes, including the 737 Max, his experience in that area would help with production and quality issues related to their systems. The article says he oversaw development for Boeing and Airbus planes, so that's relevant.

3. The third question connects his appointment to FAA scrutiny. The FAA grounded the Max 9 and imposed inspections and production limits. Ortberg's background in avionics and quality systems (since Rockwell's products are critical) suggests Boeing wants someone familiar with regulatory compliance to address these issues. The article mentions his experience could help stabilize production and quality, so that's the link.

4. The fourth question is about his leadership at Rockwell Collins influencing his selection. The text states he led Rockwell, handled major programs like the 787 and A350, and was a respected industry figure. His leadership skills and understanding of aerospace systems are why he was chosen for Boeing's current challenges.

5. The fifth question asks about balancing long-term and stakeholder expectations. The article quotes Kevin Michaels saying Ortberg can do both. Since Boeing needs immediate fixes and long-term strategy, his ability to balance these was a key factor in his selection.

6. The sixth question is straightforward: Ortberg will be based in Seattle near the factories, as stated in the article.

7. The seventh question asks which former CEO of a company acquired by United Tech in 2018 is now Boeing's CEO. Rockwell was acquired by United Tech in 2018, and Ortberg was its CEO, so he's the answer.

8. The eighth question refers to someone who oversaw Boeing and Airbus programs. Ortberg did that at Rockwell, so he's the one taking over production stabilization.

9. The ninth question mentions a mechanical engineer with an avionics background. Ortberg is a mechanical engineer, worked at Rockwell (avionics), and needs to complete the supplier acquisition (Spirit AeroSystems) mentioned in the article.

10. The tenth question is about a retired RTX executive from Texas Instruments. Ortberg started at TI in 1983, retired from RTX, and is leading Boeing's next-gen planes.

I need to ensure all answers are directly from the text and avoid any assumptions. Let me check each one again for accuracy and compliance with the instructions. No N/A answers here since all questions are addressed in the article. Okay, time to format them properly.
