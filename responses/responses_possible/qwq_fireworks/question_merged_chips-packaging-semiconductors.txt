Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions that the U.S. currently has only 3% of advanced chip packaging, mostly done in Asia. If they increase to 10%, it would address dependency on Asian countries for packaging. So the answer should be the reliance on Asia for packaging.

2. **Question 2**: TSMC does both fabrication and packaging. Since the U.S. relies on TSMC, and China claims Taiwan, this creates a geopolitical risk. The answer is the strategic challenge due to China's claims on Taiwan where TSMC's packaging is.

3. **Question 3**: The grants aim to fund U.S. packaging tech, so it could reduce reliance on Asian countries by developing domestic capabilities. The answer is reducing dependency on Asian packaging.

4. **Question 4**: The CHIPS Act funds manufacturing, but packaging is mostly in Taiwan. The funding aligns to reduce Taiwan dependency by supporting domestic packaging. So the relationship is that the Act's funding aims to cut reliance on Taiwan's packaging through grants.

5. **Question 5**: The article states the focus on high-performance computing and low-power electronics is needed for AI leadership. The underlying reason is enabling AI leadership.

6. **Question 6**: If not addressed, chips made in the U.S. would still need Asian packaging, so continued dependence. The consequence is ongoing foreign dependency despite CHIPS Act factories.

7. **Question 7**: The article says focusing on manufacturing without packaging might mean chips still go to Asia for packaging. The unintended consequence is continued reliance on foreign packaging.

8. **Question 8**: The article mentions Resonac (Japanese) and U.S. companies in a consortium. Non-Asian countries? Wait, Resonac is Tokyo-based, so Japan is non-U.S. but Asian. Hmm. Wait, the question says non-Asian country. The consortium includes U.S. and Japanese companies. The non-Asian country here would be Japan, but maybe the question expects another? Wait, the article says "Japanese and U.S. companies". So the non-Asian country is Japan, but the question asks for a non-Asian country taking steps without U.S. funding. The consortium is a private effort. So Japan (Resonac) is the answer.

9. **Question 9**: If the U.S. doesn't develop packaging, China might gain control or influence in the supply chain, possibly strategic advantage in semiconductor dominance.

10. **Question 10**: The funding aligns by directly addressing the packaging dependency, which the CHIPS Act aims to reduce foreign reliance. So the alignment is to reduce dependence on foreign companies as per the Act's goals.

Wait, checking each question again for exactness:

1. The question asks what dependency it addresses. The article says packaging is mostly in Asia, so answer is dependency on Asian countries for chip packaging.

2. TSMC's role in both fabrication and packaging creates a challenge because the U.S. relies on Taiwan, which China claims. So the answer is the geopolitical risk from China's claims on Taiwan where TSMC's packaging is located.

3. The grants would fund domestic packaging, so reduce reliance on Asian countries. Answer: reducing reliance on Asian countries for packaging.

4. The CHIPS Act's funding (through grants) aims to reduce Taiwan dependency by building domestic packaging capacity. The relationship is that the Act's funding (part of it for packaging) directly targets reducing reliance on Taiwan's packaging.

5. The article says the focus is for AI leadership. So underlying reason is enabling AI leadership.

6. The consequence is that chips made in U.S. factories would still need to go to Asia for packaging, so dependency remains. Answer: Chips would still require Asian packaging, maintaining foreign dependence.

7. The article states that without packaging focus, dependency remains. The unintended consequence is continued foreign dependency on packaging.

8. The Resonac consortium includes Japanese and U.S. companies, so Japan (a non-U.S. Asian country?) but the question says non-Asian? Wait, Japan is in Asia. Maybe the question considers non-Asian as non-U.S.? But the question specifies non-Asian countries. So perhaps there's no non-Asian country mentioned. Wait, the article says "Japanese and U.S. companies". The non-Asian country would be Japan? Since the U.S. is part of it. The question asks for a non-Asian country taking steps without U.S. funding. The consortium is a joint effort but the company leading is Resonac (Japan). Since it's a private consortium, they don't rely on U.S. funding. So answer is Japan (but Japan is in Asia). Wait, maybe I misread. The article says "non-Asian country"—maybe the question is a trick? Alternatively, perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, the article mentions the consortium is between Japanese and U.S. companies. So the non-Asian country is Japan. But since Japan is in Asia, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "non-Asian country"—so maybe there's no such country mentioned. Let me check the article again. The article says "Resonac, a company based in Tokyo, announced on Monday a new consortium with nine other Japanese and U.S. companies..." So all non-U.S. companies are Japanese (Asia). So the non-Asian country isn't mentioned. Therefore, answer is N/A? But the question asks for a non-Asian country taking steps without U.S. funding. Since the consortium includes Japanese (Asian) companies, perhaps there is no non-Asian country. Then answer is N/A? Hmm, maybe I missed something else. Alternatively, maybe the U.S. is part of it but the question wants a non-Asian, so maybe N/A. Wait, but the question says "non-Asian country"—so unless there's another country mentioned. The article doesn't mention any other countries outside Asia and U.S. in this context. So answer is N/A?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the article's exact wording: "Resonac, a company based in Tokyo, announced on Monday a new consortium with nine other Japanese and U.S. companies to focus on packaging research and development in a new facility that will be built in Union City, Calif." So the non-Asian countries here would be... none, because Japan is in Asia. So the answer to question 8 is N/A? But the question is about a non-Asian country. Since the consortium is Japanese and U.S., there's no non-Asian country involved. So the answer should be N/A. But the user might have thought of Japan as non-Asian? No, Japan is in Asia. So the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "non-Asian country"—so perhaps the answer is N/A. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I missed another part. Let me check again. The article mentions Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea, Philippines, Vietnam, and China as where packaging happens. The consortium is Japanese and U.S., so no non-Asian countries. So answer is N/A.

9. If the U.S. doesn't develop packaging, China could gain strategic advantage in controlling the supply chain, possibly leading to dominance in semiconductors. The article mentions that China's territorial claims on Taiwan are a concern. So China might exploit the dependency, so the strategic advantage is controlling the supply chain or leverage in tech dominance.

10. The funding aligns by directly addressing the packaging part which the CHIPS Act aims to reduce foreign reliance. So the answer is aligning with the Act's goal to reduce dependence on foreign companies by supporting domestic packaging.
