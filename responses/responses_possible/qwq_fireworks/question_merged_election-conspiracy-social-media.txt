Okay, I need to answer the 10 questions based solely on the provided article. Let me go through each question one by one and check the text for the answers.

1. **Which platform had a 448% traffic increase after Trump's assassination attempt?** The article mentions "Truth Social" saw a 448% rise compared to June Saturdays. So that's the answer.

2. **Percentage of fake accounts claiming the assassination was staged?** The text says "nearly half" were fake, so 50%? Wait, exactly, the question says "nearly half" so maybe 49%? But the article says "nearly half of the accounts... were fake, resulting in over 400,000 interactions". So the exact percentage is stated as "nearly half", but the question asks for the percentage. Since "nearly half" is approximately 50%, but the answer might need the exact figure. Wait, the question says "what percentage... were identified as fake by Cyabra?" The article states "nearly half", so the answer is 50%? But maybe the exact number is 49% or 49.5%? But the text just says "nearly half", so maybe the answer is 50% as the closest. Wait, but the question might expect "nearly half" but in percentage terms. Alternatively, perhaps the article says "nearly half" which is 49% or exactly 50%? Hmm, but the question asks for the percentage, so maybe the answer is 50%, but the article says "nearly half", so maybe the exact figure is 49.5% or similar? Wait, the article says "nearly half of the accounts making those claims were fake", so the answer is 50%? Or perhaps the exact number isn't given, but the question says "what percentage... were identified as fake" and the article says "nearly half", so maybe the answer is 50%? Or should I put "nearly half"? Wait, the instructions say to use the exact numbers from the text. Since it's stated as "nearly half", maybe the answer is 50%, but perhaps the question expects the exact wording. Wait, the question asks for the percentage, so maybe the answer is 50% as the approximate. Alternatively, maybe the exact figure is 49%, but the article just says "nearly half". Hmm. Wait, the question might be looking for "nearly half" but since it's a percentage, maybe 50% is acceptable. Alternatively, the answer is "nearly half" but the question wants a numerical value. Wait, the article says "nearly half of the accounts... were fake" so the answer is 50% as the closest. Wait, but maybe it's 49.5% or similar, but the article rounds it to nearly half, so the answer is 50%.

Wait, the question says "what percentage... were identified as fake by Cyabra?" The article says "nearly half of the accounts... were fake", so the percentage is 50%? The answer is 50%? Or maybe "nearly half" but the question requires a numerical answer. The article doesn't give an exact number, so maybe the answer is "50%" as an approximation. Alternatively, if it's exactly stated as "nearly half", perhaps the answer is "50%" but maybe the exact figure isn't given, so maybe the answer is "N/A"? Wait, no. The question is asking for the percentage, and the article says "nearly half", so the answer should be 50% as the approximate value. So I'll go with 50%.

3. **Which account gained 50x more followers daily after the shooting?** The article mentions Alex Jones gained nearly 50k daily vs 1k before. So Alex Jones is the answer.

4. **Type of manipulated media altering Secret Service agents' appearance?** The text says "manipulated images... to make it appear that the Secret Service agents... were smiling". So "manipulated images".

5. **Platform sharing revenue with users for engagement and unfiltered political speech?** The article says "X now shares revenue with prominent users who drive engagement with the platform, offering an incentive for sensational content." So X (Twitter).

6. **Common phenomenon observed by Cyabra after both events indicating coordinated campaign?** The article states "the same phenomenon after Mr. Biden's withdrawal, indicating a coordinated campaign..." The phenomenon is the spread of disinformation. The article mentions "a coordinated campaign to promote Mr. Trump and denigrate Mr. Biden." So the answer is "a coordinated campaign to promote Trump and denigrate Biden".

7. **Conspiracy theorist previously banned from X, gained 50k followers?** The article says "Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist who was until recently banned from X... gained nearly 50,000 new followers a day immediately after the shooting." So Alex Jones.

8. **Percentage of posts mentioning the new Democratic front-runner (Harris) with racist/sexist attacks?** The article states "More than one in 10 posts mentioning her on X on Sunday included racist or sexist attacks..." So over 10%, so 10% or higher. The exact phrasing is "more than one in 10", so the answer is "more than 10%" but the question asks for the percentage. Since the question is "what percentage...", the answer is "more than 10%" but maybe the exact number isn't given. Wait, the question says "what percentage of posts... contained..." and the article says "More than one in 10" which is over 10%. Since the question asks for the percentage, the answer is "over 10%" or "more than 10%". But the instructions say to prefer sentence fragments. The article says "More than one in 10 posts...", so the answer is "more than 10%".

9. **Social media intelligence company in Tel Aviv that found fake accounts?** The article mentions "Cyabra, a social media intelligence company based in Tel Aviv."

10. **Type of AI-generated content featuring Biden and Harris?** The article says "video deepfakes spread of Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris." So "video deepfakes".

3. Alex Jones – correct.
4. Manipulated images – correct.
5. X – correct.
6. The phenomenon is the coordinated campaign mentioned, so "a coordinated campaign to promote Trump and denigrate Biden".
7. Alex Jones – correct.
8. More than 10% – correct.
9. Cyabra – correct.
10. Video deepfakes – correct.
