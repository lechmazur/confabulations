Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. 

1. The first question asks which British university chair studied farmer perceptions of a product that reduces the dietary paw print of medium-sized dogs. The article mentions Tom MacMillan, who is the chair at the Royal Agricultural University, studied farmer perceptions of lab-based meat. The "dietary paw print" part is from Andrew Knight's statement about a medium-sized dog's impact. Since MacMillan's role is tied to the study on lab meat perceptions, that's the answer.

2. The second question is about the company CEO with cats named after East African places and who's pioneering a product replacing 50 billion deaths. The article says Owen Ensor, CEO of Meatly, named his cats Lamu and Zanzi. Lamu sounds like Lamu, Kenya, and Zanzi could relate to Zanzibar. The 50 billion figure is from Ensor's statement, so Meatly is the company.

3. The third question asks which European country's linguistic restrictions mirror a U.S. state's stance on lab-grown meat. France is mentioned as banning terms like "filet" for plant-based products. Florida banned lab-grown meat, similar to France's regulatory approach, so France is the answer.

4. The main reason Britain is ahead in approving lab-grown meat is due to leaving the EU, allowing faster, less regulated processes. The article states this directly, so the answer is Brexit or leaving the EU. The exact phrase from the text is "no longer beholden to the bloc's tighter regulations."

5. Andrew Knight's comparison is that a medium dog's dietary paw print equals an average person's. The article states this explicitly, so the answer is "that of an average person."

6. The University of Winchester study found 40% of meat-eaters willing to try cultivated meat. The question asks for the percentage, so 40.

7. Owen Ensor mentions that lab-grown meat doesn't require raising or killing animals. His quote says, "We don't need to raise or kill any animals," so the benefit is no animal deaths.

8. The UK hasn't approved lab-grown meat for humans yet, only pet food. The article states Britain hasn't approved it for human consumption despite allowing pet food.

9. Linus Pardoe says the UK's system is more straightforward post-Brexit. The quote is "The U.K. has a much more straightforward system now that we've left the European Union," so the answer is a more straightforward regulatory system.

10. In 2020, U.S. dogs and cats ate 20% of livestock. The article says "in 2020, dogs and cats in the United States consumed an average of 20 percent," so 20%.
