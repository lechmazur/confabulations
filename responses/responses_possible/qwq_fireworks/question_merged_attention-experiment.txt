Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one using only the provided article. Let's start with question 1. The question asks about the significance of the ghostlike second reflection in Whistler's painting, considering pentimento and his description of his work.

Looking at the article, it mentions that the second reflection might be a pentimento, which is a change in the artwork over time. The conservator, Kate Smith, suggests Whistler might have flipped the panel and started over, leaving this reflection. Also, Whistler described his work as arrangements of "line, form and color first," not necessarily literal scenes. So the reflection's significance could be linked to the pentimento and his focus on form over literal meaning. The answer should tie these points together.

Question 2: If the painting was finished without the reflection, what does that suggest about Whistler's intentions and pentimento? The article says the reflection might have emerged decades later, implying it wasn't intentional. But Whistler might have left it intentionally. Since pentimento is a change visible over time, the answer would be that it shows the artist didn't originally intend it, but the pentimento reveals changes, suggesting the work evolves beyond the artist's initial plan.

Question 3: Professor Roberts' assignment's student reactions and perceived difficulty. The text says students react with horror, thinking it's impossible or remedial. But they find it neither too hard nor too easy. The answer should note that students initially find it hard but later realize it's manageable.

Question 4: The pentimento's relationship between the artist's intent and viewer's interpretation. The article states that pentimento might be unintended, but Whistler's focus on form over literal meaning allows viewers to interpret it. The answer should say the pentimento shows the artist's intent can shift, letting viewers find their own meaning.

Question 5: Which artistic element transforms industrial structures into marvels? The article says "when the evening mist clothes the riverside with poetry as with a veil, and the poor buildings lose themselves in the dim sky, and the tall chimneys become campanili, and the warehouses are palaces..." The element here is the use of light and color (hazy blue tones), so "light/color" or "hazy blue tones."

Question 6: How does the hidden reflection challenge the viewer's perception of time? The reflection might be a pentimento, showing changes over time, so the painting includes different time layers. The answer is that it shows the passage of time in the artwork's creation and viewing.

Question 7: Connection between Whistler's lecture and the conservator's theory. The lecture talks about evening mist transforming scenes, while the theory is about flipping the panel. Both involve reinterpreting or changing the initial composition. The answer: the lecture's theme of transformation mirrors the theory of altering the painting's orientation.

Question 8: Relation between ghostly reflection and Roberts' views on student reactions. The reflection's ambiguity might parallel the students' initial resistance but eventual acceptance. The article says students thought it was hard but found it manageable, similar to the reflection's ambiguity leading to deeper insight. Answer: The reflection's ambiguity mirrors students' initial resistance but eventual discovery.

Question 9: Parallel between Whistler refusing to confirm figures and the pentimento. The article says Whistler refused to say if figures were people, emphasizing form over literal meaning. The pentimento's ambiguity also leaves interpretation open. So the parallel is both elements encourage viewers to interpret without fixed answers.

Question 10: How the painting's subject relates to office worker screen time. The article mentions office workers spend less than a minute per screen. The exercise required focused attention on a static image, contrasting with short attention spans. So the painting's static nature challenges the brief attention typical of office workers.
