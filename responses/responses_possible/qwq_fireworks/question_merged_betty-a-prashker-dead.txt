Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and answer exactly what's asked. Let's start with the first question.

1. **Question 1:** The question is about how Betty Prashker's decision to publish "Sexual Politics" showed foresight and understanding of 1970s cultural shifts. The article mentions that "Sexual Politics" became a landmark of second-wave feminism. Since she recognized its importance despite initially not liking Millett's other work, her choice aligns with the feminist movement of the time. The answer should be that she recognized its role in the feminist movement.

2. **Question 2:** Her interaction with Isaac Asimov on the "Foundation" sequel. The article says she insisted he write a sequel, leading to "Foundation's Edge" which was popular. This shows her editorial instinct to push for a sequel and influence on sci-fi trends. The answer is that she pushed Asimov to write a sequel which became popular.

3. **Question 3:** Her involvement with "Backlash" by Faludi. The text states that other publishers were cool to it, but Prashker understood its need in the '80s. The answer is that she recognized the backlash against feminist gains in the 1980s.

4. **Question 4:** Connection between her career resurgence and post-WWII. The article says her first job at Doubleday in 1945 was because men were still at war. So her initial entry into publishing was due to post-war job openings. The answer is that her first job came because men were still returning from WWII.

5. **Question 5:** The venue after rejecting a club. The Century Association rejected her, but later she preferred the Grill Room at Four Seasons. The answer is the Grill Room of the Four Seasons.

6. **Question 6:** Career advancement and government policy. The editor told her in 1963 that Doubleday needed more women for affirmative action to do business with the government. So her promotion was tied to affirmative action policy. The answer is affirmative action policy.

7. **Question 7:** Personal life decisions and feminist themes. She left career to raise kids but later returned, similar to themes of constraint and empowerment in her books. The answer is that she left career to be a homemaker then returned, reflecting feminist themes of balancing roles.

8. **Question 8:** Literary club's rejection before a legal decision. The Century Association rejected her in 1978, then in the 80s Supreme Court upheld a law banning club discrimination. The answer is the Century Association.

9. **Question 9:** Difference at Crown vs Doubleday regarding feminist lit. At Crown she championed "Backlash" which was a critique of 80s backlash, while at Doubleday she published "Sexual Politics" (second-wave). The article says her approach was consistent, but maybe the question is about strategy? Wait, the article says she became an immediate champion of "Backlash" at Crown, implying maybe a focus on contemporary issues there. The answer might be that at Crown she focused on contemporary feminist critiques like "Backlash," whereas at Doubleday she started with foundational texts. But the article doesn't explicitly compare strategies, so maybe N/A? Wait, the article says she was known as an advocate for women and published Faludi at Crown. Since the question asks how her approach differed, but the article might not specify a difference. Hmm. Wait, the text says "Throughout Ms. Prashker's career, she was also known as an advocate..." so maybe no difference. Then answer N/A? Or perhaps the difference is that at Crown she pushed "Backlash" which was specifically addressing 80s backlash. The question is about how her approach differed, so maybe she continued the same approach, so N/A? But the question says "differ," so maybe the answer is N/A unless the article says otherwise. Let me check again. The article states she was at Crown and became a champion of "Backlash," but doesn't compare to Doubleday's approach beyond noting she published foundational texts there. Since the question asks about difference, but the article doesn't explicitly state a differing strategy, perhaps N/A. Wait, but the article says her instincts were broad, crossing high and low culture. Maybe that's part of her approach at both? Hmm, tricky. Maybe the answer is N/A because no explicit difference is mentioned except the specific books. Alternatively, the question might be implying that at Crown she focused on feminist critiques of the 80s, while at Doubleday earlier feminist works. The answer might be that at Crown she focused on contemporary feminist critiques like "Backlash" while at Doubleday she published foundational feminist texts like "Sexual Politics." But the article doesn't explicitly say her approach differed, just that she published different books. Since the question is about her approach differing, maybe N/A. Need to check again. The article says "Throughout Ms. Prashker's career, she was also known as an advocate for other women in publishing, and for equal pay... she was not a snob about what she published..." So her approach was consistent, so perhaps N/A. Hmm, but the question might expect the answer to be that she continued her feminist advocacy at both, so no difference. Therefore, answer N/A.

10. **Question 10:** Connection between her advocacy for women and dining venues. She chose the Grill Room instead of male-only clubs, which were exclusionary. Her advocacy for women's inclusion led her to prefer a more inclusive venue. The answer is that she chose a venue open to women, reflecting her advocacy against exclusion.

Wait, but the question says connection between her advocacy and her dining choice. The article says she mixed business at the Grill Room instead of the Century (male-only), so her advocacy for women's inclusion in professional spaces led her to a venue that didn't exclude them. So the answer is that her choice of the Grill Room reflected her advocacy for inclusive professional spaces.

Now, let's check each answer against the article text precisely.

1. The article says she was excited about "Sexual Politics" and it became a landmark of second-wave feminism. So her foresight was recognizing its importance as a feminist text. Answer: She recognized its role as a feminist landmark.

2. She pushed Asimov to write a sequel, which became popular. Answer: She pushed Asimov to write a sequel to "Foundation," which became a bestseller.

3. She understood the need for "Backlash" in the 80s when others didn't. Answer: She recognized the need for a critique of the backlash against feminism in the 1980s.

4. Her first job in 1945 at Doubleday because men were at war. Answer: Her first publishing job opened due to post-WWII labor shortages.

5. The Grill Room at Four Seasons. Answer: The Grill Room of the Four Seasons.

6. The editor mentioned affirmative action to hire women to do business with the government. Answer: Affirmative action policy to include more women in senior roles.

7. She left career to be a homemaker then returned, similar to themes of constraint and empowerment in her books. Answer: She left her career to raise children then returned, reflecting feminist themes of reclaiming autonomy.

8. The Century Association rejected her in 1978, then later Supreme Court upheld a law that allowed women. Answer: The Century Association.

9. The article doesn't explicitly state a difference in approach between the two publishers regarding feminist literature. She published different books, but the approach (advocacy) was consistent. Answer: N/A.

10. Her choice of the Grill Room instead of male-exclusive clubs aligns with her advocacy for inclusion. Answer: Her preferred venue was inclusive, aligning with her advocacy for women's professional equality.

Wait, need to ensure exact wording from the article for each:

For question 9, the article says she was at Crown and became a champion of "Backlash," but at Doubleday she had published "Sexual Politics." The question asks how her approach at Crown differed from Doubleday regarding feminist lit. The article doesn't state a difference in strategy, just different books. Since the question asks for a difference in strategy, and the article doesn't mention that, so answer N/A.
