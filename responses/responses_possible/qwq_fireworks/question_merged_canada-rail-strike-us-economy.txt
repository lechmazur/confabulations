Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the instructions strictly. Let's start with the first question.

1. The first question asks about the economic impact if the shutdown lasted longer than a week. The article mentions that a weeklong shutdown would cause about $1 billion in losses, but a longer stoppage would "hammer Canada's export-dependent economy and the businesses around the world that rely on its goods." Since the question specifies longer than a week, the answer should be that it would cause severe harm to the export economy and global businesses relying on Canadian goods. But the exact phrasing in the article is "hammer Canada's export-dependent economy and the businesses around the world that rely on its goods." So the answer is that it would severely hurt the economy and those businesses.

2. The second question is about the primary logistical challenge for transporting fertilizer to the U.S. The article states that 90% of Canadian fertilizer to the U.S. is delivered by rail, and trucks can't handle it because of huge volumes and distances. So the challenge is lack of alternative transport, meaning no practical alternatives like trucks can replace rail for such volume.

3. C.H. Robinson advised customers to shift to U.S. ports starting in May. The article says they began advising this when the union voted to authorize a strike. The strategic advice is to switch to U.S. ports, specifically LA, Long Beach, Seattle, Tacoma. The reflection is that they anticipated a rail disruption affecting supply chains, so moving to other ports to avoid rail dependency.

4. The question is which industry group's estimate would be most affected if the shutdown lasted 8 days. The article mentions the Railway Association of Canada estimates that half of Canada's exports are moved by rail, and in 2022, rail carried goods worth 380 billion CAD. An 8-day shutdown (longer than a week) would affect their estimates of exports. Since the Railway Association provides these numbers, their estimates would be impacted. So the answer is Railway Association of Canada.

5. If the shutdown lasted 10 days, forest product companies (sawmills, pulp, paper) would face running out of storage space, leading to closures. The article says Derek Nighbor from the Forest Products Association warned that these mills might close as they run out of storage. So the consequence is closure due to storage limits.

6. If the shutdown coincided with low Panama Canal levels, which industry would face compounded effects? The article mentions Panama's low water levels reduced vessel numbers. The rail shutdown affects exports. The article says rail is crucial for exports, so any industry relying on both rail and Panama would be hit. Since the Panama Canal is for shipping, maybe an export industry that uses both. The article mentions coal for Asian steel uses rail to ports. If Panama is an issue, maybe coal exports via that route? Or maybe automotive, but not sure. Wait, the question says "specific export industry". The article says rail is vital for 380 billion CAD goods. The Panama issue affects shipping routes. Maybe the automotive industry, since they use rail for transport. Alternatively, grain? Or maybe the forest products? Hmm. Alternatively, the article mentions coal for steel in Asia. If rail is down and Panama can't handle ships, maybe coal exports would be hit. But the article says the coal mines have limited storage. If rail is down and Panama is a shipping route, maybe that's a problem. Alternatively, the automotive industry uses rail to transport vehicles. If their rail is down and Panama is an issue for other shipping, maybe not directly. The question says "most severe compounded effects". Since rail is essential for exports, and Panama's issues would add another layer. The article also mentions that automakers rely on rail. So if rail is down and another shipping issue, maybe automotive? But the article says automakers were monitoring but not yet affected. Alternatively, maybe grain, which can't be moved by truck. But the Red Sea issue is mentioned separately. Wait the question is about Panama low levels. The article says "low water levels at the Panama Canal reduced the number of vessels that could use that passage." So industries relying on rail and Panama would be hit. The coal for steel in Asia is transported via rail to ports, maybe using Panama? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the forestry products? The article says forest products would close mills. Maybe the combination would make it worse. Alternatively, the article's mention of "global supply chain" issues including Panama, so perhaps the rail shutdown plus Panama would hit the most export-reliant industries. The Railway Association's estimate is that half of exports are via rail. So maybe the industries that are most reliant on rail and also affected by Panama. Since the article mentions that rail is critical, perhaps the one most affected would be the forest products, as they face closure. Wait, but the question is about compounded effects from both rail and Panama. Maybe the automotive industry? The article mentions automakers rely on rail. If they can't ship via rail and their other routes (Panama) are also constrained, that's compounded. Alternatively, maybe the grain industry, but they can't use trucks. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the coal for Asian steel, as they need rail to ports, and if Panama is an issue for shipping, but maybe they use other routes. The question says "specific export industry". The article mentions "Coal used for steel making in Asia travels on dedicated trains from mines in Alberta and British Columbia to ports for shipment." If rail is down, coal can't reach ports. If Panama's low levels affect their shipping routes (maybe they go through Panama?), then both issues would block coal exports. So that's the coal export industry. But the article doesn't explicitly say coal uses Panama, just that Panama is a shipping route. Alternatively, maybe the automotive industry, which is mentioned as relying on rail. Since they're in Ontario, their exports might go via rail to ports, which then use other routes. If both rail and Panama are down, that's a problem. The article says "the U.S. auto sector, its domestic manufacturing supply chain" so maybe the auto industry is the one. The question is asking which specific industry would face the most severe compounded effects. The answer might be the automotive industry, but I need to check. Alternatively, maybe the forest products? But the question is about compounded effects from rail and Panama. The article says the forest products would close mills, but that's due to storage, not Panama. Hmm. Maybe the answer is the automotive industry. Alternatively, the article mentions that the rail shutdown plus other supply chain issues (like Panama) would compound. The question says "specific export industry", so maybe the automotive industry, as they are mentioned as critical. The article says "A prolonged railroad strike would severely disrupt the North American automotive supply chain...". So if the rail is down and Panama is also an issue, their exports would be hit. So answer: automotive industry.

7. If the rail shutdown happened with the dockworkers' strike, the primary challenge for fertilizer distribution. The dockworkers' strike would affect ports, so if both rail and ports are down, then fertilizer can't be moved by rail or via ports. But the article says fertilizer is 90% by rail, and if rail is down, trucks can't do it. If ports are also affected by dock strike, maybe the fertilizer can't be shipped out. The primary challenge would be no alternative transport. But the question is about the challenge if both strikes happen. Since fertilizer can't be moved by truck, and if the dock strike is at U.S. ports (the article mentions companies are diverting to U.S. ports like LA etc. in anticipation of rail strike. But if dock strike also happens there, then those ports are also down. So the challenge would be no alternative transport available. So the answer is lack of alternative transportation options.

8. If the shutdown lasted two weeks, the immediate effect on U.S. auto sector. The article states that automakers said they weren't feeling effects yet but were monitoring. A prolonged strike would disrupt the North American supply chain. The immediate effect after two weeks (since a week is mentioned as causing $1B loss, two weeks is longer). The answer would be severe disruption to the auto supply chain, affecting manufacturing and employment. The article says "A prolonged railroad strike would severely disrupt..." So the immediate effect would be severe disruption of the supply chain.

9. Grain exporters' concern if rail shutdown plus Red Sea disruptions. The Red Sea attacks forced ships to avoid Suez. Grain can't be moved by truck. If rail is down and ships can't go through Suez, then grain can't be transported either way. So the primary concern is inability to export grain via both rail and alternative sea routes. The article mentions that grain has no practical alternatives to rail, so the combined issue would mean no way to move grain. So the concern is inability to export grain.

10. Which specific plant would shut down first after 3 weeks. The article mentions sawmills and pulp/paper plants would close due to storage limits. Also, coal mines have limited storage. The Forest Products Association says those mills would close. The question asks for a specific type in Canada. The answer would be sawmills or pulp and paper plants. The article says "sawmills and pulp and paper plants to close". Since the question asks for the first, maybe sawmills? But the article lists them together. The exact wording is "sawmills and pulp and paper plants". So the answer is sawmills or pulp and paper plants. But need to pick one. The question says "specific type of manufacturing plant", so either is acceptable. The article says "sawmills and pulp and paper plants", so perhaps the answer is sawmills.
