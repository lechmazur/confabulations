Okay, I need to tackle these questions based solely on the given article. Let me go through each one step by step.

1. The question is about inferring the Chinese government's fiscal strategy from the Third Plenum summary, considering past property tax proposals and current revenue issues. The article mentions that in 2003 and 2013, there were suggestions for a property tax to help local governments, but it wasn't done except in small experiments. The recent communique says they need to improve the macro-control system and coordinate finance/tax reforms. So maybe they're hinting at property tax again? The answer might be improving the macro-control system and finance/tax reforms, referencing past property tax ideas.

2. The approach to economic reform regarding market forces and state control. The article says the summary emphasizes sticking to Xi's state-led, tech-focused strategy but mentions a socialist market economy. They want market order but under party goals. So the answer could be maintaining state control while allowing markets within party objectives.

3. The official whose fate is a mystery but still called "Comrade" is Qin Gang. The text states he was removed but still referred to as Comrade, so that's the answer.

4. The specific economic measure hinted at but not implemented before is the property tax. The communique mentions improving finance and tax reforms, which connects to past property tax proposals.

5. The sector absent but indirectly addressed: the private sector. The communique didn't mention it but talked about maintaining market order. Recent crackdowns affected private businesses like tech giants, so that's the sector.

6. The policy linked to left-behind children is residency restrictions. Migrants can't access public schools in cities, leading to children being left behind. The communique mentions urban-rural reforms and land system changes, which might address residency.

7. The communique's language on market order shows tension between state control and markets. They allow markets but only if they serve party goals, so the tension is between state control and limited market roles.

8. The economic stimulus hinted at is allowing families to live together in cities, which could boost birth rates and apartment demand. The communique talks about narrowing urban-rural gaps and land reforms, implying residency rights might be eased.

9. Private sector concerns are ignored despite regulatory issues. The communique doesn't mention the private sector but says to maintain market order under party control, showing prioritizing state goals over private sector needs.

10. The aspect reaffirmed is state-led development. The communique mentions socialist market economy and tech revolution under state control, which critics say hampers innovation but is reaffirmed here.
