Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly what's asked. Let me go through each question carefully.

1. The first question asks which state requires removing a book statewide if removed by a specific combination of districts and charter schools. The article mentions Utah's law where if three school districts or two districts and five charter schools remove a material, the state board orders its removal. So the answer should be Utah.

2. The Idaho statute defining "obscene materials" originated from a 1970s statute. The article says "as defined by an existing statute from the 1970s." The exact year isn't given, so the answer is 1970s. Wait, but the question asks for the year. Since it's the 1970s, but not a specific year, maybe N/A? Wait, the question says "year" but the text only mentions the decade. Since the exact year isn't provided, the answer would be N/A. Hmm, but maybe the question expects the decade? Wait, the instructions say if the exact year isn't there, then N/A. The question asks for the year, so since it's 1970s, not a specific year, answer is N/A.

3. The state with new rules making no distinction between elementary and high school content and affecting classics like "The Bluest Eye" etc. The article mentions South Carolina's regulations don't distinguish between grades and Joshua Malkin mentions those books. So South Carolina.

4. The sexual topic depicted in both Utah and Tennessee's regulations. Utah's law mentions "descriptions of sex or masturbation". Tennessee's amendment says "descriptions or depictions of sexual conduct". The common one is "sexual conduct" but Utah also mentions masturbation. Wait, the question asks for a specific sexual topic that's grounds in both. Let me check. The article says Utah's law includes "descriptions of sex or masturbation" and Tennessee's includes "sexual conduct". Hmm. Wait, the article's section on Tennessee says "descriptions or depictions of sexual conduct". So maybe "sexual conduct" is common? Or is there another overlap? The question is asking for a specific topic that's in both. Let me recheck Utah's part: "Utah... any book or other classroom or library material that includes descriptions of sex or masturbation". Tennessee's part: "descriptions or depictions of sexual conduct". So "sexual conduct" is in Tennessee, while Utah has "sex or masturbation". The overlapping term might not be exact, but maybe "sexual conduct" is in both? Wait, maybe "sexual conduct" is part of both. Wait, the question is which specific topic is in both. Alternatively, maybe masturbation is only in Utah. Hmm. Wait, the question is "what specific sexual topic... is grounds for removal in both Utah and Tennessee's new regulations?" Let me check again. Utah's law says "descriptions of sex or masturbation". Tennessee's says "descriptions or depictions of sexual conduct". The exact terms may not overlap, but perhaps "sexual conduct" is a broader term that includes masturbation? Or maybe the answer is "sexual conduct" because Tennessee's law explicitly mentions it, but Utah's law includes "sex", which could be part of sexual conduct. Alternatively, maybe "sadomasochistic abuse" is in both? Wait, looking back: Utah's law includes "sadomasochistic abuse" as part of the 1970s statute. Wait, the Idaho section mentions the 1970s statute includes "sadomasochistic abuse". Wait, the article says for Idaho's law: "The definition includes nudity and sexual conduct including 'masturbation, homosexuality, sexual intercourse,' as well as 'sadomasochistic abuse.'" So that's Idaho's definition. But Utah's law: "identify and remove pornographic or indecent material... includes any book... descriptions of sex or masturbation." Then Tennessee's amendment says "material that includes any descriptions or depictions of sexual conduct, 'sexual excitement,' excess violence or sadomasochistic abuse cannot be part of a school library's collection." So Tennessee includes "sexual conduct" and "sadomasochistic abuse". Utah's law mentions "sadomasochistic abuse" via the Idaho's 1970s statute? Wait, no, Utah's own law? Wait, Utah's law is separate. Let me recheck Utah's part again. The Utah section says the amendment to existing law includes removing materials with "descriptions of sex or masturbation". The article also mentions in the Idaho section that the 1970s statute includes "sadomasochistic abuse". But for Utah's own law, does it mention "sadomasochistic abuse"? The article says Utah's law includes "sadomasochistic abuse" as part of the existing statute? Wait, no, Utah's own amendment's specific terms are "descriptions of sex or masturbation". The other parts about "sadomasochistic abuse" are from Idaho's 1970s statute. So for Utah's own law, the sexual topics are sex or masturbation. Tennessee's law includes "sexual conduct" and "sadomasochistic abuse". The overlapping term between Utah and Tennessee might not be present. Wait, maybe "sexual conduct" is in both? No. Wait, perhaps "sexual conduct" is in Tennessee, and Utah's law has "sex" which could be part of sexual conduct. But the question asks for a specific topic that is grounds in both. Alternatively, maybe "sadomasochistic abuse" is in Tennessee's law but not Utah's? Hmm. Wait, the article's Tennessee section says: "codifies the definition... material that includes any descriptions or depictions of sexual conduct, 'sexual excitement,' excess violence or sadomasochistic abuse cannot be part of a school library's collection." So Tennessee includes "sadomasochistic abuse". Utah's law's specific terms are "descriptions of sex or masturbation". But does Utah's law also include "sadomasochistic abuse" via another part? Let me check again. The Utah law's amendment says "identify and remove pornographic or indecent material" which includes descriptions of sex or masturbation. The article's Utah section doesn't mention "sadomasochistic abuse" as part of Utah's law. The Idaho section mentions that Idaho's 1970s statute includes "sadomasochistic abuse", but Utah's own law's specific grounds are sex or masturbation. So the only overlapping term between Utah and Tennessee's laws would be "sexual conduct"? No, because Utah's law doesn't mention that. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me read again the question: "What specific sexual topic, when depicted in books, is grounds for removal in both Utah and Tennessee's new regulations?" So maybe the answer is "sadomasochistic abuse"? Wait, Tennessee's law includes that, but does Utah's? The Utah law's amendment says "pornographic or indecent material", and the article says "includes any book or other classroom or library material that includes descriptions of sex or masturbation." But the "sadomasochistic abuse" is part of Idaho's definition. So unless Utah's existing law includes it, but the article doesn't state that. Therefore, perhaps the overlapping term is "sexual conduct" is in Tennessee, and "sex" in Utah. Maybe the question is looking for "sadomasochistic abuse" but that's only in Tennessee and Idaho. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "sexual conduct" because that's in both? Wait, no. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again:

Utah's law explicitly includes "descriptions of sex or masturbation". 

Tennessee's law includes "descriptions or depictions of sexual conduct".

The question asks for a specific sexual topic that is grounds in both. Since Utah's terms are "sex or masturbation" and Tennessee's is "sexual conduct", perhaps there is no overlap. Wait, but maybe "sexual conduct" is a broader term that includes masturbation? Or perhaps the answer is "sadomasochistic abuse" but that's only in Tennessee and Idaho. Wait, the article says in the Tennessee section: "codifies the definition of what books... suitable for children... material that includes any descriptions or depictions of sexual conduct, 'sexual excitement,' excess violence or sadomasochistic abuse cannot be part..." So sadomasochistic abuse is in Tennessee. Utah's law's specific terms are "descriptions of sex or masturbation". So there's no overlap between Utah and Tennessee's specific terms except perhaps "sex" and "sexual conduct" being related, but not the same. Therefore, maybe the answer is "N/A". Wait, but that can't be. Let me think again. The question might be referring to "sadomasochistic abuse" but that's only in Tennessee and Idaho. Alternatively, maybe "sexual conduct" is part of both? No. Wait, the article says Utah's law is an amendment to an existing law that "includes any book or other classroom or library material that includes descriptions of sex or masturbation." But the existing law's definition (like Idaho's 1970s statute) might include "sadomasochistic abuse", but Utah's own law's amendment might not. Hmm. Maybe the answer is "sadomasochistic abuse" but only in Tennessee and Idaho. So the correct answer for the question is N/A? Wait, the question is about Utah and Tennessee. Since their specific terms don't overlap, then the answer is N/A. Wait, but the question says "specific sexual topic", so maybe the answer is "sexual conduct" is in Tennessee and "sex" in Utah. But they are different terms. Alternatively, maybe the question is looking for "sexual conduct" because that's part of Tennessee, and Utah's law's existing statute (which is being amended) might have included "sadomasochistic abuse" but the amendment adds "sex or masturbation". So perhaps there is no overlapping term, so N/A? Hmm. This is tricky. Let me see if I missed any other parts. Alternatively, maybe "sadomasochistic abuse" is part of Utah's existing law? The article says in the Idaho section that the 1970s statute includes "sadomasochistic abuse", but Utah's own law's amendment is separate. Unless Utah's existing law also uses that definition. The article says in Utah's section: "The definition includes nudity and sexual conduct including 'masturbation, homosexuality, sexual intercourse,' as well as 'sadomasochistic abuse.'" Wait, no, that's in the Idaho section. Wait, the article says about Idaho: "The definition includes nudity and sexual conduct including 'masturbation, homosexuality, sexual intercourse,' as well as 'sadomasochistic abuse.'" So that's Idaho's definition. Utah's law's amendment says "descriptions of sex or masturbation". So Utah's specific terms are different. Therefore, the answer for question 4 is N/A? But the user might have a different view. Alternatively, perhaps "sadomasochistic abuse" is in Tennessee, and Utah's law might include it via the existing statute? Wait, the article says Utah's amendment is to an existing law. The existing law's definition might include "sadomasochistic abuse", but the article doesn't explicitly state that. The article only mentions that in Idaho's case. Since the article doesn't say Utah's existing law includes "sadomasochistic abuse", then we can't assume that. So the answer would be N/A? Hmm, but maybe the question is looking for "sadomasochistic abuse" even if it's only in Tennessee and Idaho. Wait, no, the question specifies Utah and Tennessee. Since the article says Tennessee includes "sadomasochistic abuse" and Utah's law's amendment includes "descriptions of sex or masturbation", there's no overlap. Therefore, the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the exact wording again for Utah and Tennessee.

Utah's law: "any book or other classroom or library material that includes descriptions of sex or masturbation."

Tennessee's: "descriptions or depictions of sexual conduct, 'sexual excitement,' excess violence or sadomasochistic abuse cannot be part..."

So the only common element might be "sex" (from Utah) and "sexual conduct" (from Tennessee). But those are different terms. Therefore, there is no overlapping specific sexual topic between the two states' regulations as per the article. So the answer is N/A. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I missed something. Alternatively, maybe "sexual conduct" is a broader term that includes "sex", but the article doesn't say that. The question asks for a specific topic that is grounds in both. Since they don't share the exact term, it's N/A. Let me tentatively go with N/A for question 4. Wait, but the user might have intended "sadomasochistic abuse" as in Tennessee and perhaps Utah's existing law includes that. But the article doesn't say Utah's existing law includes that term. So I have to go with N/A here.

5. The state where library size impacts a child's ability to enter without permission. The article mentions the Donnelly Public Library in Idaho had to require parental permission because they lacked space to separate materials. So Idaho.

6. The state aiming to replace a patchwork approach with a uniform process and requiring lists. South Carolina's new regulations are described as creating a uniform process to replace a patchwork approach, and they must keep a list of all materials. So South Carolina.

7. The state where libraries might face financial strain due to legal reviews. The article discusses Idaho's libraries possibly needing lawyers to review complaints, leading to potential costs. Saba Baig mentions concerns about costs, including legal fees if litigation happens. So Idaho.

8. The classic novel mentioned as frequently challenged nationwide, like "Beloved". The article says "Beloved" by Toni Morrison is an example of a challenged book but considered a masterpiece. So "Beloved".

9. The Idaho state representative who sponsored the bill requiring separate areas for obscene materials. The article mentions Idaho's bill sponsor is Jaron Crane. So Jaron Crane.

10. The state where agencies must prioritize protecting children over other considerations. Utah's law explicitly says they should prioritize protecting children from pornography over other considerations. So Utah.

Wait, but let me go back through each question again to confirm.

1. Utah – correct.

2. Idaho's statute from the 1970s: the question asks for the year. Since it's the 1970s, not a specific year, answer is N/A. Yes.

3. South Carolina – correct.

4. The overlapping sexual topic between Utah and Tennessee: since Utah has "sex or masturbation", Tennessee has "sexual conduct" and "sadomasochistic abuse". No overlap, so N/A. But maybe I missed a term. Wait, the article says in Tennessee's law: "descriptions or depictions of sexual conduct, 'sexual excitement,' excess violence or sadomasochistic abuse cannot be part..." So "sexual conduct" is in Tennessee. Utah's law includes "descriptions of sex or masturbation". The term "sexual conduct" may encompass "sex" but they are different terms. So N/A.

5. Idaho – correct.

6. South Carolina – correct.

7. Idaho – correct.

8. "Beloved" by Toni Morrison – correct.

9. Jaron Crane – correct.

10. Utah – correct.

Okay, that seems to fit.
