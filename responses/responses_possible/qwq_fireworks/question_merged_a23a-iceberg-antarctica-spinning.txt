Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I answer each question exactly based on the text and not use any outside knowledge.

1. **Question 1**: The question is about the specific aspect of the Taylor column's formation that prevents A23a from drifting. The article mentions that the Taylor column forms around a seamount, creating a stagnant cylinder of fluids. The key aspect here is the stagnant cylinder because it keeps the iceberg in place. So the answer should be "stagnant cylinder of fluids".

2. **Question 2**: The rotating feature causing a full revolution in the time Earth orbits the Sun (a year). The article says the iceberg spins about 15 degrees per day, completing a full rotation in 24 days. Wait, the question mentions a full revolution in Earth's orbit time (year), but the text says 24 days. Hmm, maybe a mistake here? Wait, the question might be a trick. The Taylor column is causing the rotation. The answer is "Taylor column".

3. **Question 3**: Impact on sea levels if A23a melts. The article states that icebergs from floating ice shelves don't significantly contribute to sea level rise because they're already floating. So the answer is "no significant contribution compared to land-based glaciers which do contribute".

4. **Question 4**: Historical event in the 80s leading to A23a. The article says A23a broke off from A23, which calved in 1986. The event is the 1986 calving from the Filchner Ice Shelf.

5. **Question 5**: Similarity between robotic float and A23a's fate. The study mentioned a float trapped in a Taylor column for 4 years near the same area. The similarity is being trapped in a Taylor column for an extended period.

6. **Question 6**: Phenomenon over the 100km seamount. The article clearly states it's a Taylor column.

7. **Question 7**: Years the robotic float was trapped. The article says four years.

8. **Question 8**: Diameter of the underwater mountain. The article says 100 kilometers across.

9. **Question 9**: Who surmised A23a would go like other icebergs? Christopher Shuman is mentioned here, pointing to A68a's example.

10. **Question 10**: The current icebergs get sucked into. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current is named.

Wait, let me double-check each against the text to ensure accuracy. For question 2, the rotation rate is 15 degrees per day, so full rotation in 24 days. The question mentions "time it takes Earth to orbit the Sun" (a year), which doesn't match. But the question is about what's causing the rotation. The answer is still Taylor column because that's the feature causing it. Maybe the question has a typo but the answer is as per the text. All other answers seem to fit.
