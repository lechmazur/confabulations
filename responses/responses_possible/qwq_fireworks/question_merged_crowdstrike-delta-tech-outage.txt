Okay, let me start going through the questions one by one, using only the provided article. 

Question 1: What role did Delta's decision to decline CrowdStrike's offer of on-site help play in the narrative according to their letter? The article mentions that CrowdStrike's letter said Delta's refusal contributed to a misleading narrative that they're responsible for Delta's IT decisions. So the answer is that it contributed to the narrative that CrowdStrike is responsible for Delta's decisions.

Question 2: How does the DoT's investigation complicate Delta's legal claims? The article states that the investigation might reveal why Delta struggled more, possibly showing Delta's vulnerabilities. So the investigation could bring out details that make Delta's claims harder, like their systems being more dependent on the affected software.

Question 3: Compare the financial impact ($500M estimated by CEO) to the liability limit ($10M proposed by CrowdStrike). The answer is the estimated impact is much higher than the proposed limit.

Question 4: Compare percentage of flights canceled by Delta vs peers. The article says Delta canceled 37%, while others like American and United recovered faster. But the exact percentage for peers isn't given. Wait, the question is about the percentage of canceled flights compared to peers. The article only states Delta's 37% and that others rebounded faster. Since the exact percentages for others aren't provided, maybe it's N/A? Wait, the article says "many carriers recovered within a day or two" but doesn't give their cancellation percentages. So the answer would be N/A because the exact percentage isn't provided for peers.

Wait, but the question is how Delta's percentage compares. The article says Delta had 37% canceled, while others like American and United were back in a day or two. Since their cancellations weren't as high, maybe the answer is Delta's was higher. But the question is about the percentage comparison. Since the exact numbers for others aren't given, maybe the answer is N/A? Hmm, need to check the text again. The article says "many carriers recovered within a day or two" but doesn't state their cancellation percentages. So the comparison can't be made numerically, so N/A?

Wait the question is "how does the percentage... compare to its peers during the same incident?" Since the article only gives Delta's 37% and mentions others recovered faster but not their cancellation rates, I can't state the exact percentage comparison. So answer N/A.

Question 5: Compare duration of recovery. Delta took four days, others like American and United were back in 1-2 days. So Delta's duration was longer. The answer is Delta's recovery was longer.

Question 6: Ratio of canceled to delayed flights. The article states Delta canceled ~5,000 flights (37% of schedule), and about 75% of remaining flights were delayed. Wait, total flights: let's see. The 5k canceled is 37% of schedule. The remaining 63% would be the flights not canceled. Of those remaining, 75% were delayed. So delayed flights are 75% of 63%, which is ~47.25% of total schedule. The canceled were 37%, so the ratio is 37 canceled : 47.25 delayed. But the question is during the four-day disruption period. The ratio would be canceled (5k) vs delayed (75% of remaining flights). But the exact numbers might not be directly given. Wait, the question is the ratio of canceled to delayed flights. The text says "about three in four of the airline's remaining flights were delayed." So remaining flights are total flights minus canceled. Let me see: total flights would be 5000 / 0.37 ≈ 13,513 total flights. Remaining flights: 13,513 - 5000 = 8,513. 75% of those were delayed: 6,385 delayed. So canceled (5k) vs delayed (6,385). Ratio would be approximately 5:6.385, but the exact numbers aren't given. The article says "about three in four of the remaining were delayed," so the ratio is 1 (canceled) to 0.75 (delayed) of remaining. Wait, the canceled are separate. The ratio is 5000 canceled vs (0.75 * remaining). But the exact ratio isn't stated. The article says "about three in four of the remaining flights were delayed." So remaining flights: 100% - canceled (37%) = 63% remaining. Of those 63%, 75% delayed, so 47.25% of total were delayed. So the ratio of canceled (37%) to delayed (47.25%) is 37:47.25, simplifying to roughly 0.78:1. But the question is asking for the ratio during the four-day period. The article says "about three in four of the airline's remaining flights were delayed," so the ratio of canceled to delayed is (canceled) : (delayed) = 1 : (0.75/(1-0.37))? Not sure. Alternatively, the canceled flights are 37%, and the delayed are 75% of the remaining 63%: so 0.75 * 63% = 47.25%. So the ratio is 37:47.25, which simplifies to roughly 0.78:1. But the question might be phrased as canceled vs delayed, so the answer would be 1 to 0.75 (since for every canceled flight, 0.75 delayed?), but I'm not sure. Wait, the exact numbers are not given. The article says "about three in four of the remaining flights were delayed." So remaining flights are 63% (since 37% were canceled). Of those 63%, 75% delayed. So the total delayed is 47.25% of total. So canceled is 37%, delayed is 47.25%. So the ratio is 37 to 47.25, which can be written as approximately 0.78:1. But the question is asking for the ratio, so maybe "canceled were fewer than delayed" or the exact numbers? Since the question asks for the ratio, but the article doesn't state it numerically, perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "how does the percentage of flights canceled by the affected airline compare to its peers during the same incident?" Wait no, question 6 is ratio of canceled to delayed. The article gives the percentages, so maybe 37% canceled vs 47.25% delayed, so the ratio is 37:47, which simplifies to 74:94 or 37:47.25. But the question is the ratio, so maybe 37 to 47.25, but the answer should be in the form like "approximately 0.78:1" but since the article doesn't state it exactly, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait no, the article does give the percentages. Let me recheck the text. The text says "canceled about 5,000 flights, about 37 percent of its schedule... About three in four of the airline's remaining flights were delayed." So the remaining flights are 63% (100-37). 3/4 of that is 47.25% of total. So canceled (37%) vs delayed (47.25%). The ratio is 37:47.25, which can be approximated as 37 to 47, or simplified by dividing both by 37: 1 to 1.28. So the ratio is approximately 1:1.28. But the question might just want the numbers given, so "37% canceled vs 47% delayed" but as a ratio, maybe written as "approximately 37:47" or "1:1.3". But the article doesn't explicitly state the ratio, so perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, the question asks for the ratio, which can be calculated from the given percentages. Since the article provides the percentages, even if it's not explicitly stated as a ratio, it can be inferred. So the answer would be 37% canceled vs 47.25% delayed, so the ratio is 37:47.25, which simplifies to approximately 0.78:1. But the question might want it in whole numbers. Alternatively, the exact numbers are 5,000 canceled and 0.75*(total flights - 5,000) delayed. Let me compute total flights: 5000 is 37%, so total is 5000 /0.37 ≈13,513.5. Remaining flights: ~8,513.5. 75% of that is ~6,385 delayed. So 5000 canceled vs 6,385 delayed. The ratio is 5000:6385 ≈ 0.783:1. So the ratio is about 0.78:1. But since the question is asking for the ratio, perhaps the answer is "approximately 0.78:1" but the article doesn't give the exact ratio, so maybe "37% canceled vs 47% delayed" but the question is ratio. Alternatively, the question may accept the percentage comparison. The answer should be in terms of the numbers given. Since the article states the percentages, the ratio can be calculated, so the answer is "37% canceled vs 47.25% delayed" but as a ratio, maybe "37:47" or "approximately 0.78:1". The question might just want the comparison in terms of the numbers provided. The article says "three in four of the remaining flights were delayed," so the ratio of canceled to delayed is (37%) : (0.75*(63%)) = 37 : 47.25. So the answer is "approximately 0.78:1" but since the question might want the exact numbers as per the article's given data, maybe "37% canceled and 47% delayed" but as a ratio, perhaps "37 to 47". Since the question asks for the ratio, the answer should be "37:47" or similar. Alternatively, the question might accept "canceled were fewer than delayed" but the question specifically asks for the ratio. Hmm, maybe I need to write the exact numbers as per the article. The answer would be "37% canceled vs 47% delayed" but phrased as a ratio. Alternatively, the question wants the actual numbers of flights. The article says 5000 canceled and 75% of remaining (which is 75% of 13,513-5000=8513, so 6,385). So 5000:6385, which is approximately 0.78:1. But since the article doesn't explicitly state this ratio, perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait no, the article gives the percentages, so it can be inferred. So the answer is "37% canceled vs 47% delayed" but as a ratio, maybe "approximately 0.78:1". Alternatively, the exact ratio can be written as 37:47.25. Since the question requires a direct answer, I think the correct answer is "approximately 0.78:1" but the article might not state it exactly. Wait, the question is asking for the ratio of canceled to delayed flights. The article says "about three in four of the remaining flights were delayed". The remaining flights are those not canceled, so the delayed are 75% of (100% - 37%) = 63%, so 47.25%. The canceled are 37%. So the ratio is 37:47.25. So the answer would be "37 to 47" or "37:47" approximately. The question might just want the numbers given in the text, so 37% canceled vs 75% of remaining (which is 47.25% of total). So the ratio is 37:47.25. The answer should be written as "37% canceled to 47% delayed" but as a ratio, maybe "37:47". Since the question asks for the ratio, that's the best I can get from the given data. So I'll go with "37:47".

Question 7: Compare percentage of schedule affected (Delta's 37% vs Southwest's in 2022). The article says Southwest canceled nearly 17,000 flights over 10 days, which was more than a third of their scheduled flights. So both had over a third. The exact percentage for Southwest isn't given, but "more than a third" which is over 33.3%. Delta had 37%, so Delta's was higher. The answer is Delta's was higher (37% vs "more than a third", so maybe around 34% or so, but since Southwest's is stated as "more than a third", but exact isn't given. The article says "more than a third of those scheduled", so the exact percentage isn't specified. But the question is comparing Delta's 37% to Southwest's "more than a third". Since "more than a third" could be 34% or higher, but the article doesn't specify. However, the question asks how the percentage compares. Since Delta's is 37%, which is more than a third, but Southwest's is also more than a third, but the exact comparison isn't possible unless we know Southwest's exact percentage. The article says "more than a third", so maybe the answer is N/A because the exact percentage for Southwest isn't given. Wait, but the question is asking how Delta's percentage compares to Southwest's. The article states that Southwest's was "more than a third" (so over 33.3%), and Delta's was 37%, so Delta's was higher. Since "more than a third" could be, for example, 34%, which is less than 37%, so Delta's was higher. Alternatively, if Southwest's was 35%, same. The exact figure isn't given, but the text says "more than a third", so Delta's 37% is higher than "more than a third", but since Southwest's exact percentage isn't given, can we infer that Delta's was higher? The article says "more than a third" which is a range. Since 37% is within that range, but the exact value isn't given. Therefore, the comparison can't be definitively stated. So maybe N/A? Or since the article says Southwest had "more than a third" and Delta had 37%, which is a specific number within that range, so the answer would be Delta's was 37%, which is higher than the minimum of "more than a third" but not necessarily higher than the actual Southwest's percentage. Since the exact percentage isn't given for Southwest, the answer is N/A.

Question 8: Compare the financial impact percentage of affected flights between Delta and Southwest. The question is about the estimated financial impact compared to the cost of Southwest's 2022 disruption in terms of percentage of affected flights. The article says Delta's outage cost $500M and Southwest's disruption in 2022 had nearly 17,000 canceled flights (more than a third). However, the financial impact of Southwest's disruption isn't mentioned. Since the article doesn't provide the financial cost for Southwest, the answer is N/A.

Question 9: Average daily financial impact. The CEO estimated $500M total over four days. So 500M divided by 4 is $125 million per day. The answer is $125 million.

Question 10: Compare the liability limit ($10M) to Delta's daily costs ($125M). The liability limit is less than the daily costs. The answer is the proposed limit is lower.
