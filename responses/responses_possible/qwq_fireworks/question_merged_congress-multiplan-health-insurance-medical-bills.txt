Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly as per the instructions. Let's start with the first question.

1. **What is the connection between Kraft Heinz's lawsuit against Aetna and the broader issues of undisclosed fees in employer-based insurance?**
   The article mentions that Kraft Heinz sued Aetna, claiming the insurer paid claims improperly and kept millions in undisclosed fees. This directly ties into the broader issue of undisclosed fees in employer-based insurance because the lawsuit is an example of such practices. So the connection is that the lawsuit highlights the issue of undisclosed fees.

2. **Which congressional committee member... cited MultiPlan as an example of opaque fee structures?**
   The article states that Reps. Bobby Scott and Mark DeSaulnier highlighted MultiPlan as an example. Since the question asks for the member, both are mentioned. But the question might expect both names? Wait, the exact question says "which congressional committee member" (singular), so maybe the answer is both? Wait, the article says "the lawmakers, Representatives Bobby Scott of Virginia and Mark DeSaulnier of California, both Democrats in leadership positions on a House committee..." So they are both members. But the question asks for "congressional committee member" (singular). Maybe the answer is both? Wait, but the question is phrased as "which congressional committee member" so maybe the answer includes both names? The question might be expecting both. Alternatively, maybe the leadership positions mean they are committee members. The answer should list both names separated by "and".

3. **In the case involving UnitedHealthcare and MultiPlan, what was the ratio of the fee charged to the employer compared to the reduced hospital bill?**
   The article states that UnitedHealthcare used MultiPlan to cut a $152,594 bill to $7,879, then charged a $50,650 fee. The reduced bill is $7,879, the fee is $50,650. The ratio would be fee/reduced bill. But the question asks for the ratio of the fee compared to the reduced bill. So $50,650 fee vs. $7,879. The ratio is 50,650:7,879. Simplify? Maybe just state the numbers as given. The answer is the fee was higher than the reduced bill. The question asks for the ratio, so perhaps 50,650 to 7,879, but maybe just the numbers as presented.

4. **What type of legal proceeding has MultiPlan become involved in that is similar to cases against companies accused of driving up rents and fueling the opioid crisis?**
   The article mentions that a federal panel consolidated cases into a single large proceeding, similar to those against companies in those other cases. The term used is "consolidated the cases into a single large proceeding." But the question refers to the type of proceeding. The article says "consolidated the cases into a single large proceeding, similar to those against companies accused of driving up rents and fueling the opioid crisis." The answer is "consolidated class-action" or "multi-district litigation"? The article says "consolidated the cases into a single large proceeding", so perhaps the answer is "consolidated class-action lawsuits" or "a consolidated proceeding". The exact term isn't given, but the article says "consolidated the cases into a single large proceeding, similar to those against companies..." So the answer is "consolidated class-action lawsuits" but maybe just "consolidated proceedings". The question asks for the type, so the answer is "consolidated proceedings" as per the article's wording.

5. **What action did MultiPlan's CEO acknowledge taking in response to media scrutiny, as revealed during an investor call?**
   The CEO, Travis Dalton, mentioned establishing a corporate and government affairs team with PR and lobbying. The answer is "established a corporate and government affairs team, including PR and lobbying."

6. **What type of health coverage arrangement does MultiPlan's business model focus on?**
   The article says MultiPlan focuses on "self-funded" employer-based insurance. The exact term is "employer that 'self-funds,' meaning it pays medical claims with its own money..." So the answer is "self-funded employer-based insurance" or "self-funded employer health plans".

7. **What legal requirement do companies operating health plans for employees have regarding service providers and their fees?**
   The article states that companies must "monitor service providers and ensure their fees are reasonable." So the requirement is to "monitor service providers and ensure their fees are reasonable."

8. **What specific concern did members of two Senate committees express about MultiPlan's business model in their May letter?**
   The committees expressed concern about an "improper conflict of interest." The article says "Members of two Senate committees... expressed concern that MultiPlan's business model could 'result in an improper conflict of interest.'"

9. **What was the outcome of the lawsuit filed by trustees for a union health plan against Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts?**
   The article mentions that the Massachusetts lawsuit was dismissed. So the outcome is "dismissed."

10. **What challenge do employers face when trying to understand the charges related to their health plans?**
    The article states employers have trouble obtaining and understanding the data showing what they've been charged and why. The challenge is "difficulty obtaining and understanding data showing charges and reasons."
