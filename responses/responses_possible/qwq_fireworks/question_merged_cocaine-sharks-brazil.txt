Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article provided. Let's start with the first question.

1. The question asks about the common factor between the study and the documentary "Cocaine Sharks" regarding the source of cocaine in marine environments. The article mentions that the study was inspired by the documentary, which looked into sharks ingesting cocaine from packages lost or dumped in the waters. The study's researchers also considered similar sources like illegal labs or traffickers. So the common factor is the cocaine packages lost or dumped by traffickers.

2. The significance of the 100 times higher cocaine levels is stated as indicating chronic exposure. The article says the high levels show chronic exposure, so that's the key point here.

3. The shark species often consumed by locals in Rio is the Brazilian sharpnose. The article mentions that the sharks tested were Brazilian sharpnose, which locals eat.

4. Dr. Hauser Davis believes the majority of cocaine comes from human excretion. She says the major source is urine and feces from people using cocaine, not just illegal labs or lost packages.

5. The researcher who commented on the small sample size was Daniel Snow. He remarked that 13 animals isn't too big a stretch but still notable. The article mentions he's from the University of Nebraska.

6. The article contrasts public reaction by noting that cocaine gets attention but other pollutants are bigger issues. Tracy Fanara points out that cocaine draws interest, but there are more serious pollutants like pharmaceuticals and pesticides.

7. The environmental factor contributing to cocaine release is wastewater treatment plants not filtering it. The text says these plants can't effectively filter the substances, leading to release into oceans.

8. The limitation of wastewater plants is their inability to filter cocaine. The article states they can't effectively filter these substances, so they end up in the ocean.

9. The study relates to broader concerns by highlighting the need to test other animals and pollutants. Dr. Hauser Davis wants to test sharks, rays, and turtles, showing it's part of a larger pollution issue.

10. The researcher who drew the parallel between cocaine in water and effects on organisms is Daniel Snow. He mentioned that chemicals in water can affect aquatic life, like how he studied meth in wastewater before.

Wait, let me check each answer again against the text to ensure accuracy. For question 10, the article says Daniel Snow was among the first to measure meth in wastewater and commented on the chemicals affecting organisms. Yes, that's correct. Okay, I think all answers are directly from the text without any assumptions beyond what's stated.
