Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article. I need to make sure I only use the information provided and follow the strict format. Let me start with the first question.

1. How does the White House's definition of "corporate landlords" create a potential loophole in the proposed rent cap policy?

Looking at the article, the White House defines corporate landlords as those with over 50 rental units. The loophole might be that landlords with 50 or fewer units aren't affected, so they could avoid the cap. The article mentions exemptions for new construction, but the loophole question is about the definition. So the answer is that landlords with 50 or fewer units aren't subject to the cap, creating a loophole. Wait, but the question is about how the definition itself creates a loophole. The article says the policy affects those with over 50 units. So the loophole is that smaller landlords (under 50 units) aren't included. But the question is phrased as how the definition creates a loophole. So the answer is that the threshold of 50 units allows landlords with fewer units to avoid the cap, which is a loophole.

2. How does Moses Kagan's perspective on the proposed rent cap differ from the majority of industry critiques mentioned in the article?

The majority of industry critiques (like real estate groups, economists) say it's counterproductive, harmful to supply, etc. Moses Kagan, from Adaptive Realty, says most deals would still look good even with a 5% cap. The article states he argues that many investors expect lower growth rates. So his perspective is more positive or less critical compared to others. The majority think it's bad, but he thinks it's manageable. So the difference is that he believes large landlords can still profit under the cap, unlike others who see it as harmful.

3. What connection does the article draw between zoning deregulation and federal transportation funding?

The article mentions the Transportation Department's $6 billion grants in 2022 that awarded more funds to jurisdictions that deregulated zoning and land-use policies. So the connection is that federal transportation funding is tied to zoning deregulation (more funding for places that reduce zoning constraints). The answer is that states/localities getting more federal transportation funds if they deregulate zoning to allow more housing.

4. How does the article suggest the proposed rent cap policy might affect the profitability calculations of real estate investors?

The article says many real estate investors target projects profitable with growth below 5%, so the cap might not hurt them. But Jonathan Woloshin (UBS) says capping rent could make the economics not reflect development risks, leading capital to go elsewhere. So the answer is that some investors already target below 5%, but others might see reduced profitability leading to capital moving away.

Wait, the question is how the article suggests it affects profitability calculations. The article states that Moses Kagan thinks most deals would still look good, implying profitability isn't too affected. But Woloshin argues that capping rents could make the economics unattractive. So the answer might be that it could make some projects less profitable, but others (like those expecting lower growth) are unaffected. But the question is how the article suggests the policy affects the calculations. The article says "many real estate investors put their money in projects that are expected to be profitable with annual rent growth assumptions below that rate." So the answer is that the cap aligns with some investors' existing assumptions, so profitability isn't as impacted for them. But the article also mentions Woloshin's view that it might make capital go elsewhere, so the effect is mixed. The question is about how the article suggests it affects their calculations. The answer might be that it could reduce profitability for some but others already expect lower growth. The article says "many real estate investors put their money in projects that are expected to be profitable with annual rent growth assumptions below that rate." So the answer is that the cap (5%) is within the growth assumptions of many investors, so their calculations may not be significantly affected. But the question is how the policy affects their calculations. So the answer is that the 5% cap aligns with existing growth expectations for many, so profitability calculations remain viable for those projects. But Woloshin's critique is separate. The question is about the article's suggestion, so the answer is that it might not impact many since their expected growth is below 5%.

5. How does the article suggest the proposed national housing construction fund might address financing constraints in housing development?

The article says the fund would create a national market for construction financing loans backed by federal government, providing safety for investors and lower credit costs, similar to the residential mortgage market. So the answer is that federal backing lowers costs and provides security, making financing more accessible.

6. How does the article suggest the proposed rent cap policy might affect the allocation of developer capital according to Jonathan Woloshin?

Woloshin's view is that if rents are capped, the economics of development aren't reflective of risks, so capital will go elsewhere. The answer is that it could lead capital to move away from housing development.

7. How does the article contrast the White House's approach to housing affordability with economists' traditional views on rent control?

The White House proposes rent caps, but economists (traditional view) see rent control as backfiring, not reducing prices for new tenants and causing shortages. The article says economists consider rent control taboo, citing research showing backfires. The answer is that the White House supports rent caps while economists traditionally oppose them due to backfiring effects.

8. What connection does the article draw between the proposed rent cap policy and federal tax breaks based on property depreciation?

The policy gives corporate landlords a choice: cap rents at 5% or lose tax breaks based on depreciation. So the connection is that tax breaks are contingent on accepting the rent cap. The answer is that tax breaks are made contingent on complying with the rent cap.

9. How does the article contrast the potential effects of the rent cap policy on existing tenants versus new tenants?

Existing tenants get capped rent increases, but the article mentions economists' point that rent control can fail to reduce prices for new tenants. The Harvard report notes that existing tenants are protected but new tenants might not benefit. The answer is that existing tenants see capped increases but new tenants may not see reduced prices.

10. What connection does the article draw between the proposed rent cap policy and the construction of new housing units?

The policy includes exemptions for new construction, and the administration argues the two-year cap would help until more units are built. Also, the policy's two-year duration is meant to aid until new units are built. The answer is that the policy exempts new construction and aims to provide temporary relief until new units are built.
