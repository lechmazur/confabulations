Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and follow the strict format. Let's start with the first question.

1. **How does the eligibility of athletes with 46XY DSD condition differ in boxing compared to track and field, according to the article?**
   The article mentions that track and field requires athletes with 46XY DSD to lower their testosterone levels for two years. Boxing's rules don't have such a requirement, just linking eligibility to passport gender. So the answer is that boxing doesn't have testosterone restrictions like track and field.

2. **How did the I.O.C.'s decision to expel the International Boxing Association impact the eligibility rules for the Paris Olympics boxing competition?**
   The article states that after expulsion, the I.O.C. took control but the rules were set by the I.B.A. before. So the eligibility rules remained based on the I.B.A.'s old regulations.

3. **How did the disqualification of Khelif and Lin at the world championships relate to the I.O.C.'s concerns about the boxing association's governance and funding sources?**
   The I.O.C. had issues with the I.B.A.'s reliance on Gazprom and other scandals. The disqualification was done by the I.B.A., which the I.O.C. later expelled, implying the governance issues led to arbitrary decisions.

4. **How did the I.O.C.'s handling of the boxing competition at the Paris Olympics differ from its approach to other sports with gender eligibility issues?**
   The article says the I.O.C. left eligibility rules to individual sports. In boxing, they took over but the rules were still from I.B.A., so maybe other sports have their own rules, while boxing's were outdated and problematic.

5. **Which boxer's victory prompted comments from a national leader about perceived inequalities, despite the athlete's longstanding participation in women's competitions?**
   The Italian PM commented on Khelif's win over Angela Carini, saying the match wasn't equal. So Khelif's victory caused that.

6. **What specific chromosomal pattern did a Russian official claim was the basis for disqualification, though this reasoning was later criticized as arbitrary by Olympic authorities?**
   The Russian president Kremlev mentioned X and Y chromosomes (XY pattern). The I.O.C. called the disqualification arbitrary.

7. **Which governing body's expulsion led to a situation where outdated eligibility rules remained in effect for the Paris Olympics?**
   The I.B.A. was expelled, but their old rules were still used for Paris.

8. **What physiological condition, mentioned in relation to track and field regulations, might be relevant to the boxing controversy without being explicitly linked?**
   The 46XY DSD condition is mentioned in track and field's context, which is the same as discussed in boxing.

9. **How does the timing of test results from the 2022 world championships relate to the controversy surrounding the 2023 disqualifications?**
   In 2022, results came after the event, so they weren't disqualified then. In 2023, they were disqualified during, which was inconsistent.

10. **Which athlete's decision not to pursue legal action inadvertently strengthened the contested ruling against their eligibility?**
    Lin didn't challenge her disqualification, so the ruling stood without appeal, unlike Khelif who withdrew her appeal.

Now, I need to make sure each answer is concise and only uses the article's info. Let me check each question again to avoid missing any details.
