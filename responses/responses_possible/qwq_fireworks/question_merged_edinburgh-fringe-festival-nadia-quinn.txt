Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. I need to make sure I don't use any outside knowledge and stick strictly to the text.

1. **Question 1**: The cancellation of her initial venue led her to a larger space. The article says she booked a basement in New Town which had a capacity for 80, which was too large. The initial venue was a small bar, so the cancellation made her take a bigger venue that exceeded her needs.

2. **Question 2**: The song mentioned when she performed on the streets was "I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)" by the Proclaimers, which is called the Scottish national anthem. That's the culturally relevant one.

3. **Question 3**: Experienced performers told her to pace herself, not stay out late. But she ignored advice and was out all the time, busking and promoting non-stop.

4. **Question 4**: Audience reviews mentioned she loved being there, which contrasts her initial anxiety about feeling overwhelmed or nervous. The text says "what I loved most is how much you could tell she loved being there."

5. **Question 5**: Alex Malaos got booked on comedy panels and opportunities through her efforts. The article says she got him on panels like dysfunctional families, and he mentioned riding her coat-tails.

6. **Question 6**: Her ticket sales went from 2 pre-sold to 24 by the second show, showing her tactics worked. The text states "she had gone from selling two seats in advance to 24, with enough walk-ups..."

7. **Question 7**: The Netflix series "Baby Reindeer" showed humiliation, but Nadia's experience was positive, making her feel alive and hopeful again, contradicting the cautionary tale.

8. **Question 8**: She had her husband hold her poster above his head while she approached people, highlighting the contrast between her innocent look and the flier's racier content like "smoking" and "boobs."

9. **Question 9**: The festival is the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. The article mentions "Fringe Festival in Edinburgh" and "Edinburgh Fringe."

10. **Question 10**: The venue manager canceled because she was asking too many questions. The text says the manager told her that directly.

Now, check each answer against the article to ensure accuracy and that no external info is used. Make sure all answers are direct and follow the format.
