Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. The user provided an article about Anthony Hopkins and his new series "Those About to Die," along with specific questions they want answered based solely on the article. The instructions are strict, so I need to make sure I don't go beyond the text and only use what's given.

Starting with question 1: How does Anthony Hopkins' perception of his own age and career longevity influence his choice of roles, particularly in "Those About to Die"? The article mentions that he plays characters in the "waning of their power" and that his age gives him energy to move forward. He also talks about playing Vespasian, so the connection here is that his perception of his own age influences him to take roles of older, powerful figures. So the answer should be that his perception influences him to take roles of men in the twilight of their lives.

Question 2: How does his perspective on time relate to portraying historical figures like Vespasian? The article states he feels a kinship with figures who came from humble origins, like Vespasian being a mule trader. His background in South Wales and his father's sacrifices make him relate to these characters. So the answer would be his humble origins and shared background with these historical figures.

Question 3: If not Vespasian, which other historical figure might he have played? The article lists past roles like Nixon, Freud, and "The Father." So another historical figure could be someone like Nixon or Freud. Since the question asks for a figure based on his interests, maybe another emperor or political figure. But the text doesn't explicitly say another, so perhaps "N/A" because the question is hypothetical and not stated in the article. Wait, the article mentions he played Nixon and Freud. The question is hypothetical, so maybe it's okay to infer. But the instructions say if it's not in the text, answer N/A. Since the text doesn't suggest another figure, maybe N/A. Hmm, tricky. The article says he plays men in waning power, so maybe another emperor like Julius Caesar? But that's not mentioned. Since the text doesn't specify, better to say N/A.

Question 4: How does his background as a baker's son relate to Vespasian? The article says Vespasian was a mule trader and Hopkins relates because of his own humble origins. So the answer is that both came from humble backgrounds, so he identifies with that aspect.

Question 5: Common thread in recent characters. The article says he plays men in the waning of their power, like Vespasian, Nixon, Freud, etc. So the common thread is characters in the twilight of their power or lives.

Question 6: If Roland Emmerich didn't direct, which other director? The article mentions he worked with someone on "The Two Popes" but doesn't name the director. Since the text doesn't mention other directors he's collaborated with, this would be N/A.

Question 7: Portrayal of Vespasian reflecting views on mortality and legacy. The article states he views his career with a sense of fun and talks about legacy. Vespasian is infirm but purposeful, so Hopkins' view is that legacy is about purpose, not physical strength. The answer would be his focus on purpose over physical decline, showing command despite age.

Question 8: Challenges adapting to stage due to CGI. Hopkins prefers practical effects over CGI. On stage, they can't use CGI, so effects like amphitheater visuals would be hard. Answer: digital effects would be challenging to translate without CGI.

Question 9: Compare his acting approach to others playing historical figures. The article says he doesn't "transmogrify" but presents himself as the character. Others might use method acting. The text doesn't mention other actors' approaches, so N/A.

Question 10: Themes in his memoir. The article mentions his humble origins, career journey, and views on legacy and mortality. Themes would include humble beginnings, career journey, and reflections on aging and legacy.
