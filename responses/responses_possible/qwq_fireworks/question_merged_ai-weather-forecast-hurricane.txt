Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided.

1. **First question**: The A.I. approach vs. traditional supercomputer methods. The article says that A.I. uses learned patterns from historical data instead of current observations and complex calculations. Also, it mentions that GraphCast does in minutes what supercomputers take hours. So the difference is data utilization (learned patterns vs. current data) and speed.

2. **Second question**: Why GraphCast was more accurate. The article states that GraphCast was trained on four decades of European data. The European agency's model might have used real-time data but got it wrong, while the A.I. relied on historical learning. The primary reason is the historical data training.

3. **Third question**: Paul G. Allen's connection. The article mentions Dr. Bretherton works at the Allen Institute for AI. The European Center is the top agency and is adopting AI. Since Allen's institute is involved in AI weather work, maybe they contribute to tech that the European Center uses. The connection is that Bretherton's work at Allen's institute supports the tech the European Center is adopting.

4. **Fourth question**: Impact on film industry. The article mentions Hollywood actors and writers got limits on AI in contracts. If GraphCast improves weather predictions, film could use it to better schedule outdoor shoots around bad weather. The unexpected impact might be using AI weather forecasts for better scheduling, but the article doesn't directly link this. Wait, the article says "Hollywood actors and writers won strict limits on A.I. in contract negotiations, but movie editors and artists face a growing challenge." Maybe the challenge is using AI for editing, but the question is about outdoor shoots. Since the article doesn't mention film scheduling, maybe N/A? Hmm. Wait, the question says "based on the article's information about AI weather forecasting and Hollywood contract negotiations". The Hollywood part mentions challenges for editors/artists, but not outdoor shoots. So maybe N/A? Or maybe the article's mention of AI in weather could imply that better forecasts let them schedule shoots better. But since the article doesn't connect the two, maybe N/A. Need to check again. The question is asking for an unexpected impact from GraphCast on the film industry's scheduling. Since the article doesn't mention film scheduling, answer N/A?

5. **Fifth question**: Ethical concern about using GraphCast for voter turnout during severe weather. The article mentions AI tools in political campaigns for November's election. If GraphCast predicts severe weather, could be used to suppress turnout by knowing which areas to target. The ethical concern is manipulating voter turnout using accurate weather predictions. So the answer is potential misuse of weather predictions to affect voter turnout.

6. **Sixth question**: Parallel between Iranian campaign and GraphCast misuse. The article says OpenAI disrupted an Iranian campaign using their tech for misinformation. Similarly, accurate weather predictions could be misused for spreading fake weather disasters to influence events. The parallel is using AI for misinformation campaigns, like fake weather alerts.

7. **Seventh question**: California's AI safety rules affecting European Center's adoption. The article says California amended a bill for AI safety rules. If applied, maybe stricter regulations could slow down or require changes in how they adopt AI tech. The answer would be that the rules might impose safety requirements, affecting their plans.

8. **Eighth question**: How GraphCast's historical data overcomes chaos. The article says A.I. learns patterns from data, so even though atmosphere is chaotic, the historical data helps spot patterns that traditional methods can't. The answer is learning historical patterns to predict despite chaos.

9. **Ninth question**: GraphCast's training data (40 years) vs. traditional forecast improvements (up to 10 days from 3 decades ago). The potential for AI in long-term climate prediction is that longer historical data could improve long-term forecasts, so the parallel is using historical data for better long-term predictions.

10. **Tenth question**: Bias in blending data vs. political campaigns. The article says traditional models blend data from many sources into a guess. If AI uses biased data, like in political campaigns, it might have similar biases. The parallel is that both involve data blending and potential biases from sources.

Now, checking each question again for exact answers from the text:

1. The article says A.I. uses learned patterns from historical data instead of current observations and complex calculations, and does it faster. So the answer combines those points.

2. The reason is that GraphCast was trained on historical data from the European center, which allowed better prediction than their real-time model. The article mentions that Dr. Lam said they trained on European data, and their model outperformed.

3. Paul G. Allen's Allen Institute has Bretherton, who says the European Center is top but adopting AI. The connection is that Allen's institute's work supports the tech the European Center is adopting. The article states that Bretherton works there and the European Center is adopting AI, so the link is that Allen's involvement via his institute's research contributes to the tech's development, influencing the European Center's adoption.

4. The article's Hollywood part mentions AI challenges for editors/artists, but not scheduling. Since the question combines weather AI and Hollywood contracts, but there's no direct link given, the answer would be N/A. Wait, but maybe the article says "movie editors and artists face a growing challenge" with AI, so maybe AI weather could help scheduling? But the question is about an unexpected impact. Since the article doesn't mention outdoor shoots, answer N/A.

5. The article mentions AI in political campaigns, so combining that with weather predictions, the ethical issue is using weather predictions to manipulate voter turnout (e.g., knowing bad weather areas to suppress turnout). The answer is using weather predictions to influence voter turnout, which is an ethical concern.

6. The Iranian campaign used AI for misinformation. Similarly, GraphCast's accurate predictions could be misused for fake weather info to manipulate public or events. The parallel is spreading misinformation via AI-generated data.

7. California's rules might impose safety requirements, so the European Center would need to comply if adopting GraphCast, affecting their plans. The article says the European Center is adopting AI, so safety rules could impact that.

8. The article says A.I. spots patterns humans can't, so despite chaos, historical data helps predict. The answer is learning historical patterns to predict chaotic systems.

9. The 40 years of data vs traditional extending to 10 days from 3. So AI's longer data could help in long-term climate predictions. The answer is that historical data allows better long-term predictions.

10. Blending data in traditional models (from many sources) might introduce biases, similar to how political AI could use biased data. The parallel is potential biases from data sources in both areas.

Now, ensure all answers are directly from the text and not inferred beyond. Let me check each again:

1. The article says A.I. uses learned patterns from historical data, not real-time data, and is faster. So the difference is data (learned vs current) and speed. Correct.

2. The European agency used their model (supercomputer) but GraphCast, trained on their data, was better. The reason is the training on historical data. Yes.

3. Paul G. Allen's Allen Institute's Bretherton is part of AI weather work, and the European Center is adopting AI. So the connection is that Allen's involvement (his institute's research) supports the tech the European Center is adopting. The article says Bretherton is at Allen's institute and the European Center is adopting AI, so the link is that Allen's institute contributes to the technology.

4. The article doesn't mention film scheduling, so N/A.

5. The article mentions political campaigns using AI, so combining with weather predictions, the ethical concern is using weather data to influence voter turnout. The article doesn't explicitly state this, but the question allows inference based on the two topics. Since the question says "based on the article's information", and the article does mention both AI in politics and weather, the ethical concern is valid. So the answer is using weather predictions to manipulate voter turnout.

6. The parallel is using AI for misinformation (Iranian case) vs. weather predictions being misused similarly. The article mentions the Iranian case, so the parallel is valid.

7. California's rules on AI safety would require compliance, affecting adoption plans. The article says the European Center is adopting AI, so yes.

8. The article says AI learns patterns from data to predict despite chaos. Correct.

9. The 40 years of data vs traditional extending to 10 days (from 3 decades ago). So AI's longer data allows better long-term forecasts. The answer is that historical data improves long-term climate predictions.

10. Blending data in traditional models can have biases, similar to AI in politics using biased data. The article mentions both blending data in traditional models and political AI's potential biases (since campaigns' AI tools failed), so the parallel is valid.
