Okay, I need to answer each of the 10 questions based solely on the provided article. Let me go through each question one by one and find the relevant information in the text.

1. **How did Brock Pierce's personal relationships influence his business dealings in Puerto Rico, particularly in the context of his interactions with Joseph Lipsey III?**  
   The article mentions that Pierce and Lipsey were friends, with Lipsey's wife being friends with Pierce's mother. They collaborated on business ventures, including the W Hotel deal. However, their personal relationship turned sour when Lipsey seized control of the W due to a loan default. So the answer here is that their friendship influenced business dealings, leading to a dispute.

2. **How does Brock Pierce's portrayal of his achievements in Puerto Rico differ from the reality of his business ventures, as evidenced by the state of the NFT art gallery?**  
   Pierce claimed the NFT gallery was the first of its kind, but the article states it was listed for sale and never fully opened. The difference is between his claim of pioneering success versus the reality of it being for sale and struggling.

3. **How did Brock Pierce's public persona and private actions in Puerto Rico create a disconnect between his stated goals and actual achievements?**  
   Publicly, he presented himself as a savior and transformative figure, but privately, he faced legal disputes, unpaid bills, and failed projects. The disconnect is between his public image of success and the reality of his failures.

4. **Which property did Brock Pierce lose control of due to a dispute with an investor who had previously made a promise to Pierce's deceased mother?**  
   The W Hotel. The article says Lipsey, who had promised to support Pierce's mother after her death, ended up seizing the W due to Pierce defaulting on a loan.

5. **What item designed by a prominent Spanish architect sits unused in the atrium of a shuttered resort that was once central to Brock Pierce's vision for Puerto Rico?**  
   The article mentions a $17,000 lounge chair designed by a prominent Spanish architect collecting dust in the atrium of the W Hotel.

6. **How does the fate of Brock Pierce's yacht mirror the trajectory of his broader business ventures in Puerto Rico?**  
   The yacht was sinking and had unpaid repairs, similar to his failing ventures like the W Hotel and other projects that faced financial issues and legal disputes.

7. **How does the story of Brock Pierce's birthday celebration relate to the loss of control over a key investment in Vieques?**  
   Pierce spent borrowed money on a lavish birthday party instead of the intended investment, leading Lipsey to seize the W Hotel as collateral.

8. **How does the fate of Pierce's NFT gallery reflect the broader trajectory of his business ventures in Puerto Rico?**  
   The gallery, like other projects (hotel, hospital), was underdeveloped, faced financial issues, and was put up for sale, showing a pattern of unfulfilled promises and failures.

9. **How does the story of Pierce's armed guard at the Hacienda Tamarindo connect to broader concerns about his mental state and business practices?**  
   The guard was allegedly there due to a cult's influence, indicating possible mental instability. The incident also shows erratic business practices, like the dispute with Lipsey over the hotel.

10. **How does the fate of Pierce's children's museum project connect to both local resistance and his broader real estate strategy?**  
   The museum was bought but left empty, showing poor management and local disappointment. It reflects his strategy of acquiring properties without proper development, leading to backlash.
