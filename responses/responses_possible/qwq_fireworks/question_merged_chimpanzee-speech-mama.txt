Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article provided.

1. The first question is about how the "speech ready" primate vocal tracts challenge previous assumptions. The article mentions that in 2016, scientists found that primate vocal tracts were actually speech-ready, which contradicted Philip Lieberman's earlier claims that their anatomy limited speech. So the answer should reference that shift.

2. The pant-grunt is mentioned by Dr. Fischer as a possible explanation for Johnny and Renata's "mama." She suggests they might be combining pant-grunts instead of forming words. So the answer here is about her counterargument using pant-grunts.

3. Wait, question 3 is the same as question 1? Let me check. Yes, the user listed them as separate questions. The article says the 2016 study showed primate vocal tracts were speech-ready, which challenges the idea that apes can't speak due to anatomy. So same answer as 1, but maybe phrased differently. But I need to follow exactly the text. The answer would still be that it showed their vocal anatomy wasn't the limitation.

4. The scientist who died in 2022 is Philip Lieberman. His death is mentioned, and his argument was about vocal anatomy. The shift to brain capabilities would be after his findings were challenged, so his death influenced the shift.

5. The analysis showed Johnny and Renata's "mama" had consonant-vowel structures, unlike pant-grunts. If pant-grunts are a standard sound, combining them might not form the word-like structure found. The study's analysis suggests their sounds were more structured, countering the pant-grunt idea.

6. Viki's "papa" was just consonants without vowels, while Johnny's had vowels. The earlier experiments didn't analyze the sounds properly, but now with better analysis (like comparing to human voices and using recordings), they found more evidence. So the method evolved from just observing to detailed acoustic analysis.

7. The article says that humans combine consonants and vowels into syllables, which relates to brain capability. The "speech-ready" tracts allow the physical part, but the brain's ability to coordinate is needed. So the monkey's vocal tracts being ready supports that anatomy isn't the barrier, so the focus shifts to brain.

8. The article states humans can learn new sounds, which is unique. But chimps like Johnny and Renata learned "mama," showing they can learn sounds from others, challenging human uniqueness in that aspect.

9. The debate is whether apes lack brain capabilities. The vocalizations of Johnny and Renata show they can form consonant-vowel combinations, suggesting their brains might have some capacity, thus challenging the idea that their brains are lacking.

10. The article mentions humans can send coordinated commands to jaw/throat for speech. The chimps' "mama" uses consonant-vowel combinations, which requires such coordination, so their ability relates to that human trait, suggesting some brain capacity exists.

Now, check each answer against the article's text to ensure accuracy and that they're direct answers. Avoid adding anything not in the text. If any question can't be answered, use N/A. Let's see:

1. The "speech-ready" finding contradicts Lieberman's anatomical limitation claim. Answer: It showed that primate vocal tracts were capable of speech, challenging the idea that their anatomy prevented speech.

2. Dr. Fischer suggests they used pant-grunts, not learned words. Answer: She argues they combined pant-grunts instead of forming words.

3. Same as 1. Answer same.

4. Philip Lieberman. Answer: Philip Lieberman.

5. Their vocalizations had consonant-vowel structures, unlike pant-grunts. Answer: The vocalizations had consonant-vowel structures, unlike pant-grunts.

6. Viki's lacked vowels, Johnny's had them; better analysis methods now. Answer: It reflects improved acoustic analysis methods over earlier unanalyzed claims.

7. Speech-ready tracts allow physical production, requiring brain coordination. Answer: It indicates anatomy isn't a barrier, focusing on brain's role in combining sounds.

8. Chimps learned "mama," showing they can learn sounds. Answer: It shows apes can learn new vocalizations from others.

9. Their vocalizations suggest brain capability for speech elements. Answer: It provides evidence apes have some brain capacity for speech components.

10. Chimps' "mama" uses coordinated jaw/throat movements. Answer: It demonstrates coordinated commands to produce consonant-vowel combinations.

Wait, need to ensure all answers are in the article. Let me check each point again:

For question 5, the article says Fischer suggests pant-grunts. The analysis showed their "mama" was word-like with specific acoustic profiles, so the answer is that their vocalizations had a unique structure that pant-grunts don't, making Fischer's counterargument less valid. So the answer should be that their sounds had a unique acoustic profile not matching pant-grunts.

Hmm, maybe better phrased as the analysis showed their sounds were word-like, not just pant-grunts. So the answer would be that the analysis showed their vocalizations had a unique acoustic profile resembling words, not standard pant-grunts.

But the article says "It's a very particular, very unique acoustic profile. You can't mistake it for something else." So the answer for 5 is that the analysis showed their vocalizations had a unique structure different from pant-grunts, countering the suggestion.

But to keep it concise per instructions, maybe the answer is "The vocalizations had a unique acoustic profile resembling words, not pant-grunts."

But I need to stick strictly to the text. The article states that Ekstrom's team found their sounds more closely resembled human "mama" with consonant-vowel, so the answer for 5 is that the analysis showed they formed consonant-vowel combinations, unlike pant-grunts.

Alternatively, the exact quote from the article: "Unlike Viki, both Johnny and Renata could add a vowel after a consonant." So the answer for 5 is "They could form consonant-vowel combinations, unlike pant-grunts."

Wait, the question is how the analysis challenges Fischer's pant-grunt suggestion. Fischer said they might be combining pant-grunts. The analysis showed their sounds were structured as "mama" with consonant-vowel, so that's different from pant-grunts. So the answer is the analysis showed their vocalizations had a word-like structure with consonant-vowel, not just combined pant-grunts.

But the article says "It looks essentially wordlike" and "a very particular, very unique acoustic profile." So the answer is that the analysis showed their vocalizations had a unique acoustic profile resembling words, which doesn't match pant-grunts.

I think that's better. Let me adjust answers accordingly.
