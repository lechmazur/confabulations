Okay, I need to answer each question based solely on the article provided. Let me go through each question one by one and check the text carefully.

1. The first question asks about a specific maintenance issue symbolizing the building's decline. The article mentions several issues like bad cell service, lack of sunlight, elevator troubles, water fountain issues, pest infestations, and cracked ceilings covered in duct tape. The duct tape on cracks in the ceiling seems symbolic of broader decline because it's a makeshift fix for visible deterioration.

2. The ground lease with Cooper Union requires the building owners to pay increasing rent. In 2018, the rent jumped to $32.5 million and will go up to $41 million by 2028. This increasing financial burden likely contributes to the owners' challenges, maybe forcing them to focus on other priorities instead of maintenance.

3. The question is about a former tenant's departure coinciding with the shift from yuppie success to deterioration. The article mentions that in the late '80s, yuppies wanted to work there, but by the late '90s, Tishman Speyer restored it. However, after Tishman Speyer, new ownership came, leading to current issues. Wait, the text says that in the late '90s, Tishman Speyer improved occupancy, so maybe after they left or sold it? The article states that before Tishman Speyer, in the 1970s it faced foreclosure and the Cloud Club closed. Then in the late '80s, Joan Amenn was there, and later Tishman Speyer took over in the late '90s. The shift might be when Tishman left? Wait, the article says that in 2019, Signa and RFR bought it. Hmm. Alternatively, the Cloud Club's closure in 1940? No, that's too early. Maybe the departure of the Empire State Building's tenants? Wait, the article says that during the Depression, the Empire was called "Empty State" while Chrysler held occupancy. The shift to yuppies was in the late 80s. The deterioration might have started after the 2019 ownership change? The article mentions that after Signa's insolvency, the future is uncertain. Maybe the departure of Tishman Speyer's occupancy? The article says that in the late '90s, Tishman Speyer restored it and occupancy was high, but then new ownership came. The problem is the question asks for a tenant's departure. The article mentions Clune Construction leaving next month (as of the article's writing) but that's recent. The former tenant's departure that coincided with the shift might be when the Cloud Club closed in the 1970s? But the yuppies came later. Alternatively, the article mentions that in the 1970s it faced foreclosure. Maybe the departure of major tenants during that period? But the question is about a specific tenant's departure. The article says that in the late '80s, Joan Amenn was there, and it was still a bragging right. The shift to deterioration might be after the 2019 sale? The article states that the building's occupancy dropped again after Tishman's improvements. Wait, the article says that in the late '90s occupancy was 95%, but later new ownership came. The current issues started after the 2019 sale to Signa and RFR. The problem is the question is looking for a specific tenant's departure. The article mentions that Clune Construction is leaving, but that's recent. The article also mentions that the arcade's mom-and-pop stores were replaced by newer retailers, but their leases weren't renewed. The departure of those mom-and-pop stores might symbolize the shift, but the question is about a tenant's departure. Alternatively, maybe the departure of the Cloud Club's closure (a tenant?) but that was in 1940. Hmm. Maybe the answer is "N/A" since the article doesn't mention a specific tenant's departure causing the shift. Wait, the article says that in the 1970s it faced foreclosure, so maybe a major tenant left then, but the article doesn't name one. Alternatively, the question might refer to the departure of the Empire State Building's tenants, but that's not a tenant of Chrysler. Alternatively, the article says that the Cloud Club shut down in 1940, which was part of the building. Since the Cloud Club was a tenant (or part of the building's amenities), its closure might be the answer. The question says "former tenant's departure", so Cloud Club's closure in 1940 could be it, but the shift to yuppies was later. The timing might not align. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "N/A" because there's no specific tenant mentioned whose departure caused the shift. Wait, the article says that in the late '80s it was still a bragging right, but later in the 2000s? The article mentions that in 2019, ownership changed to Signa and RFR. The problem is the question asks for a former tenant's departure coinciding with the shift from yuppy success to deterioration. The article mentions that in the late '90s, under Tishman, occupancy was high, but then new ownership came. Maybe the departure of Tishman Speyer? The article doesn't explicitly state when they left. The article says "Things started to look up in the late '90s, when Tishman Speyer acquired... but it wouldn't be long before new ownership came in through the lobby's revolving doors once again." So maybe Tishman left, leading to new owners who didn't maintain it. But the question is about a tenant's departure, not the owner's change. Hmm. Maybe the answer is "N/A" because the article doesn't mention a specific tenant's departure causing the shift. Wait, the article mentions that the Cloud Club shut down in 1940, which was part of the building's amenities. If that's considered a tenant's departure, then maybe that's the answer, but the shift to yuppies was later. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is "N/A". Alternatively, the question might refer to the departure of the original tenants after Walter Chrysler's death. The article says "In 1940, Mr. Chrysler died, and his monument started to crumble. New owners didn't maintain the interior, tenants vacated..." So the tenants vacated after 1940, leading to decline. That might be the answer. The question is asking which former tenant's departure coincided with the shift. The answer could be "tenants vacated" but the question wants a specific name. Since the article doesn't name a specific tenant, maybe "N/A". Alternatively, perhaps the answer is "N/A" because there's no specific tenant mentioned. Hmm. This is tricky. Let me check the text again. The article says "tenants vacated and in the 1970s it faced foreclosure proceedings." So the departure of tenants in the 1940s and 70s. But the shift to yuppies was in the late 80s. The current deterioration started after 2019. Maybe the answer is "N/A".

4. The question asks for an architectural feature mentioned in a pop culture reference that mirrors disrepair. The article mentions the ceiling mural by Edward Trumbull in the lobby. It says parts of the ceiling have deteriorated and are covered in duct tape. The ceiling's cracks and duct tape symbolize disrepair, and it's part of the Art Deco style that's a pop culture reference. So the ceiling mural's deterioration is the answer.

5. The building lacks an observation deck, unlike the Empire State and One Vanderbilt. The article states that tourists can't go up, so they crowd the lobby. This reflects struggles with modernization because newer buildings have amenities like observation decks, which the Chrysler lacks, making it less attractive to tourists and tenants seeking modern features.

6. The pop culture reference from a former employee is Sophie Smith's "Hard-Knock Life" reference, where the line mentions the Chrysler Building's top being shiny. But now the building has maintenance issues, so that's an ironic contrast.

7. The elevators have historical significance (part of the original design) but now have issues like getting stuck, which shows both their historical role and current neglect. The article mentions that even in the 80s, elevators were problematic, and today they jam, reflecting both history and current problems.

8. The ground lease rent increased to $32.5 million in 2018.

9. The increase from $32.5M to $41M by 2028. The difference is $8.5M. The percentage increase is (8.5 /32.5)*100. Let me calculate: 8.5 divided by 32.5 is approximately 0.2615, so 26.15%. Rounded to nearest whole number? The question says "percentage increase over this period". The article says it was $32.5 million in 2018 and will be $41 million by 2028. So the increase is $8.5M over 10 years. The percentage is (8.5/32.5)*100 ≈26.15%, so approximately 26%.

10. The question is complex. First, the price per square foot for retail is $350. The total retail area is half of Spaces' 100,000 sq ft. Wait, Spaces occupies over 100k sq ft, but the question says "total area occupied by them equals half area occupied by Spaces". Wait, the question says "assuming it will be exactly $350 per square foot on average, what will be total annual revenue from all retail spaces if total area occupied by them equals half area occupied by Spaces?" So Spaces has 100,000 sq ft. Half of that is 50,000 sq ft. So 50,000 * 350 = $17,500,000 annually. But the article says that the arcade's retail spaces are currently desolate, but the question is hypothetical based on the given assumptions. So the answer would be 17,500,000. But need to confirm. The article says "Spaces occupies over 100,000 square feet in the building". So half of that is 50,000. 50,000 * 350 = 17,500,000. So the answer is $17,500,000.
