Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. I need to make sure each answer is directly from the text or logically inferred without any external info.

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions that private banks "trumpet the cells' lifesaving possibilities" and that sales reps "peddle cord blood as if it were at the medical vanguard." So the misleading strategy is exaggerating the current and future medical uses despite low likelihood. The answer should be about overstating potential uses.

2. **Question 2**: The article says cord blood reps are exempt from kickback laws because insurers don't cover their product. The exact exemption is due to non-insurance coverage. The answer is the exemption related to no insurance coverage.

3. **Question 3**: FDA found issues like bacterial growth in a sterile area and leaky bags. The question specifies "FDA inspectors found at CBR's Tucson..." so the answer is bacterial growth in processing area and improper shipping conditions.

4. **Question 4**: CBR's campaign with Teigen claimed stem cells can treat over 80 conditions. The article states most are rare and not proven for cord blood. The misleading claim is the 80 conditions.

5. **Question 5**: Anna Lazos's case shows contamination and unusable cells. Her sample had E. coli, so the pitfall is contamination leading to unusable samples.

6. **Question 6**: The article mentions Chrissy Teigen's campaign brought in $6.6M. So the celebrity is Chrissy Teigen.

7. **Question 7**: CBR had FDA issues with bacterial growth. The question asks which bank marketed as "biological insurance" (mentioned in intro), so CBR.

8. **Question 8**: CooperSurgical bought CBR's parent for $1.6B, with 2/3 value from cord storage. Answer is CBR (Cord Blood Registry).

9. **Question 9**: CBR has a program for free banking for clinical trial enrollment. The article says Kristin Prins used CBR's program for her son's cerebral palsy trial. So CBR.

10. **Question 10**: Jenna Edwards was charged for 2 years after contamination wasn't disclosed. ViaCord is the bank here.

Wait, need to check each detail again. For question 9, the article says "CBR has a program that offers families in these situations free banking." So yes, CBR. Question 10's answer is ViaCord as per Jenna's case. Let me confirm all points again to avoid mistakes.
