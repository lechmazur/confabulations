Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the strict instructions. Let's start with the first question.

1. The first question asks which military-developed technology is used in the 4DX seats. The article mentions that the chairs use technology first developed for military flight simulators. So the answer should be "military flight simulators".

2. The second question refers to an unexpected sensation related to a horror prequel and a common pest. The article says there are flexible straws that wag and smack ankles, which Diaz describes as simulating a "critter running around the floor". The horror prequel mentioned is "A Quiet Place: Day One". So the answer is "flexible straws smacking ankles" or maybe just "straws smacking ankles".

3. The third question is about the Japanese monster movie's naval scene mirroring the crew's real experiences. The article states that in "Godzilla Minus One", the crew got seasick while filming, and the 4DX version made the director feel sick due to accurate boat swaying. The answer is that the 4DX made the director feel seasick, mirroring the crew's real experience. So "caused seasickness in the director, mirroring the crew's real experiences".

4. The fourth question asks about a war film's 4DX creating tension without intense stimulation. The example given is "Civil War" (though the article mentions "Civil War" directed by Alex Garland, which is about combat journalists). The answer mentions using ceiling fans for a breeze to enhance tension without overstimulation. So "gentle breeze from ceiling fans".

5. The fifth question is about the tornado film's sensory effects mirroring the plot. The article says in "Twisters", the air represents the tornado, and effects build from breeze to violent shaking. The answer could be that the sensory effects escalate with the tornado's development. "Escalating air effects mirroring the tornado's intensification".

6. Sixth question on an action film subverting expectations with seat movements. The example is "Mission: Impossible" where gentle rumbling mid-dialogue signals something's wrong. The answer is "gentle rumbling during dialogue to signal impending danger".

7. Seventh question about a monster movie blurring sound and touch. The article says Godzilla's roars have seat vibrations so the body trembles. So "vibrations in seats synchronized with Godzilla's roars".

8. Eighth question's aspect that's both enhancement and critique. The article mentions critics like Scorsese question if it's still film with added effects. The disaster film's scene where the screen breaks and storm enters might be the answer. The aspect is the 4D effects breaking the fourth wall, so "simulated destruction breaking the theater's boundaries".

9. The ninth question is hypothetical: if CJ didn't start in 2009, their growth would be less. The text says they started as an experiment in 2009 and now have 790 theaters. So the answer is "unlikely significant growth" or "no expansion to 790 theaters".

10. Tenth question on CJ's growth and filmmaker partnerships. The article states more filmmakers are involved now, like Kosinski and "Mission: Impossible". So "increasing filmmaker collaboration drives growth".

Now I need to check each against the article to ensure accuracy. Let me verify each point again quickly.

1. Yes, flight simulators mentioned for the chairs. Correct.
2. Straws and critter reference. Correct.
3. Godzilla's scene causing seasickness in director. Yes.
4. Civil War's breeze with ceiling fans. Correct.
5. Twisters' air as tornado character, escalating effects. Yes.
6. Mission Impossible's rumbling during dialogue. Correct.
7. Godzilla's roar vibrations. Yes.
8. The disaster film's scene where the theater is destroyed, breaking the screen. The article mentions in "Twisters", the storm breaks the wall and the screen is gone. So the aspect is the screen destruction, which is both an effect and a critique (since it's a meta element). So "simulated destruction of the theater screen".
9. Without starting in 2009, they wouldn't have their current growth. So "N/A" because the question is hypothetical, but the article states they started in 2009. Wait, the question is asking what would happen if they hadn't started in 2009. The article says they started then and now have 790. So the answer is they wouldn't have that growth. So "no growth to 790 theaters" or similar.
10. Partnerships with filmmakers are driving growth. Yes, mentioned with Kosinski and others. So "collaborations with filmmakers enhance growth".
