Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the provided article. I need to make sure each answer is directly from the text and follows the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1:** The question asks how the discovery of a singing black hole challenged theories about massive black hole formation via sound waves. The article mentions the black hole's sound waves (B flat) but doesn't explicitly say it challenged formation theories. The challenge was about quasars and black hole formation timing, not the sound itself. So maybe N/A? Wait, the singing black hole's activity produced sound, but the challenge was from quasars. Hmm. The article says the quasars made them rethink formation ideas. The sound waves themselves might not be the challenge. So answer N/A?

Wait, the question specifically mentions the role of sound waves. Since the article doesn't link the sound to challenging formation theories, maybe N/A. But the question is phrased as "how did the discovery... considering the role of sound waves..." Since the sound waves were part of the discovery, but the challenge was about quasars. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** The Webb detected flecks, Chandra found they were quasars. This shows Chandra redefined early universe understanding by identifying those flecks as quasars, leading to rethinking black hole formation. So the answer is that it showed quasars are young galaxies with supermassive black holes, leading to rethinking formation timelines.

3. **Question 3:** The singing black hole emits a B flat note. The article says "an eternal note of B flat." So answer is the black hole in the galaxy cluster 250 million light-years away. The name isn't given, but the question just asks the object. The answer is the black hole mentioned there.

4. **Question 4:** Native American pictographs are linked to the Crab nebula's supernova observed in 1054. The article states the 1054 event was recorded by Chinese, Japanese, and Native American pictographs. So the connection is that the pictographs record the supernova that created the Crab nebula.

5. **Question 5:** The Nobel laureate is Riccardo Giacconi, who created Chandra. The B flat comes from Chandra's discovery. So his vision led to the observatory that found the B flat.

6. **Question 6:** Cassiopeia A's supernova happened 340 years ago (17th century), but no one observed it. The article says "nobody seems to have observed it at the time," and it's providing insights into element formation (shedding elements like iron). So the event is Cassiopeia A's supernova.

7. **Question 7:** The black hole with 80 million suns mass at half a billion years old contradicts formation theories. The article says scientists can't explain how it got so big so fast, so that's the object.

8. **Question 8:** Faulkner's quote is about the past not being dead, and Chandra observes old events (supernovae from centuries ago) which are still affecting now. So the commonality is that both recognize the past's ongoing presence.

9. **Question 9:** The Crab nebula's supernova was recorded by Native American pictographs and Chinese observers. So the object is the Crab nebula.

10. **Question 10:** The article says supernova remnants spread elements like those in our cells. So the relation is that elements in our cells come from supernova-produced elements.

Wait, checking each again:

1. The question specifically ties the challenge to the role of sound waves. Since the article doesn't say the sound waves themselves caused the challenge, but the quasars did. So N/A.

2. The answer should be that Chandra redefined by identifying quasars as young galaxies with SMBHs, leading to rethinking formation theories.

3. The object is the black hole in the galaxy cluster (no name given, but the question just asks the object, so "a black hole" or the specific one? The article says "a singing black hole that had been periodically blowing bubbles...", so the answer is the singing black hole.

4. Connection is the pictographs recorded the supernova that created the Crab.

5. Giacconi's vision led to Chandra, which found the B flat.

6. Cassiopeia A's supernova was unnoticed in the 17th century but now studied for elements.

7. The 80M solar mass BH at early universe contradicts timelines.

8. Both see the past as not dead/ongoing.

9. Crab nebula linked to pictographs and Chinese records.

10. Elements in our cells come from supernova remnants (like iron, oxygen, etc.).
