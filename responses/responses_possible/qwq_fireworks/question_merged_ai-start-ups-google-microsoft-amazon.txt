Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I'm only using the information from the article provided.

1. The first question asks for the primary reason big tech companies are choosing licensing deals over acquisitions to avoid regulatory scrutiny. The article mentions that these deals help them sidestep regulatory scrutiny while trying to get ahead in AI. So the answer is about avoiding scrutiny.

2. The second question is about how the Google-Character deal's financial structure differs from a traditional acquisition in terms of regulatory avoidance. The article says Google paid $3B to license the tech and use $2.5B to buy out shareholders. Unlike a traditional acquisition where they own the company, here they license and buy out shareholders without owning the company. So the difference is they don't take ownership, thus avoiding acquisition scrutiny.

3. Third question compares the ROI timeframe for Character's investors to typical VC investments. The article states investors got a return after two years. Typical VC investments usually take longer, like 5-10 years. So the answer is shorter timeframe.

4. Fourth question: ratio of Inflection employees moving to Microsoft vs those who stayed. The article says Inflection had 70 employees left (so 70 joined Microsoft?), but wait, the article says Inflection had 70 employees who joined Microsoft, and only 2 stayed. Wait, actually, the article says "roughly 70 people joined Microsoft while the rest left?" Wait, the exact line: "Inflection has also hired a new chief executive, but just two employees stayed on while the rest -- roughly 70 people -- joined Microsoft." So 70 joined, 2 stayed. The ratio is 70:2, which simplifies to 35:1. But the question asks for the ratio of those who joined Microsoft to those who remained. So 70 to 2, which is 35:1. But the question might want it as 70:2, but maybe simplified? The article says "roughly 70 people joined Microsoft" and "just two employees stayed on." So the ratio is 70:2, so 35:1. The answer would be 35:1.

5. Fifth question: which startup has the highest discrepancy between licensing deal value and previous private valuation. The article mentions Character.AI was privately valued at $1B, and Google paid $3B. Inflection got $650M but was funded $1.5B. Wait, but the question is about the deal value vs previous valuation. Let's see: Character's deal was $3B vs $1B valuation (so 3x). Inflection's deal was $650M vs their valuation? The article doesn't state Inflection's private valuation, but it says they had raised $1.5B. But valuation isn't the same as funding. Adept got $330M from Amazon, but their valuation isn't mentioned either. The article says Character's investors got a 2.5x return in two years, implying their $1B valuation. So Character's deal value ($3B) vs valuation ($1B) is the highest discrepancy. So the answer is Character.AI.

6. Sixth question: total spent by the three companies on licensing deals vs combined previous valuations. Let's see: Google paid $3B for Character, Microsoft $650M for Inflection, Amazon $330M for Adept. Total is 3B + 650M + 330M = 3,980 million. The previous valuations: Character was $1B, Inflection's valuation isn't stated, but they had $1.5B in funding. Adept's valuation? The article says Adept had raised $414M. But valuations aren't given for Inflection and Adept except Character. So maybe the combined previous valuations are at least $1B (Character) plus others' valuations which aren't given. Since the question is about the total spent vs the combined previous valuations, but since we don't have Inflection and Adept's valuations, maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the article says Character's previous valuation was $1B. For Inflection, the $650M licensing fee was used to reimburse investors who had put in $1.5B. So their valuation might have been higher than $1.5B? Not sure. Since the article doesn't state the valuations for Inflection and Adept, the total previous valuations can't be calculated. So answer is N/A?

Wait, the question says "combined previous valuations of the acquired start-ups". But the article only mentions Character's private valuation. For Inflection, it's not stated. So the total previous valuations would be at least $1B (Character) plus whatever Inflection and Adept's valuations were. Since we don't have those numbers, the comparison can't be made. So answer N/A.

7. Seventh question: percentage of Character owned by Shazeer vs percentage of employees joining Google. Shazeer owns 30-40%, and 20% of employees joined. So the answer is 30-40% vs 20%, so the percentage owned is higher.

8. Eighth question: which startup has highest ratio of licensing deal value to number of employees who joined. Let's see:

- Inflection: $650M, 70 employees joined. 650M /70 ≈ ~$9.29M per employee.

- Adept: $330M, the number of employees who joined? The article says Amazon hired the researchers, but how many? The article mentions Adept's founder and "many of its employees", but exact number isn't given. For Inflection, it's 70 employees. For Character, the deal involved 20% of employees. But Character's total employees? Not stated. However, the article says for Inflection, 70 employees joined Microsoft, so their ratio is highest so far. Since Adept's employee count isn't given, maybe Inflection has the highest. So answer Inflection.

9. Ninth question: average ROI for venture capital firms backing the startups. The article says Character's investors got 2.5x return. For Inflection, the $650M was used to reimburse investors who put in $1.5B. So Inflection's investors got their money back (since they had invested $1.5B and got $650M? Wait, no: Inflection's deal was $650M from Microsoft, which was used to "reimburse" investors who had put in $1.5B. Wait, "Inflection used the $650M licensing fee from Microsoft to reimburse its investors, who had poured $1.5B into the company." So they gave back the $1.5B? Wait, that can't be. Wait the article says "used the $650 million licensing fee... to reimburse its investors, who had poured $1.5 billion into the company." So they used the $650M to pay back the $1.5B? That would mean investors got less than their investment. But the article says "most investors got their money back" in the Adept and Inflection deals. Wait, the article says "Investors in Character... made a two-and-a-half-times return... At the same time, some of the start-ups are struggling to make money... most investors got their money back, people familiar with the transactions said." So for Character: 2.5x. For Inflection: investors got their money back (so 1x). Adept: "Amazon paid Adept at least $330 million to license its technology, with much of the money going toward paying back the $414 million that the start-up had raised from investors." So Adept's investors got their $414M back from the $330M? That doesn't add up. Wait, the article says "much of the money going toward paying back the $414 million". Maybe they paid back the $414M with the $330M? That can't be. Maybe the total deal included more? The article says "Amazon paid Adept at least $330 million to license its technology, with much of the money going toward paying back the $414 million that the start-up had raised from investors." So they might have used the $330M to pay back part of it, but the investors didn't get full return? The article says "most investors got their money back", so perhaps the $330M plus other funds? Not sure, but the article says for Inflection's investors, they got their money back (so 1x), Character's got 2.5x, Adept's got their money back (1x). So average would be (2.5 + 1 +1)/3 = 4.5/3 = 1.5x. But the question is about the average for all mentioned startups. The article also mentions other start-ups but only gives specifics on these three. So the average would be 2.5 (Character) + 1 (Inflection) + 1 (Adept) divided by 3: 1.5x. But the question says "mentioned in the article"—maybe other startups? The article mentions Anthropic and others, but their details aren't given. So based on the three, the average is 1.5x. So the answer would be 1.5x, but the question asks for average ROI. So answer 1.5x or 150%? The article says "two-and-a-half-times return" for Character, so 2.5x, and the others 1x each. So average is (2.5 +1+1)/3 = 1.5x. So answer 1.5x or "1.5 times".
