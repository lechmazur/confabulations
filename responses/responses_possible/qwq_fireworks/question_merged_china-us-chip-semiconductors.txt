Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. I need to make sure each answer is directly from the text or logically inferred without using any outside knowledge.

1. **Primary reason for pushing allies to impose restrictions?** The article mentions that if allies don't adopt similar rules, China could still get technology from elsewhere, and U.S. companies would lose sales. So the main reason is to prevent China from getting tech via other countries and to protect U.S. sales. 

2. **Impact on U.S. companies if allies don't adopt?** The article states that U.S. companies would lose sales, and competitors in allied countries wouldn't be restricted. Also, countries might avoid U.S. components to bypass rules, hurting U.S. firms further.

3. **Draft policy addressing foreign technicians?** The text says the U.S. is trying to get allies to stop their citizens from servicing equipment in Chinese factories. So the policy likely includes restrictions on foreign technicians through allied countries' laws.

4. **Consequence if countries avoid U.S. components?** The article says it could encourage countries to not use American parts to avoid following U.S. rules, leading to reduced U.S. component usage and market share.

5. **ASML and Tokyo Electron's actions?** ASML got nearly half revenue from China, Tokyo Electron sold less advanced tech, showing controls aren't fully effective. This illustrates enforcement challenges as companies adapt by selling lower tech or finding loopholes.

6. **Huawei's advanced chip significance?** The article states Huawei's phone with an advanced chip in 2022 was seen as a challenge, prompting tighter rules. So it shows China's progress despite restrictions, pushing the U.S. to act.

7. **Proposed rules addressing third-party countries?** The draft mentions making it harder for U.S. companies to bypass via subsidiaries in places like Israel, but some countries' shipments remain unaffected. So the rules target subsidiaries but can't fully stop all third-party routes.

8. **Allied country with 50% revenue from China?** ASML is mentioned as having nearly half (so 50%) of Q1 revenue from China. ASML is Dutch, so the country is the Netherlands.

9. **Chinese telecom company's product?** Huawei released a phone with an advanced chip in 2022, prompting tighter rules. So the answer is Huawei.

10. **AI training chips under restrictions?** The draft rules mention restricting memory chips crucial for AI training. So the answer is memory chips.
