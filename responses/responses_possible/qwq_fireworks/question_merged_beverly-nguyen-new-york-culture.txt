Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure each answer is directly from the text and follows the instructions strictly.

1. **Question 1**: The article says Tishman Speyer hired her because she can advise on brand activations involving social media and hospitality. It mentions her multi-hyphenate career and her role as a connector. So the answer is her experience in fashion, editing, merchant roles, and her ability to connect people and create environments that bring people together.

2. **Question 2**: Her Vietnamese immigrant background is mentioned as instilling a drive and "just do it" attitude. Her grandmother's store influenced her eclectic product choices. Also, her upbringing made her a connector. The answer combines these points from the text.

3. **Question 3**: The pop-up at Rockefeller and partnership with Nordstrom increased her visibility. Nordstrom’s VP said she brought cultural roots and nostalgia into her goods. So the strategic partnerships enhanced her influence by exposing her brand to larger platforms.

4. **Question 4**: The article states she has a knack for creating environments that make people feel good. The adviser role at Rockefeller was because of this ability, as noted by Alissa Bersin. So the answer is her knack for creating such environments.

5. **Question 5**: She sourced items from struggling Chinatown stores during the pandemic, which showed business acumen (finding undervalued goods) and community support. The text explicitly mentions this strategy.

6. **Question 6**: She works across fashion, retail, events, etc., and Joshua Glass says she finds synergies. So leveraging synergies across industries contributed to her success as a broker.

7. **Question 7**: Similar to question 4 and 7, but the answer here is her ability to connect people and create enjoyable environments, as mentioned by others like Jenna Lyons and Alissa Bersin.

8. **Question 8**: The pop-up at Rockefeller was her first major placement there, plus the Nordstrom collaboration. This exposure boosted her visibility and influence, as the text states.

9. **Question 9**: Same as question 2. The cultural background and upbringing shaped her approach through drive and family influence.

10. **Question 10**: The article mentions Alissa Bersin noted Nguyen's knack, but the question asks about someone similar to Family Style’s founder (Joshua Glass). The text says both are children of Vietnamese immigrants. So answer is Beverly Nguyen and Joshua Glass, but the question asks for the individual described, which is Joshua Glass since he’s the founder.

Wait, let me check the text again for question 10. The quote from Joshua Glass says both he and Nguyen are children of Vietnamese immigrants. The question asks which individual shares a background similarity with the founder of Family Style. The founder is Joshua Glass, so the answer is Beverly Nguyen, since they share that background. The question is phrased as "which individual described...", so the answer is Beverly Nguyen.
