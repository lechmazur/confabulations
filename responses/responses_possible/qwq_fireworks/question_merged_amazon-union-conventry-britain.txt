Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided.

1. **Question 1:** The central point of contention is about Amazon's actions being heavy-handed and possibly illegal. The article mentions accusations that Amazon was heavy-handed in opposing unionization and that they might have breached British law by displaying QR codes to encourage union cancellation. Amazon defends itself by saying they engage directly with employees. The legal issue is whether their actions were illegal, so the central point is the legality of their anti-union tactics.

2. **Question 2:** Foxglove focuses on big tech companies. Their involvement suggests that the legal challenges are specifically related to tech companies, implying that Amazon's unionization issues have a tech-specific legal angle or that the challenges are systemic in the tech industry.

3. **Question 3:** The claim that Amazon pressured workers to attend seminars suggests they were trying to influence votes by making workers attend sessions where union downsides were highlighted. This indicates a strategy to sway opinion against the union through mandatory or pressured attendance.

4. **Question 4:** Foxglove representing workers shows that legal battles are a key challenge. Tech workers face legal hurdles, possibly due to companies' aggressive anti-union measures, requiring specialized legal groups to navigate complex labor laws.

5. **Question 5:** The article states GMB can't bid again for three years. If they had succeeded by one vote, they wouldn't need to wait; but since they failed, the three-year rule still applies. Wait, the question is hypothetical: if they succeeded, would they have to wait? No, because success would mean recognition. The question is tricky. Wait, the article says GMB can't make another bid for three years after this failed attempt. So regardless of success, the next bid would be after three years from now. But the question is hypothetical about success, so maybe N/A? Wait, no. The question says "if the unionization had succeeded by one vote...", so then they wouldn't need another bid. The question is about how long to wait before making another bid after success. But the article says after a failed bid, they can't for three years. So if they succeeded, there's no need for a new bid. The answer might be N/A because the scenario is hypothetical. Wait, but maybe the question is about the legal requirement regardless. The article says "GMB cannot make another bid for formal recognition for three years" after this effort. So even if they succeeded, they wouldn't need to make another bid. The question is about waiting after a successful bid? Not applicable. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, no. The question is phrased as "how long would GMB have to wait before making another bid for formal recognition?" If the first bid succeeded, they wouldn't need another bid. So the question's premise is invalid (since the bid succeeded), so the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe the question is asking the standard waiting period after a failed bid. The article says "cannot make another bid for three years", so if they had succeeded, the three years wouldn't apply. Therefore, the answer is N/A because the scenario assumes success, so no need to wait. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick, but I think the answer is N/A.

6. **Question 6:** The wage for associates is £12.30-13, national minimum is £11.44. At the lower end, 12.30 - 11.44 = £0.86 more. So the difference is 0.86 pounds per hour.

7. **Question 7:** The vote was 49.5% yes. Total eligible voters were 3,000. To get over 50%, they needed at least 1501 yes votes. Since 49.5% of 3000 is 1485 (since 3000*0.495=1485), they needed 16 more votes (1500 would be exactly 50%, but maybe needs majority, so 1501). The difference is 1500 -1485 = 15, so 15 more votes needed. But the article says they fell short by 28 votes. Wait, the article says "fell short by just 28 votes". So total yes votes were 28 less than needed. So the required yes votes would be total votes needed for majority. The exact numbers: the total votes cast were 2600 (since 2600 employees took part). Wait, the article says "About 2,600 employees... took part in a ballot" and "More than 3,000 eligible". So total eligible is over 3000. The 49.5% yes is of the 2600? Or of the total eligible? The article says "the effort failed, with only 49.5 percent voting in favor in a poll approved by the Central Arbitration Committee". The poll's total participants would be the number who voted, so 2600. But the required majority might be over 50% of all eligible voters. Wait, no, typically, union recognition requires a majority of those voting, not eligible. But the article says the vote was 49.5% of those who voted. To get a majority, they needed 50%+1. So 2600 votes total. 50% of 2600 is 1300, so 1301 needed. They had 49.5% of 2600 = 1287. So 14 more votes needed. But the article states they fell short by 28 votes. Wait, perhaps the article says the difference was 28 votes. So the total yes was (total votes)/2 -14? Wait, the article says "fell short by just 28 votes". So the margin was 28 votes. So the yes votes were (total votes /2) -14. So the needed votes would be 28 more than they got. But the exact calculation is tricky. The question is "how many more 'yes' votes would have been required for the unionization effort to succeed, assuming all eligible workers participated in the ballot?" Wait, the question assumes all eligible (3000) voted. But the article says 2600 took part. So if all 3000 voted, then the required yes votes would be 1501 (50% of 3000 is 1500, so 1501). The actual yes votes if all voted would depend, but the question is hypothetical. The article says they fell short by 28 votes. If the actual yes votes were (total votes -28)/2. But perhaps the article's "fell short by 28" refers to the difference between yes and no votes. So yes votes were 28 less than no votes. If total votes were V, then yes = no -28. Since yes + no = V, so yes = (V -28)/2. To get a majority, yes needs to be > V/2. So they needed 29 more votes (to flip the difference). Wait, if they were 28 behind, adding 29 would make them 1 ahead. Therefore, the answer is 29. But the question is phrased as "how many more yes votes needed" to succeed. So 29. But the article says "fell short by just 28 votes" which might mean the difference between yes and no was 28 votes. So yes votes were 28 less than no. Therefore, to get a majority, they needed 29 more votes. So answer is 29. But the question says "assuming all eligible workers participated in the ballot?" The article says "More than 3,000 Amazon workers were eligible to vote." So total eligible is over 3000. The exact number isn't given, so can't compute exact. But the article says they fell short by 28 votes. So the answer is 28? Wait, maybe the shortfall is the difference needed. If they got 49.5%, then to get to 50.1%, the difference is 0.6% of total votes. But since the exact total votes isn't given (2600 actually voted), but the shortfall is 28 votes. The article states "fell short by just 28 votes", so the answer is 28. The question says "how many more 'yes' votes would have been required", so the answer is 28. But maybe it's 29? Because to flip the majority, you need one more than half. If they were 28 behind, then need 29 more. Hmm. The article says "fell short by just 28 votes" so the answer is 28.

8. **Question 8:** The article says employees work 10-hour shifts, four days a week, plus overtime. Excluding overtime, that's 10*4=40 hours.

9. **Question 9:** GMB started supporting them over a decade, according to Amanda Gearing's quote: "has been supporting Amazon workers for more than a decade". The first protests were in August 2022, and the sit-ins started then. The article says "since then, about 1200 signed up...". But when did GMB start supporting them? Amanda says "for more than a decade". The sit-ins started in 2022. So the time between GMB's support and the first sit-ins is more than a decade. But the question is "how many years passed between the time GMB began supporting Amazon workers and the first impromptu cafeteria sit-ins?" Since GMB has been supporting for more than a decade (so at least 10 years before 2023?), but the sit-ins were in 2022. Wait, the article says "In August 2022, employees walked off the job..." and "GMB organizer Amanda Gearing has been supporting for over a decade". So if she started in 2012 or earlier, the years between would be around 10 years. But the exact number isn't given. The article says "more than a decade", so the answer is "N/A" because the exact number isn't stated. The question asks for the number of years, but "more than a decade" is vague. So answer is N/A.

10. **Question 10:** The wage has increased 20% in the past two years. The question asks the percentage increase since the first walkout over pay, which was in August 2022. The wage increase over the past two years (as of the article's time, which is 2023 or 2024?), so the 20% increase is since the walkout. So the answer is 20%.
