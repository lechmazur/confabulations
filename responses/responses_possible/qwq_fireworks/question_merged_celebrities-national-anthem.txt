Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. Let me start by going through each question and see what the article says.

1. **Question 1:** How did the introduction of electronic public-address systems during WWII affect the anthem's performances? The article mentions that by WWII, PA systems allowed the anthem to be played at every pro game, not just with bands. So the answer is that it increased frequency and made it possible beyond bands.

2. **Question 2:** The proposed solution to disconnect between original purpose and current execution. The author suggests a moratorium on hiring performers, just play music and let the audience participate. So the answer is the temporary moratorium on performers.

3. **Question 3:** Historical context of 1918 World Series. The article says the US had entered WWI, the season was cut short, and the band tried the new version during the seventh-inning stretch. The context is the wartime setting leading to the spontaneous performance.

4. **Question 4:** Tension between tradition and novelty. The article gives examples like Whitney Houston's performance (novelty with tech and jets) versus traditional expectations. Also mentions artists like Feliciano and Hendrix who faced backlash for reinterpretations. The answer is that performers face challenges balancing tradition with innovation, leading to mixed receptions.

5. **Question 5:** National mood and anthem reception. The article notes Houston's performance after the Gulf War got a positive reception because of the national unity at the time. So national mood affects how performances are receivedâ€”better in times of unity or war.

6. **Question 6:** Addressing spectacle vs. patriotism. The solution proposed is to stop hiring celebrities and let the audience participate, making them sing together. So the answer is removing professional performers to force audience participation.

7. **Question 7:** Shifting focus from celebrities to audience. The author suggests not hiring performers, just play the music and let the crowd do it. So the method is eliminating hired singers to make the audience sing.

8. **Question 8:** Impact of tech on anthem tradition. The PA systems allowed broader use beyond bands, and later tech like fighter jets and media coverage turned it into spectacles. So tech increased frequency and turned it into big spectacles.

9. **Question 9:** Relationship with commercialization. The article says anthems are part of big-budget, for-profit events and the DoD funded spectacles. So commercialization ties it to profit and media culture valuing novelty over tradition.

10. **Question 10:** Addressing anthem as entertainment vs. patriotism. The solution is the moratorium, letting audiences participate instead of relying on celebrities. So the answer is stopping professional performances to make it participatory again.

Wait, let me check each question again to ensure I didn't miss any details. For example, question 3 specifically asks about the 1918 context. The article mentions the US entered WWI the previous year (1917), the shortened season, and the band's new arrangement. That's the context. 

Question 4's answer should be about how the article shows tension through examples like Houston vs. others who tried new styles (Feliciano, Hendrix) and faced backlash. The article says performers walk a "treacherous line" between tradition and novelty.

Question 9: The article states that anthems are part of for-profit spectacles, and the DoD funded some, showing commercial ties. So yes, that's the link.

All answers seem covered. Now, I need to format them properly without extra text. Let's list each question's answer concisely as per instructions.
