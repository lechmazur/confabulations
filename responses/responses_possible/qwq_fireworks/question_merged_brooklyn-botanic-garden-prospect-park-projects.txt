Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and answer exactly what's asked without any extra info. Let me start with the first question.

1. The question asks which project near the Brooklyn Botanic Garden would cast shadows on both rare equatorial plants and a playground named after a baseball pioneer. The article mentions the proposed 14-story tower on Franklin Avenue. It says the tower's shadows would affect the garden's plants, including rare and endangered ones that need sunlight. Also, the draft impact statement notes shadows on Jackie Robinson Playground, which is named after the baseball pioneer. So the answer should be the Franklin Avenue tower.

2. The second question relates the tower's impact on sunlight to the 1991 rezoning's purpose. The article states that in the 1980s, the city rezoned parts of Crown Heights South to protect the garden's solar envelope. The current tower's shadows threaten that, so the answer is that the 1991 rezoning aimed to protect the garden's solar needs, which the tower now jeopardizes.

3. The third question connects a former ash dump, Olmsted Brothers, and a threat to plants. The botanic garden was laid out by Olmsted Brothers on a former ash dump. The tower's shadows threaten the outdoor nurseries used for propagating plants. So the answer links the garden's origin (ash dump and Olmsted) to the nurseries now at risk.

4. The skate park's location relates to a 1850s water project and LaGuardia's 1939 statement. The park was built on a reservoir from the 1850s. LaGuardia called it a monument. The skate park is in Mount Prospect Park, so the answer connects those elements.

5. The reservoir, pink-granite structure, and skate park as a "third space." The pink structure is the water tower added in 1891. The skate park is part of the "critical third space" mentioned. So the reservoir's history and the structure are part of the park where the skate park is planned.

6. The solar envelope, killed 39-story towers, and current affordable housing. The killed towers were from Continuum, same as the current 14-story proposal with affordable units. The solar envelope was part of the 1991 rezoning. The answer connects these points.

7. The skate park's location, 19th-century water infrastructure (reservoir), and reducing prejudice. The skate park is on the site of the old reservoir. The article says skate parks reduce prejudice as a "third space." So the answer links those elements.

8. The ash dump, glass pavilions, and shadows on nurseries. The garden was on an ash dump with the glass pavilions built in 1988. The shadows affect the outdoor nurseries. So the connection is between the pavilions' location and the nurseries' shadow issue.

9. The former MLB stadium (Ebbets Field), demographics, and sunlight as a resource. The playground is near where Ebbets Field was. The area's demographics (88% Black residents) and Alicia Boyd's comments about sunlight's importance tie into this. So the answer connects those points.

10. The claim about new trees vs. a concern about green space. Friends of Mount Prospect Park opposed paving over green space for the skate park, especially during heat crises. The city's plan includes trees but not addressing the loss of green space, which the group raised. So the specific concern is paving over green areas despite climate issues.
