Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the strict instructions.

1. The first question asks which musician's antipathy towards documentaries led to a revolutionary filmmaking approach. The article mentions Brian Eno's longstanding antipathy to documentaries, and Hustwit had to use a generative approach to get him on board. So the answer should be Brian Eno.

2. The second question is about the technological innovation inspired by a 1950s musical experiment. The article says Eno was inspired by Steve Reich's "It's Gonna Rain" from 1972, but the 1950s part might be from Christian Wolff's mention of composers like Cage and others in 1958. Wait, the question says inspired by a 1950s experiment. The text says Reich's work was in 1972, but maybe the innovation here is generative music, which Eno used. The filmmaker used software based on generative principles, so the answer is generative software or Brain One. But the inspiration was Reich's work. Hmm. Wait, the question specifies inspired by a 1950s experiment. The article mentions that Christian Wolff in 1958 talked about composers using chance procedures. But the technological innovation Hustwit used is the software Brain One, inspired by Eno's generative music philosophy, which in turn was inspired by Reich's 1972 work. Since the 1950s part might be a trick, but the question says "inspired by a 1950s musical experiment"â€”maybe Wolff's 1958 comments refer to earlier experiments. But the actual innovation used was the software program, so the answer is the proprietary software program or Brain One.

3. The third question asks why "Clue" and "Mosaic" approaches weren't enough for Eno. The article states Hustwit knew he couldn't hook Eno with half-measures. The other films had limited non-linear elements (random endings, app for perspectives), but Eno wanted something not linear, so the answer is because they were half-measures or not fully generative.

4. The fourth question is about the anecdote from "Words for the Dying" creating a misleading expectation. The article says Eno initially refused, but later allowed hands/feet, making the film more interesting. The expectation might be that Eno would be completely uncooperative, but he actually contributed in a controlled way, so the answer is that it suggests he was resistant but later allowed limited participation.

5. The fifth question asks for a phrase by Christian Wolff in 1958 that encapsulates Eno and Hustwit's philosophy. The text says Wolff mentioned using chance procedures to achieve "a kind of objectivity, almost anonymity," resulting in music "free of artistry and taste." So the phrase is "objectivity, almost anonymity" or the full quote. The question asks for the specific phrase, which is "a kind of objectivity, almost anonymity" or "free of artistry and taste." The best fit is the first part.

6. The sixth question is how Eno agreeing to only hands/feet in "Words for the Dying" shows a nuanced perspective beyond aversion. The article mentions it was a "great cat and mouse game" and Nilsson said Eno made the film more interesting. So it shows he engaged creatively, not just refusing outright. The answer is that it demonstrates his creative collaboration despite resistance, indicating a nuanced approach rather than simple refusal.

Now I'll format each answer as per instructions.
