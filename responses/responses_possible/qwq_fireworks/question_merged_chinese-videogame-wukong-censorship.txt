Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and answer strictly as per the instructions.

1. **Question 1**: The question asks how Game Science's attempt to control the narrative relates to broader societal tensions regarding gender in China. The article mentions that the company faced backlash for past misogynistic comments, and the guidelines include forbidding discussion of "feminist propaganda." This seems to tie into societal tensions, so the answer is likely that it reflects tensions between gender equality and traditional or restrictive norms. But the exact phrasing in the text might be needed here. The article says the "feminist propaganda" was a forbidden topic, linked to the company's past issues. So the answer could be that it reflects societal tensions over gender equality versus traditional norms.

2. **Question 2**: The restriction on "feminist propaganda" shows a conflict between cultural exports (trying to be global) and domestic policies (restrictive on feminism). The article mentions China's push for soft power through cultural exports but also the domestic restrictions. The answer would be that it highlights the tension between promoting global cultural influence while suppressing feminist discourse domestically.

3. **Question 3**: Benoit Reinier's reaction (calling the guidelines shameful) shows challenges between creative freedom and compliance. The text says he refused to stream because of the censorship, indicating that creators face pressure to comply with restrictions, limiting their freedom. So the answer is that it reveals challenges in balancing creative freedom with compliance to content restrictions.

4. **Question 4**: The involvement of state-owned enterprises in marketing. The article states that Hero Games has ties to state-owned enterprises and that Zhejiang Publishing & Media (state-owned) is the publisher. So the answer is Zhejiang Publishing & Media, which is majority owned by Zhejiang provincial government.

5. **Question 5**: The prohibition on discussing Covid-19 relates to the government's control over public discourse. The article says Beijing sought to rewrite its pandemic handling, so the answer is that it reflects the government's effort to control public memory and discourse about the pandemic.

6. **Question 6**: The restriction on discussing industry policies shows tension between global ambitions and domestic regulations. The game is a global release, but guidelines prevent discussing policies that restrict the industry, highlighting that conflict.

7. **Question 7**: The entity tied to a provincial government is Zhejiang Publishing & Media, as stated in the article.

8. **Question 8**: The protagonist is based on the Monkey King from "Journey to the West," but the feminist propaganda restriction might relate to the company's past issues. The article connects the forbidden topic to the company's misogyny, so the answer is that the protagonist's origin in a classic novel contrasts with the company's gender-related controversies.

9. **Question 9**: The marketing strategy's link to Covid narrative control. The guidelines prohibit discussing quarantine/isolation, which ties to the government erasing pandemic hardships. The answer is that it aligns with suppressing discussion of past pandemic measures.

10. **Question 10**: The grouped topics in the guidelines are politics, feminist propaganda, Covid-19, and industry policies. The article lists these under "Don'ts," so the answer is these four topics.

Now, I'll check each against the text to ensure accuracy and avoid N/A where possible.
