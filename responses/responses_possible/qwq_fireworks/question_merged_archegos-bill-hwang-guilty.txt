Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and answer exactly as per the instructions.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks which financial institution, now under new ownership, incurred the largest loss from the Archegos collapse. The article mentions Credit Suisse lost $5.5 billion and was taken over by UBS. So UBS now owns Credit Suisse, so the answer is Credit Suisse.

2. **Question 2**: The second question is about a seemingly unrelated aspect of the defendant's life covered by a non-finance publication. The article says Christianity Today covered the trial, focusing on his religious activities like the Grace and Mercy Foundation's Bible work. The answer is his religious activities or the charitable foundation's religious work.

3. **Question 3**: The charitable foundation's connection to his courtroom behavior. The text says he was seen reading a religious book before the jury entered. His foundation supports Christian causes, so the answer links his reading to his foundation's religious focus.

4. **Question 4**: The defense argued that the prosecution was criminalizing high-risk trading and noted he didn't cash out. They said his trading wasn't fraudulent but just aggressive. The contradiction is between aggressive trading vs. fraud.

5. **Question 5**: The article mentions his religious activities (reading books, charity) alongside financial misconduct. The contradiction is between his public religious persona and the illegal financial actions.

6. **Question 6**: The prosecutor stated their lies about positions and metrics affected creditworthiness. The article earlier mentioned banks relied on these metrics. So the answer is the lies about positions and metrics directly relate to creditworthiness.

7. **Question 7**: The prosecutor mentioned misrepresenting Hwang as extremely wealthy. The metric would be his wealth or assets, so "wealth" or "net worth".

8. **Question 8**: The trial was covered by Christianity Today, which isn't a finance-focused publication, showing a disconnect between his finance trial and his religious public image.

9. **Question 9**: Defense said he didn't "cash out" of stock positions, contradicting the idea he was fleeing or defrauding.

10. **Question 10**: Banks eagerly lent billions despite risks, which contradicts proper risk management. The article mentions banks needing to know large positions for risk management, so their eagerness to lend despite risks is the contradiction.

Now, check each answer against the text for accuracy and ensure no N/A is needed unless info isn't there. Let me verify each point again quickly.

1. Credit Suisse is correct as per article's $5.5B loss and UBS takeover.
2. Christianity Today covered his religious aspects.
3. Reading religious book links to his foundation's work.
4. Defense said high-risk trading isn't criminal, so they argued against fraud charges despite the risks.
5. His religious activities vs. financial crimes suggest a conflict.
6. The prosecutor's statement directly ties to credit metrics they lied about.
7. "Extremely wealthy" is mentioned, so that's the misrepresented metric.
8. Christianity Today's coverage shows disconnect from finance focus.
9. Not cashing out contradicts intent to defraud.
10. Banks lending eagerly despite risks shows poor risk management.

All answers are present in the text. No N/A needed.
