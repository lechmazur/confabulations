Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the strict instructions given.

1. **Question 1:** The question is about a design feature of Pinehurst No. 2 restored by Crenshaw that aligns with Donald Ross's original intent and challenges players like the Postage Stamp. The article mentions that Crenshaw restored Pinehurst No. 2 in 2011 and talks about sloping greens with false fronts. It also says Ross intended these for championship play. The Postage Stamp's challenge is its small target. The sloping greens with false fronts fit here because they require precise shots, similar to the Postage Stamp's small green. So the answer should be "sloping greens with false fronts".

2. **Question 2:** Bobby Clampett had a triple bogey on a long hole (6th, 577 yards) in 1982, while Tiger Woods had a bad score on the short Postage Stamp in 1997. The article states that both had issues with Troon's extreme lengths (long and short), showing how both types of holes can derail players. The answer is that they show how both short and long holes can cause problems, so "both short and long holes can end title runs" or similar. The exact phrase in the article is "ended many title runs" from the first paragraph, but the examples given are their specific issues. Maybe "both ended their title runs due to challenges from short and long holes respectively".

3. **Question 3:** Oakmont stretched their 12th to 684 yards to make it unreachable. Tom Doak prefers a different approach, like a loose bunkered par-5 where pros might face a 40-yard bunker shot if they try to drive. The contrast is Oakmont's lengthening vs. Doak's use of hazards that penalize risky shots. The answer is Oakmont uses extreme length, while Doak prefers strategic hazards like bunkers. So "Oakmont uses extreme length; Doak prefers penalizing risky shots with bunkers".

4. **Question 4:** Both Clampett and Woods had bad rounds at Troon where a single hole caused their downfall. Clampett tripled on the long 6th, Woods took a 6 on the short 8th. The commonality is that a single hole (either long or short) caused their decline. So "both had their rounds derailed by a single hole (long/short respectively)".

5. **Question 5:** The Postage Stamp is a short hole with bunkers. Patrick Reed played Erin Hills at max yardage and shot 73. The connection is that both involve short holes challenging players. The article says Erin's 9th is 135 yards with bunkers, making players unsure. Reed's experience there relates to the challenge of such holes. So "both involved short holes with bunkers challenging players".

6. **Question 6:** The feature praised by a designer (Hurdzan) analogous to Royal Troon's fairways is the slopes causing roll-offs. The article mentions Pinehurst's sloping greens and Troon's fairways that make balls "scoot one way or the other". Hurdzan praised slopes reducing error margins. So "slopes causing roll-offs".

7. **Question 7:** The Postage Stamp's small green tests accuracy. Erin's 9th is a short hole with bunkers causing uncertainty. The parallel is that both use short length with hazards to make players cautious. So "short length with hazards causing strategic play".

8. **Question 8:** Oakmont's approach is lengthening. Doak's philosophy contradicts this by preferring hazards over length. The answer is Tom Doak, as he said making holes 700 yards isn't wanted and prefers strategic hazards instead of just length.

9. **Question 9:** The designer's philosophy aligning with Troon's fairways (which are capricious) is Hurdzan, who mentioned the fairways making balls move unpredictably. Doak talked about hazards, but Hurdzan's comment on Troon's fairways matches. Wait, the question asks which architect's view on tee-shot hazards aligns with Troon's challenges. The article says Doak suggested a tee-shot hazard like a deep bunker that costs a stroke. Troon's fairways are tricky but not specifically about tee hazards. Wait, maybe Crenshaw? No, the article says Hurdzan talked about the fairways' capriciousness. The question is about tee-shot hazards. Doak's approach includes a tee-shot hazard (deep bunker). So Doak's preference for hazards like that would align with Troon's challenges? The article says Doak's idea is a tee-shot hazard that penalizes. Troon's fairways are tricky but maybe not specifically about tee hazards. Wait, the question is about which architect's philosophy on tee-shot hazards aligns with Royal Troon's fairway challenges. The article mentions Doak's suggestion of a tee-shot hazard (like a deep bunker). Since Troon's fairways are capricious, maybe Doak's approach is similar. Alternatively, Hurdzan talked about fairways making balls move, but that's not a tee hazard. The answer is Tom Doak, as he's the one who suggested a tee-shot hazard that penalizes, which is a design feature Troon might have? The article says Troon's fairways are tricky, but Doak's approach is about creating hazards that affect tee shots. So answer: Tom Doak.

10. **Question 10:** Pinehurst was restored with sloping greens and roll-offs. The article says Troon's greens have a lot of roll-off, which will be used in pin placements. So the connection is that both use sloping greens/roll-offs to challenge players. The answer is "both use sloping greens and roll-offs to challenge players".
