Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the article provided and answer each question exactly as asked. Let's go step by step.

1. **Question 1: Which character shares a name with the villain but differs in appearance and role?**
   - The article mentions Sharon Gordon Fisherman as the villain. Edgar works for her. Wait, the question is about a character with the same name as the villain but different role. Wait, maybe the villain's name is Sharon Gordon Fisherman, but the article says "Edgar (Jamie Dornan, transcendent) will be there too, at the behest of a villainess named Sharon Gordon Fisherman." Wait, the villain is Sharon Gordon Fisherman. The question is asking if there's another character with the same name. Wait, maybe "Star" is short for "Starbara," but that's not related. Wait, maybe "Fisherman"? Wait, the villain's full name is Sharon Gordon Fisherman. The article also mentions "Edgar the night they meet at the hotel bar." Hmm, maybe "Fisherman" is part of the villain's name. Alternatively, maybe "Edgar" is part of the villain's name? Wait, no. Let me recheck. The villain is Sharon Gordon Fisherman, and Edgar is her henchman. The question is if any character shares the villain's name but has a different role. Wait, perhaps "Fisherman" is part of her name, but Edgar's last name isn't mentioned. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe "Star" is part of the villain's name? Wait, Sharon's full name is Sharon Gordon Fisherman. Wait, maybe the villain's name is Fisherman, and another character has the same last name? No, the article doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the crab's voice? The crab talks like Morgan Freeman, but that's not related. Hmm, maybe I missed a part. Wait, the question might be about "Edgar" and "Ken"? Wait, in the text: "Ryan Gosling shimmy and pirouette through 'I'm Just Ken,' I had one thought: Edgar walked so Ken could run." So Edgar and Ken are both characters? But Ken is from Barbie, maybe? Wait, the article mentions "I'm Just Ken" as a song from Barbie? So the question is about a character in the article (Barb and Star's movie) that shares a name with the villain but different role. Wait, maybe the villain's name is Sharon Gordon Fisherman. Is there another character with Fisherman? No. Wait, maybe the answer is "Edgar" but he's not the villain. Wait, the villain is Sharon. The question is asking for a character that shares the villain's name but has a different role. Maybe "Fisherman" is part of her name, but no other character. Hmm, maybe I need to think again. Wait, the article says "villainess Sharon Gordon Fisherman, also played by Wiig." Wait, no, Sharon is played by Wiig. Wait, the article says "Edgar (Jamie Dornan, transcendent) will be there too, at the behest of a villainess named Sharon Gordon Fisherman, also played by Wiig." So Sharon is the villain. The question is asking if another character shares the villain's name (Sharon Gordon Fisherman) but has a different role. Since the article doesn't mention another character with that name, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe "Star" is part of Sharon's name? No, Sharon's full name is given. Alternatively, maybe "Starbara" (the full name of Star) but that's not the same as Sharon's name. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Wait, maybe the crab? The crab's voice is like Morgan Freeman, but that's not related. Maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question says "shares a name with the villain but differs in appearance and role." Wait, maybe Edgar is not the villain, but the villain is Sharon. So maybe there's no character with the same name as Sharon except herself. Therefore, the answer might be N/A. Wait, but maybe the answer is "Edgar" but that's not the same name. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to "Edgar" and "Ken"? Wait, the text mentions "Edgar walked so Ken could run." So Ken is a reference to the song in Barbie. But the question is about a character in the article's film (Barb and Star) that shares the villain's name. Since the villain's name is Sharon Gordon Fisherman, I don't see another character with that name. Maybe I'm missing something here. Wait, maybe "Star" and "Barb" are the protagonists, but their names don't match Sharon's. Hmm, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, let me check again. The question is about a character in the article (so the film discussed) that shares the villain's name but has a different role. The villain's name is Sharon Gordon Fisherman. The only other characters are Barb, Star, Edgar, etc. None of their names are Sharon. So answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe "Fisherman" is part of the villain's name and someone else has that surname? No. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Wait, the article says "Edgar (Jamie Dornan, transcendent) will be there too, at the behest of a villainess named Sharon Gordon Fisherman, also played by Wiig." Wait, Wiig plays Sharon? Wait, the villain is Sharon Gordon Fisherman, played by Wiig. The other main characters are Barb (Mumolo) and Star (Wiig?) Wait, no, the article says "Barb and Star are played by Mumolo and Wiig." Wait, "written by its leads, Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo". So Barb is played by one, Star by the other. So the villain Sharon is also played by Wiig? So the same actress plays both Star and Sharon? That would mean that Sharon shares the same name as the villain but is a different role. Wait, that's possible. The question asks which character shares the villain's name but differs in appearance and role. Wait, but the villain is Sharon Gordon Fisherman. The question is asking if a character has the same name as the villain. But Sharon is the villain's name, so the villain herself is Sharon. Unless there's another character named Sharon. Wait, but the question says "shares a name with the villain". The villain's full name is Sharon Gordon Fisherman. So another character with the same name would be Sharon, but she is the villain. So maybe the answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe "Fisherman" is part of the name and another character has that surname? No. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Wait, the article says "Edgar (Jamie Dornan, transcendent) will be there too, at the behest of a villainess named Sharon Gordon Fisherman, also played by Wiig." So the villain is Sharon, played by Wiig. The other characters are Barb (played by Mumolo) and Star (played by Wiig as well? Wait, the article says "Barb and Star are played by Mumolo and Wiig." So Barb is Mumolo, Star is Wiig. Therefore, Sharon is another role played by Wiig. So Sharon and Star are both played by Wiig. So the character Star shares the actress's name (Wiig) but not the villain's name. The villain's name is Sharon. The question is which character shares the villain's name (Sharon) but differs in role and appearance. There's no other character named Sharon except the villain. So answer is N/A. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the question again. Wait, maybe "Edgar" and "Ken"? The text says "Edgar walked so Ken could run." Ken is from "Barbie" (the song "I'm Just Ken"). But that's a different film. The question is about characters in Barb and Star's film. So Edgar is part of that film. The villain is Sharon. The question is about a character in Barb and Star that shares the villain's name. Since no one else is named Sharon, maybe the answer is N/A. Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Wait, maybe "Star" is short for Starbara, which isn't the same as Sharon's name. Maybe the answer is N/A. I'll tentatively put N/A here but maybe I missed a character.

2. **Question 2: How does Edgar's musical performance foreshadow a similar scene in a more recent film?**
   - The article mentions Edgar sings a "forlorn love ballad addressed to sea gulls." Then it says when Ryan Gosling does "I'm Just Ken," the thought was "Edgar walked so Ken could run." So Edgar's singing foreshadows Gosling's performance in Barbie. The answer is that Edgar's singing foreshadows Ryan Gosling's "I'm Just Ken" scene in Barbie. The question asks how Edgar's performance foreshadows the similar scene in the recent film (Barbie). So the answer is "Edgar's singing foreshadows Ryan Gosling's 'I'm Just Ken' in Barbie" but need to be concise. The article says "Edgar walked so Ken could run." So the answer is "Edgar's singing foreshadows Ryan Gosling's 'I'm Just Ken' in Barbie."

3. **Question 3: What specific clothing item emphasized in the opening symbolizes the protagonists' transformation and the film's aesthetic?**
   - The opening mentions "maybe it was the culottes?" and "obsessive attention to culottes." So the clothing item is culottes. The answer is "culottes."

4. **Question 4: What specific promise made by the villain to Edgar mirrors a theme in a recent successful film?**
   - The villain Sharon promises Edgar that if they do her evil plot, they can be an "official couple." The article mentions "Barbie" as the recent film. The theme in Barbie might be about being made for something or relationships. The promise of becoming an official couple mirrors a theme in Barbie, perhaps the idea of fulfilling desires or relationships. The exact promise is "they can be an 'official couple.'" The answer is "to be an official couple."

5. **Question 5: What cinematic technique associated with a specific director mentioned in the article is evoked in the film's musical elements?**
   - The article mentions "Busby Berkeley musicals" in the description. Berkeley is known for his elaborate musical numbers. So the technique is Busby Berkeley-style musical numbers. The answer is "Busby Berkeley musical numbers."

6. **Question 6: How does the article's description of the film's tone and style explain its box office underperformance?**
   - The article says it was released in Feb 2021 during pandemic when theaters were closed, and people were focused on "WandaVision." So the underperformance is due to timing and lack of theater availability. The question asks how the tone/style explains it. Wait, the question is about tone and style causing underperformance. The article says "it was written by the same duo as Bridesmaids" but didn't get spotlight, maybe because the tone was too zany or not mainstream. The article says "the fact that theaters weren't open... matters like time and release schedules were nebulous" so the main reason was pandemic timing. But the question is about the tone/style's role. The article mentions that the film's zany, pastiche style might be why it was overlooked, but the primary reason given is pandemic timing. The question might expect the answer related to its eclectic mix being hard to market, leading to underperformance. The article says "it's the sort of film you used to stumble onto late at night on cable" implying it's not mainstream. So the answer is "its eclectic, pastiche style made it hard to market effectively" but need to check the exact wording. The article says "the fact that theaters weren't open... matters like time and release schedules were nebulous, mushy concepts. The fact that Barb and Star was written... somehow didn't propel it into the spotlight (we were all too busy obsessing over WandaVision)." So the main factors were timing and competing content. But the question asks how the tone/style explains it. The article says "zany pastiche quality" and "mishmash" which might not attract big audiences. The answer might be "its zany, eclectic tone and style made it less commercially viable." But the article's explanation for underperformance is more about pandemic timing and other factors, not the style itself. Hmm. The question says "indirectly explain its underperformance." Since the article mentions the style as "zany pastiche" and "mishmash," perhaps that made it harder to market, leading to lower ticket sales. The answer is "its zany, eclectic tone and style made it less commercially viable."

7. **Question 7: What demographic typically marginalized in Hollywood is centralized in the film?**
   - The article says the protagonists are middle-aged women in culottes, "women who were made for something... Barb and Star whose favorite recipe is 'hot dog soup'... women in culottes looking to have a nice time at the beach." The article mentions they are "women who Hollywood sidelined or skewered" not starlets or sexpots. So the demographic is "middle-aged women."

8. **Question 8: What factor should be applied to Barbie's tone to get Barb and Star?**
   - The article says "Crank up the 'Barbie' tone by a factor of five..." so the answer is "crank up the tone by a factor of five."

9. **Question 9: What specific recipe do Barb and Star like?**
   - The closing says "their favorite recipe is 'hot dog soup'." So answer is "hot dog soup."

10. **Question 10: How does Edgar's singing compare to Morgan Freeman's voice?**
    - The article says "a crab talked in a voice that sounded like Morgan Freeman." Wait, the question is about Edgar's singing. Wait, no, the crab's voice is like Morgan Freeman, but Edgar's singing is compared to? Wait the article says "Edgar the night they meet at the hotel bar, as a lounge pianist sings in the background about his love of female anatomy." Wait, the Morgan Freeman voice is the crab. The question is about Edgar's singing voice compared to Morgan Freeman. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The article says: "There were some dance numbers, a remix of 'My Heart Will Go On,' a bunch of colorful sugar-bomb cocktails and an obsessive attention to culottes. The jokes came fast and furiously. A crab talked in a voice that sounded like Morgan Freeman." So the crab's voice is like Morgan Freeman, not Edgar's. The question asks about Edgar's singing voice compared to Morgan Freeman. Wait, maybe the question is a trick? The article doesn't compare Edgar's singing to Morgan Freeman. The crab's voice is. Edgar's singing is a forlorn ballad to sea gulls. So the answer would be N/A. Wait, but the question says "according to Alissa Wilkinson". The article says the crab's voice was like Morgan Freeman, but Edgar's singing isn't compared. So the answer is N/A. But maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The question is about Edgar's singing voice compared to Morgan Freeman. The article only mentions the crab's voice as Morgan Freeman. So the answer is N/A.
