Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and follow the strict format. Let me start with the first question.

1. The first question asks what would have happened if Duane Thomas hadn't been traded back to the Cowboys in 1971 regarding their Super Bowl performance. The article mentions that after being traded back, he had a productive season and led in rushing in the Super Bowl they won. So if he wasn't there, maybe they wouldn't have won. The answer should be that they might not have won their first Super Bowl.

2. The second question compares Thomas's actions to Curt Flood's challenge. The article states that Thomas's stance was part of a narrative of Black athletes challenging labor treatment, similar to Flood's challenge against baseball's reserve clause. So the answer is that both challenged labor systems in their sports.

3. The third question is about the player with the 10th highest college rushing total (Thomas) being traded multiple times. The article says his disputes with coaches and teams led to trades. So his contract disputes and conflicts caused multiple trades.

4. The connection between the player (Thomas) who refused to speak to reporters and Curt Flood. The article mentions Flood in the same context as Thomas's labor challenge. So both challenged labor systems, and Flood is the center fielder.

5. The ironic statement upon being drafted. The article quotes Thomas saying, "I'm so excited, I can't think," but later he refused to talk to media. The irony is his initial excitement vs later silence.

6. The parallel between Thomas's stance and another sport. The article compares his actions to Flood in baseball, leading to free agency. So his labor stance paralleled the baseball movement leading to free agency.

7. The book collaboration and the "Fall of America's Team" narrative. The book's title suggests his actions contributed to the team's downfall, as his disputes and holdouts might have strained the team.

8. Contract dispute strategy vs pre-play stance. Thomas refused the three-point stance, preferring his own way, similar to how he handled contract negotiations on his terms. So both involved doing things his own way against team wishes.

9. The commissioner's intervention reflecting power dynamics. Rozelle intervened at Patriots' request, showing management had more power before free agency, as players had less leverage.

10. Refusing the three-point stance foreshadowing conflicts. His insistence on his method (standing upright) led to a conflict with a coach,预示了后来与联盟权威的更多冲突，比如合同纠纷。

Now, I need to ensure each answer is direct and based solely on the text. If any question can't be answered, put N/A. Let me check each again.
