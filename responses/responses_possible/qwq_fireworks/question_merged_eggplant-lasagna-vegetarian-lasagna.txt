Okay, I need to tackle these questions one by one based on the provided article. Let's start with the first question.

1. The question asks how the author's approach to freezing ingredients relates to Sam Sifton's mandatory activity. The article mentions Sam Sifton's mandatory 6 a.m. fly fishing lessons, which the author and others repeat. The connection here is that even though the cooking staff might have to do unrelated activities (like fly fishing), they still focus on the pursuit of delicious food. The answer might be "fly fishing lessons" because the author mentions doing those, even if it's unrelated to cooking, but the question is about freezing. Wait, maybe the author's freezing is part of the work (as per "a little work in the pursuit of the delicious"). The mandatory activity is fly fishing, so the answer is that freezing relates to the work they do despite the lessons. Hmm, maybe the answer is "fly fishing lessons" because the author mentions Sam's activity, and the freezing is part of their cooking approach which is tied to his philosophy. Wait, the article says "We here at New York Times Cooking don't mind a little work in the pursuit of the delicious (a phrase Sam Sifton makes us repeat in his mandatory 6 a.m. fly fishing lessons)". So the author's approach (freezing) is part of the "pursuit of the delicious" which is linked to Sam's lessons. The answer would be that the freezing reflects the pursuit of deliciousness which Sam's lessons emphasize. But the question is about the approach to freezing reflecting Sam's mandatory activity. Since Sam's activity is fly fishing, but the phrase is part of his lessons, the answer might be "fly fishing lessons" because that's the activity they have to do, and the author's freezing is part of the work they do as per his teachings. Wait, but the question is about how freezing reflects the mandatory activity. Maybe the answer is "fly fishing lessons" because the author's approach is tied to Sam's phrase, which he enforces through those lessons. So the answer is "fly fishing lessons".

2. The author dislikes "Working quickly..." and prefers "To save time...". Ham's recipes are easy but look fancy. The connection is that the author likes recipes that save time (her preference) and Ham's recipes are easy (implying they save time) but look impressive. So the answer is "they save time and look effortless" or similar. The question asks for a connection between the author's view on instructions and Ham's creations. The author's view is that saving time is good, and Ham's recipes are easy to execute but look fancy, so the connection is that they both emphasize ease and appearance of effortlessness. So answer: "they emphasize ease and appearance of effortlessness".

3. The author mentions being pro-cake but gives pie its due. The rise of cottage cheese is compared to Betty White, implying a comeback. The connection between cake/pie stance and cottage cheese's rise: maybe the author's openness to both (cake vs pie debate) mirrors her appreciation for cottage cheese's rise over burrata. The question is about the parallel between her cake vs pie stance and cottage cheese's rise. Since she supports both cake and pie (or at least acknowledges pie's worth), similar to how cottage cheese is rising despite burrata's popularity, the parallel is that both show embracing alternatives. Answer: "embracing alternatives over traditional favorites".

4. The author's stance on effortlessness is about appearing effortless through planning. The dairy product mentioned is cottage cheese, which she says has risen to a worthy perch. The description of cottage cheese's salad uses "Betty White of dairy", implying a comeback or underappreciated thing that's now valued. This reflects her earlier point that effortlessness requires planning. The answer would be that the cottage cheese's rise shows that effortlessness (its popularity now) comes from proper preparation (like the salad recipe). So maybe "cottage cheese's rise shows effortlessness through preparation". Alternatively, the cottage cheese salad example (using simple ingredients made special) mirrors the idea that effortlessness needs work. Answer: "cottage cheese's rise through simple flourishes mirrors the need for planning to appear effortless".

5. The chicken recipe reference is Eric Kim's Ritzy Cheddar with Ritz crackers. The author says if she didn't have Ritz, she'd use Cheez-Its. This exemplifies her philosophy of improvisation with what's on hand. The question asks how this reference exemplifies her cooking philosophy. The answer is "improvisation with available ingredients".

6. The film scene is Meryl Streep's Key lime pie in "Heartburn". The earlier discussion of improvisation includes using substitutes like Cheez-Its. The connection is that the pie scene involves a specific recipe (which can be made ahead, maybe?), showing that even a movie's prop can be part of improvisation. Or the fact that the pie is a specific recipe (like the one she mentioned) ties into improvisation. The answer might be "the film's pie recipe allows improvisation like in cooking". Or since the pie is a specific recipe, but she talks about improvisation, perhaps the reference shows that even a movie's recipe can be part of her improvisational approach. The answer: "the pie's recipe allows for improvisation like in cooking".

7. The spice blend mentioned is "everything bagel" and dukkah. The author says using these makes simple dishes special. The earlier discussion was about simple dishes becoming special through flourishes. The question asks how the spice blend relates to that. The answer is "they add special touches to simple dishes".

8. Chicken adobo variations are personal and regional. The author earlier said that effortlessness requires work. The connection is that adobo's variations show personal effort (work) but appear effortless. The answer: "adobo's variations require personal effort to achieve effortless taste".

9. The dessert debate is cake vs pie. The earlier discussion on staples includes having basics like pasta, stock, etc. The parallel is that the debate (choosing between options) relates to having staples to build upon. The answer might be "the debate highlights reliance on staples for improvisation".

10. Restaurant tech like automation vs human touch. The author's earlier point is that effortlessness needs work. The connection is that tech promises efficiency but restaurants are about feelings (effortless experience through human work). Answer: "restaurant tech promises efficiency but human touch is key, like effortlessness needing work".

Now I need to check each answer against the text to ensure accuracy.

1. The article says Sam's phrase is repeated during fly fishing lessons. The author's freezing is part of her cooking approach which aligns with the "pursuit of delicious". The mandatory activity is fly fishing, so the answer is "fly fishing lessons".

2. The author dislikes "working quickly" and likes saving time. Ham's recipes are easy (saving time) and look fancy. So the connection is "they emphasize ease and effortlessness".

3. Cake vs pie debate vs cottage cheese's rise. The author supports both cake and pie, similar to how cottage cheese is rising against burrata. So "embracing alternatives over traditional favorites".

4. Cottage cheese's rise as the Betty White of dairy (comeback) shows that through preparation (the salad recipe), it can be special, reflecting effortlessness via planning. Answer: "cottage cheese's popularity through simple preparation mirrors effortlessness through planning".

5. Using Cheez-Its instead of Ritz shows improvisation with what's available. Answer: "improvisation with available ingredients".

6. The pie in the movie is a specific recipe. The author's improvisation includes using substitutes. The film's use of a specific recipe (like her approach) allows for improvisation (maybe the scene shows making it ahead, but not sure). The answer is "the film's pie recipe exemplifies improvisation through substitution".

7. The spice blend (everything bagel or dukkah) is used to make the dish special. Answer: "adds special touches to simple dishes".

8. Adobo variations show personal effort (work) but taste effortless. Answer: "variations require personal effort to achieve effortless taste".

9. Dessert debate (cake vs pie) relates to staples because having staples allows improvisation. So "the debate highlights using staples for creative choices".

10. Restaurant tech (automation) vs human touch. The author's point: effortlessness needs work (human touch). So "technology vs human touch mirrors effortlessness requiring work".

Now, formalizing the answers:

9. <question_number>9</question_number><answer>debate highlights using staples for creativity</answer>
10. <question_number>10</question_number><answer>technology vs human touch mirrors effortlessness needing work</answer>

Wait, need to check if all answers are strictly based on text. Let me verify each:

1. Correct. The freezing is part of the author's method, which aligns with Sam's "pursuit of delicious" which he enforces via fly fishing lessons. So the answer is fly fishing lessons.

2. The author prefers recipes that save time, Ham's are easy to execute but look fancy. So connection is ease and effortlessness.

3. The author supports both cake and pie (she was pro-cake but gives pie due), similar to cottage cheese rising over burrata. So alternatives over traditional (burrata is traditional, cottage cheese is the alternative).

4. The cottage cheese's salad example shows that with simple flourishes (like spices), it becomes special, which is planning to look effortless. So the answer is correct.

5. The Ritz vs Cheez-Its example is improvisation with available ingredients.

6. The film's pie is a specific recipe (Key lime), and the author's improvisation is about using what's available. The film's scene might tie to using a specific recipe, but the connection is that the recipe allows for improvisation (like making it ahead?), but the text says "the recipe for the frozen Key lime pie", which implies preparation ahead, which ties to her earlier points about saving time by prepping. But the question links to improvisation. Alternatively, the author's improvisation (using Cheez-Its) is like the pie being used in a film scene (a specific instance). Hmm, maybe the answer is better phrased as "the film's pie exemplifies improvisation through preparation".

Alternatively, the answer should be that the film's pie scene (which involves a specific recipe) relates to improvisation because the author mentions that improvisation is key, like using Cheez-Its. The film's use of a precise recipe might contrast with improvisation, but the question says how it relates to earlier discussion of improvisation. Maybe the answer is that the pie's recipe allows for improvisation (like freezing ahead), which is part of her philosophy. So the answer is correct as "pie's recipe allows improvisation like cooking".

7. The spice blends (everything bagel or dukkah) are used to make the dish special, so "adds special touches".

8. Adobo variations are personal (work) but taste effortless, so "variations require effort for effortless taste".

9. The dessert debate (cake vs pie) relates to staples because having staples allows you to make either, so the debate highlights using staples for creativity.

10. The restaurant tech (automation) vs human touch (effort) mirrors her point that effortlessness requires work (human touch over tech). So "technology vs human touch mirrors effortlessness needing work".

I think these are all correct based on the text.
