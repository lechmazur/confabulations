Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. 

1. **Question 1**: The primary reason Eli Lilly's cheaper vials could undermine compounded drugs despite the latter's lower price. The article mentions that compounded drugs have less oversight and safety, so Lilly is positioning their vials as a safer alternative. So the answer is safety and FDA oversight.

2. **Question 2**: Lilly's strategy through LillyDirect challenges telehealth companies by offering their own vials via their platform, which directly competes with the telehealth companies that provide compounded meds. The key point here is the direct access and lower price through their own telehealth platform.

3. **Question 3**: The implicit risk of compounded drugs is their lack of FDA oversight and potential safety issues. The article states that compounded drugs are subject to less oversight, and there are warnings against them.

4. **Question 4**: The price undercutting is a strategic move to regain market share even if it hurts pen sales. The article says they might lose 10-60% of pen users to the cheaper vials, but it's worth it to keep customers from compounded drugs.

5. **Question 5**: The FDA's shortage list allows compounding pharmacies to make alternatives. Once Lilly is off the shortage list, those pharmacies can't legally compound as much, so Lilly's legal challenges would be stronger.

6. **Question 6**: Direct-to-consumer sales via LillyDirect, bypassing third parties. The article mentions removing third-party supply chain entities for transparent pricing.

7. **Question 7**: Medicare doesn't cover weight-loss meds, so Lilly's cheaper vials might attract Medicare patients, but there's a risk noted by Dr. Fugh-Berman about muscle loss in older patients.

8. **Question 8**: Offering FDA-approved vials makes Lilly's product seem safer than compounded ones, which have safety concerns highlighted in the article.

9. **Question 9**: Tirzepatide is on the FDA's shortage list, allowing compounding pharmacies to produce it legally under shortage exceptions.

10. **Question 10**: Dr. Mackey mentions the signal of lowering prices to take back market share, implying price competition as an indirect method.
