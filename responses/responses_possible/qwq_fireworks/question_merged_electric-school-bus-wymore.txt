Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article provided. Let me start by skimming through the article again to recall the details.

1. **Irony in Mr. Zimmerman's concerns**: The article mentions that Zimmerman is a farmer and a school board president. He's worried about electric tractors needing to be charged every night, but he's also part of a family farm. The irony might be that he's resistant to electric vehicles even though he's involved in agriculture, which is another area where traditional practices are being challenged by new tech. Wait, the article says he's a farmer and skeptical about electric farm equipment. The irony could be that he's resisting electric tech while being part of an industry that's also facing similar changes. But maybe the key point is that he's against electric buses but uses diesel in his own pickup. The article mentions he drives his pickup home instead of electric tractors. So the irony is that he uses a diesel pickup but criticizes electric tractors and buses, highlighting his reliance on traditional fuels while opposing alternatives.

2. **Fake horse's head anecdote**: The article says Jim Zvolanek, a school board member, compared early cars with fake horse heads to soothe fears, just like people today are skeptical of EVs. The parallel is that both were new technologies that people were skeptical about, so the fake horse's head shows historical resistance to change similar to current EV skepticism.

3. **Historical resistance and the poem**: The poem from 1923 lamented the end of horse-drawn transport, showing past resistance to change. The community's reaction to the electric bus mirrors that, as they're resistant to new tech like the bus, just like they were to cars back then.

4. **Individual with surname of a music maestro**: The article mentions "Lawrence Welk" performed in town. The question asks which individual shares his surname. The author is Dionne Searcey, and John Watts and David Zimmerman are classmates. Wait, the music maestro's name is Welk. Looking through the text: "Champagne music maestro Lawrence Welk once performed at a dance pavilion on the outskirts of town." The person in question here would be the individual who is initially skeptical but shares the surname. Wait the question is which individual initially skeptical shares the surname. The author mentions her classmate John Watts. But Welk's last name is different. Wait, maybe the author's classmate? Wait, the article says "John Watts was my high school classmate. So was David Zimmerman..." So the music maestro is Welk, so no one in the text shares that surname. Wait, maybe the author? No. Wait, the question says "shares a surname with a famous champagne music maestro who once performed in the town." The only person with a last name related is the author's classmate? The music maestro is Lawrence Welk, so the person with the surname Welk? The article doesn't mention anyone else with that name. Hmm. Wait, maybe the author's name? The author is Dionne Searcey. Not Welk. Wait, perhaps the individual in question is the author herself, but she's not skeptical. Alternatively, maybe the school board president, David Zimmerman? No. Wait, maybe the answer is N/A, but the question says "which individual... shares a surname with..." Since the maestro is Welk, but the text doesn't mention someone with that surname. Wait, the author's last name isn't Welk. Maybe I missed a part. Let me check again. The only person mentioned with a last name is the author's classmates: John Watts, David Zimmerman. The music maestro is Welk. So there's no one in the text with the surname Welk. Therefore, the answer might be N/A. Wait, but the question says "shares a surname with...", so maybe the author's classmate? No. Wait, perhaps the question is a trick. The author is Dionne Searcey, and the article says "John Watts was my high school classmate. So was David Zimmerman..." So the music maestro is Welk, but no one in the text shares that name. So maybe the answer is N/A? But the question says "which individual initially skeptical...", so perhaps the answer is David Zimmerman? No. Wait, maybe the author herself? She's not skeptical. Hmm. Wait, maybe the answer is David Zimmerman's friend? The article says Zimmerman's friend hauls turbine blades. Not sure. Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again. The question is: "Which individual, initially skeptical of the electric bus, shares a surname with a famous champagne music maestro who once performed in the town?" The music maestro is Lawrence Welk, so the surname is Welk. The article mentions that the author's classmate was John Watts. No one else with surname Welk. So the answer must be N/A? But the question says "which individual" implying there is an answer. Maybe I made a mistake. Wait, the author mentions "my grandparents had their first date... at one of the downtown movie theaters." Not related. Wait, maybe the answer is the author? But she's not skeptical. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is David Zimmerman, but his surname isn't Welk. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing a detail. Let me check the exact text again. "Champagne music maestro Lawrence Welk once performed at a dance pavilion on the outskirts of town." The question is about an individual who is skeptical and shares the surname. Since no one in the text has the surname Welk, the answer must be N/A. Wait, but maybe the author's name? The author is Dionne Searcey. No. Maybe the person is the friend who hauls turbine blades? Not Welk either. Hmm, maybe I'm missing it. Alternatively, maybe the surname of the music maestro is part of the answer, but the question wants the person's name. Since there's no one, the answer is N/A.

5. **Friend's career leading to wind turbine concerns**: Zimmerman's friend hauls turbine blades in a fossil-fuel-burning truck. He wonders about the environmental impact when turbines wear out. So the friend's career is transporting turbine blades, which made Zimmerman question the environmental impact of wind turbines.

6. **Automotive component repurposed**: The old bus engine had to be destroyed because of the grant. Salvage yards like John Watts' can't recycle electric engines, so the engine component is the one that's problematic. The bus shells make good storage sheds, but the engine can't be recycled, so the engine is the component. The answer would be "engine".

7. **Auditory effect causing logistical issue**: The bus is too quiet, so kids didn't hear it. Parents had to be told to look for it instead of relying on the engine noise. The issue was the quietness leading to kids not hearing it, so the effect is the quietness.

8. **Safety concern related to organ donation**: The assistant fire chief, Collin Meints, was worried about electric shocks during rescues. The resident mentioned was Zimmerman, whose uncle was an organ donor. The paradox is that organ donation is about reuse, but the bus engine must be destroyed, not recycled. The safety concern about electric shocks relates to Zimmerman's example of organ donation (reusing parts) vs. the bus engine being destroyed. So the safety concern is electric shocks, and the organ donation is about reusing parts. The answer is "organ donation" but the question says the safety concern relates to a life-saving practice. Wait, the question says "paradoxically relates to a life-saving practice mentioned by another resident". The organ donor example by Zimmerman is the life-saving practice (organ donation), and the safety concern is about electric shocks during rescue (which is a life-saving scenario). So the safety concern is electric shock risk during rescue, which relates to organ donation's reuse theme. So the answer is "electric shocks" or "risk of electrocution".

9. **Technical detail contradicting selling point**: The superintendent mentioned the bus has a 10-year battery warranty. But when Zimmerman looked under the bus, he saw exposed wires, which might contradict the reliability or safety (the selling point was low maintenance and battery warranty). The key selling point was maintenance savings and battery warranty, but the exposed wires suggest potential issues, so the detail is "exposed wires".

10. **Federal agency contradicting voting history**: The bus was funded via an EPA grant. The town's voting history: Zimmerman's county had strict rules against wind farms, opposing alternative energy. So the EPA's involvement (pushing for electric buses via grants) contradicts the town's opposition to such projects. The agency is the EPA.
