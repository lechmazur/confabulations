Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and not any outside knowledge.

1. **Question 1**: The paradox is that the U.S. generates the most plastic waste but lags behind countries like Rwanda and Kenya in banning single-use plastics. The article mentions that the U.S. is a laggard compared to these African nations which have already implemented national bans. So the paradox is the U.S. being a top polluter but slower in action.

2. **Question 2**: The U.S. generates the most waste, but recycling is only 9%, so even with the new strategy, the low recycling rate suggests that relying on purchasing changes might not be enough. The implicit challenge is that the strategy's success is questionable given the current low recycling rate and high production.

3. **Question 3**: Christy Leavitt said the U.S. would have a global impact if the effort sticks. If reversed, that impact is lost. The answer is the global impact mentioned by her.

4. **Question 4**: The EPA tried to ban PFAS but was blocked. The agency is the EPA, and the chemical is PFAS. So the answer is the EPA's action on PFAS was thwarted.

5. **Question 5**: The mention of African nations highlights that the U.S., despite generating more waste, hasn't taken as strong measures as those countries, creating a paradox in their approach.

6. **Question 6**: The Navy is reining in plastic waste on ships and subs. The mundane change is switching to refillable supplies or eliminating plastic bottles. The specific example given is the Navy's actions.

7. **Question 7**: The article says global production is expected to quadruple by 2050. The government's timeline (2027 and 2035) might be too slow compared to the rapid increase in production. The challenge is that the timeline might not keep up with rising production.

8. **Question 8**: Microplastics are found in human blood and tissue, showing the health urgency. This underscores why reducing plastic is urgent.

9. **Question 9**: If Trump returns, he might roll back the policies, undermining long-term impact. The political scenario mentioned is Trump potentially reversing the policies.

10. **Question 10**: The article states only 9% of plastic is recycled, so focusing on government purchases alone might not address the larger issue of most waste not being recycled. The statistic contradicts the effectiveness of just changing purchases without addressing the larger recycling problem.

Now, I'll format the answers properly, making sure each question has a number and answer tag, and check for N/A where needed. All answers are directly from the text or logical inferences.
