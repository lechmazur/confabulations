Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the instructions strictly.

1. The first question asks about the pivotal event in Elizabeth Taylor's life that changed celebrity photography from glamour to destruction. The article mentions her split from Eddie Fisher and her affair with Richard Burton led to the birth of paparazzi chasing scandals. So the answer should be that event.

2. The documentary uses her interviews layered over archival footage. The text says this creates a contrast between her public appearances and interior life. So the approach is showing her private thoughts against public images.

3. The film suggests her experiences paved the path for future stars dealing with celebrity. Since media platforms evolved but challenges remain, this is the connection.

4. The article links Glen Powell's stardom discussions to the doc's exploration of stardom's changes. The first paragraph says the author's talks about stardom due to Powell led to the doc's theme.

5. Taylor stopped trying to fix her image, realizing the public had fixed views. The answer connects her response to media scrutiny and the shift in celebrity culture over time.

6. The documentary says her giving up on image led her to AIDS activism. The text states her third act as an activist came after media issues, so the connection is her shift to activism after image struggles.

7. Her marriages are part of scandals that the public consumed, reflecting how scandals became more focused on destruction. The doc shows the public's shift to feeding on scandals via her marriages.

8. Taylor said people have fixed images of stars, either good or bad, so trying to explain confuses them. That's her insight on self vs public image.

9. The article says social media and small-screen changed the celebrity process. So one change is the role of social media and TV in stardom.

10. The text explicitly states social media and small-screen changed the process of becoming a celebrity, so that's the answer here.

Need to check each answer against the text to ensure accuracy. Avoid any inferences beyond the article. If a question isn't addressed directly, use N/A. Let me verify each point again quickly.
