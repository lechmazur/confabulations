Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me start by going through each question carefully.

1. **Financial implication if Paramount chooses Bronfman over Skydance:** The article mentions a $400 million breakup fee to Skydance if the deal doesn't close. So, choosing Bronfman would mean paying that fee. The answer should be the breakup fee.

2. **Bronfman's strategic advantage over Ellison:** The text says Bronfman has a friendly relationship with Shari Redstone and her family, and he has experience running a public company (Warner Music). Ellison lacks that experience. So the advantages are his relationship and his experience.

3. **Impact of the breakup fee on decision-making:** The fee would make Paramount hesitant to leave Skydance because they'd have to pay $400M. So it's a disincentive to switch.

4. **Control premium's role in Redstone's decision:** The article states Ellison offered a control premium to Shari Redstone, giving her an incentive to stick with Skydance. So the premium directly influences her to stay with the existing deal.

5. **Bronfman's relationship with Redstones:** The article mentions Bronfman is friendly with them, which gives him a toehold. This likely makes his bid more acceptable, so the relationship increases his bid's chances.

6. **Consequences for stock if rejecting Bronfman for Skydance:** The text says some shareholders are disenchanted with Ellison. If Paramount sticks with Skydance despite that, the stock might drop because of investor dissatisfaction. But the article doesn't explicitly state consequences, so maybe N/A? Wait, the article says pursuing Bronfman could risk alienating investors who dislike Ellison, but if they reject Bronfman, maybe the stock reacts positively? Hmm, the article says if they don't take Bronfman's bid seriously, it could risk alienating investors who are disenchanted with Ellison. So if they reject Bronfman (stick with Skydance), those investors might be upset, leading to a stock drop. But the question is about consequences if they reject Bronfman (so choose Skydance). The article says some shareholders feel Skydance's valuation is too high, so maybe the stock could go down because investors think the deal undervalues Paramount. The article mentions the stock has suffered, so maybe continuing that trend? But the exact consequence isn't stated. Wait, the article says "investors haven't bought in, and the company's stock has suffered." If they go with Skydance, maybe the stock remains low? But the question is about the consequence of rejecting Bronfman (so choosing Skydance). The article says the existing deal has resistance, so maybe the stock could drop further. But since the article doesn't explicitly state the consequence, maybe N/A? Wait, the article says "if the company's special committee... doesn't take his bid seriously, it could risk alienating investors who are disenchanted with Ellison and Skydance." So if they reject Bronfman (stick with Skydance), those investors might be alienated, leading to stock decline. So the answer is that the stock might drop due to investor dissatisfaction. But the article doesn't explicitly state the consequence, so maybe I need to check again. The exact quote is: "if the company's special committee... doesn't take his bid seriously, it could risk alienating investors who are disenchanted with Mr. Ellison and Skydance." So rejecting Bronfman's bid (by choosing Skydance) could lead to alienating those investors, which might hurt the stock. So the answer is that the stock could decline due to investor dissatisfaction.

7. **Media executive with public company experience submitting a bid:** The article says Bronfman has experience running Warner Music Group, a public company, so he's the one challenging the Skydance deal. The answer is Edgar Bronfman Jr.

8. **Outcome for Shari's voting clout if Bronfman wins:** The existing deal (Skydance) includes a control premium for her voting power. If Bronfman's bid wins, she might lose that premium. The article says Bronfman's bid doesn't mention a premium, so her voting clout might diminish, but the exact outcome? The article states that Ellison's deal gives her a control premium in exchange for her support. If Bronfman's bid prevails, she might not get that, so her voting clout would lose its financial incentive. The answer is that her voting clout would lose the financial incentive (premium), so her influence might decrease. The article says "David Ellison has also guaranteed Ms. Redstone an additional payout in exchange for her voting clout — what's known as a control premium." So if Bronfman wins, she wouldn't get that, so her voting clout's value would be gone. The likely outcome is her voting clout diminishes or is no longer monetized.

9. **Comparison of Ellison's valuation vs. Paramount's value:** The article states that Skydance's valuation ($4.75B) is seen as too high relative to Paramount's value. So Ellison's valuation is higher than Paramount's worth, allowing him to take over at a discount. The answer is that Ellison's valuation is higher than Paramount's value, enabling a discounted takeover.

10. **Outcome for Skydance if Paramount picks Bronfman:** They would have to pay the breakup fee, but the article says Paramount would pay the $400M if they back out. Wait, no—the breakup fee is paid by Paramount to Skydance if the deal doesn't close. Wait, the article says "Paramount has agreed to pay a $400 million 'breakup fee' to Skydance if the deal doesn't close." So if Paramount goes with Bronfman, Skydance gets the fee. But the question is what happens to Skydance. The answer would be Skydance receives the breakup fee but loses the acquisition. The question asks the outcome for Skydance, so they get the fee but don't acquire Paramount.

Now, checking each question again to ensure answers are directly from the text without inference beyond what's stated.

1. Breakup fee is a financial implication. Correct.

2. Relationship with Redstone and experience. Correct.

3. Breakup fee makes it costly to leave Skydance, so decision harder. Correct.

4. Control premium incentivizes Redstone to stay with Skydance. Correct.

5. Friendly relationship increases likelihood. Correct.

6. The article does mention that rejecting Bronfman's bid could alienate investors, leading to stock decline. So answer is stock could drop. The exact wording in the article: "If the company's special committee... doesn't take his bid seriously, it could risk alienating investors who are disenchanted with Mr. Ellison and Skydance." So if they reject Bronfman (stick with Skydance), those investors are alienated, leading to possible stock drop. So the answer is stock might decline due to investor dissatisfaction.

7. Bronfman has experience, so he's the one. Correct.

8. Losing the control premium, so her voting clout's financial benefit is gone. The answer is her voting clout would lose the financial incentive (so maybe "diminished" or "loses the control premium"). The question asks the outcome for her voting clout. Since the premium was tied to her voting power, without it, her clout's value is gone. So answer is "loses the control premium" or "diminished". The article says "David Ellison has also guaranteed Ms. Redstone an additional payout in exchange for her voting clout — what's known as a control premium." If Bronfman's bid wins, she wouldn't get that, so her voting clout's value is lost. The answer is "loses the control premium."

9. Ellison's valuation is higher than Paramount's, allowing discount. Correct.

10. Skydance gets the breakup fee but doesn't acquire Paramount. So the outcome is they receive the $400M but don't take over Paramount. The question asks the likely outcome for Skydance, so answer is they receive the breakup fee but lose the acquisition.

Now, ensuring all answers are in the correct format, using N/A where appropriate. Let me check each question again for exactness.

Question 6: The article does imply that choosing Skydance over Bronfman's bid might lead to investor dissatisfaction, hence stock consequences. So answer is not N/A.

All others seem covered. Now, structure the answers accordingly.
