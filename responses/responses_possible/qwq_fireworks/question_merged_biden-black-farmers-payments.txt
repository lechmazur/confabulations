Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article. 

1. **Question 1**: The article mentions that President Biden faced criticism for delays and that Black farmers accused him of not keeping promises. The eventual outcome was the start of disbursements. The contrast is shown through the initial promises versus the delays and the eventual action. The answer should be "delays and lawsuits thwarted efforts" but maybe more directly. Wait, the question is about illustrating the contrast. The article says "political problem...accusing him of failing... Today that promise has become reality." So the contrast is between his promise and the delays. The answer would be "delays and lawsuits" but the exact phrasing from the article? The first paragraph says "follow years of delays and lawsuits that frustrated..." and Biden's statement. So the answer is "delays and legal battles thwarted the government's efforts to compensate them." But the question asks how the article illustrates the contrast. The answer is the delays and lawsuits versus the eventual payout. So the article's illustration is through the delays and lawsuits. The answer is "delays and lawsuits" but maybe the exact quote from the article's first sentence? Wait, the question is about the contrast between the promises and the outcome. The outcome was the start of payouts after years of delays. So the contrast is shown by the initial promise vs the delayed execution. The article says "the Biden administration said... started disbursing... after years of delays and lawsuits..." So the contrast is the delays and lawsuits vs the eventual start. The answer is "delays and lawsuits" but the exact phrasing? The first sentence says "follow years of delays and lawsuits that frustrated..." So the answer is "delays and lawsuits".

2. **Question 2**: The second-highest number of recipients. The article states Mississippi and Alabama had the most. So the second-highest would be another state, but the question is about a senator from a state with the second-highest. Wait, the article mentions Senator Raphael Warnock from Georgia. The article says "Ms. Harris in states like Georgia, where there was substantial frustration... Senator Raphael Warnock... These payments... will go a long way..." So Georgia might be the second? But the article doesn't specify the order beyond Mississippi and Alabama being the top. Since the question is about a senator from the second-highest, but without knowing which state is second, but the only mentioned senator is Warnock from Georgia. Since the article doesn't list other states, maybe Georgia is the next, but we can't confirm. Wait, the question says "second-highest number of payment recipients". The article only says Mississippi and Alabama have the most. The rest are not specified. So perhaps the senator is from another state but the only one mentioned is Warnock from Georgia. The question asks which senator from a state that has the second highest. Since we don't know which state is second, but the only senator mentioned is Warnock, so maybe that's the answer? The article says "Senator Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat." So the answer is "Raphael Warnock".

3. **Question 3**: Demographic group receiving 75% of the funds. The article says John Boyd said Black farmers got $1.5B of $2B total. 1.5/2 is 75%. So the answer is "Black farmers".

4. **Question 4**: Protected characteristic not in federal employment laws. The article mentions eligibility includes race, gender, sexual orientation, religion. Federal anti-discrimination laws like Title VII cover race, color, religion, sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity as per recent rulings, but maybe the article's context is older?), national origin. Wait, the article says the program covers discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. The question is which of these is not covered in federal employment laws. Sexual orientation was only recently included via Bostock v. Clayton County (2020). So if the article is from before that, maybe sexual orientation wasn't covered. But the article's date isn't given. The article mentions "sexual orientation" as part of the eligibility, but federal employment laws (Title VII) now do include sexual orientation. Wait, but the question is about which is NOT explicitly covered. The article says the program covers those characteristics, but the question is about federal anti-discrimination laws in employment. The article's program might have broader coverage. Wait, the question is about the characteristics mentioned in the article that are not in federal employment laws. The article's program uses race, gender, sexual orientation, religion. If the federal laws (like Title VII) don't include sexual orientation, but the article's program does, then that's the answer. Since the question is about which of the mentioned in the article is not in federal employment laws. Assuming that sexual orientation wasn't explicitly in federal employment laws until Bostock (2020), but the article's program might be under USDA, not employment. Wait, the question specifies "in employment contexts". The article's program is about discrimination in farm loans, which is not employment. Wait, the question is about federal anti-discrimination laws in employment contexts. The protected characteristics in the article's program are for discrimination in loans, not employment. The question is asking which of the mentioned characteristics (race, gender, sexual orientation, religion) is not covered in federal employment laws. The answer would be sexual orientation, if that's the case. Since Title VII now includes it, but maybe the article's context is pre-2020? The article's date isn't given, but the Inflation Reduction Act 2022 is mentioned. Bostock was 2020, so now Title VII includes sexual orientation. So perhaps the answer is N/A? Wait, the question is asking which of the four is NOT covered. The article says the program covers those four. The question is which of those four is not in federal employment laws. Since all are covered now, maybe the answer is N/A. Wait, but the article's program is about discrimination in farm loans, not employment. The question is about employment contexts. The protected characteristics in employment are race, color, religion, sex (including sexual orientation), national origin. So sexual orientation is covered under sex via Bostock. So all four are covered except maybe religion? No, religion is covered. Wait, perhaps the article mentions "sexual orientation" which might not be explicitly listed in older federal laws, but under Bostock it is. So maybe the answer is N/A, but the question says "explicitly covered". Since Title VII says "sex", and Bostock interpreted it to include sexual orientation, but it's not explicit in the text. So the explicit federal laws might not list sexual orientation, so the answer is "sexual orientation".

5. **Question 5**: Number of farmers to account for the non-Black portion. Total is $2B, Black got $1.5B, so non-Black got $0.5B. Average payout is $82,000. So 0.5B / 82,000 = approx 6,097. The question is asking how many farmers would need to receive the average payout to account for the portion not received by Black farmers. The portion not received by Black farmers is $500 million (2B-1.5B). So 500,000,000 / 82,000 ≈ 6,097. So the answer is "approximately 6,098" but the question says "how many farmers would need to receive" so rounded? The article says average payment is $82,000. The exact calculation is 500,000,000 divided by 82,000. Let me compute that: 500,000,000 / 82,000 = 500,000,000 ÷ 82,000 = 6,097.56, so approximately 6,098. But the article might use exact numbers. The answer is 6,097.56, but since you can't have a fraction, maybe 6,098. The question says "how many farmers", so the answer is 6098. But the question might expect rounding to the nearest whole number. The answer should be "6,098".

6. **Question 6**: Who changed stance after disbursement? The article says John Boyd said in June he wouldn't support Biden, but after the disbursement (Wednesday), he was open to supporting Kamala Harris. So the answer is "John Boyd".

7. **Question 7**: Percentage allocated to states other than MS and AL if they got 30%. The question says "assuming these two states received 30% of the total". Wait, the article says Mississippi and Alabama have the most recipients, but doesn't specify the percentage. The question is hypothetical: if those two states received 30%, then the rest would be 70%. The question is asking what percentage of the total fund went to other states. So 70%. The answer is "70%".

8. **Question 8**: Which state's farmers could influence support for an executive branch member? The article mentions Georgia and Senator Warnock, and John Boyd's comment about Georgia's frustration. It also says support of Black farmers could help Kamala Harris in Georgia. So the state is Georgia. The answer is "Georgia".

9. **Question 9**: Difference between recipients and non-recipients as a percentage of applicants. Total applicants: 60,000. Recipients: 43,000. Non-recipients: 60k -43k =17k. The difference is 43k -17k =26k. The question asks the difference (43k - (60k-43k)=26k) as a percentage of total applicants. So (26,000 /60,000)*100= ~43.33%. The answer is "43.33%".

10. **Question 10**: Total funds not distributed to Black farmers. The article says Black received ~1.5B of 2B total. So 0.5B. The answer is "$500 million".

Now check each question again for exactness.

1. The first question asks how the article illustrates the contrast between Biden's promises and the outcome. The article states the delays and lawsuits caused frustration, but the program started. The answer should be "delays and lawsuits" as that's what contrasted the promise with the delayed outcome. The exact wording from the article: "after years of delays and legal battles thwarted the federal government's efforts to compensate them." So the answer is "delays and legal battles".

2. Senator from second-highest state. Since Mississippi and Alabama are highest, but the next isn't known. However, the only senator mentioned is Warnock from Georgia. The question is about a senator from a state with the second-highest. Since we don't know the actual second state, but the answer given in the article is Warnock, perhaps that's the intended answer because he's the only senator mentioned in context of the program's support. So answer is "Raphael Warnock".

3. Correct, Black farmers got 75%, so answer is "Black farmers".

4. The protected characteristics: the article includes sexual orientation. Federal employment laws (Title VII) now include it via Bostock, but if the question is about explicit listing, maybe it's not. However, the question is about which is NOT explicitly covered in federal anti-discrimination laws in employment. Since the article's program is about farm loans, not employment, but the question is about employment contexts. The protected characteristics in employment are race, color, religion, sex (including sexual orientation as per Bostock), national origin. So all are covered except maybe sexual orientation was not explicit before 2020. Since the article is about 2022 (Inflation Reduction Act 2022), and Bostock was 2020, so it's covered. Therefore, the answer might be N/A. Wait, the question says "not explicitly covered". If the law doesn't list sexual orientation explicitly but it's inferred, then maybe it's the answer. Alternatively, maybe the article's program includes sexual orientation beyond what's in federal employment laws. But the question is about the characteristics mentioned in the article. Since the article says the program covers those four, but the question is which of those four is not in federal employment laws. Since all are covered now, perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait, the article's program is for discrimination in loans, not employment. The question is about employment contexts. So maybe the answer is N/A? But the options are the four mentioned. Alternatively, perhaps religion is covered, so maybe none. Hmm. Maybe the question is a trick. Alternatively, perhaps the article mentions "sexual orientation" which is a protected class in the program but not in federal employment laws? But no, Title VII now does. So maybe the answer is N/A. Wait the question says "explicitly covered". Since sexual orientation is covered under "sex" via interpretation, but not explicitly listed, so the explicit characteristic not listed would be sexual orientation. So the answer is "sexual orientation".

5. Calculation correct: 500,000,000 /82,000 ≈6097.56 → 6098. So answer is "6,098".

6. Correct: John Boyd.

7. If Mississippi and Alabama received 30%, then others got 70%. The question is "percentage allocated to farmers in states other than...", so 70%. Answer "70%".

8. Georgia.

9. Difference between recipients (43k) and non-recipients (17k) is 26k. As a percentage of total applicants (60k), that's (26/60)*100 ≈43.33%. So "43.33%".

10. 2B -1.5B =500 million. So "$500 million".

Now check each against the instructions: must be exact from the text unless inferred.

For question 4, the article's program includes sexual orientation, but federal employment laws (Title VII) now do as well. Unless the question is considering before Bostock, but the article is from 2022. So maybe the answer is N/A. Wait the question is which is NOT explicitly covered. If the law doesn't explicitly list it, then it's not explicitly covered. Since the law says "sex", and sexual orientation is interpreted under that, then it's not explicitly listed. So the answer is "sexual orientation".
