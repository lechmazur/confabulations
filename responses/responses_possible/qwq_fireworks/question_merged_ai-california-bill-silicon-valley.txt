Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and don't infer beyond what's stated.

1. **Question 1**: The first question asks which aspect of AI development could be most affected, leading to a shift in innovation. The article mentions that critics argue the bill could push AI development out of California to other states. The reason given is the potential legal and liability issues under SB 1047. So the answer is about the location shift due to the bill's requirements.

2. **Question 2**: The tech executive whose stance contradicts previous statements. The article says that many AI experts and tech execs previously urged for guardrails but now oppose the bill. The specific executive mentioned is Yann LeCun (Meta's AI chief) and others like Andrew Ng and Fei-Fei Li. But the question asks for "tech executive," so maybe Yann LeCun?

3. **Question 3**: The bill's origins and a philosophical movement. The article states the bill has ties to the Center for AI Safety, linked to effective altruism, which is concerned with existential threats. So the connection is effective altruism's focus on preventing existential threats.

4. **Question 4**: The expert whose testimony conflicts with their company's position. Dario Amodei of Anthropic testified about future risks (like biological attacks), but Anthropic opposes the bill in its current form. So Amodei's testimony vs. Anthropic's opposition.

5. **Question 5**: The bill's requirement leading to power consolidation. The article mentions Jeremy Howard's point that requiring safety tests could mean only big companies can afford it, leading to consolidation. The aspect is the safety testing costs and requirements favoring large companies.

6. **Question 6**: Irony in the tech industry's response. The industry initially called for guardrails but now opposes this bill. The irony is that they previously asked for government regulation but now reject it in California.

7. **Question 7**: Company opposing the bill despite CEO warnings. Dario Amodei (Anthropic's CEO) warned about risks but his company opposed the bill. So Anthropic's opposition vs. Amodei's previous warnings.

8. **Question 8**: Bill aspect that could worsen risks. Critics say the bill might stifle open-source sharing, which is seen as a way to identify and fix issues. So the requirement for safety testing and liability could reduce open-source collaboration, making risks harder to mitigate.

9. **Question 9**: Contradiction between safety tests and studies. The article mentions studies by OpenAI showed current AI isn't more dangerous than search engines, but the bill requires safety tests. The contradiction is that current tech isn't significantly dangerous, so the tests might be overkill or conflicting with findings.

10. **Question 10**: Bill aspect pushing development elsewhere. Similar to question 1, the requirement for safety testing and potential legal issues might drive companies to other states or countries, especially due to costs and liability.

Need to check each answer against the text to ensure accuracy and that there's no missing info. Let me verify each point again quickly.
