Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided. 

1. **Question 1:** How does the portrayal of AI in "Alien: Resurrection" vs "Prometheus" differ? The article mentions that "Resurrection" has an android created by androids, while "Prometheus" has Michael Fassbender's android with a suavely threatening performance. So the difference is that in Resurrection, the AI is made by other androids, whereas in Prometheus, it's a more traditional android with a menacing role. 

2. **Question 2:** Ripley's character development in "Alien 3" vs "Aliens." The article says "Alien 3" has Weaver's best performance and a "core melancholia," while "Aliens" is criticized for being formulaic with a little girl in peril and action clichés. So "Aliens" is more action-oriented with a tough, militaristic tone, while "Alien 3" is more somber and introspective.

3. **Question 3:** Which film's title has a name related to the city where Rome's founders were raised. The question refers to Romulus, the city where Romulus and Remus were raised. The article mentions "Alien: Romulus" as the latest film. So the answer is "Alien: Romulus."

4. **Question 4:** The film that could be an opera. The article says "Resurrection" has a "baroque atmosphere" making it the one that could be an opera. 

5. **Question 5:** Which film's trailer is praised in the same section as introducing a female sci-fi character. The first movie, "Alien," introduced Ripley as a significant female character. The article says "Even the trailer was amazing. No notes." So the answer is "Alien."

6. **Question 6:** Film with numeric designation matching an adjective's use. The article says "Alien 3" is the "maudit" (cursed) and "three times the bleakness." The number 3 in the title matches "three times" the bleakness. So "Alien 3."

7. **Question 7:** Score praised in a section with criticized dialogue. "Alien 3" has Elliot Goldenthal's score praised, while the article doesn't mention dialogue issues here. Wait, looking again: "Aliens" has bad dialogue (cartoonishly aggro, clichés) but its score is by James Horner. The article says "Alien 3" has a haunting grandeur and the score is praised. The question is about a film where the score is praised but dialogue is criticized. Wait, maybe "Aliens" has a score but the dialogue is criticized. The article says "Aliens" has "hackneyed would-be catchphrases" (dialogue issues) and mentions the score by Horner. But the article doesn't praise the score of "Aliens"—it's just mentioned. The article says "Alien 3" has a score praised. Hmm, maybe the answer is "Alien 3" but I need to check. Wait the question is which film's score is praised in the same section where its dialogue is criticized. Looking at each film's section:

- "Alien" (1979): no dialogue criticism.
- "Aliens" (1986): criticized for dialogue (cartoonishly aggro, clichés, etc.), but the score is mentioned as "bombastically martial" but not necessarily praised. The article doesn't explicitly praise it.
- "Alien 3" (1992): score is praised ("haunting grandeur... imaginative score"), and there's no mention of dialogue being criticized here. The problem with "Alien 3" is its production chaos but the article says it's good now.
- "Resurrection" (1997): no dialogue issues mentioned.
- "Prometheus" (2012): dialogue not discussed.
- "Covenant" (2017): maybe, but the article says "characters making idiotic decisions" but not dialogue specifically.
Hmm, maybe "Alien 3" isn't the right one. Wait the question is where the score is praised in the same section where dialogue is criticized. The only film where the dialogue is criticized is "Aliens". But the score of "Aliens" is described as "bombastically martial" but not necessarily praised. The article says "worst: almost everything else" including the dialogue, but does it praise the score? Not clearly. Maybe the answer is N/A? Wait the question says "score is praised in the same section where its dialogue is heavily criticized." The only film where dialogue is criticized is "Aliens". The score there is mentioned but not praised. So maybe N/A? But maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The "Aliens" section says: "a bombastically martial score (by James Horner) and, worst of all, an avalanche of hackneyed would-be catchphrases." The score is described but not praised. So no. The only other possibility is "Alien 3" but its dialogue isn't criticized. Hmm. Maybe the answer is N/A, but the question might refer to another film. Wait "Resurrection" has "scientific experiments getting out of control, corporate greed and the growth of A.I. (introducing an android created by androids) dominate the story, whose baroque atmosphere makes it the one 'Alien' film that could be turned into an opera." But the question is about score and dialogue. Alternatively, maybe "Alien: Romulus" isn't part of the core seven, so the question is about the seven core films. The only film with a praised score and criticized dialogue is none? Then answer N/A. Wait the "Alien 3" section says "Weaver's best performance" and the score is praised. There's no mention of dialogue issues in "Alien 3". So perhaps the answer is N/A. Wait but maybe I missed another film. Let me check again. The article's "Alien 3" section: "Featuring Weaver's best performance in the entire series, 'Alien 3' has a haunting grandeur and a core melancholia that are subtly emphasized by Elliot Goldenthal's imaginative score. This one easily bears repeat watching." No dialogue criticism here. The problem with "Alien 3" was its chaotic production but the article says it's good now. So maybe the answer is N/A. But the question says "heavily criticized"—maybe "Aliens" is the one. The score isn't praised but described as bombastic. Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe the answer is N/A, but the question might have a different angle. Alternatively, maybe the article says that "Aliens" has a score but the article doesn't praise it. So the answer is N/A. But I might be missing something. Let me think again. The article's "Alien 3" section mentions the score positively. The question asks for a film where in the same section, the dialogue is heavily criticized. Since "Alien 3" doesn't have dialogue criticism, but "Aliens" does but its score isn't praised, then the answer is N/A. Hmm, but maybe I'm missing another film. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to "Alien: Resurrection"? No, the article says "Resurrection" had a baroque atmosphere but doesn't mention its score. Wait the article says "whose baroque atmosphere makes it the one 'Alien' film that could be turned into an opera." The score isn't directly discussed there. So maybe the answer is N/A. But I need to check the questions again. The user's question 7 is: "What Alien film's score is praised in the same section where its dialogue is heavily criticized?" Since the only film with heavily criticized dialogue is "Aliens", but its score isn't praised, the answer must be N/A. Wait but maybe I misread. The "Alien 3" section doesn't mention dialogue issues. Maybe "Alien: Covenant" (2017)? The article says "characters who constantly make idiotic decisions" but that's about plot, not dialogue. So yes, maybe the answer is N/A. But perhaps I missed a part. Alternatively, the "Alien 3" has a score praised but no dialogue criticism. So the answer is N/A. Hmm, but the user might expect an answer here. Wait maybe "Alien 3" is the answer? Let me check again. The article says "Alien 3" has a good score but there's no dialogue criticism. So no. Maybe "Alien 3" is not the right one. I'm confused here. Maybe the answer is N/A. Let's proceed and see.

8. **Question 8:** Protagonist's arrival mirrors the creature's emergence. The creature typically emerges from a host after being implanted by a facehugger. The protagonist in "Alien 3" crash-lands, but maybe "Alien: Romulus" has arrival via a spaceship? Wait the article says "Romulus" is set on an abandoned spaceship. The creature's emergence is from hosts. The protagonist's arrival in "Alien 3" is a crash-landing, which is similar to how Ripley arrived in the first film (the Nostromo was heading back when they got the signal). Alternatively, "Alien 3" starts with Ripley crash-landing on a prison planet. The creature's emergence is from hosts. The question is about the protagonist arriving in a way that mirrors the creature's emergence. The creature comes from a host's body. The protagonist's arrival in "Alien 3" is a crash, which isn't similar. Maybe "Alien: Resurrection" where Ripley is a clone waking up on a ship? The creature's emergence is from hosts. The clone's arrival is via cloning, which is a form of artificial reproduction, similar to the creature's reproduction. Alternatively, "Alien" (1979) has the crew receiving a signal and going to the moon, but that's not emergence. Wait, maybe "Alien 3" where Ripley crash-lands, but the creature emerges from her? No, in "Alien 3", the alien comes from another host. Alternatively, "Alien: Resurrection" where she's a clone created by others, similar to how the alien is created. Hmm. The question is the protagonist's method of arrival mirrors the creature's emergence. The creature emerges from a host. The protagonist's arrival in "Resurrection" is via cloning, which is artificial creation, similar to the creature's origin. The article says "a clone of Ripley waking up on a research ship." So the protagonist's arrival (cloning) mirrors the creature's method of reproduction (parasitic). So the answer is "Alien: Resurrection."

9. **Question 9:** Primary antagonist's motivation mirrors a corporate entity. The article mentions corporate malfeasance in the franchise. The corporate entity is mentioned in the first paragraph. In "Alien," the company (Weyland-Yutani) is involved. "Prometheus" deals with the Engineers but also has corporate elements. "Resurrection" has corporate greed. The primary antagonist's motivation: in "Resurrection," the corporate greed is part of the plot. The article says "scientific experiments getting out of control, corporate greed and the growth of A.I." So "Resurrection" has corporate greed as a motivation. The primary antagonist might be the corporation's actions. The question is which film's primary antagonist's motivation mirrors a corporate entity. The article says in "Resurrection," corporate greed is part of the story, so maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, "Alien: Covenant" (2017) also deals with the company's role. The article says "the essence of the 'Alien' franchise gets diluted" but the primary antagonist's motivation in "Covenant" might be the company's actions. Wait, the article says "the problem is that giving death an origin story is pointless... the plot revolves around a colony vessel that picks up a strange signal..." but the primary antagonist's motivation might be the corporate greed leading them to ignore safety. Alternatively, "Prometheus" is about the Engineers but the company's role is there too. The article says "corporate malfeasance" is a theme. The question is which film's primary antagonist is motivated like a corporate entity. Maybe "Alien: Resurrection" where the company's experiments led to the problem. The primary antagonist's motivation (the corporation's greed) so the answer is "Alien: Resurrection."

10. **Question 10:** Setting's isolation mirrors the director's rookie status. The article says "Alien 3" was directed by David Fincher, a rookie, and the setting is a prison planet. The isolation of the setting (prison planet) mirrors Fincher's isolation as a new director? Or maybe the production was chaotic, but the article says "cursed by a chaotic production process, met with a divided reception and disowned by its rookie director." The setting's isolation (prison planet) mirrors the director's status (rookie, maybe isolated in his role). So the answer is "Alien 3."
