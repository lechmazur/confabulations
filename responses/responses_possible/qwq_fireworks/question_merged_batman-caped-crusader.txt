Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information given and follow the strict format.

1. **Question 1:** How does Bruce Timm's approach to Batman's character in "Caped Crusader" differ from his original vision for "BTAS" due to constraints?

The article mentions that Timm felt constrained by content restrictions for children in "BTAS," so in "Caped Crusader," he can hew closer to his original plans. The key difference is not having to worry about toys or traumatizing kids. The answer should be about fewer content restrictions allowing him to realize his original vision more fully. So the answer is "unhindered by content restrictions/studio/network constraints."

2. **Question 2:** Which actor known for comedy and horror roles voiced Batman?

The text says Hamish Linklater, who's been in comedy ("Old Christine") and horror ("Midnight Mass"). So answer is "Hamish Linklater."

3. **Question 3:** What aspect of Batman's relationships differs in "Caped Crusader"?

In "BTAS," Batman had chummy relationships with Robin and Alfred. The new series avoids that. The answer is "not having chummy relationships with allies like Robin and Alfred."

4. **Question 4:** Specific hallucination from "BTAS" that affected an exec producer?

The article mentions Ed Brubaker was affected by an episode where Batman hallucinates his parents' deaths. The hallucination described is "parents walking into a tunnel that turns into a gun barrel with blood pouring out."

5. **Question 5:** Which actor's performance influenced the current voice actor?

Kevin Conroy's portrayal is mentioned as the vibration Hamish Linklater tried to capture. So answer is "Kevin Conroy."

6. **Question 6:** What sets "Caped Crusader" apart regarding Batman's likability?

The article states it's "not necessarily concerned with making Batman likable to Gotham or the audience." So the answer is "not making him likable to Gotham or audience."

7. **Question 7:** Creative approach contrasting current trends?

Timm says he's not doing interconnected universes like others. The answer is "not creating an interconnected DC universe."

8. **Question 8:** Origin story aspect reimagined for Depression era?

The series sets it in the 1930s-40s, so Batman's early days without tech. The answer is "set in Depression-era 1930s/40s with no modern tech."

9. **Question 9:** Trait to avoid contrary to modern interpretations?

Timm wants Batman to be "weird and creepy" instead of likable. The answer is "avoiding making him likable."

Wait, but question 9 asks about a specific trait to avoid contrary to modern takes. The article says modern takes might make him likable, so he avoids that. The exact phrasing is "not concerned with making him likable," so the trait to avoid is being likable.

10. **Question 10:** What can Timm now realize due to fewer restrictions?

The original vision was to make Batman like Shadow/Doc Savageâ€”remote, not showing emotions. So the answer is "Batman as a remote, emotionless pulp hero like Shadow/Doc Savage."

Now check each against the article to ensure accuracy. For example, question 10's answer is about the pulp hero inspiration, which the article states Timm wanted originally but couldn't due to restrictions. Now he can.
