Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure I only use the information from the text and follow the strict format.

1. **Question 1**: The primary reason deepfake videos of a certain individual are effective despite his lack of recent interviews. The article mentions that Musk's fanbase includes crypto enthusiasts and anti-establishment types who are drawn to alternative investment paths. So the answer should be about their belief in hidden wealth secrets.

2. **Question 2**: How scammers use Musk's fanbase and AI. The text says his global fanbase is targeted because they're into crypto and A.I., so combining that with tech makes the scams spread widely.

3. **Question 3**: Irony of Musk's deepfakes in crypto scams. The article states Musk has been critical of crypto, like Bitcoin, so using his image for crypto scams is ironic.

4. **Question 4**: Temporal sequence from AI tools to scams. The article says the new wave started after public release of AI tools, leading to more scams. So the answer is the release of tools enabled the rise.

5. **Question 5**: Discrepancy between authenticity and tech limits. The deepfakes aren't perfect (robotic voice, lip sync issues) but still work because they're convincing enough to some.

6. **Question 6**: Social media policies vs. scammers. Platforms like Facebook and YouTube have policies but scammers adapt tactics to evade detection, leading to a cat-and-mouse game.

7. **Question 7**: Financial strategy exploiting psychology. Scammers ask for small initial investments, then lure targets into bigger ones by showing fake growth, preying on greed.

8. **Question 8**: Technology repurposed for scams. The article mentions A.I. tools used for cloning voices and editing videos, which were initially non-malicious but now used for fraud.

9. **Question 9**: Musk's speech pattern. The article says they replicated his stilted cadence and South African accent.

10. **Question 10**: Cost-to-impact ratio. The videos cost as little as $10 to make but can defraud millions, so high impact low cost.

Now I need to make sure each answer is direct and from the text. Let me check each again:

1. Correct, the article mentions the demographic's belief in hidden wealth secrets.
2. Combining fanbase and AI tech for reach.
3. Musk's stance against crypto vs using him in crypto scams.
4. AI tools' release led to scam rise.
5. Imperfections but still effective.
6. Platforms' policies vs scammers' adaptability.
7. Small initial investments leading to more.
8. AI voice-cloning and video tools.
9. Cadence and accent.
10. Low cost, high impact.

All answers are supported. None are N/A. Formatting is key here.
