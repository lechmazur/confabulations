1. **Question 1**: How does Mukhtar Babayev's career background create a potential conflict of interest in his role at COP29?  
   The article mentions Babayev worked in the state oil company. So his background in the oil industry might conflict with promoting climate goals that aim to reduce fossil fuels. Answer: His career in the state oil company.

2. **Question 2**: What geopolitical factors contributed to Azerbaijan being the last option for hosting COP29?  
   The text says Russia vetoed other candidates due to their opposition to its Ukraine invasion. So Russia's vetoes left Azerbaijan as the only option. Answer: Russia vetoed other candidates opposing their stance on Ukraine.

3. **Question 3**: What role does the European Union's energy policy play in Azerbaijan's defense of natural gas production?  
   EU requested more gas despite opposing fossil fuels, which Babayev uses to justify gas as a transitional fuel. Answer: EU's demand for Azerbaijani gas despite opposing fossil fuels.

4. **Question 4**: What is the potential impact of Trump's possible re-election on Azerbaijan's climate commitments?  
   The article mentions Trump could roll back clean energy laws and boost fossil fuels, affecting global commitments. Answer: Threatens global climate progress if he rolls back clean energy policies.

5. **Question 5**: What is the irony in Azerbaijan hosting COP29 given its energy transition stage?  
   They rely heavily on oil/gas but host a climate summit. The article states irony in their fossil fuel dependence vs. hosting the conference. Answer: Hosts a climate summit despite being a major fossil fuel producer.

6. **Question 6**: What is the implication of Russia's veto power in selecting COP29's host?  
   It shows how geopolitical conflicts influence UN processes, possibly choosing a less ideal host. Answer: Demonstrates geopolitical interference in UN climate processes.

7. **Question 7**: How do methane leaks complicate Azerbaijan's defense of natural gas?  
   Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, undermining gas's "cleaner" image. The article notes this. Answer: Methane leaks negate gas's climate benefits.

8. **Question 8**: What's the paradox in investing in renewables and increasing gas exports?  
   They push renewables but expand gas, which contradicts reducing fossil fuel reliance. The article mentions this contradiction. Answer: Promoting gas exports while advocating renewables creates a contradiction.

9. **Question 9**: What contradiction in Western policies does Azerbaijan's gas exports highlight?  
   EU bans fossil fuel financing but buys Azerbaijani gas, needing others to fund pipelines. Answer: Europe opposes fossil fuels but relies on them, shifting funding responsibilities.
