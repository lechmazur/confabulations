Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the article provided. Let me start by reading through the questions again and then check the article for each answer.

1. **Question 1:** The article mentions the ATR 72-500 model and improvements to its de-icing system after the 1994 crash. The red herring here might be that since they improved the system, people might think icing isn't the cause, but the article says the system's effectiveness is in question. So the answer is that it's a red herring because the system was improved but might have failed this time.

2. **Question 2:** The speed was around 325 mph but dropped, but without severe icing, that speed shouldn't cause a stall. The conditional is that if icing was severe, then the stall could happen even at higher speeds. So the article's mention of speed and altitude creates a condition where icing severity is a factor.

3. **Question 3:** The crash location's temperature was 63°F, which isn't very cold. The anti-icing system's rubber tubes might not be needed in such mild temps, challenging the icing theory because it's not a typical icy condition.

4. **Question 4:** A stall usually leads to a nosedive, but the plane spun and fell on its belly, which isn't typical. The article says the spin indicates loss of control, which contradicts the usual stall outcome.

5. **Question 5:** The speed didn't drop low enough for a stall unless severe ice was present. The discrepancy is that the speed alone wouldn't cause a stall, so the theory needs ice to explain it.

6. **Question 6:** Pilots didn't communicate an emergency before the crash. Protocol would require alerting controllers to descend, so not doing so conflicts with standard procedures.

7. **Question 7:** The location's temperature (63°F) contradicts the assumption that severe icing would occur in a warmer area like Brazil, not Antarctica.

8. **Question 8:** The improved de-icing system post-1994 might now be suspected of failing, complicating the investigation since it was supposed to prevent such issues.

9. **Question 9:** The anti-icing system uses rubber tubes. If they didn't inflate, that's crucial. The article mentions whether they were activated or failed, so the system's components are key.

10. **Question 10:** The plane fell from 17,000 feet quickly. Gradual ice accumulation would take time, but a sudden stall suggests a rapid issue, not gradual buildup.

Wait, let me check each against the article again to ensure accuracy.

For question 7, the expert compared it to Antarctica, but the crash was in Brazil with 63°F, so that's the contradiction. Yes.

For question 10, the altitude drop was sudden, which challenges the idea of slow ice buildup leading to stall over time. The article mentions the speed dropped sharply, but the altitude part is about the sudden fall.

I think all answers are covered. Let me structure them now.
