Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. I need to make sure each answer is directly from the text or logically inferred without external knowledge.

1. **Question 1**: How does "Didi" use the protagonist's interactions with technology to reflect his internal struggles and growth?  
   The article mentions Chris uses a camcorder and sites like YouTube, MySpace, and AIM. These technologies are part of his attempt to capture his world, which mirrors his growth in seeing others. The answer should link tech tools to his perspective.

2. **Question 2**: Focus on social media specifically. The text says he uses MySpace and later Facebook, and checks Top 8 lists. His online presence (like Top 8) reflects social status. The answer might be "Top 8" as a metaphor for social hierarchy.

3. **Question 3**: The mother, Chungsing, is initially seen as two-dimensional by Chris but later revealed with depth. The article states parents seem 2D to teens but the mom has hidden dreams. So the answer is Chungsing.

4. **Question 4**: The mother is a painter. The article says she has dreams she keeps to herself, connecting to themes of perception and self-expression. Answer: painting.

5. **Question 5**: A detail like being in someone's Top 8 on MySpace shows social status. The article mentions checking if a friend is in the Top 8, so that's the detail.

6. **Question 6**: The slang and crude talk about sex contrast with their virginity. The article says they use crude slang but are virgins, so the answer is that their posturing contrasts with reality.

7. **Question 7**: Skateboarding and filming it is mentioned. Filming skateboarders is his hobby, symbolizing capturing the changing world. The answer is filming skateboarders.

8. **Question 8**: The MySpace Top 8 is both a plot point (checking the list) and a metaphor for social hierarchy. Same as question 2's answer.

9. **Question 9**: The mother's hidden dreams as a painter. The article states she has dreams she keeps to herself, so that's the hidden aspect.

10. **Question 10**: The camcorder he uses for skateboarding and observation. It's his tool and a metaphor for perspective. Answer: camcorder.

Wait, need to check each question again for exact wording. Let me recheck each:

1. The article says Chris uses camcorder, YouTube, etc., and the film's theme is about learning to see. So the answer would involve using tech to capture world, showing growth in perspective. The exact phrase: "obsessed with filming skateboarders... metaphor for attempts to capture and understand."

2. Social media specifically: MySpace and Top 8. The answer for Q5 is Top 8, so Q2's answer might be using MySpace and Facebook transition to show his social status and era's digital landscape.

3. The character is the mother, Chungsing. Correct.

4. Artistic pursuit: painting. Correct.

5. The detail is being in someone's Top 8.

6. The contrast is between their crude slang (posturing) and actual inexperience (virgins). Answer: their crude slang contrasts with virginity, showing posturing vs reality.

7. The juvenile activity is filming pranks (mailbox) and skateboarding. But the question asks for the activity that's a metaphor. The article says filming skateboarders is part of his attempt to capture the world. So filming skateboarders.

8. The MySpace Top 8 is both a plot point (checking the list) and social hierarchy metaphor. Correct.

9. The mother's artistic dreams as a painter. Correct.

10. The camcorder is the device he uses for filming, symbolizing his perspective. Correct.

Now, ensuring all answers are directly from the text or inferred. For example, Q7's answer is "filming skateboarders" as per the article's mention. Q2's answer could be "MySpace and Facebook transition" but the exact answer might be the Top 8. Wait, Q2's question is about social media's role in reflecting internal struggles. The article says "checks a friend's MySpace page to see if he's still in their Top 8 list" and that this is part of his social status. So the answer to Q2 is using MySpace (and Top 8) to show social status and digital era. But the question asks how it reflects internal struggles and growth. Maybe the answer is the transition from MySpace to Facebook shows his growing up, but the article says he's stuck in MySpace while friends move to Facebook, indicating his lag in social status. So the answer could be "his MySpace presence versus friends moving to Facebook" but the exact wording in the text says "checks a friend's MySpace page to see if he's still in their Top 8 list" which is a detail about his online presence. The question's answer might be the Top 8 as a metaphor for social status (Q5's answer is the same detail, so need to check. Wait, Q5's question is about "seemingly insignificant detail about his online presence becomes a metaphor for social status and era's digital landscape". So Q2's answer might be broader, like using social media to show his struggle with identity. Hmm, perhaps the answer is the transition from MySpace to Facebook, but the article says "friends are starting to move toward the cleaner, more sophisticated Facebook." So his clinging to MySpace while friends move on could show his struggle. But the question is how the interactions with social media reflect internal struggles and growth. So maybe the answer is "his lingering on MySpace as friends move to Facebook reflects his social insecurity and growing awareness of change."

But the instructions say to answer directly from the text. The article states: "he checks a friend's MySpace page to see if he's still in their Top 8 list" — so the Top 8 is the detail for Q5, and for Q2, the broader use of MySpace and the shift to Facebook. However, the exact answer for Q2 would need to be concise. Maybe the answer is "his MySpace use and Top 8 status reflect his social struggles and growth in navigating digital spaces." But the instructions prefer sentence fragments. The article says: "they feel universal... when Chris flubs a first kiss... when he flips out at his mother..." but the social media part is about his use of MySpace and Top 8. Maybe the answer is "using MySpace and Top 8 to gauge social standing, highlighting his insecurity and the era's digital norms."

Alternatively, the article says "they feel universal... as much about realizing how others see you as learning to see them..." so maybe the answer is that his social media interactions (like Top 8) show his need for acceptance and growing awareness of social dynamics.

But given the strict instructions, perhaps the answer to Q2 is "his use of MySpace and Top 8 status reflects his social insecurities and the era's digital landscape, highlighting his struggle to fit in." But the answer must be a fragment. The article says "checks a friend's MySpace page to see if he's still in their Top 8 list" — so the answer to Q2 would be "MySpace and Top 8 usage shows his social status and digital era context, reflecting his struggles with identity and acceptance."

But the question asks how the film uses his interactions with social media to reflect internal struggles and growth. The answer from the text would be that his interactions (like checking Top 8, using MySpace while friends move to Facebook) show his social insecurity and the transition between platforms mirrors his growth. But the exact wording in the article for social media's role is: "he checks a friend's MySpace page to see if he's still in their Top 8 list" — so the answer for Q2 is "his MySpace activity (Top 8) and the shift to Facebook reflect his social status anxieties and growth in navigating digital environments."

But since the answer must be concise, perhaps the answer is "using MySpace and Top 8 to gauge social standing, reflecting his insecurity and era's digital norms."

Alternatively, the article says "the exact variety of aimless discomfort... he spends a lot of time poking around YouTube... he has a MySpace account, but his friends are starting to move toward Facebook." So the contrast between MySpace and Facebook indicates his lag in social trends, which reflects his internal struggle to keep up. The answer might be "his lingering on MySpace as friends move to Facebook mirrors his social awkwardness and growth."

But the exact answer must be from the text. Let me check each question again carefully.

1. Technology interactions (camcorder, YouTube, etc.) used to reflect his growth in perspective. The answer is "filming skateboarders and using tech tools to capture his world, symbolizing his evolving perspective."

2. Social media (MySpace, Top 8) shows his social status and the era's digital landscape. The answer is "his MySpace presence and Top 8 status reflect his social insecurities and the digital era's norms, highlighting his growth in understanding social dynamics."

But the question requires a direct answer. Since the article says that the Top 8 is part of his online activities, maybe the answer is "the protagonist's MySpace Top 8 status reflects his social standing and the era's digital environment, illustrating his internal struggles with identity and belonging."

But the answer must be concise. Maybe "Top 8 on MySpace" as the detail for Q5, and for Q2, the broader use of social media (MySpace and Facebook shift) to show his struggles.

Alternatively, the article states: "they feel universal... as much about realizing how others see you as it is about learning to see them..." so social media's role is in how others see him. The answer for Q2 is "social media interactions (like MySpace and Top 8) highlight his struggle to understand social perception and his place in the digital world."

But to stick strictly to the text's exact mentions, the answer for Q2 is "using MySpace and Top 8 to gauge social acceptance, reflecting his internal struggles with identity and the era's digital norms."

However, the instructions say to answer in a sentence fragment or words. Maybe "MySpace and Top 8 usage reflects social status and digital era, showing his struggles."

Proceeding with the answers as per the text's explicit mentions, and ensuring each question's answer is correctly mapped.
