<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Because daily doses of protease inhibitors are too expensive for most people with H.I.V. to rely on, and while lenacapavir may be more effective, it may also be difficult to ensure that people keep up with twice-yearly shots.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It might make it harder for people to transmit H.I.V. to others.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>TIPs insert themselves into the DNA of a patient's immune cells, becoming a permanent part of their bodies, which raises concerns about obtaining consent from others who may be infected with TIPs through transmission.</answer>

<answer>N/A</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The potential for unexpected side effects that cannot be removed due to TIPs becoming a permanent part of the patient's body.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>TIPs can outcompete H.I.V. in infected cells because they can replicate three times more than H.I.V. viruses when the infected cells burst open.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The risk of unexpected side effects that cannot be removed due to TIPs becoming a permanent part of the patient's body.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Because, in principle, the strategy of using cheating viruses like TIPs could be applied universally to develop antivirals for other viruses.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>It complicates the ethical considerations because doctors cannot obtain consent from others who may be infected with TIPs through transmission.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>TIPs work by inserting themselves into the DNA of a patient's immune cells and outcompeting H.I.V., whereas traditional H.I.V. drugs like protease inhibitors work by attacking the virus itself, such as preventing a protein from activating H.I.V.</answer>
