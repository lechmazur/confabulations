<question_number>2</question_number>
<other>Since a double-twisting double tuck dismount has a difficulty rating of H (0.8), and the gymnast needs to achieve a D score of 6.0, we need to subtract the difficulty rating of the dismount from the target D score.</other>
<other>6.0 - 0.8 = 5.2</other>
<other>Since there are 8 skills in total, and the dismount is one of them, the remaining 7 skills need to have a total difficulty rating of 5.2.</other>
<other>However, without knowing the exact difficulty ratings of the other skills, we cannot determine the minimum difficulty rating required for the rest of their skills.</other>

<other>A candle mount has a difficulty rating of C (0.3), and a double tuck dismount has a difficulty rating of D (0.4).</other>
<other>The total difficulty rating of these two skills is 0.3 + 0.4 = 0.7.</other>
<other>To achieve a D score of 5.5, the gymnast needs to have a total difficulty rating of 5.5.</other>
<other>Subtracting the difficulty rating of the mount and dismount from the target D score, we get:</other>
<other>5.5 - 0.7 = 4.8</other>
<other>This means the remaining skills, including the acro series, need to have a total difficulty rating of 4.8.</other>
<other>However, without knowing the exact number and difficulty ratings of the other skills, we cannot determine the minimum difficulty rating required for the acro series.</other>

<other>The gymnast also needs to fulfill the composition requirements, which are worth 2.0 in total.</other>
<other>Adding the difficulty rating of the mount and dismount to the composition requirements, we get:</other>
<other>2.0 + 0.9 = 2.9</other>
