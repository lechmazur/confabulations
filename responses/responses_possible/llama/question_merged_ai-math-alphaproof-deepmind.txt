<answer>It represents a transformative change in the use of A.I. in mathematics and the ability of A.I. systems to do mathematics.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Mathematics requires a combination of abstract, precise, and creative reasoning, making it a good litmus test for reaching artificial general intelligence.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>It represents a step-change in the history of mathematics, where computers can now tackle problems that were previously unsolvable, and potentially prove things that humans can't.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that the A.I. system's current level of mathematical reasoning is comparable to a human silver medalist.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It highlights the system's ability to learn and improve indefinitely without human intervention.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>It serves as a benchmark for its potential to solve research-level mathematical problems, suggesting that a useful research tool may not be far away.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>It implies that mathematicians may eventually be left with nothing to do if computers become better and faster at everything they currently do.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>It reflects the potential for A.I. to surpass human capabilities in mathematical reasoning, as the system can learn and improve indefinitely.</answer>
