<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Because the flow of hemolymph is reduced in thigh injuries, making it more difficult for bacteria to move from the wound into the body.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The presence of multiple muscles in the thighs that keep hemolymph flowing.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Wounds closer to the body (thigh injuries) have a higher amputation success rate, while wounds further away from the body (lower leg injuries) have a lower success rate.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The amputation behavior saves the colony energy by rescuing injured ants and reducing the need to produce new ants to compensate for losses.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The time window for successful amputation is narrower for lower leg injuries compared to thigh injuries.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The multiple muscles in ant thighs help reduce the flow of hemolymph, making it more difficult for bacteria to move from the wound into the body, thus increasing the success of amputation as an infection prevention method.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Bacterial movement plays a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of amputation, as bacteria can penetrate the ant's body more quickly in lower leg injuries, reducing the success rate of amputation.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The injured ant presents its injured leg and calmly sits while another ant gnaws it off, followed by the presentation of the newly amputated wound for cleaning.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>There is a positive correlation between the location of hemolymph-pumping muscles (in the thighs) and the success rate of ant leg amputations.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The high survival rate of amputee ants (90%) contributes to the overall energy efficiency of the colony by reducing the need to produce new ants to compensate for losses.</answer>
