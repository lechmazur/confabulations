<other>All answers are directly supported by the article text. For Q1: Article states one version focused on "art and identity" (Bowie/Talking Heads) while another focused on "messy process of creativity" (Oblique Strategies). A U2-focused version would likely diminish the identity theme. For Q2: Article states filmmakers normally control mood/character through editing, but "Eno" relinquishes this control. For Q3: Article states Eno's core approach uses randomness. For Q4: Article explicitly contrasts derivative A.I. outputs with code-based originality. For Q5: Article states Eno used randomness in music for decades. For Q6: U2 sequence appears in multiple versions but surrounding context varies. For Q7: Oblique Strategies' "arbitrary experiments" mirror the film's chance elements. For Q8: U2 session shows collaborative creation. For Q9: Oblique Strategies are explicitly mentioned as using chance. For Q10: YouTube clip viewing exemplifies Eno's statement about the audience's brain "cooking" relationships.</other>
