<other>I will answer each question strictly based on the article text. For Q1: The sequence is Rockwell acquisition by United Technologies in late 2018, merger with Raytheon in early 2020 forming RTX, Ortberg retiring from RTX in 2021. For Q3: The article doesn't explicitly link Ortberg's appointment to FAA scrutiny, so N/A. For Q5: The article quotes Kevin Michaels saying Ortberg balances long-term strategy with short-term expectations. All other answers are directly extractable from text.</other>
