<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The text describes the Taylor column formation but does not specify any "crucial aspect" of its formation that prevents drifting into warmer waters.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states the iceberg rotates fully in about 24 days. It does not mention Earth's orbit around the Sun (1 year) in relation to the rotation rate or the seamount causing a rotation matching that orbital period.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Melting icebergs like A23a do not significantly contribute to global sea level rise, unlike melting land-based Antarctic glaciers.</answer>
<other>Directly stated: "Melting icebergs that originate from floating ice shelves like A23a do not themselves significantly contribute to global sea level rise... because the ice is already floating in the ocean."</other>

<answer>The calving of iceberg A23 from the Filchner Ice Shelf in 1986.</answer>
<other>The article states: "A23, which was even bigger than A23a, was one of three icebergs that broke off, or calved, from the Filchner Ice Shelf in 1986. A23a broke off later that year". This calving event created A23a.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>Both got trapped in a Taylor column.</answer>
<other>The text states: "Dr. Brearley pointed to a 2015 study that observed a robotic float... trapped in a Taylor column... If A23a spends an extended time in the vortex..."</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Taylor column</answer>
<other>Directly stated: "the gigantic iceberg got caught in what's known as a Taylor column".</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Four years</answer>
<other>Directly stated: "trapped in a Taylor column for four years".</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>100 kilometers</answer>
<other>Directly stated: "The bump A23a is swimming over is about 100 kilometers across".</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Christopher A. Shuman</answer>
<other>Directly stated: "Christopher A. Shuman, a glaciologist... surmised that A23a would eventually go the way of other large icebergs -- toward the island of South Georgia... and melt."</other>
