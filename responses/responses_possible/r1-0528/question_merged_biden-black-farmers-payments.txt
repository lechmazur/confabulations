<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>43.3%</answer>
<other>60,000 applied, 43,000 received payments. Difference: 60,000 - 43,000 = 17,000 did not receive payments. Difference as % of total applicants: (17,000 / 60,000) * 100 ≈ 28.3%. However, the question asks for the difference (17,000) expressed as a percentage of total applicants (60,000), which is (17,000 / 60,000) * 100 ≈ 28.3%. But re-reading: "difference between number who received and number who did not" (43k received - 17k not = 26k difference) as % of total applicants: (26,000 / 60,000) * 100 ≈ 43.3%.</other>
