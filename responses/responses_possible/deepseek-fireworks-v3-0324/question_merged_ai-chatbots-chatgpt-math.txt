<answer>They were never designed to do math, being fine-tuned for determining probabilities rather than rules-based calculations.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Chatbots excel when they have consumed vast quantities of relevant training data, but math accuracy remains inconsistent despite this.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Traditional computing follows step-by-step rules, while A.I. chatbots learn by analyzing data and predicting likely outcomes, leading to math inaccuracies.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>A.I. shifts from rigid, rules-based computing to learning from data, making it more flexible but less precise in math.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>A.I. chatbots prioritize language fluency over mathematical precision, contrasting with traditional computing's focus on accurate calculations.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Errors prompt students to critically compare their answers with the chatbot's, fostering discussion and sharpening critical thinking.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>A.I. systems now excel in language tasks but struggle with math, reversing traditional computing strengths.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Math inconsistencies fuel debate between proponents of large language models and skeptics advocating for broader approaches like "world modeling."</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>A.I. chatbots perform like liberal arts majors (fluent in language) rather than math whizzes, blurring the STEM-liberal arts divide.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>He highlights A.I.'s impressive language skills but notes its lack of accuracy in critical applications requiring "painful precision."</answer>
