<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article doesn't explicitly state how the study's focus on Thwaites Glacier provides insights into the broader stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet, only that it is a fast-receding and least stable glacier in Antarctica.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Its disappearance prevented cliffs from becoming tall enough to trigger runaway breakdown.</answer>
<other>The article states that removing the ice shelf prevented the cliffs from becoming so tall as to trigger a runaway breakdown.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article does not discuss how the study's focus on Thwaites Glacier contributes to understanding collapse in other parts of Antarctica.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>They can easily miss it.</answer>
<other>The article states that if scientists aren't watching, they can easily miss quick collapses.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It looks less likely.</answer>
<other>The study suggests that this particular form of collapse looks less likely than previously thought.</other>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Rob DeConto</answer>
<other>The article states that Rob DeConto was among the researchers who first proposed that ice-cliff instability could spell ruin for West Antarctica.</other>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Faster glacier flow</answer>
<other>The article states that faster glacier flow prevented the cliffs from becoming so tall as to trigger a runaway breakdown.</other>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>How ice behaves when it fractures</answer>
<other>Richard Alley states that scientists don't have enough observations of how ice behaves when it fractures.</other>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Emissions of heat-trapping gases climb to extremely high levels</answer>
<other>The article states that the sea-level rise prediction assumes extremely high levels of emissions.</other>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Taller cliffs lead to faster flow</answer>
<other>The article states that once the shelf was removed, the glacier's ice started flowing more quickly out to sea, preventing the cliffs from becoming too tall.</other>
