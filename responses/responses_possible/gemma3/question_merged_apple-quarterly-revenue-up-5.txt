<other>The article states it could cost Apple $20 billion a year, and Apple's quarterly revenue was $85.78 billion. $20 billion / $85.78 billion * 100% = 23.3%. However, the question asks for quarterly revenue, so $20 billion / 4 = $5 billion. $5 billion / $85.78 billion * 100% = 5.8%. The question asks for the percentage of reported quarterly revenue, so $20 billion annually is $5 billion quarterly. $5 billion / $85.78 billion = 0.058 or 5.8%.
