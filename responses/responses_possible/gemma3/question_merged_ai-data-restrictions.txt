<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>75 percent</answer>
<other>The article states 5 percent of all data is restricted, and 25 percent of the highest-quality data is restricted, totaling 30 percent. It also states 45 percent of C4 is restricted. The article states that C4, RefinedWeb and Dolma are the three data sets. The article does not state the proportion of C4, RefinedWeb and Dolma in the three data sets. Therefore, it is impossible to calculate the percentage of unrestricted high-quality data remaining. However, the article states that 5 percent of all data is restricted and 25 percent of the highest-quality sources is restricted. Therefore, 95 percent of all data is unrestricted and 75 percent of the highest-quality sources is unrestricted. The question asks for the percentage of unrestricted high-quality data remaining, so the answer is 75 percent.</other>
