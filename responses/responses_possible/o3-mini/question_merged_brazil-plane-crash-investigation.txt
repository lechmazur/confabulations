<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>It introduces a historical icing incident despite current system improvements, potentially diverting attention from other causes.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The recorded speed drop at high altitude implies that only severe icing could force a stall, linking the crash conditionally to unexpected speed and altitude factors.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The use of rubber-tube anti-icing combined with a relatively warm ground temperature around 63°F challenges the idea that icing was solely responsible.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The aircraft was observed spinning slowly yet ultimately crashing almost directly on its belly, which is atypical for a stall-induced crash.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The flight data showed a speed that did not drop sufficiently low to trigger a stall under normal conditions, implying only extreme icing could have been the factor.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The pilots did not alert air traffic controllers or declare an emergency before the crash.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The crash occurred in a gated community with a moderate temperature (around 63°F), contradicting assumptions of extreme cold necessary for severe icing.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The de-icing system was upgraded after the 1994 incident, complicating the inference that icing was the cause in the current crash.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The aircraft’s designation as an ATR 72-500, known for its sensitivity to ice due to its specific de-icing system, is crucial to the icing theory.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The crash from 17,000 feet suggests a sudden loss of lift, challenging the notion of a gradual ice buildup causing the stall.</answer>
