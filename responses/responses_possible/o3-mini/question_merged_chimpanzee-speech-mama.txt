<answer>It suggests that apes’ vocal tracts are capable of producing a range of sounds, shifting the focus from anatomical limitations to brain function.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It indicates that the sounds might be mere combinations of pant-grunts, rather than deliberate, word-like utterances.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The evidence shows that primate vocal tracts are “speech ready,” implying that the limitation lies not in the anatomy but in neural coordination.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The recordings display a distinct, word-like acoustic profile, especially with the addition of vowels, which differs from typical pant-grunt sounds.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>It reflects a move from early, ambiguous recordings like Viki’s incomplete sounds to modern, systematic acoustic and listener analyses of clearer, word-like vocalizations like Johnny’s.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>It indicates that while the anatomy is capable of producing speech sounds, combining consonants and vowels actually depends on brain-driven coordinated control.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>It shows that chimpanzees can learn to produce a word-like sound, suggesting that the ability to acquire new sounds may not be exclusively human.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The word-like vocalizations imply that apes possess at least some of the necessary brain functions for speech, adding nuance to the debate about neural limitations.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The discovery shows that chimpanzees can coordinate their vocal outputs—adding vowels to consonants—in a way that parallels the human ability to send coordinated commands to the jaw and throat.</answer>
