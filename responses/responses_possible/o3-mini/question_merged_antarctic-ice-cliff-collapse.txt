<answer>Case study of a fast‐retreating, unstable glacier to infer dynamics of the broader ice sheet.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It shows that the removal of Thwaites’ ice shelf causes faster flow that limits cliff height buildup.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>It provides a model example suggesting that accelerated glacier flow after shelf loss may prevent runaway cliff collapse elsewhere.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It risks missing rapid collapse events and leads to inaccuracies in predicting the ice sheet’s breakdown.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The study indicates that runaway ice cliff collapse is less likely than previously assumed.</answer>
