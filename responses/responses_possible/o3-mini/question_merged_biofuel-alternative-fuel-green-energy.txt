<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>It enables compliance with EU mandates by turning existing refineries into plants that produce fuels meeting the sustainable aviation fuel requirements.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Despite being able to process various wastes, its operation relies on waste ingredients that may be inherently scarce.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>They are seen as practical due to the use of existing infrastructure, yet sourcing limited waste feedstocks introduces significant logistical challenges.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The steep increase—from 2 percent to 70 percent sustainable aviation fuel—forces a rapid scaling of sustainable feedstock production amid complex sourcing and regulatory issues.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It is ironic because while biofuels are claimed to offer green credentials with minimal effort, obtaining enough sustainable feedstocks like used cooking oil is notably challenging.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The contradiction is that although these fuels are touted for robust cold-weather performance, their consistent quality may be jeopardized by the unreliable supply of scarce raw materials.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Repsol is modernizing its existing refineries for greener fuel production, unlike competitors who have shut down their traditional oil facilities.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>They face challenges from low-cost international competitors and the risk of oversupply depressing prices, particularly with imports like Chinese biodiesel.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The production could be limited by an insufficient and potentially uneven supply of waste feedstocks such as used cooking oil.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Although biofuels are promoted as a simple emissions-reducing solution using existing infrastructure, the difficulty in reliably sourcing enough feedstock poses a challenge to that practicality.</answer>
