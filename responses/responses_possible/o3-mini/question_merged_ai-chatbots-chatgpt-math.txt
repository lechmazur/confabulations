<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>They are designed primarily for language-based probability rather than precise, rules-based mathematical calculations.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Although they are trained on vast amounts of math problems, their probability-driven design leads to inconsistent mathematical accuracy.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>A.I. chatbots use learned probabilities and delegate calculations to calculator programs, while traditional systems follow strict, rules-based computation.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The evolution shows a shift from precise, rules-driven numerical computing to flexible, language-based neural networks less adept at math.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It challenges the notion by demonstrating that modern A.I. systems excel in language rather than in the precise calculation central to "math on steroids."</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The errors are used as discussion points in classrooms to enhance critical thinking about problem-solving methods.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The portrayal indicates that A.I. now excels in language and pattern recognition, with mathematical precision lagging behind.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The math limitations highlight the need to integrate more structured, rules-based methods alongside neural networks.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>By excelling in language tasks yet faltering at math, A.I. blurs the traditional separation between STEM’s numerical focus and liberal arts’ language skills.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>He notes that impressive language skills cannot replace the need for the precision of rules-based systems in critical applications.</answer>
