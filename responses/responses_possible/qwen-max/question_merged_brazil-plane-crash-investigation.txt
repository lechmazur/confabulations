<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The article mentions improvements to the de-icing system since a 1994 crash, potentially misleading investigators into focusing on icing without considering other factors.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The plane's speed dropped sharply but not far enough to cause a stall unless icing was severe, creating a conditional link between speed, altitude, and icing as potential causes.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The temperature at the crash site was around 63 degrees, challenging the theory that severe icing caused the crash.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The plane spun slowly while plummeting, which is not typical of a standard stall-induced crash trajectory.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The plane's last recorded speed was roughly 325 mph, which experts said should not cause a stall unless icing was extreme, conflicting with the icing theory.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The pilots did not communicate with air traffic controllers before the crash, contradicting standard protocol for addressing emergencies like icing.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The crash occurred in a gated community in Vinhedo, Brazil, where temperatures were warm, contradicting assumptions about severe icing conditions.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The de-icing system improvements made after the 1994 crash complicate the investigation by raising questions about whether the system failed or was improperly used.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The plane's rubber tube de-icing system becomes crucial when considering whether it malfunctioned or was activated too late to prevent icing.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The plane fell from 17,000 feet, challenging assumptions that ice accumulation would occur gradually and allow time for corrective actions.</answer>
