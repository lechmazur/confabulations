<answer>Dr. Sara E. Edwards' study found that although Black newborns had lower Apgar scores and were admitted to the NICU at higher rates, they did not have more abnormal cord gas values, suggesting that their lower scores did not necessarily indicate poorer health outcomes.</answer>

<answer>Removing the skin color metric from the Apgar test could potentially reduce unnecessary NICU admissions for babies of color.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Sara E. Edwards' study revealed that Black newborns had lower Apgar scores but did not have more abnormal umbilical cord gas values compared to non-Black babies.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Low Apgar scores were far more inaccurate predictors of poor outcomes for Black babies than for Asian babies, with Asian infants with low scores being 100 times more likely to die than those with normal scores, while Black babies with low scores were only 23 times more likely to die.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Black babies with low Apgar scores were only 23 times more likely to die than those with normal scores, while white babies with low scores were 54 times more likely to die than those with normal scores.</answer>

<answer>The article suggests that the Apgar test's reliance on skin color might lead to healthy babies of color being subjected to unnecessary medical treatment, potentially sending them to intensive care unnecessarily, which separates them from their mothers, disrupts bonding and breastfeeding, exposes them to infection risks, and can be traumatizing for parents.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The study by Dr. Sara E. Edwards specifically identified the skin color component as the driver of racial discrepancies in Apgar scores.</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The article mentions that finding a substitute for the skin color component in the Apgar test is challenging because umbilical cord gas analyses take time to run through a lab and can't provide immediate results, and pulse oximetry has been found to be less accurate for Black patients.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The article states that the American Academy of Pediatrics emphasizes a quick assessment of breathing and heart rate to guide resuscitation decisions, not color, acknowledging the Apgar score's limitations.</answer>
