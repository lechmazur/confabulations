<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>They were never designed to do math; they are fine-tuned for determining probabilities, not rules-based calculations.</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Despite being trained on vast quantities of relevant data, their mathematical capabilities remain erratic.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Traditional computers follow step-by-step rules, while A.I. learns from data, predicting outcomes rather than calculating them directly.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It shows a shift from computing as purely calculation-based to incorporating learning and prediction, challenging the notion that computing is solely about math.</answer>

<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that while traditional computing excels in math, modern A.I. excels in language, marking a departure from computing being just about mathematical computation.</answer>

<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>It teaches students to critically evaluate answers, comparing AI solutions with their own to understand the correct approach.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>It indicates that AI's strengths now include language and creative tasks, traditionally seen as outside the realm of computing's math-centric capabilities.</answer>

<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>It fuels the debate by highlighting the limitations of large language models in logic and reasoning, suggesting a need for broader approaches like "world modeling."</answer>

<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>It blurs the lines by showing AI can be more akin to a liberal arts major, excelling in language over precise mathematical computation.</answer>

<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>It underscores that while AI has impressive language skills, its lack of accuracy in critical applications necessitates the use of more structured, rules-based systems.</answer>
