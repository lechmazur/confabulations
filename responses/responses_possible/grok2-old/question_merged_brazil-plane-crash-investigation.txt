<answer>It suggests improvements might have solved past issues, potentially misleading to overlook icing as a cause despite past enhancements.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It implies the plane could stall at higher speeds if icing was severe, creating a conditional scenario for the crash cause.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The system's design to inflate and deflate to break ice, with the crash occurring in Brazil where temperatures are not typically conducive to severe icing.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The plane spinning slowly as it plummeted contradicts the expectation of a more chaotic descent in a typical stall.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The recorded speed did not drop low enough to cause a stall without severe icing, challenging the icing theory.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The lack of communication with air traffic controllers before the crash.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The ground temperature was around 63 degrees, challenging the assumption of severe icing conditions at lower altitudes.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The improved de-icing system after the 1994 crash, which should theoretically prevent icing-related stalls.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The ATR 72-500's rubber tubes on the wings for ice breaking.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The plane fell from 17,000 feet, suggesting rapid ice formation or another acute issue rather than gradual accumulation.</answer>
