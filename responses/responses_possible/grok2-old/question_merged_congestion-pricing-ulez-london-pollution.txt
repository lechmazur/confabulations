<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The article uses London's ULEZ outcomes to illustrate that despite initial opposition due to financial concerns, the environmental and health benefits can be substantial, thereby questioning the validity of political arguments against congestion pricing based solely on economic hardship.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>

<question_number>8</question_number>
