<answer>Presence of multiple muscles that keep hemolymph flowing.</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Amputations work when the wound is closer to the body, which is counterintuitive as one might expect farther wounds to be less critical.</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
