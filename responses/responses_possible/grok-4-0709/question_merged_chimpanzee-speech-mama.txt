<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It suggests that the sounds could be combined pant-grunts rather than human-like speech, as apes were possibly rewarded for producing them.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>It indicates that with anatomically capable vocal tracts, chimpanzees can combine consonants and vowels, shifting focus to brain capabilities.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>It shows that chimpanzees can learn and produce new sounds like "mama" from human interaction.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
