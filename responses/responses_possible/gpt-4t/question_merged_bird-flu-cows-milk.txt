<answer>Genomic sequencing suggests that wildlife might play a role in transporting the virus between farms or introducing it to other wild animals.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It challenges the current understanding by suggesting that the infection may start in the upper respiratory tract before moving to the mammary glands, indicating a different progression than previously thought.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>It complicates the narrative by showing that the virus is also present in nasal swabs and urine, suggesting other modes of transmission beyond milk.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It challenges the assumption by showing that the virus can spread to other species, indicating that controlling cow and equipment movement alone may not be sufficient.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The study implies that wild birds might be involved in transporting the virus between farms, given the genomic similarities.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>Wild blackbirds</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk, challenging the effectiveness of current surveillance methods focused on milk samples.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses or urine than in their milk, contradicting assumptions about milk-based transmission.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The genomic analysis challenges the effectiveness of farm-focused control measures by showing that infected cows passed the virus on to other species.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Asymptomatic cows were more likely to have the virus in their noses than obviously sick ones.</answer>
