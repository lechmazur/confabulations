<answer>Repsol's strategy aligns with the European Union's regulations by investing in biofuel production to meet the requirement of supplying airports with jet fuel that includes a growing proportion of sustainable aviation fuel, starting with 2 percent in 2025 and rising to 70 percent by 2050.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The paradox lies in the claim of flexibility in using various waste materials for biofuel production at the new plant, while facing potential scarcity of these waste ingredients, such as used cooking oil.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The contradiction is that while biofuels are considered a practical solution for reducing emissions, the logistical challenges of sourcing and transporting waste ingredients from around the world could create additional emissions, undermining their environmental benefits.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The complex challenge is meeting the increasing requirement for sustainable aviation fuel, which rises to 70 percent by 2050, amidst potential scarcity of suitable waste ingredients and the complexity of the regulations protecting the food supply and tropical forests.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The irony is that despite biofuels being touted as providing green credentials with little effort, the sourcing challenges for waste ingredients like used cooking oil could make achieving these green credentials more difficult and effort-intensive than suggested.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Repsol's strategy differs by retrofitting its facilities to produce greener fuels from waste and eventually e-fuels, rather than closing them, taking advantage of reduced competition and potentially higher prices for lower carbon fuels.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The potential challenge is dealing with global competition, including the impact of cheap biodiesel imports from China and the scarcity of waste ingredients, which could affect Repsol's ability to maintain a competitive edge in the biofuel market.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Repsol's biofuel production might be affected by the limited availability of waste ingredients like cooking oil, as there is a global search for such materials, making them valuable and scarce commodities.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The potential contradiction is that despite being promoted as a practical solution for reducing emissions, the logistical challenges of sourcing and transporting waste ingredients could undermine the practicality and environmental benefits of Repsol's new biofuels.</answer>
