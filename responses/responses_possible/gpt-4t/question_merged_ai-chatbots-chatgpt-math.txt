<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>A.I. chatbots struggle with mathematical accuracy because they were never designed to do math, being fine-tuned for determining probabilities, not doing rules-based calculations.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The paradoxical relationship is that despite A.I. chatbots' proficiency in language tasks due to training on vast amounts of data, this approach does not translate well to mathematical accuracy, where they often struggle.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The article illustrates the difference by highlighting that traditional computing systems were programmed to follow step-by-step rules and retrieve information in structured databases, whereas A.I. chatbots learn by analyzing vast amounts of data and predicting language, which is less effective for math.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The shift reflects a move from A.I. being seen as primarily a tool for fast and accurate calculations (math on steroids) to a technology that learns and predicts based on data analysis, which is a break from computing's past focus on rules-based calculations.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The article challenges the traditional definition by showing that the world's smartest computer scientists have created A.I. that excels in language, a liberal arts domain, rather than in numerical calculations, thus breaking with the past where computing was synonymous with superior mathematical capability.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The occasional mathematical errors made by AI chatbots have turned into a teaching opportunity by encouraging students to compare their answers to the bot's, fostering critical thinking and discussion.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The portrayal reflects a shift towards recognizing A.I.'s strengths in language and probabilistic reasoning over traditional computational tasks like math, indicating a broader view of artificial intelligence capabilities.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The discussion contributes to the debate by highlighting A.I.'s limitations in math, suggesting that current models may not be sufficient for achieving artificial general intelligence and that a broader approach to understanding and replicating human reasoning might be necessary.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The portrayal challenges the traditional distinction by demonstrating that A.I., traditionally associated with STEM, now shows strengths in areas associated with the liberal arts, such as language, due to its design and training.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>David Ferrucci's perspective highlights that while A.I.'s language skills are impressive, they do not necessarily translate to accuracy in critical applications, emphasizing the need for a combination of large language models and more structured, rules-based software for tasks requiring precision.</answer>
