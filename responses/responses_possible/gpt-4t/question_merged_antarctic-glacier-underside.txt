<answer>The unexpected formations discovered under the Dotson Ice Shelf showed complex structures like terraces and divots, challenging the assumption that melting smooths out underwater ice topography.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The use of dead reckoning for navigation under the ice shelf made the missions tense and uncertain, resulting in only about half of Ran's missions being completely successful.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The seals observed by the researchers could have caused the robot Ran to become disoriented and potentially contributed to its loss.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The researchers' findings under the Dotson Ice Shelf challenged the assumption by revealing complex structures instead of a flat and featureless bottom.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The primary reason the scientists were unable to survey the Thwaites Glacier was due to too much sea ice blocking access.</answer>

<answer>Ran</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The newly discovered topography of the Dotson Ice Shelf's underside contradicts previous scientific assumptions by showing that melting does not necessarily smooth out underwater ice topography, but can create complex structures.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Thwaites Glacier</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The newly discovered complex topography of the ice shelf's underside suggests that these features and indentations can persist and potentially affect overall melting patterns in response to ocean warming.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>The researchers risked encountering a misconception that the bottom of the ice shelf would be flat and featureless.</answer>
