<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Because thigh injuries reduce the flow of hemolymph, making it more difficult for bacteria to move from the wound into the body, thus lowering the chance of infection if the leg is amputated quickly.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Florida carpenter ants have many muscles in their thighs that keep hemolymph flowing.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>Wounds closer to the body (thigh injuries) have a higher success rate of amputation than wounds further away (lower leg injuries).</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>It saves an enormous amount of energy on the colony level by rescuing the injured, thus reducing the need to produce more ants to compensate for losses.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The time window for a successful amputation is narrow for lower leg injuries, making them less likely to be successful compared to thigh injuries.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The presence of multiple muscles in the thighs helps maintain hemolymph flow, which is crucial for preventing infection post-amputation.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>Bacteria can penetrate the body very quickly through lower leg injuries, making amputations there less effective compared to thigh injuries where hemolymph flow is reduced.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The injured ant presents its injured leg and calmly sits there while another ant gnaws it off, followed by the other ant cleaning the newly amputated wound.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>There is a correlation between the location of hemolymph-pumping muscles in the thighs and the higher success rate of amputations in preventing infections.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Ants with amputated limbs survived 90 percent of the time, indicating that amputation significantly contributes to individual survival and thus the overall energy efficiency of the colony.</answer>
