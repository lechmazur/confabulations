<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The study's findings suggest that patients diagnosed with disorders of consciousness may have some level of awareness, and therefore, further research and efforts to communicate with them are necessary.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>Cognitive motor dissociation</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that brain implants, which have been successful in helping patients with ALS communicate, could potentially be used to help patients with cognitive motor dissociation communicate as well.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that patients who survive longer after brain injuries might be more resilient and therefore more likely to retain awareness.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The article draws a parallel between the potential use of brain implants for patients with disorders of consciousness and the recent success of a brain implant in allowing a patient with ALS to communicate.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The study suggests that up to 100,000 patients in the United States might have some level of consciousness despite their injuries.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The use of both functional MRI and electrode recordings allows for a more comprehensive and reliable assessment of brain activity, strengthening the study's findings compared to earlier research that relied solely on functional MRI.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The article suggests that the development of brain-computer interfaces could potentially allow patients with cognitive motor dissociation to communicate.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Schiff estimates that tens of thousands of people with cognitive motor dissociation could benefit from brain implants.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>Dr. Schiff believes that the study might be missing some patients with awareness due to the demanding nature of the tests and the possibility that some patients with some awareness might not have scored positive results.</answer>
