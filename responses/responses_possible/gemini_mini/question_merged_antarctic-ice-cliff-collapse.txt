<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>The Thwaites Glacier is one of the fastest receding and least stable glaciers in Antarctica, making it a crucial test case for understanding the potential for ice cliff collapse and its implications for the broader West Antarctic ice sheet.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The study's focus on the Thwaites Glacier's ice shelf highlights the importance of the shelf's role in preventing ice cliff collapse. The simulations show that the glacier's ice flows more quickly out to sea once the shelf is removed, preventing the cliffs from becoming tall enough to trigger a runaway breakdown.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The study's findings suggest that the ice cliff collapse scenario might be less likely than previously thought, potentially applying to other parts of Antarctica with similar ice shelf dynamics.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Scientists' lack of sufficient observations of ice behavior when it fractures could lead to inaccurate projections of ice sheet stability and the potential for catastrophic sea-level rise.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The study challenges the previous assumption that ice cliff collapse is a high-likelihood, high-impact scenario for the West Antarctic ice sheet, suggesting that it might be less pressing a concern.</answer>

<answer>Rob DeConto, who was among the researchers who first proposed that ice-cliff instability could spell ruin for West Antarctica.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The increased flow speed of the glacier's ice out to sea after the ice shelf's removal prevented the cliffs from becoming tall enough to trigger a runaway breakdown.</answer>

<answer>Observations of how ice behaves when it fractures.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The simulations assume that nations' emissions of heat-trapping gases will climb to extremely high levels.</answer>

<answer>The simulations show that a faster flow speed of the glacier's ice out to sea prevents the cliffs from becoming tall enough to trigger a runaway breakdown.</answer>
