<answer>The primary reason that A.I. chatbots struggle with mathematical accuracy is that they were never designed to do math.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>The paradoxical relationship is that while A.I. chatbots excel when they have consumed vast quantities of relevant training data, their mathematical capabilities remain a shortcoming.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>The article illustrates the difference by noting that Khan Academy's AI-powered tutor, Khanmigo, sends numerical problems to a calculator program instead of asking the AI to solve the math.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>The article reflects a shift by noting that traditional computing has been about "math on steroids," but modern AI is more about language and probability, not rules-based calculations.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>The description challenges the traditional definition by showing that AI chatbots, despite their language proficiency, struggle with mathematical accuracy.</answer>
<question_number>6</question_number>
<answer>The unexpected teaching opportunity is that students can compare their answers to the bot's, discuss who is right, and how each arrived at their solution, sharpening critical thinking.</answer>
<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The portrayal reflects a shift by showing that AI's strengths lie more in language and probability than in precise mathematical calculations.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>The discussion contributes to the debate by highlighting the limitations of large language models in math and the need for a broader approach to AI development.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>The portrayal challenges the traditional distinction by showing that AI, often seen as a STEM field, has strengths more aligned with liberal arts, such as language and probability.</answer>
