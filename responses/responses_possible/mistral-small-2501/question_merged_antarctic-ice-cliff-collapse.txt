<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>It provides insights into the broader stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet by simulating worst-case scenarios for the Thwaites Glacier, which is among the fastest receding and least stable in Antarctica.</answer>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>It helps understand the potential for ice cliff collapse by testing what happens if the ice shelf completely disappears, which could expose taller ice cliffs.</answer>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>It contributes to understanding the potential for ice cliff collapse in other parts of Antarctica by using the Thwaites Glacier as a case study for how ice cliffs might behave under similar conditions.</answer>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>Scientists might miss crucial data on how ice behaves when it fractures, leading to incomplete models and uncertain projections.</answer>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>It challenges previous assumptions by suggesting that ice cliff collapse might be less likely than initially thought, based on the study's simulations.</answer>

<question_number>7</question_number>
<answer>The glacier's ice started flowing more quickly out to sea, preventing the cliffs from becoming so tall as to trigger a runaway breakdown.</answer>
<question_number>8</question_number>
<answer>Observations of how ice behaves when it fractures.</answer>
<question_number>9</question_number>
<answer>Nations' emissions of heat-trapping gases climb to extremely high levels.</answer>
<question_number>10</question_number>
<answer>As ice cliffs become taller, the glacier's flow speed increases, which prevents the cliffs from becoming so tall as to trigger a runaway breakdown.</answer>
