<answer>Rebecca Hoffman's involvement in both the Aspen Art Fair and Intersect Art and Design illustrates a strategic shift in the art fair landscape in Aspen by creating a new fair in partnership with Bob Chase, an Aspen dealer, and several exhibitors followed along, including the French gallery Perrotin; Miles McEnery Gallery, whose headquarters are in Chelsea; and K Contemporary, a gallery in Denver. Newcomers signed on as well, including Galerie Gmurzynska, from Zurich, a secondary-market specialist that featured a Picasso painting in its booth priced at $3.5 million. Another, Southern Guild, a gallery in Cape Town, brought along the South African photographer Zanele Muholi, who currently has solo shows at Tate Modern in London and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and who was one of the fair's artists-in-residence.</answer>
