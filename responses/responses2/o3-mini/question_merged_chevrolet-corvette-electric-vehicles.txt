<other>The article does not provide information on the reason for discontinuing the Dodge Challenger nor does it mention any effect on Chevrolet Corvette sales specific to that discontinuation, so the answer is N/A.

The article provides no details on the model year the Chevrolet Camaro was discontinued.</other>
