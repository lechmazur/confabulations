<other>Question 1: The article states the FTC "has so far stopped short of bringing a lawsuit or other enforcement action," so no primary reason for a lawsuit is provided. Question 2: The article mentions CVS Health's Caremark became vertically integrated by the end of 2018 but does not specify the acquisition year. Question 3: The article cites $1.6 billion in revenue for PBMs from overpaying their own pharmacies for generic cancer drugs, but this is not an estimate of patient overpayments.</other>
