<other>The user wants me to answer a question based on the provided article. The question asks for the primary reason for the Venice entrance fee, as stated by Mayor Luigi Brugnaro during a specific event: a speech at the UNESCO World Heritage Sites conference last year. I will search the article for any mention of the mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, giving a speech at a UNESCO conference last year. The article mentions the reason for the fee was to "dissuade day-trippers from visiting at peak times," but attributes this to "officials" in general. It mentions UNESCO and "last year" in the context of a recommendation to put Venice on an endangered list, but it does not mention a conference or a speech by the mayor at such an event. Since the article does not state that the mayor gave a speech at a UNESCO conference last year, nor what he might have said there, I cannot answer the question as it is phrased. Therefore, the answer is N/A.</other>
