<other>I will read the article to find information about the Rodchenkov Act. The article states, "The escalation in the case represents perhaps the most significant investigation into a doping offense since the United States passed legislation known as the Rodchenkov Act in 2020...". It also says, "WADA has been a critic of the new law since it was first proposed...". The article provides the year the act was passed, but not the year it was first proposed. Therefore, the answer is not in the text.</other>
