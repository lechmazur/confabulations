<other>I will analyze the first question. The question asks for the name of a researcher who meets two criteria: 1) worked with Dr. Liu to develop the base editing system, and 2) is now leading the effort to apply this technology to human patients with progeria. The article mentions Nicole Gaudelli worked in Dr. Liu's lab and produced an enzyme for the system. The article also mentions Dr. Francis Collins is part of the team working to apply the technology and start a clinical trial. However, the article does not state that Dr. Collins worked with Dr. Liu to develop the system, nor does it state that Nicole Gaudelli is leading the effort to apply the technology to patients. No single person is identified as meeting both criteria. Therefore, the answer is not in the text.</other>

<other>I will analyze the second question. The question asks for the expected timeline for the FDA to approve the system, assuming a successful clinical trial. The article states, "We want to start this trial in two years or less." This is the timeline to *start* the trial, not for the final FDA approval after the trial's completion. The article does not provide any information about the expected timeline for the FDA's final approval of the treatment itself.</other>
