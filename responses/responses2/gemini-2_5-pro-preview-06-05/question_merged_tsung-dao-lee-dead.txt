<other>I will analyze each question based only on the provided article. For question 1, the article states Dr. Lee and Dr. Yang knew each other as graduate students at the University of Chicago, but it does not state the year they met. It also indicates their collaboration on K meson decay happened later, when Dr. Lee was at Columbia and Dr. Yang was at Princeton, not at the University of Chicago. Therefore, the premise of the question is not supported by the text, and the specific year is not mentioned. For question 2, the article says that over a three-year period (1950-1953), Dr. Lee worked at three different institutions, one of which was the Institute for Advanced Study. It does not specify the duration of his work at any single institution during that period. For question 3, the article lists awards Dr. Lee received, such as the Albert Einstein Award in Science, but it does not state in which year he received them. The year 1962 is mentioned only in the context of him becoming a U.S. citizen.</other>
