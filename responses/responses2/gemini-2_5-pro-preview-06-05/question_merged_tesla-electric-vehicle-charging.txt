<other>I will analyze each question and find the answer only within the provided article.

For question 1, the article states that Tesla's slowdown in building new stations was "a blow to the Biden administration's effort to encourage expansion of the charging network". This describes the effect on the administration's efforts, but not a response from the administration itself. Therefore, the article does not state how the administration responded.

For question 2, the article mentions that Tesla has "suffered from declining sales" and "slumping car sales", but it does not state a reason for this decline. It mentions speculation that Musk might be worried about other automakers luring customers away, but this is not presented as a factual reason for the sales decline.

For question 3, the article mentions that the Charging Interface Initiative "warns that adapters not endorsed by manufacturers may be unsafe". It then provides an anecdote of a person who bought one anyway. However, it does not provide any information on the overall impact of this warning on the sales of these non-endorsed adapters. The article does not state whether sales increased, decreased, or were unaffected by the warning.</other>
