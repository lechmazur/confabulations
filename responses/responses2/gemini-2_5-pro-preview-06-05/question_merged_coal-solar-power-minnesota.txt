<other>The user wants me to answer a question based on the provided article. The question asks for the current percentage of electricity produced by solar power, according to an Energy Department report mentioned in the text. I will look for the mention of the Energy Department report and see what it says about solar power percentages. The article states, "One Energy Department report concluded that solar energy could provide up to 40 percent of the nation's electricity by 2035." This is a future projection for 2035, not the current percentage. The article does not state the current percentage. Therefore, the answer is N/A.</other>
