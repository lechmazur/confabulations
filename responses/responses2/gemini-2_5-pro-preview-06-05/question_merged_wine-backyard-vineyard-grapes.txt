<other>I will read the article to find the answers to the three questions. For the first question, I will look for information about Erica Ritchie's vineyard, specifically the year it was planted and the production numbers for the first year. For the second question, I will find the section on Vines of the Valley and look for the number of clients they had when they started. For the third question, I will locate the part of the article about Jeremy Winkie and see what struggles, specifically with insects, are mentioned.</other>
