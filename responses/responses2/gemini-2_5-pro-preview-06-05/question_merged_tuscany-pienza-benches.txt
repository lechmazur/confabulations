<other>I will analyze each question and search for the answer within the provided article only.

For question 1, the article states it took two years to formulate the route and get permissions, but it does not specify how long the installation of the benches took for Urs Rechsteiner.

For question 2, the article names Bernardo Rossellino as the architect of the town of Pienza and its palazzi. It mentions travertine benches in the main square separately, but does not name their designer.

For question 3, the article mentions George Clooney in the context of Lake Como, not Pienza or the Val d'Orcia. No Hollywood actor is mentioned as having a villa near the path.

For question 4, the article describes Pienza's architecture but does not mention or compare it to any other nearby town known for Renaissance architecture.</other>
