<other>I will analyze the first question. The article states that Fabrice Pierret manages Le Lutetia, not that he opened it. Therefore, the reason he decided to open it is not mentioned. For the second question, the article provides tourist projections from the Paris tourism office, but not from the French commerce group. Therefore, the answer to the second question is also not available in the text.</other>
