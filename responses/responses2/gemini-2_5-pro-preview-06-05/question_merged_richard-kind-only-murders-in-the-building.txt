<other>I will analyze each question based only on the provided article.</other>
<other>For question 1, the article mentions Richard Kind moved to Los Angeles and "booked series after series, including the pilot 'Bennett Brothers,' where he met Clooney, and the Carol Burnett anthology 'Carol & Company.'" It does not specify which of these, or any other series, was the first one he appeared in after the move. Therefore, the answer is not in the text.</other>
<other>For question 2, the article states Kind moved to Los Angeles in his "early 30s" and that his teacher predicted he would "come into his own around age 32 or 33." However, it does not define what his "first major television role" was, nor does it state his specific age when he landed it. Therefore, the answer is not in the text.</other>
<other>For question 3, the article states that Frank Galati "predicted he would come into his own around age 32 or 33." It does not mention any prediction about winning a major award. Therefore, the answer is not in the text.</other>
