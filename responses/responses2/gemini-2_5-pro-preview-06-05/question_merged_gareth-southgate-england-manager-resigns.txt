<other>I will analyze the first question. The article states that "Polling found that a substantial portion of the population wanted him to be prime minister." It does not provide a specific percentage. Therefore, the answer is not available in the text.</other>

<other>I will analyze the second question. The article mentions that before Southgate, England was "losing to Iceland" in 2016. It also states that Southgate led the team to a semi-final in 2018 and finals in 2021 and 2024. However, it does not state the year of the last final or semi-final appearance before Southgate's tenure began, so it is not possible to calculate the number of years.</other>
