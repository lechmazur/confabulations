<other>I will analyze each question and find the answer solely within the provided article.

For question 1, the article mentions the UN's help during the siege (providing a generator and transporting film reels) but does not describe the relationship after the siege ended.

For question 2, the article states Jovan Marjanovic began working as a projectionist over 20 years ago, but it does not specify for how long he held that specific role before becoming director.

For question 3, the article refers to "what he called a 'punk' collective" but does not provide a specific name for the group.

For question 4, the article says Phil Alden Robinson brought a "box full of Universal films" but does not name the first film screened from that box or its director.

For question 5, the article states that Jasmila Zbanic's film "Quo Vadis, Aida?" was "Oscar-nominated," not that it won an Oscar. Therefore, the year it won cannot be determined from the text.</other>
