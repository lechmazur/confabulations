<other>I will analyze the first question by searching the article for mentions of the United States and its oil and gas production. The article states that the U.S. "produces and exports more oil and gas than ever," but it does not provide a reason for this increase. It only presents this as a contradiction to the U.S. call to fight climate change. Therefore, the reason is not mentioned.</other>

<other>For the second question, I will look for any connection between the U.S. oil and gas production and Azerbaijan's plans. The article mentions the U.S. production as an example of a contradictory policy from a Western country, which is followed by a quote from Mr. Babayev saying, "It's easy for Azerbaijan today to stay a fossil-fuel-producing country." However, the text does not explicitly state how the U.S. production has specifically impacted Azerbaijan's plans to expand its own industry. It does not draw a direct causal link. Therefore, the answer is not in the text.</other>
