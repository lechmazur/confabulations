<other>I will analyze each question and scan the article for the specific information requested. For question 1, I will look for reasons for the success of "Twisters" attributed to Lee Isaac Chung. For question 2, I will search for the worldwide opening weekend box office for "Twisters" and a comparison to the original. For question 3, I will look for a comparison of the critical reception of "Twisters" with "Inside Out 2" and "Despicable Me 4". For question 4, I will search for any mention of distribution challenges for Universal Pictures. For question 5, I will look for another franchise that released a seventh installment, besides "Mission: Impossible".</other>
