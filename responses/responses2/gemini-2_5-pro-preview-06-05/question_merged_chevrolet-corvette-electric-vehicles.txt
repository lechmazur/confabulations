<other>I will analyze each question based only on the provided article. For question 1, I will search for the reason the Dodge Challenger was discontinued and its effect on Corvette sales. The article mentions the Challenger was done away with by Stellantis but does not provide a main reason or link its discontinuation to Corvette sales. For question 2, I will look for a specific technological innovation in the E-Ray that is explicitly stated to differentiate it from other hybrid sports cars. The article describes the E-Ray's hybrid system but does not compare it to others to establish a point of differentiation. For question 3, I will search for the model year the Chevrolet Camaro was discontinued. The article states G.M. has retired the Camaro but does not specify a model year.</other>
