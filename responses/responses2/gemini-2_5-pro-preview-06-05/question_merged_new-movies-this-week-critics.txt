<other>I will analyze each question and check the article for the specific information requested.

Question 1 asks for the name of the tech billionaire in "Blink Twice". I will search the article for the movie title "Blink Twice" and the characters Frida and Jess. The article mentions Frida and Jess being invited to an island by a tech billionaire played by Channing Tatum, but it does not name the film. The question introduces a film title not present in the source text. Therefore, the answer is not available.

Question 2 asks what instrument Ben plays in "Between the Temples". The article states Ben is a cantor, which is a singer in a synagogue. It does not mention him playing any physical instrument.

Question 3 asks about an award nomination for Carla Juri in "Shortcomings". I will search the article for the film "Shortcomings" and the actress Carla Juri. The article mentions Carla Juri in a film, but does not name that film. It does not mention a film called "Shortcomings". Furthermore, the review of the film starring Carla Juri does not mention any award nominations.

Question 4 asks which of the two remakes is truer to the original. The article mentions a remake of a 1994 film and a remake of a 1989 film. The review of the latter states it "adds several new twists not found in the first movie," implying it is not a direct copy. The review of the former calls it a "hollow caricaturization" but does not compare its faithfulness to the source material. The article does not make a direct comparison of which is "truer".

Question 5 asks about the use of different languages in "The Inspection". I will search the article for the film title "The Inspection". The article does not mention a film with this title. It mentions a film called "Mountains" that uses different languages, but the question is specifically about "The Inspection".</other>
