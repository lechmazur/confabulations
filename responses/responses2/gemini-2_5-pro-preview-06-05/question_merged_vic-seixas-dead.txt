<other>I will analyze each question and find the answer solely from the provided article.

For question 1, the article states, "he teamed with Trabert to defeat Ken Rosewall and Lew Hoad to end Australia's four-year Davis Cup reign in 1954." This describes a single event of defeating them. The question asks "how many times," and the article only mentions one time.

For question 2, the article says Seixas played in 28 U.S. championship tournaments between 1940 and 1969, but "missed the event only when he was serving in the military during World War II." This means his participation was not consecutive for the entire period. The article does not provide enough information to determine the longest consecutive streak of tournaments he played.

For question 3, the article states Seixas won eight mixed doubles titles, "seven with Doris Hart and one with Shirley Fry." It does not provide the dates of these victories, so it is impossible to determine who his partner was for his last title.

For question 4, the article mentions Seixas won a men's doubles championship with Mervyn Rose and four more with Tony Trabert. It also mentions he won the Wimbledon singles title in 1953. However, it does not state who his partner was for any specific men's doubles championship, including Wimbledon in 1953.</other>
