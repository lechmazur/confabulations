merged_vienna-aspern-seestadt-gender.txt
<other>The user wants me to answer a question based on the provided article. The question has two parts: the main reason Anna Nagy-Staron moved to Aspern Seestadt, and how this decision reflects broader urban migration trends. I will search the article for this information. The article states that Anna Nagy-Staron moved to Seestadt in 2015. It then explains why she likes living there and why she stays: the convenience of having everything within walking distance allows her to balance a full-time job and family life. However, the article does not state the original reason she decided to move there. It also does not connect her move to any "broader trends in urban migration." Therefore, the information required to answer the question is not present in the text.</other>
