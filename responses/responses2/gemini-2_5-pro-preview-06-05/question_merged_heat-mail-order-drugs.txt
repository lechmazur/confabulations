<other>I will analyze the article to find the specific response of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association to the 1996 findings. The article states that representatives from the association were present at a meeting where a task force reviewed the findings, and the task force subsequently decided against acting. However, it does not detail the association's specific response, argument, or actions at that meeting. Therefore, the article does not provide a direct answer to how the association responded.</other>

<other>I will search the article for the number of states that have implemented regulations requiring temperature monitoring for mail-order drugs. The article mentions that Oklahoma passed a "vague rule" and that a more specific rule was abandoned there. It also states that some other states have contacted Oklahoma's pharmacy board director about framing their own proposals, but it does not state that any have been successfully implemented. The text does not provide a specific number of states with such regulations.</other>
