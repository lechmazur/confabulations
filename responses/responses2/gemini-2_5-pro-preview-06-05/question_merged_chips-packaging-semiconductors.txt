<other>The user wants me to answer a question based on the provided article. The question is: "How many Japanese companies are part of the new packaging research consortium in California?". I will scan the article for the keywords "consortium", "Japanese", and "California". The article says: "Resonac, a company based in Tokyo, announced on Monday a new consortium with nine other Japanese and U.S. companies to focus on packaging research and development in a new facility that will be built in Union City, Calif." This sentence identifies one Japanese company, Resonac. It then mentions "nine other Japanese and U.S. companies". The text does not specify how many of these nine are Japanese and how many are from the U.S. Therefore, the exact number of Japanese companies cannot be determined. It is at least one (Resonac), but the total number is unknown. According to the instructions, if the answer is not provided and cannot be logically inferred, I must write "N/A".</other>
