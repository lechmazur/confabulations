merged_Who Are the Korean Cheerleaders Flooding TikTok_ - The New York Times.txt
<other>I will read the article to find the names of any Kia Tigers cheerleaders. The article explicitly names Lee Ju-Eun as a cheerleader. I will search for any other names identified as cheerleaders for the Kia Tigers. The article mentions Lee Si-Young, but he is the founder and president of the agency that represents the squad, not a cheerleader. No other cheerleaders are named. Therefore, the answer is N/A.</other>
