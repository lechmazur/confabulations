merged_roadside-motels-renovation.txt
<other>I will read the article to find the answers to the questions. For question 1, I will look for the renovation cost of the Downtowner Motel. The article mentions the purchase price ($4.25 million) but not the renovation cost. It does mention the renovation cost for a different motel, the Skyview, but not for the Downtowner. Therefore, the answer is not available. For question 2, I will look for information about the beds Lisa Lennox installed in the Interstate Inn. The article states that "one room has a water bed" and that she "found a Magic Fingers bed". It does not state that she installed any specific type of unique bed in *every* room. Therefore, the answer is not available.</other>
