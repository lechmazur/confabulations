<other>I will analyze each question and find the answer only within the provided article.

For question 1, I will look for information about Germany's photovoltaic capacity goals for the year 2023, specifically as stated by the Federal Network Agency. The article mentions Germany's aim for 2030 (a third of 600 gigawatts) and the capacity added in the first six months of "the year" (9 gigawatts), which is compared to the total capacity at the end of 2023. However, it does not state what the *aim* was for additions by the end of 2023. Therefore, the information is not available.

For question 2, I will search for the number of European countries, other than Germany, that have legalized plug-in solar panels. The article states that plug-in panels are popular in the Netherlands and that interest is growing in France, Italy, and Spain. However, popularity or growing interest does not explicitly mean they have been "legalized" in the same way the article describes for Germany with its "new laws". The article does not provide this specific legal information for other countries.

For question 3, I will look for a specific price point at which the cost of individual plug-in solar panels stabilized in Germany after an initial demand surge. The article mentions a current price ("as low as 200 euros") and a "boom in use," but it does not mention an "initial surge in demand" followed by a price "stabilization" at a specific point. The text does not contain this information.</other>
