<other>For question 1, the article states that Rupert Murdoch visited the Fox studio "just minutes earlier" than Tucker Carlson's arrival. It does not state that they interacted at the studio. Therefore, the nature of their interaction at the studio cannot be described. For question 2, the article mentions that Tucker Carlson "once expressed deep ambivalence" for Donald Trump and provides a text message from 2021 where he expressed hatred. However, it does not state that 2021 was the first time he expressed this ambivalence, nor does it provide a specific reason for the ambivalence itself, only a later dismissal of the text message as "venting".</other>
