<other>I will read the article to find the answers to the questions. For each question, I will locate the relevant section of the text and determine if the specific information requested is present.

For question 1, I am looking for the name of a law signed by Governor Walz. The article mentions, "Governor Walz signed a new law that will require people selling copper scrap metal in Minnesota to obtain a license from the state and to attest that the material was obtained legally." However, it does not provide a name for this law.

For question 2, I am looking for the dollar amount of the increase in copper wire theft cases in Kevin de Leon's district. The article states there was an increase from 600 cases to 6,900 cases, but it does not provide a corresponding dollar amount for this increase.

For question 3, I am again looking for the name of the law signed by Governor Walz. As with question 1, the article describes the law's function but does not give it a specific name. Therefore, the answer is not available in the text.</other>
