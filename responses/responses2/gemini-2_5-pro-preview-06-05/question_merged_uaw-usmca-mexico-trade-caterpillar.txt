<other>I will analyze each question and find the answer only within the provided article.

For question 1, I will look for information about CNH, the number of jobs moved, the year 2022, and the source of the information being financial filings. The article mentions CNH moving "more than 200 jobs" from Racine, Wis. to Mexico. It states this was told to the U.A.W. "recently". It does not specify the year 2022, nor does it state the information came from financial filings. Therefore, the specific details of the question are not present in the text.

For question 2, I will search for an economist who has written extensively on the USMCA's impact and argued it increased outsourcing. The article mentions Joyce Sadka, an economist, but describes her as an expert on Mexico's labor institutions. The article does not state that she has written extensively on the USMCA's impact or that she has argued that the agreement led to a significant increase in outsourcing. The premises of the question are not supported by the text.

For question 3, I will look for the reason why many Mexican workers are unaware of their labor rights. The article states that "many Mexican workers don't know their labor rights," but it does not provide a reason for this lack of knowledge. It presents it as a fact that contributes to scant enforcement actions, but does not explain its cause.</other>
