<other>I will read the question and then scan the article for the answer. The question asks how many different species of jellyfish the Essexella fossils were initially classified as. The article states, "Paleontologists decided that they were odd jellyfish named Essexella asherae." This is the name of a single species. The article does not mention any other species names that the fossils were classified as. Therefore, the answer is one.</other>
