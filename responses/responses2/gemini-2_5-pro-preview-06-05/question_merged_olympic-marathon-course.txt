<other>I will analyze each question and find the answer only within the provided article.

For question 1, the article states, "Paris 2024 organizers may have saved the most sadistic test for last." This is the author's phrasing. The article then says, "Olympic organizers have been curiously understated in their own assessments, describing the course in promotional materials as one that 'will set demanding conditions for the athletes, because the Paris region is not as flat as it may seem.'" This shows the organizers did not describe the course as "sadistic." Therefore, the premise of the question is incorrect based on the text.

For question 2, the article mentions that the course approximates a route taken by women to confront King Louis XVI. It does not state that he, or any king, designed the route.

For question 3, the article says Rory Linkletter peaked at about 130 miles a week as part of "his preparation." The context of this preparation is for the Paris Olympics race, not for last year's world championships. The article mentions his result at the world championships but does not detail his training for that specific event.</other>
