<other>The user wants me to answer a question based on the provided article. The question asks for the name of the Brooklyn neighborhood where Tanya Sichynsky grills with her parents. The article states that Tanya lives in a Brooklyn neighborhood, but it does not name the neighborhood. It also states that she grilled at her parents' place, which is 800 miles away from her Brooklyn apartment. Therefore, she does not grill with her parents in a Brooklyn neighborhood, and the name of her neighborhood is not mentioned. The answer is not in the text.</other>
