<other>The article does not provide specific information to directly answer any of these questions. While it mentions various aspects of eurypterid research, it doesn't address evolutionary timeline changes, Silurian environmental conditions causing gigantism, evidence of seasonal migration, Dr. Lamsdell's publications, or when eurypterids first appeared.</other>
