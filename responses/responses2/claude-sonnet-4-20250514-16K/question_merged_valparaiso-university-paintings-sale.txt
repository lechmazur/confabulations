<other>I need to carefully read through the article to find information about Richard Brauer's position on the sale and any law firm representing Valparaiso University.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>Richard Brauer is actually opposing the sale, not supporting it. The article states he is "vigorously fighting the sale" because he feels dormitory renovations are not equivalent to exposing students to prized artwork.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions Sterling Teel Capital, but this is described as an "appraisal and art advisory firm" that made a filing alongside the university's petition, not a law firm representing the university. No specific law firm representing Valparaiso University is identified in the article.</other>
