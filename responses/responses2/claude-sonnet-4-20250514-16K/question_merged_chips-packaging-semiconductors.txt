<other>I need to find information about the packaging research consortium in California and specifically count Japanese companies.</other>

<other>The article mentions: "Resonac, a company based in Tokyo, announced on Monday a new consortium with nine other Japanese and U.S. companies to focus on packaging research and development in a new facility that will be built in Union City, Calif."</other>

<other>Resonac is clearly Japanese (based in Tokyo), but the article says "nine other Japanese and U.S. companies" without specifying the breakdown between Japanese and U.S. companies among those nine.</other>
