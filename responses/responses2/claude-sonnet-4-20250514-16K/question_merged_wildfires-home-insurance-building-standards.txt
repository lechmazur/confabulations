<other>I need to carefully examine the article for information about each question, focusing only on what is explicitly stated.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions that California and Oregon have their own requirements, but states these are "not as stringent as the I.B.H.S. standards," meaning they haven't adopted the I.B.H.S. standards. No information is provided about any states adopting I.B.H.S. standards as mandatory.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions "more than roughly 220,000 acres of land in just this year" for California, but doesn't specify that "this year" refers to 2023. The question asks specifically about 2023.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions State Farm requesting a 30 percent rate increase, not Allstate. While Allstate is mentioned as one of the insurers that pulled back, no rate increase request from Allstate is mentioned.</other>
