<other>Looking through the article, I can see Lee Ju-Eun is mentioned as a breakout star cheerleader. Let me check for any other cheerleader names.</other>

<other>I see Lee Si-Young mentioned, but he is described as "founder and president of Apex Communications, which represents the cheer squad" - so he represents them but is not a cheerleader himself. All other named individuals in the article are reporters, content creators, influencers, or other people not associated with the Kia Tigers cheerleading squad.</other>
