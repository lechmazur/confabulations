<other>I need to carefully examine the article to answer each question based only on the facts provided.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article indicates that the journalist described the course as "sadistic," but the organizers themselves described it as setting "demanding conditions for the athletes, because the Paris region is not as flat as it may seem."</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions King Louis XVI in connection with the course route, but states that the course approximates the route taken by women during the French Revolution who sought to confront him at his palace. It does not say the king designed the route.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions Linkletter peaked at about 130 miles a week, but this appears to be for his Paris Olympics preparation. The article mentions he placed 18th at last year's world championships but doesn't specify his training mileage for that event.</other>
