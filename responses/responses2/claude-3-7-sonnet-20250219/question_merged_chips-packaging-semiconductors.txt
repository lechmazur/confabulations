<other>Let me check the article for information about the consortium. The article states: "Resonac, a company based in Tokyo, announced on Monday a new consortium with nine other Japanese and U.S. companies to focus on packaging research and development in a new facility that will be built in Union City, Calif." The article mentions "nine other Japanese and U.S. companies" but doesn't specify how many of these nine are Japanese versus U.S. companies.</other>
