<other>For question 1, while the article mentions the anti-abortion group called the sculpture "satanic", it does not provide their specific justification for this claim. 

For question 2, the article states Sikander did not specifically intend to comment on Supreme Court justices, and while Ruth Bader Ginsburg is mentioned, there's no indication she inspired the lace collar. The article only says Sikander explained the lace collar was inspired by a stained-glass dome symbolizing breaking the "legal glass ceiling".</other>
