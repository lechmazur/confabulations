<other>Notes:
1. The article mentions Channing Tatum as the tech billionaire in the "Blink Twice" review
2. While the article mentions Ben is a cantor, it does not specify his instrument
3. The Carla Juri review does not mention any award nominations
4. While two films are noted as remakes (the John Woo film and "The Crow"), the review does not compare their fidelity to original source material
5. The language review is for "Mountains" about Little Haiti, not "The Inspection", and while it notes characters move between English and Haitian Creole, it does not discuss how this relates to gentrification</other>
