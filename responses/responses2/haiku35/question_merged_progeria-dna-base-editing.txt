<other>For question 1, while Nicole Gaudelli is mentioned as a researcher in Dr. Liu's lab who produced the enzyme, the article does not specify that she is leading the effort to apply the technology to human patients with progeria. Dr. Francis Collins seems to be more prominently involved in the human application, but the article does not definitively state a single lead researcher. For question 2, Dr. Collins directly quotes the timeline as "two years or less" for seeking FDA approval to start a clinical trial.</other>
