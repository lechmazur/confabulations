<other>Notes on my reasoning:
- Question 1: No direct link between Roxy Music and documentary's generative structure is mentioned
- Question 2: Article directly states Reich's work inspired Eno's generative music concept
- Question 3: Article states Eno left Roxy Music in 1972
- Question 4: Article mentions Siddhant Adlakha reviewed the Sundance premiere
- Question 5: Article suggests 1972 as the year Eno was inspired by Reich
- Question 6: No specific detail about Hustwit's background convincing Eno
- Question 7: No mention of another documentary besides "Rams" that Eno contributed to</other>
