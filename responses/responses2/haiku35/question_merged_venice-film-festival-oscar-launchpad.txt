<other>Reasoning:
1. The article does not mention Lodge claiming another festival was an Oscar launchpad before Venice
2. The article states Barbera assembled the program from "over 4,000 submissions"
3. The article does not indicate any consecutive years where the Golden Lion winner also won Best Picture
4. No specific director is mentioned as being personally convinced by Barbera to choose Venice over Toronto
5. The article does not specify what award "Birdman" won at Venice, only that it went on to win Best Picture at the Oscars</other>
