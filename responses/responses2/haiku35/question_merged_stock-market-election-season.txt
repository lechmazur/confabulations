<other>Notes:
- For question 1, while the article doesn't definitively state Nvidia had outstanding earnings, it's the only specific company mentioned in the earnings context
- For question 3, the article mentions Robert Shiller and a 10-year price-to-earnings ratio (CAPE), but not a 5-year ratio
- For question 4, Morningstar Direct's calculations showed that holding at least 10 percent of a portfolio in bonds reduced losses over 5-year periods</other>
