<answer>He did not support the sale of the paintings</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>For question 1, the article directly states that Brauer is "vigorously fighting the sale" and believes that "dormitory renovations are not equivalent to exposing students to prized artwork". He specifically said, "The masterpiece painting is a great painting, and it's a great teacher. We'd lose three great teachers." So he is against selling the paintings.

For question 2, the article does not mention a specific law firm representing Valparaiso University. While the university has filed a court petition, no law firm is named in the text.</other>
