merged_Who Are the Korean Cheerleaders Flooding TikTok_ - The New York Times.txt
<other>I need to carefully read through the article to find any mentions of Kia Tigers cheerleaders by name, excluding Lee Ju-Eun.</other>

<other>Looking through the article, I can see that Lee Ju-Eun is specifically mentioned as a cheerleader: "If there's one breakout star, it's Lee Ju-Eun, who shares the same name as a K-pop star" and later references to "Ms. Lee" referring to the same cheerleader.</other>

<other>I need to check if any other cheerleaders from the Kia Tigers are mentioned by name in the article. Reading through completely, I only see references to the cheerleaders as a group, the cheer squad, and Lee Ju-Eun specifically. No other individual cheerleader names are provided.</other>
