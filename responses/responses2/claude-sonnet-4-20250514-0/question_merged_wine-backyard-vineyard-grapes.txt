<other>I need to carefully read through the article to find information about each question.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<other>Looking for information about Erica Ritchie's wine production. The article states her vineyard was first planted in 2018, but it says "Since 2022, Haven has produced 500 bottles of red, white, and rose wines a year." There's no mention of production in the years between 2018 and 2022, so I cannot determine what was produced in the first year after planting.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<other>Looking for information about Vines of the Valley's initial client count. The article states "The company began in 2021 after they began planting vines the previous year and has 12 clients throughout Southern California." This tells me their current client count but not how many they had when they first started.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<other>Looking for information about Jeremy Winkie's insect struggles. The article mentions he battled mildew and fungus, and talks about training vines, but doesn't mention any specific insects that Jeremy Winkie struggled with. The article does mention Craig Lemoine struggling with Japanese beetles, but that's a different person.</other>
