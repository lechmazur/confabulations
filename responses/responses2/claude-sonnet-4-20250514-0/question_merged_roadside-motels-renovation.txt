<other>I need to carefully read through the article to find information about Lark Hotels' renovation spending and Lisa Lennox's bed installations.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions that Lark Hotels bought the Downtowner Motel for $4.25 million in 2018 and turned it into a boutique hotel, but it doesn't specify how much they spent on the actual renovation work.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions that one room has a water bed with a black velvet headboard, and that she found a Magic Fingers bed that vibrates when you put a quarter in. However, it doesn't state that she installed these types of beds in every room - it only mentions specific rooms having these features.</other>
