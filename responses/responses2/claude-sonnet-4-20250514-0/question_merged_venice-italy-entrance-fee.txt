<other>I need to look for information about Mayor Luigi Brugnaro's speech at a UNESCO World Heritage Sites conference last year regarding the primary reason for introducing the five euro entrance fee.</other>

<other>Looking through the article, I can see that officials said the aim was to dissuade day-trippers from visiting at peak times to ease pressure on residents. However, the question specifically asks about what the mayor said during his speech at the UNESCO World Heritage Sites conference last year. The article mentions UNESCO recommending Venice be put on the endangered list and that Venice stayed off after the access fee was approved, but it does not mention any speech by the mayor at a UNESCO conference or what he said there about the entrance fee.</other>
