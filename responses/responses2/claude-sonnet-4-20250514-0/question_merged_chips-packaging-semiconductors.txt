<other>I need to find information about the packaging research consortium in California and specifically count how many Japanese companies are part of it.</other>

<other>Looking at the article, I can see: "Resonac, a company based in Tokyo, announced on Monday a new consortium with nine other Japanese and U.S. companies to focus on packaging research and development in a new facility that will be built in Union City, Calif."</other>

<other>This tells me that Resonac (which is Japanese, based in Tokyo) announced a consortium with nine other companies that are Japanese and U.S. companies combined. But it doesn't specify how many of those nine are Japanese versus U.S. companies. I only know for certain that Resonac itself is Japanese, but I cannot determine the exact number of Japanese companies among the other nine.</other>
