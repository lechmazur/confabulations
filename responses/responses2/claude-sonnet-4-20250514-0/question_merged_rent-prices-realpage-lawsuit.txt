<other>I need to carefully read the article to find answers to the two questions about federal agencies taking legal action against RealPage and about a former RealPage executive quoted on their website.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article states "The Justice Department has not taken legal action against the company" and mentions that the Justice Department's antitrust division filed a brief in support of renters' case, but filing a brief is not the same as taking legal action against RealPage itself.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions Rick Graf, who was the former chief executive of Pinnacle (a property management company that uses RealPage's software), not a former RealPage executive. The question specifically asks for a former RealPage executive, but Rick Graf was an executive at Pinnacle, which is a customer of RealPage.</other>
