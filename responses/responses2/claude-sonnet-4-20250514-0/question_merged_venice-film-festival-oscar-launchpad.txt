<other>For question 1, Lodge discusses Venice becoming an Oscar launchpad but doesn't mention which festival was first before Venice. For question 2, the article mentions over 4,000 submissions for this year's program but doesn't specify the year "Poor Things" won. For question 3, the article mentions two films that won both Golden Lion and Best Picture but doesn't specify consecutive years. For question 4, the article mentions Barbera flew to LA to court studios but doesn't name specific directors he convinced. For question 5, the article doesn't mention "Birdman" winning any Venice award, only that it opened the festival and later won Oscar for Best Picture.</other>
