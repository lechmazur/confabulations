<other>I need to carefully read through the article to find specific information about the percentage of English public wanting Southgate as prime minister and information about England's tournament performance before Southgate.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions that "Polling found that a substantial portion of the population wanted him to be prime minister" but does not provide a specific percentage.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions that Southgate broke patterns - "England did not win semifinals; Southgate did. England did not reach finals on foreign soil; Southgate did." It also mentions that as recently as 2016 England was losing to Iceland, and that Southgate made England "a regular presence in finals and semifinals." However, it doesn't specify exactly how many years it had been since England reached finals or semi-finals before Southgate became manager.</other>
