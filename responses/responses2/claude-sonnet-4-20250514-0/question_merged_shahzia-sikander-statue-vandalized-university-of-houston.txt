<other>I need to carefully read the article to find information about the anti-abortion group's justification and about any Supreme Court justice inspiring the lace collar.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions that an anti-abortion group called the sculpture "satanic" and a memorial to abortion and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but it doesn't provide their justification or reasoning for this claim.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions that the sculpture includes a lace collar, but it doesn't state that any Supreme Court justice inspired this element. Sikander said her intention was not specifically to comment on Supreme Court justices, and the lace collar symbolism isn't attributed to any particular justice.</other>
