<other>I need to look through the article to see what awards "La Dolce Vita" won according to the text.</other>

<other>The article mentions that "La Dolce Vita" "tied for No. 35 on the British Film Institute's Sight and Sound directors' poll on the 100 greatest films of all time" and that it "brought Mr. Fellini worldwide fame." However, this is a poll ranking, not a prestigious award. The article does not mention any specific awards that the film won.</other>
