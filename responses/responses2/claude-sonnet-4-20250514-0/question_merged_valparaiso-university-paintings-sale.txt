<other>I need to carefully read through the article to find information about Richard Brauer's position on the sale and any law firm mentioned.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>Looking through the article, I can see that Richard Brauer is actually opposing the sale, not supporting it. The article states he "appears to have the best chance of preventing the paintings from being sold" and "is vigorously fighting the sale" because he believes dormitory renovations are not equivalent to exposing students to prized artwork. So the question asks for his reason for supporting the sale, but he actually opposes it.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>I searched through the article for any mention of a law firm representing Valparaiso University, but I cannot find any law firm name mentioned. The article does mention "Sterling Teel Capital" as a boutique appraisal and art advisory firm that filed alongside the university's petition, but they are described as an appraisal firm, not a law firm representing the university.</other>
