<other>I need to carefully read through the article to find information about who will exit the Crew Dragon capsule first during the spacewalk and what communication method will be used.</other>

<other>Looking at the spacewalk section: "Then two crew members -- Mr. Isaacman and Ms. Gillis, connected by umbilical cords that will provide power, air and other life support needs -- will move outside the spacecraft to conduct tests on the spacesuits." This mentions both will move outside but doesn't specify who goes first.</other>

<other>For communication methods, I see: "will also try sending communications via laser pulses, instead of radio signals, between the Crew Dragon and SpaceX's Starlink constellation of internet satellites." This mentions they will try laser communication, but it doesn't specify this as the primary method or what the primary method between Crew Dragon and ground control will be.</other>
