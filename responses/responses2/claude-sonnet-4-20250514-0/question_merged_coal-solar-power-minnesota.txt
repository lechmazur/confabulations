<other>I need to look for information about what percentage of the nation's electricity is currently produced by solar power according to the Energy Department report mentioned in the text.</other>

<other>Looking through the article, I can see there is mention of an Energy Department report, but I need to check what it says about current solar power production versus future projections.</other>

<other>The article states: "One Energy Department report concluded that solar energy could provide up to 40 percent of the nation's electricity by 2035." This is a future projection, not current production levels. The article does not mention what percentage of electricity is currently produced by solar power according to the Energy Department report.</other>
