<other>I need to carefully read through the article to find specific answers to each question, looking only for direct information provided in the text.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Rwanda deportation program for asylum seekers</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>For question 1, the article specifically mentions "a previously announced decision to end a program to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda" as one of the measures to cut spending. For question 2, while the article mentions that Reeves said there would be difficult choices on taxes and mentions various taxes like capital gains tax and inheritance tax that analysts say could bring revenue, Reeves herself did not specifically hint at raising any particular tax. For question 3, while Jeremy Hunt is quoted responding to Reeves's statement, there is no mention of Reeves directly criticizing any former Conservative minister in her speech.</other>
