<other>I need to look for information about Anna Nagy-Staron's reasons for moving to Aspern Seestadt and any mention of broader urban migration trends.</other>

<other>The article mentions Anna Nagy-Staron as a data scientist who moved to Seestadt in 2015 and lives there with her husband and two children. However, I don't see any information about why she initially decided to move there - only her comments about the benefits of living there now.</other>

<other>The question asks for the main reason she decided to move there, but the article doesn't provide this information. It only discusses her current experience living there. Additionally, the article doesn't discuss broader trends in urban migration.</other>
