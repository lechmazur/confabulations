<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions Eric Wilson as a Republican campaign technologist who led Senator Marco Rubio's digital team during his 2016 presidential run, but it does not state that he has been hosting virtual fund-raisers for the Trump campaign using Zoom. In fact, the article suggests Republicans have been resistant to using Zoom rallies.</other>
