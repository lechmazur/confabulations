<other>I need to carefully read through the article to find information about Governor Walz and any laws he signed related to scrap metal recycling.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions that Governor Walz signed a new law requiring people selling copper scrap metal to obtain a license, but it doesn't provide the specific name of the law. For question 2, I need to look at the numbers provided about copper wire theft cases in Kevin de Leon's district.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article states there were 6,900 cases in the last fiscal year, up from 600 cases five years ago, but the question asks for the dollar amount of the increase, not the numerical increase in cases. The article doesn't provide dollar amounts for this comparison.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>This question is essentially the same as question 1, asking for the name of the law. The article mentions Governor Walz signed such a law but doesn't provide its specific name.</other>
