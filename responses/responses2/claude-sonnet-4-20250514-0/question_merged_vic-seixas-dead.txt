<other>I need to carefully read through the article to find specific information about Vic Seixas's tennis career and answer each question based only on what's stated in the text.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions that Seixas "teamed with Trabert to defeat Ken Rosewall and Lew Hoad to end Australia's four-year Davis Cup reign in 1954" but this appears to be referring to one specific match/series, not multiple defeats. The question asks how many times, but the article doesn't specify a number of times.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article states that Seixas "played in 28 U.S. championship tournaments at Forest Hills between 1940 and 1969" and "missed the event only when he was serving in the military during World War II." However, the question asks about consecutive tournaments, and since he missed some during WWII, they were not all consecutive.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions that Seixas won "eight mixed doubles titles, seven with Doris Hart and one with Shirley Fry" but it doesn't specify which partner was for his last mixed doubles Grand Slam title or provide chronological order of these wins.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions that Seixas won his first men's singles title at Wimbledon in 1953, but it doesn't mention anything about him winning the men's doubles championship at Wimbledon in 1953 or who his doubles partner was for that specific tournament.</other>
