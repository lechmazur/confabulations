<other>I need to find information about Tanya Sichynsky's Brooklyn neighborhood where she grills with her parents. Let me read through the article carefully.</other>

<other>The article mentions that Tanya talks about summer evenings in her Brooklyn neighborhood where she smells charcoal grills, but then says she actually grilled "some 800 miles away at my parents' place" which is described as a house with grilling infrastructure, not her Brooklyn apartment. The article does not provide the specific name of her Brooklyn neighborhood.</other>
