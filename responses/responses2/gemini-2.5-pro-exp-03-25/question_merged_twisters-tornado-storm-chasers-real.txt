<other>Analyzing Question 1: The article states Dr. Waugh is a researcher with the National Severe Storms Laboratory and drives a government-issued truck. It does not explicitly state that this specific agency funded the research project the movie "Twisters" is based on, only that Dr. Waugh works there and consulted on the film, and that the lab is involved in current tornado research (Lift). The question requires identifying the agency that both funded the project and employs Dr. Waugh. Since the funding aspect isn't explicitly confirmed for the National Severe Storms Laboratory in relation to the movie's basis, the answer is N/A.</other>

<other>Analyzing Question 2: The article mentions scientists currently have "mobile radars and lidar". It describes the movie characters trying to drop "portable phased radar" close to the tornado. Dr. Waugh comments that deploying instruments close to a tornado's path, like in the movie, might become a reality in the future. The question asks for a type of radar, other than mobile and lidar, hoped for in the future. "Portable phased radar" fits this description as it's mentioned in the context of future possibilities moving from science fiction to reality, and it is distinct from mobile radar and lidar.</other>
