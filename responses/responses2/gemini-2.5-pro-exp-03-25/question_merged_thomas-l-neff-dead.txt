<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>1991</answer>
<other>The article states Dr. Neff approached Viktor N. Mikhailov in Washington in October 1991. It then states, "Two months later, in December 1991, he was among the last Westerners to see the Soviet hammer and sickle flying over the Kremlin..." This places his first trip to Russia (Moscow) after proposing the deal in 1991. While the specific purpose isn't explicitly stated as *only* discussing the deal, the context implies it was part of his efforts ("nudged the idea along").</other>
