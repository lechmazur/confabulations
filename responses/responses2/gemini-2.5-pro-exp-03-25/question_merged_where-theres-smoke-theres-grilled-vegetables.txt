<other>The user wants me to answer a question based only on the provided article. The question asks for the name of the Brooklyn neighborhood where Tanya Sichynsky grills with her parents. The article states Tanya lives in a Brooklyn neighborhood and smells grilling there. However, it explicitly says she grilled "some 800 miles away at my parents' place", which is described as a house, unlike her apartment. Therefore, she did not grill with her parents in her Brooklyn neighborhood. The article also does not name her specific Brooklyn neighborhood. Thus, the answer is N/A.</other>
