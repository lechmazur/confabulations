<other>The user wants me to answer the question based only on the provided article. The question asks for the specific number of Japanese companies in a new consortium mentioned in the text. The article states: "Resonac, a company based in Tokyo, announced on Monday a new consortium with nine other Japanese and U.S. companies...". Resonac is one Japanese company. The other nine companies are described as "Japanese and U.S. companies", meaning some are Japanese and some are U.S., but the exact breakdown is not given. Therefore, the total number of Japanese companies (Resonac + the Japanese companies among the other nine) cannot be determined precisely from the text.</other>
