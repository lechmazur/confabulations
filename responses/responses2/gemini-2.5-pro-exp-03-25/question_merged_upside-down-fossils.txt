<other>The user wants me to answer the question based solely on the provided article. The question asks for the number of different jellyfish species Essexella was initially classified as. The article states, "Paleontologists decided that they were odd jellyfish named Essexella asherae." It does not mention any other jellyfish species names or classifications applied to these fossils before the anemone identification. It refers to "the jellyfish model" singular. Therefore, the article only supports the initial classification as one specific jellyfish species.</other>
