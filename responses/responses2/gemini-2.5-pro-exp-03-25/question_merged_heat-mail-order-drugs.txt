<other>Analyzing Question 1: The article mentions the 1996 study and that representatives from the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA) were present at the meeting where the task force decided against acting on the findings. However, it does not explicitly state *how* the PCMA responded or what arguments they made at that specific meeting regarding the 1996 findings. It only notes their presence coincided with the decision not to act. Later, the article details arguments made by lobbyists and the trade association representing P.B.M.s (which PCMA represents) against a proposed rule in Oklahoma years later, but this is not their response to the 1996 findings specifically. Therefore, the article does not provide the specific response of the PCMA to the 1996 findings.</other>

<other>Analyzing Question 2: The article discusses the lack of federal rules covering drug transport to patients and mentions that state pharmacy boards have jurisdiction. It details Oklahoma's failed attempt to implement stricter temperature regulations due to lobbyist opposition. It also mentions that some other states have contacted Oklahoma about framing proposals, while others have "no appetite" for stronger rules. The article does not state that any state has successfully implemented regulations requiring temperature monitoring inside packages during transit, nor does it provide a count of states that might have done so. It focuses on the difficulty and lack of such regulations. Therefore, the number of states with such regulations cannot be determined from the text.</other>
