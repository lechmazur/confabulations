merged_venice-italy-entrance-fee.txt
<other>I need to find the specific reason given by Mayor Luigi Brugnaro at the UNESCO conference last year for the entrance fee. The article states the general aim according to "officials" was to dissuade day-trippers at peak times. It mentions Mayor Brugnaro's later comments about the experiment's success. It also mentions UNESCO's concerns last year and that the fee approval helped Venice stay off the endangered list. However, it does not mention Mayor Brugnaro giving a reason during a speech at a UNESCO conference last year.</other>
