<other>Analyzing Question 1: The question asks for the name of a single researcher who both worked with Dr. Liu to develop the base editing system AND is now leading the effort to apply it to human patients. The article mentions Nicole Gaudelli worked in Dr. Liu's lab on the enzyme, but doesn't state she is leading the human application effort. It mentions Dr. Collins is driving the effort towards a clinical trial ("Let's go", setting the timeline goal), but he learned about Dr. Liu's work later and didn't work with him to develop the system initially. Dr. Liu's lab developed the system, but the article describes a team effort for the human application, with Dr. Collins being a prominent figure. No single person is named as fulfilling both conditions. Therefore, the answer is N/A.</other>
