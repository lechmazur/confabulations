<other>The user wants me to find the current percentage of US electricity produced by solar power, according to a specific Energy Department report mentioned in the article. The article mentions an Energy Department report, but it states a future projection: "One Energy Department report concluded that solar energy could provide up to 40 percent of the nation's electricity by 2035." It does not state the *current* percentage according to that report or any other source. Therefore, the answer is not available in the text.</other>
