<other>Based on the article, Tubi's estimated revenue in the last year was $900 million. There is no mention of a specific Fox executive credited with making Tubi a favorite for Lachlan Murdoch. The article provides cancellation data for April to June, not January to March.  Besides horror, thriller, and true crime, no other specific genre is mentioned by Tubi executives as performing particularly well.</other>
