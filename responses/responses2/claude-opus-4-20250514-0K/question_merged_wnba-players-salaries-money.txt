<other>Looking at question 1 about the New York Liberty fine for chartering flights in 2020. The article mentions "Just two years ago, for example, the New York Liberty was fined $500,000 for chartering planes for the team." Since this article appears to be from 2024 (based on context), "two years ago" would be 2022, not 2020.</other>

<other>For question 2, I need to look for woman-centric companies at W.N.B.A. Live besides the three mentioned. The article states "Woman-centric companies like the dating app Bumble, the hair care company Mielle and Opill, an over-the-counter birth control pill, all had a presence in the 100,000-square-foot space." No other woman-centric companies are specifically mentioned.</other>
