<other>The article mentions that officials said the aim of the fee was to dissuade day-trippers from visiting at peak times to ease pressure on residents. However, the question specifically asks about what Luigi Brugnaro said during a speech at the UNESCO World Heritage Sites conference last year. The article doesn't mention any speech by Brugnaro at a UNESCO conference - it only mentions that UNESCO recommended Venice be put on the endangered list last year citing mass tourism, and that Venice stayed off the "in danger" list after the access fee was approved. Since the article doesn't provide information about what Brugnaro said at a UNESCO conference, I cannot answer this specific question.</other>
