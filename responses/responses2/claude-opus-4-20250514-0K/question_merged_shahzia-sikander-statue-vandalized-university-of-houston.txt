<other>Looking at question 1 about how the anti-abortion group justified their claim that the sculpture was a "satanic" memorial to Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The article mentions that an anti-abortion group called it a "satanic" memorial to abortion and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but it doesn't provide any information about how they justified this claim.</other>

<other>For question 2, I need to find which Supreme Court justice Sikander said inspired the lace collar. The article mentions the sculpture has a lace collar as one of its features, but it doesn't state that Sikander said any Supreme Court justice inspired this specific element. The article only mentions that her intention was not specifically to comment on Supreme Court justices.</other>
