<other>Looking at question 1 about how the Netflix algorithm specifically identified "Your Honor" as a potential hit. The article mentions the Netflix algorithm's ability to pluck shows from obscurity and turn them into hits, but doesn't explain how it specifically identified "Your Honor".</other>

<other>For question 2, I need to find which other show besides "Your Honor" was mentioned as having been revived for a new season due to Netflix success. The article mentions several shows that became hits on Netflix like "Breaking Bad," "Schitt's Creek," "You," and "Suits," but doesn't state any were revived for new seasons because of Netflix success. The article does mention executives are in discussions about reviving "Your Honor" for a third season, and the Kings hope both "Evil" and "Your Honor" could be resurrected, but neither has actually been revived yet.</other>

<other>Question 3 asks how many consecutive weeks "Your Honor" reached 2 billion minutes. The article states it reached over 1 billion minutes for three consecutive weeks, with preliminary data suggesting a fourth and possibly fifth week at that level. It never mentions reaching 2 billion minutes.</other>
