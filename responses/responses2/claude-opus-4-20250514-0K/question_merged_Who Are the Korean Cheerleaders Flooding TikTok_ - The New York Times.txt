merged_Who Are the Korean Cheerleaders Flooding TikTok_ - The New York Times.txt
<other>Looking through the article for any other Kia Tigers cheerleader mentioned by name besides Lee Ju-Eun. I see Lee Si-Young is mentioned, but he is identified as the founder and president of Apex Communications, which represents the cheer squad, not as a cheerleader. No other individual cheerleader is named in the article.</other>
