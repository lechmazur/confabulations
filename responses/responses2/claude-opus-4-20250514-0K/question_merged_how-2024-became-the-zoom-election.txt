<other>For question 1, the article mentions the "White Women: Answer the Call 2024" rally had over 100,000 and then 200,000 registrants, but doesn't state how much money was raised specifically by this rally. For question 2, the article mentions one call ran "nearly three and a half hours" but doesn't provide an average duration across all rallies. For question 3, Eric Wilson is mentioned as a Republican campaign technologist who led Rubio's digital team, but the article doesn't say he has been hosting virtual fund-raisers for the Trump campaign - it only says he hoped Republicans would learn from the Democrats' success.</other>
