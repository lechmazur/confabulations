<other>Looking at the article for information about the percentage of the nation's electricity currently produced by solar power according to the Energy Department report.</other>

<other>The article mentions that "One Energy Department report concluded that solar energy could provide up to 40 percent of the nation's electricity by 2035." This is about future potential, not current production.</other>

<other>The article also states: "By the end of last year, coal produced a little more than 16 percent of the nation's electricity, down from 52 percent in 1990, and natural gas provided about 43 percent of the country's power, according to data from the Energy Information Administration." This gives current percentages for coal and natural gas but not solar.</other>

<other>The article mentions that "Over the next several decades, solar power is expected to replace natural gas as the single largest source of electricity production" but this is about the future, not current production.</other>

<other>The Energy Department report mentioned in the text only discusses what solar could provide in the future (40% by 2035), not what percentage it currently produces.</other>
