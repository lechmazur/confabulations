<other>Looking at question 1 about how many gigawatts Germany aimed to add by the end of 2023. The article mentions that Klaus Muller said "Compared to the total capacity at the end of 2023, almost 10 percent more solar capacity was added." But this is looking back at what was added, not what Germany aimed to add. The article does mention Germany aims to reach 200 gigawatts by 2030 (a third of the EU's 600 gigawatt goal), but doesn't specify what they aimed to add by the end of 2023.</other>

<other>For question 2 about how many European countries besides Germany have legalized plug-in solar panels. The article mentions that "Elsewhere in Europe, plug-in solar panels are popular in the Netherlands, and interest is growing in France, Italy and Spain." However, it doesn't state that these countries have specifically legalized them or that they were previously illegal. The article only mentions that Germany passed new laws that relaxed rules.</other>

<other>For question 3 about the price point where individual plug-in solar panels stabilized after initial surge in demand. The article mentions current prices ("In Germany, individual plug-in panels sell for as low as 200 euros") and that there has been "a steady drop in prices," but it doesn't mention anything about prices stabilizing after an initial surge in demand.</other>
