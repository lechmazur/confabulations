<other>Looking at question 1, I need to find who worked with Dr. Liu to develop the base editing system and is now leading efforts for human patients. The article mentions Nicole Gaudelli worked with Dr. Liu to develop the enzyme for base editing, but there's no indication she's leading current efforts for human patients. The article doesn't specify who is leading the effort to apply this to human patients.</other>
