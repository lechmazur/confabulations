<other>For question 2, I need to find what the French commerce group said about expected tourists. The article mentions projections have fallen to 11 million tourists for the Olympics, from 15 million, but it doesn't specifically state that the French commerce group provided these numbers. The French commerce group is mentioned in relation to sales slumps and June sales data, but not tourist projections.</other>
