merged_vienna-aspern-seestadt-gender.txt
<other>Looking at the article for information about why Anna Nagy-Staron moved to Aspern Seestadt. The article mentions she moved there in 2015 and lives with her husband and two children. It quotes her saying that having everything within walking distance allows her to maintain a full-time job without sacrificing too much of her family life. However, the question asks about the main reason for moving there initially, not why she stays. The article doesn't explicitly state why she decided to move there in the first place. The second part asks about broader trends in urban migration, which is not discussed in the article.</other>
