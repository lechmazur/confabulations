<other>Looking at question 1 - I need to find which federal agency has already taken legal action against RealPage. Let me check the article for mentions of federal agencies taking legal action.</other>

<other>The article mentions that "The Justice Department has not taken legal action against the company." This directly states that the Justice Department, which is a federal agency, has NOT taken legal action. The article mentions that the District of Columbia Attorney General and Arizona Attorney General have taken legal action, but these are not federal agencies - they are local/state agencies. The FBI executed a search warrant at Cortland headquarters, but this was not specifically against RealPage.</other>

<other>For question 2, I need to find the name of a former RealPage executive quoted on the company's website. Looking through the article, I see a quote from someone praising the software, but I need to check if they were a RealPage executive.</other>

<other>The article mentions: "According to RealPage's website, the former chief executive of the Texas-based property management company Pinnacle said his firm's revenue rose by 4 percent at the height of a recession in 2009." This person, Rick Graf, was the former chief executive of Pinnacle, not RealPage. He is quoted on RealPage's website, but he was not a RealPage executive.</other>
