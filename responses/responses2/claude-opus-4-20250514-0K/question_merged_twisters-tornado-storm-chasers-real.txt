<other>Let me analyze the article for information about question 1. The article mentions that Dr. Waugh is "a researcher with the National Severe Storms Laboratory" and that he works with "national storm lab scientists". The article also mentions consultation with "scientists at the National Severe Storms Laboratory". However, the article does not state that this agency funded the research project that the movie is based on, nor does it explicitly state this is a government agency, though the mention of "government-issued truck" suggests it might be.</other>

<answer>National Severe Storms Laboratory</answer>

<other>For question 2, I need to look for information about types of radar scientists hope to use in the future. The article mentions "mobile radars and lidar" that they currently have, and talks about getting "radars closer to the base of a tornado to create a 3-D representation." But it doesn't specify any other type of radar beyond mobile and lidar that they hope to use.</other>
