<other>For question 2, the article mentions that Southgate took over a team that "as recently as 2016 was losing to Iceland" and turned them into "a regular presence in finals and semifinals." It also states he was the "most consistently successful England men's manager since Alf Ramsey, who delivered the country's first and only World Cup in 1966." However, it does not explicitly state the number of years it had been since England had reached a final or semi-final *before* Southgate became manager. It implies a period of underperformance but doesn't quantify the gap in years for reaching a semi-final or final specifically.</other>
