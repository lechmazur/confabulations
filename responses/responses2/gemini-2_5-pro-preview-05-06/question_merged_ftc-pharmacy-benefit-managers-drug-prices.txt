<other>I will go through each question and check the article for a direct answer or information from which the answer can be logically inferred. I will be careful to only use the provided article.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states, "The F.T.C. has so far stopped short of bringing a lawsuit or other enforcement action against a benefit manager." Since no lawsuit has been brought, the primary reason for deciding to bring one cannot be provided by the article.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions "CVS Health's Caremark" and states that by the end of 2018, each of the top three benefit managers (including Caremark) "had become part of the same company as a giant insurer." However, the specific year CVS Health acquired Caremark is not mentioned in the text.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions that for two generic cancer drugs, a practice by benefit managers "translated into nearly $1.6 billion in revenue over less than three years for the biggest three conglomerates." It also quotes Lina Khan saying the agency's inquiry showed "how dominant pharmacy benefit managers can hike the cost of drugs -- including overcharging patients for cancer drugs." However, the article does not provide a specific FTC estimate of how much patients overpaid for generic drugs. The $1.6 billion figure is revenue for the conglomerates, not explicitly stated as the amount patients overpaid.</other>
