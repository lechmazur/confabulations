<other>I will go through each question and check the article for a direct answer. If the information is not present or doesn't exactly match the question, I will answer N/A.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that "Corporate earnings -- which fuel the market -- have been outstanding," but it does not list any specific companies that had these outstanding earnings fueling the current rally. Nvidia is mentioned later in the context of potential future earnings and its importance, not as a company whose past earnings fueled the rally.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions "Acute political strife, including violence like the attack on the Capitol of Jan. 6, 2021, would create drastic problems..." This is presented as an example of strife that *would* cause problems or as a potential future issue. It is not explicitly "cited as a direct cause of the market's volatility during the political season" in the past. The article discusses potential future volatility.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions "the 10-year price-to-earnings ratio (called the CAPE) devised by the economist Robert Shiller." The question specifically asks about a "5-year price-to-earnings ratio." The article does not mention a 5-year ratio devised by Robert Shiller or any other economist.</other>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states: "The Morningstar Direct calculations also showed that over five-year periods, you would have had losses in fewer than 10 percent of those stretches if you held at least 10 percent of your portfolio in bonds." This does not state that holding 10% in bonds would "ensure no market losses"; it only states that losses would occur in "fewer than 10 percent" of such periods. The article mentions that for a *decade*, holding diversified long-term Treasury bonds in addition to stock was needed to "ensure that you had no market losses," but it doesn't specify a minimum percentage of bonds for that scenario, nor does it provide a percentage for ensuring no losses over a 5-year period.</other>
