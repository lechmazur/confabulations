<other>The article states: "Resonac, a company based in Tokyo, announced on Monday a new consortium with nine other Japanese and U.S. companies to focus on packaging research and development in a new facility that will be built in Union City, Calif."
Resonac is one Japanese company (being based in Tokyo).
The consortium includes Resonac and "nine other Japanese and U.S. companies".
The phrase "nine other Japanese and U.S. companies" means that these nine companies are a mix of Japanese and U.S. entities, or that each of the nine is either Japanese or U.S.
The article does not specify how many of these "nine other companies" are Japanese. It could be any number from zero to nine, depending on the exact composition of that group of nine.
Therefore, the total number of Japanese companies in the consortium (Resonac + any Japanese companies among the "nine other") cannot be determined as a precise figure from the text. The question asks "How many", requiring a specific number. Since this specific number is not provided and cannot be definitively calculated from the information given, the answer is N/A.</other>
