<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Expanded their known geographic range to Gondwana, revealed their ocean-crossing capabilities, and offered potential to shed light on their sudden extinction.</answer>
<other>The article states the fossils "expand the biggest sea scorpions' range to the ancient supercontinent Gondwana," that the research "reveals that the biggest sea scorpions were capable of crossing oceans," and that the specimens "could shed light on the sudden extinction." These represent changes in understanding aspects of their evolutionary history and timeline.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions that eurypterids "get very big" and that gigantism might be linked to surviving in oceans or migration, but it does not explain how specific environmental conditions of the Silurian period directly led to this gigantism.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states, "Dr. Bicknell hopes further study will reveal whether giant sea scorpions arrived in a one-time migration event or if they moved seasonally." This indicates it is a topic for future research, not that there is current evidence suggesting seasonal migration.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions Dr. Lamsdell as a paleobiologist not involved in Dr. Bicknell's study. It does not mention any specific study by Dr. Lamsdell on the extinction of giant sea scorpions, nor does it state that such a study was published in a particular journal or provided a foundation for Dr. Bicknell's research. Dr. Bicknell's research is mentioned as published in "Gondwana Research."</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that the fossil record of eurypterids "peaked in the Silurian period" and that they existed in the "Paleozoic era more than 400 million years ago." However, it does not specify the geological period in which they first appeared.</other>
