<other>For question 1, I need to identify a single researcher who meets two criteria: 1) worked with Dr. Liu to develop the base editing system, and 2) is now leading the effort to apply this technology to human patients with progeria. The article mentions Nicole Gaudelli as a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Liu's lab who "produced" the enzyme for the base editing system, so she worked with Dr. Liu to develop it. However, the article describes the current effort to apply the technology as being undertaken by "a small group of academics and government scientists, including Dr. Francis Collins" and "the researchers" or "The team". It does not state that Nicole Gaudelli is "leading" this current effort for human application. Dr. Collins is mentioned as a key figure in moving towards a clinical trial, but he did not develop the base editing system with Dr. Liu. Since the question asks for a single researcher fulfilling both conditions, and the article does not name such a person, the answer is N/A.</other>

<other>For question 2, I need to find the expected timeline for the FDA to approve the base editing system for use in human patients with progeria, assuming the clinical trial is successful. The article states that the team's goal is "to obtain permission from the Food and Drug Administration to start a clinical trial" and Dr. Collins says, "We want to start this trial in two years or less." This refers to the timeline to *start* the clinical trial, not the timeline for FDA *approval* of the treatment for use in patients *after* a successful trial. The article does not provide information on the latter.</other>
