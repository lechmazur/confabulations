<other>For question 1, I will look for information regarding the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association's reaction or actions following the 1996 findings about drug exposure to temperature and humidity. The article states that representatives from the association were present at a meeting where a task force decided against acting on the findings. However, it does not explicitly detail the association's own response or specific actions/statements regarding the findings themselves, beyond their presence at that meeting. The decision mentioned was made by the "task force".

For question 2, I need to find how many states have put in place regulations that specifically require mail-order pharmacies to monitor temperatures inside packages during transit. The article discusses a specific rule proposed in Oklahoma that was abandoned and mentions that a "relatively vague rule" passed there earlier, but the details of that vague rule regarding monitoring inside packages are not provided. It also states other states have contacted Oklahoma about framing proposals, implying they haven't yet implemented such rules. The article does not provide a specific number of states that have successfully implemented the described regulations.</other>
