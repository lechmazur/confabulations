<other>For question 1, the article describes a new law signed by Governor Walz regarding the sale of copper scrap metal in Minnesota. It states the law "will require people selling copper scrap metal in Minnesota to obtain a license from the state and to attest that the material was obtained legally." However, the article does not provide a specific name for this new law.

For question 2, the article states: "In Mr. de Leon's district alone, there were 6,900 cases of copper wire theft in the last fiscal year, up from just 600 cases five years ago." This is an increase of 6,300 cases. The question asks for the "dollar amount of the increase in copper wire theft cases". The article does not provide a dollar amount specifically for this increase in the number of cases in that district. It mentions general repair costs but not a dollar value for the increase in the number of incidents.

For question 3, similar to question 1, the article describes a new law signed by Governor Walz requiring individuals selling copper scrap metal in Minnesota to obtain a state license. It states: "Last month, Governor Walz signed a new law that will require people selling copper scrap metal in Minnesota to obtain a license from the state and to attest that the material was obtained legally." The article does not provide a specific name for this law.</other>
