<answer>1</answer>
<other>The article mentions two films that won both the Golden Lion and the Best Picture Oscar: "The Shape of Water" (2017) and "Nomadland" (2020). It states that "Nomadland" was "the second film after Guillermo del Toro's 'The Shape of Water' (2017) to claim that double distinction." This implies that the Golden Lion winners in 2018 and 2019 did not also win Best Picture. Therefore, the phenomenon occurred in 2017 (for 1 year) and then again in 2020 (for 1 year), but not in consecutive years. Thus, when it occurs, it is for 1 consecutive year at a time based on the provided information.</other>
