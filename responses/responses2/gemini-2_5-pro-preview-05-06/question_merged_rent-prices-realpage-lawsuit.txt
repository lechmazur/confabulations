<other>Okay, I will go through each question and find the answer in the article.

For question 1, I need to identify if any federal agency has taken legal action against RealPage. The article states, "The Justice Department has not taken legal action against the company." It mentions the Justice Department filed a brief in support of renters and the FBI executed a search warrant at Cortland (a RealPage customer) in connection with a Justice Department investigation, but this is not legal action *against RealPage* itself by a federal agency. State/District attorneys general have sued, but they are not federal agencies. Therefore, no federal agency is mentioned as having taken legal action against RealPage.

For question 2, I need to find the name of a former RealPage executive quoted on RealPage's website. The article mentions: "According to RealPage's website, the former chief executive of the Texas-based property management company Pinnacle said his firm's revenue rose... 'The tool, frankly, really helped us fight through that, not just as a company but as an industry,' Rick Graf, the Pinnacle executive, said in the video on the site." Rick Graf is identified as "the Pinnacle executive," not a RealPage executive. The question specifically asks for a "former RealPage executive." The article does not provide this information.
