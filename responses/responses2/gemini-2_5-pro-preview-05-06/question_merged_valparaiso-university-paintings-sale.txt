<other>For question 1, the article states that Richard Brauer is "vigorously fighting the sale" and "appears to have the best chance of preventing the paintings from being sold." It also mentions his reason for opposing the sale: "he feels strongly that dormitory renovations are not equivalent to exposing students to prized artwork." Since he opposes the sale, he would not have given a reason for supporting it. Therefore, the answer is N/A.</other>

<other>For question 2, the question asks for two pieces of information: the name of the law firm representing Valparaiso University and their argument. The article details the university's arguments for selling the paintings (e.g., the paintings are not "conservative," financial situation, improving student conditions). However, the article does not mention the name of any law firm representing Valparaiso University. It mentions "Sterling Teel Capital" as an "appraisal and art advisory firm" that filed alongside the university's petition, but not as its legal representation. Since one part of the question (the name of the law firm) cannot be answered from the text, the entire answer to the compound question is N/A according to the instructions ("If the answer is not provided and cannot be logically inferred, write 'N/A' only").</other>
