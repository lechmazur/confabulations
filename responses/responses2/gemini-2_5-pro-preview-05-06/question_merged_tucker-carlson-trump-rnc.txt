<other>The article states that Rupert Murdoch visited the Fox studio "just minutes earlier" than Tucker Carlson's arrival with Donald Trump Jr.'s entourage. It does not describe any interaction between Tucker Carlson and Rupert Murdoch at the Fox studio during the convention. It does mention Carlson bumping into Suzanne Scott, CEO of Fox News Media, and Carlson later praising Murdoch in an interview, but not an interaction with Murdoch at the studio.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions that Tucker Carlson "once expressed deep ambivalence" towards Donald Trump but does not specify the year he *first* expressed this or the reason behind that initial ambivalence. It provides an example of Carlson writing negative text messages about Trump in 2021, for which Carlson's stated reason was that he "got pissed at Trump." However, the article does not state that 2021 was the *first* instance of expressing "deep ambivalence" or that "getting pissed" was the reason for the general state of "deep ambivalence" rather than just for the 2021 comments.</other>
