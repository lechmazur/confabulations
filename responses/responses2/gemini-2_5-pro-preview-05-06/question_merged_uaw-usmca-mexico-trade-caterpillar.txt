<other>I will go through each question and check the article for a direct answer, adhering strictly to the instructions about specificity and source of information.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<other>The article states: "CNH, another equipment maker with a large U.S. presence, recently told the U.A.W. that it was moving more than 200 jobs to Mexico from Racine, Wis."
The question asks for the number of jobs moved in 2022, according to the company's financial filings.
The article says "recently," not specifically "2022."
The article says CNH "told the U.A.W.," not that the information is from "the company's financial filings."
Therefore, the specific conditions of the question are not met by the article.</other>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<other>The article mentions "Joyce Sadka, an economist who is an expert on Mexico's labor institutions."
The question asks for an economist who:
1. "has written extensively on the impact of the USMCA on labor markets in Mexico" - The article states she is an expert on Mexico's labor institutions and comments on the USMCA's enforcement mechanism, but not that she has "written extensively" on the specific impact mentioned.
2. "has argued that the agreement has led to a significant increase in outsourcing to Mexico" - The article does not attribute this specific argument to Joyce Sadka. It mentions her views on the enforcement mechanism and labor abuses, but not that she argued the USMCA itself led to a significant increase in outsourcing.
Therefore, the article does not provide the name of an economist matching both these specific descriptions.</other>
<answer>N/A</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<other>The article states: "Labor abuses like retaliatory firings of union supporters are rampant in Mexico, according to Dr. Sadka, and enforcement actions are scant by comparison, partly because many Mexican workers don't know their labor rights."
This sentence explains that workers' lack of knowledge of their rights is a reason for scant enforcement actions. It does not state the reason *why* many Mexican workers are unaware of their labor rights. The question asks for the main reason for their unawareness, which is not provided in the text.</other>
