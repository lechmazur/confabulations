<other>I will go through each question and check the article for a direct answer.

For question 1, the article states: "After a stint at Second City in Chicago, he moved to Los Angeles in his early 30s. It was as Galati predicted: He booked series after series, including the pilot 'Bennett Brothers,' where he met Clooney, and the Carol Burnett anthology 'Carol & Company.'" The use of "including" means these are examples, and it does not specify which was the *first* television series. A pilot is also not necessarily a series that aired as such. The article does not explicitly state the first television series.

For question 2, the article mentions Richard Kind is 67 and says, "I still haven't had one [a big break]." It also states he moved to Los Angeles in his early 30s and "booked series after series." Frank Galati predicted he would "come into his own around age 32 or 33." However, the article does not define what constitutes a "major television role" for Kind, nor does it specify his age when he landed such a role, especially given his own perspective on not having a "big break."

For question 3, the article says: "One of his teachers, a Chicago theater fixture named Frank Galati, told him that if he ever went into the business, he wouldn't work for 10 years because "'Hollywood doesn't want you -- you're not a pretty face.'" Galati predicted he would come into his own around age 32 or 33." This prediction is about when he would start working or "come into his own," not about winning any awards. The article does not mention Galati predicting an age for Kind winning his first major award.
