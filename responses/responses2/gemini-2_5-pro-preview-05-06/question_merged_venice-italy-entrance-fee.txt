<other>The question asks for the primary reason for introducing the five euro entrance fee in Venice, according to a specific statement by Mayor Luigi Brugnaro: "during his speech at the UNESCO World Heritage Sites conference last year".

First, I will identify what the article says about the reason for the fee. The article states: "When Venice introduced a five euro entrance fee in April, officials said the aim was to dissuade day-trippers from visiting at peak times, in a bid to ease the pressure on beleaguered residents forced to share the fragile city's limited space and public resources."

Next, I will check if Mayor Luigi Brugnaro is linked to this reason. The article quotes Brugnaro: "'We are convinced that we limited some peaks,' said Luigi Brugnaro, Venice's mayor, who called the experiment a 'great success.'" This aligns with the aim of dissuading day-trippers at peak times.

Then, I need to verify if the article states that Brugnaro gave this reason "during his speech at the UNESCO World Heritage Sites conference last year".
The article mentions UNESCO: "Last year, UNESCO, the United Nations' culture agency, recommended that the city be put on the list of its endangered World Heritage Sites, citing mass tourism as a principal concern, though Venice stayed off the 'in danger' list after the access fee was approved."
This passage indicates that the approval of the access fee influenced UNESCO's decision last year. However, it does not state that Mayor Brugnaro gave a speech at a UNESCO World Heritage Sites conference last year, nor does it specify what he said at such an event regarding the primary reason for the fee. The article attributes the statement of the aim to "officials" generally, not specifically to Brugnaro at that particular conference.

Since the article does not confirm that Luigi Brugnaro stated the primary reason for the fee during a speech at the UNESCO World Heritage Sites conference last year, the answer must be N/A based on the strict requirement to use only the provided text and answer the exact question.</other>
