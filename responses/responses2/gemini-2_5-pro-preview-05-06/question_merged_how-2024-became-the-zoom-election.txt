<other>Okay, I will go through each question and use only the provided article to find the answer. If the information is not present, I will use "N/A".</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions the "White Women: Answer the Call 2024" rally and its attendance numbers, but it does not state the total amount raised by this specific rally. It mentions amounts for "White Dudes for Harris" ($4 million) and "Win With Black Women" ($1.5 million), but not for "White Women: Answer the Call 2024".</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions the duration of one specific rally ("White Dudes for Harris" ran to nearly three and a half hours). However, it does not provide durations for other rallies, so an average duration cannot be calculated from the information given.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article identifies Eric Wilson as "a Republican campaign technologist who led Senator Marco Rubio's digital team during his 2016 presidential run." However, the article states Mr. Wilson "hoped Republicans would learn from the success of the pro-Harris Zooms and start hosting their own virtual fund-raisers." It does not state that he (or any other Republican technologist fitting the first part of the description) *has been hosting* virtual fund-raisers for the Trump campaign using Zoom. Therefore, no individual matching both parts of the question is identified in the article.</other>
