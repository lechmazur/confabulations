<other>I will go through each question and check the article for a direct answer. The instructions emphasize relying solely on the provided text and using "N/A" if the answer is not explicitly stated or cannot be logically inferred without ambiguity.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<other>The question asks how many states have adopted I.B.H.S. standards as mandatory. The article states: "States like California and Oregon have their own recently adopted requirements for how homes and developments need to be overhauled to protect against wildfire, but they are not as stringent as the I.B.H.S. standards." This indicates that California and Oregon have their own standards, which are different from (and less stringent than) I.B.H.S. standards. The article also mentions that "The I.B.H.S. is advocating new standards". It does not state that any state has made I.B.H.S. standards mandatory. Therefore, the number of states that have adopted I.B.H.S. standards as mandatory is not provided.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<other>The question asks for the total acreage of land consumed by wildfires in California in 2023. The article states: "In California, where fires have consumed more than roughly 220,000 acres of land in just this year..." The article also mentions "insurers lost $33 billion in 2023". However, the phrase "in just this year" for the acreage is not explicitly linked to the year 2023. "This year" refers to the year the article was written or the data was current, which is not specified as 2023 for the acreage figure. The Lahaina fire is mentioned as "last August," and the most recent burn demonstration was "in June." If the article was written after August 2023 (e.g., in 2024), "this year" would refer to 2024. If written in late 2023 after June, "this year" could be 2023. However, the article does not explicitly state the 220,000 acres figure is for the year 2023. Given the strict requirement to only use directly provided facts, and the ambiguity of "this year" versus the specific "2023" in the question, the answer is not directly provided.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<other>The question asks what percentage rate increase Allstate requested from California's insurance regulator this month. The article states: "This month, State Farm asked California's insurance regulator to approve a 30 percent rate increase for the owner-occupied home insurance it still provides in the state." The article mentions that "major insurers like State Farm, Allstate and Farmers have all pulled back," but the specific rate increase request mentioned is attributed to State Farm, not Allstate. There is no information in the article about a rate increase requested by Allstate.</other>
