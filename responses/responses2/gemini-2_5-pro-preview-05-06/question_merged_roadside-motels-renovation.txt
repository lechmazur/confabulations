<other>Okay, I will carefully read the article and answer each question based only on the information provided.

For question 1, I need to find information about the renovation cost of the Downtowner Motel by Lark Hotels. The article mentions Lark Hotels bought the Downtowner Motel and turned it into the Spa City Motor Lodge. It states the purchase price was $4.25 million. It describes the changes made ("turned it into a boutique hotel with a sleek, midcentury modern look") but does not specify the cost of these renovations. It does mention renovation costs for a different motel (Skyview by Nomada Group), but that's not relevant to this question.

For question 2, I need to find what type of unique bed Lisa Lennox installed in *every* room of the Interstate Inn. The article states: "At Ms. Lennox's Interstate Inn, one room has a water bed and a black velvet headboard. She also found a Magic Fingers bed, which vibrates when you put a quarter in the slot." The mention of "one room" for the water bed indicates it's not in every room. The article says she "found" a Magic Fingers bed, but it doesn't say she installed this type of bed, or any specific unique bed, in *every* room. It says "She said that she wanted people to stay in a different room each time," implying variety, not uniformity of a specific unique bed in every room.</other>
