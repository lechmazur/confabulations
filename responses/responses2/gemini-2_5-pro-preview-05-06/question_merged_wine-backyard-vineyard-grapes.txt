<other>Okay, I will go through each question and find the answer only from the provided article.

For question 1: The article states Erica Ritchie's vineyard was first planted in 2018. It also says, "Since 2022, Haven has produced 500 bottles of red, white, and rose wines a year". The question asks about the first year *after* planting in 2018, which would be 2019. The article does not provide production numbers for 2019, only from 2022 onwards. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

For question 2: The article states, "Vines of the Valley... began in 2021... and has 12 clients throughout Southern California". This indicates the number of clients they currently have (at the time of the article), not the number they had when they *first started* their business in 2021. The article does not specify the initial number of clients. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

For question 3: The question asks about insects Jeremy Winkie struggled with. The article mentions Craig Lemoine struggled with Japanese beetles. For Jeremy Winkie, it says, "he had battled mildew and fungus all year." Mildew and fungus are not insects. The article does not mention any insects that Jeremy Winkie struggled with. Therefore, the answer is N/A.</other>
