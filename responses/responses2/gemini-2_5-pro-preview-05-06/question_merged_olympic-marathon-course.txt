<other>I will go through each question and find the answer solely from the provided article.

For question 1, the article states: "But Paris 2024 organizers may have saved the most sadistic test for last." This is the author's interpretation of the organizers' actions. However, the question asks for the reason the course was described as "sadistic" *by the organizers*. The article later clarifies the organizers' own description: "Olympic organizers have been curiously understated in their own assessments, describing the course in promotional materials as one that 'will set demanding conditions for the athletes, because the Paris region is not as flat as it may seem.'" This indicates the organizers did not describe it as sadistic. Therefore, the premise of the question is not supported by the article.

For question 2, the article mentions: "The first half of the course, which heads west toward Versailles, approximates the route taken by thousands of women, early in the French Revolution, who were seeking liberal reforms and sought to confront King Louis XVI at his palace." This states the route was taken by women to confront King Louis XVI; it does not state that King Louis XVI or any king designed the route.

For question 3, the article says about Rory Linkletter: "He also ran more than he usually does, peaking at about 130 miles a week, 'because I think this race is going to favor people with more of a strength background instead of speed,' he said." This preparation and peak mileage refer to "this race," which is the Paris Olympic marathon. The question asks about his peak mileage during his training for "the world championships last year." The article mentions he "placed 18th in the men's marathon at last year's world championships" but does not specify his peak training mileage for that particular event. The 130 miles/week figure is explicitly tied to his preparation for the Paris Olympics course.
