<other>Okay, I will carefully read the article and answer each question based only on the information provided in the text.

For question 1, I need to find the reason stated in the article for the US increasing its oil and gas production.
The article states: "Similarly, the United States has called on the world to move more quickly to fight climate change, even as it produces and exports more oil and gas than ever." This sentence mentions the increased production but does not provide a reason for it. It highlights a contradiction. Therefore, the article does not state the primary reason.

For question 2, I need to find how the US's increased production of oil and gas has impacted Azerbaijan's plans to expand its fossil fuel industry.
The article mentions the US's increased production and Azerbaijan's plans for increased gas exports. However, it does not explicitly state a causal link or impact of the US's increased production on Azerbaijan's specific plans. The article discusses Europe's demand for Azerbaijani gas and Azerbaijan's general stance on fossil fuels, but not a direct impact from US production levels on Azerbaijan's expansion plans. The article presents the US actions as a contradiction in the global context but doesn't detail its specific impact on Azerbaijan's fossil fuel expansion strategy.</other>
