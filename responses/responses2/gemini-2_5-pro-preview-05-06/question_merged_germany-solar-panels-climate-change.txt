<other>I will go through each question and check the article for a direct answer or information that allows for a logical inference, keeping in mind the strict requirement to use only the provided article and to answer "N/A" if the information is not present or the question's premise is not supported.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>
<other>The question asks about the gigawatts of photovoltaic capacity Germany *aimed to add by the end of 2023* according to the Federal Network Agency. The article states, "In the first six months of the year, the country added nine gigawatts of photovoltaic capacity... according to the Federal Network Agency." It also says, "Compared to the total capacity at the end of 2023, almost 10 percent more solar capacity was added." This implies "the year" mentioned is after 2023. The article mentions Germany's aim for 2030: "Germany aims to reach a third of that amount [600 gigawatts] by the same year [2030]," which is 200 gigawatts total capacity. However, it does not specify an *aim to add* a certain capacity *by the end of 2023*.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<other>The question asks how many European countries besides Germany have *legalized* plug-in solar panels. The article mentions that in Germany, "new laws that relaxed rules around solar panel installation have contributed to a boom in use." For other countries, it states: "Elsewhere in Europe, plug-in solar panels are popular in the Netherlands, and interest is growing in France, Italy and Spain". Popularity or growing interest does not explicitly mean "legalized" in the sense of new laws being passed, as highlighted for Germany. The article does not provide information on whether these other countries have formally "legalized" them through similar legislative changes.</other>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<other>The question asks at what price point the cost of individual plug-in solar panels in Germany *stabilized after the initial surge in demand*. The article states that "individual plug-in panels sell for as low as 200 euros". It also mentions that China "deliver[s] solar panels at increasingly lower costs" and that interest in other European countries is "in part driven by a steady drop in prices." This suggests prices are falling, not stabilizing. The article does not mention a price stabilization point after an initial surge in demand; rather, it describes a "boom in use" and falling prices.</other>
