<other>The article mentions that "More than five million people tuned in" to one of Michelle Khare's videos, but it does not state the total number of subscribers to her YouTube channel.

<other>The article states that in June, YouTube's share of streaming time on TV was 9.9 percent.

<other>The article mentions "Scare PewDiePie," a YouTube Original series starring PewDiePie. However, it then states, "But only one show became a hit: 'Cobra Kai,' which was a sequel to the 'Karate Kid' films." This implies that "Scare PewDiePie" was not a major hit. Therefore, the article does not name a YouTube original series starring PewDiePie that became a major hit.</other>

The article does not provide information about any firm finding YouTube's attention rates higher than Amazon Prime Video's for the specified demographic or any other.</other>
