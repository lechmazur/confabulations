<other>I will go through each question and check the article for the answer.

For question 1, the article states Dr. Lee and Dr. Yang knew each other as graduate students at the University of Chicago. Dr. Lee started at the University of Chicago in 1946. However, the article indicates that the work on K meson decay that led to the Nobel Prize began in 1956 when Dr. Lee was at Columbia and called Dr. Yang, who was at Princeton. The article says: "At the time he challenged the theory, in 1956, it had been widely accepted for 30 years. Dr. Lee was then a young professor at Columbia... He had become intrigued by a problem involving the decay of so-called K mesons... He called on Chen Ning Yang... and together they went back through all the studies and experiments involving weak forces." This means they did not begin discussing the K meson decay problem at the University of Chicago. The question's premise that they began discussing the K meson decay problem at the University of Chicago is not supported by the article. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

For question 2, the article states: "Dr. Lee received his Ph.D. in 1950. Over the next three years, he worked at Yerkes Observatory in Williams Bay, Wis., as a guest lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, and at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He was then hired by Columbia University as an assistant professor." This indicates a three-year period during which he worked at three different institutions. The article does not specify how much of this three-year period was spent solely at the Institute for Advanced Study. Therefore, the exact number of years cannot be determined from the text.

For question 3, the article mentions: "Dr. Lee received many awards aside from the Nobel, including the Albert Einstein Award in Science..." It also states: "Dr. Lee became a United States citizen in 1962." The question asks for an award received *in 1962*. The article does not specify the year Dr. Lee received the Albert Einstein Award in Science, nor does it mention any other award received in 1962. Becoming a citizen is not an award for contributions to physics as specified. Therefore, the answer is N/A.</other>
