<answer>National Severe Storms Laboratory</answer>
<other>The article states that Dr. Waugh is "a researcher with the National Severe Storms Laboratory." It also states that "Dr. Waugh, Mr. Kelleher and scientists at the National Severe Storms Laboratory sat down and did some back-of-the-envelope calculations... And that's sort of what led to the movie's driving plot". This implies that the research (calculations) the movie's plot is based on was conducted by scientists from the National Severe Storms Laboratory. As these are scientists employed by this government agency, it is a logical inference that their work, which formed the basis of the movie's plot, was funded by the agency through their employment and resources. The question links the funding agency to the agency that employs Dr. Waugh, which is explicitly stated as the National Severe Storms Laboratory.</other>

<answer>portable phased radar</answer>
<other>The article mentions that in the movie "Twisters," the characters "are trying to drop portable phased radar close to the tornado, triangulate around it, and recover data from the three-dimensional winds occurring." Regarding real-life future possibilities, Dr. Waugh states, "We're going to see that technology kind of move away from science fiction and into more of a reality space where we might be able to pull that kind of thing off," referring to deploying instruments close to a tornado as depicted in the movie. This indicates a hope to utilize such technology, which includes "portable phased radar," in the future. This type of radar is distinct from the "mobile radars and lidar" already mentioned as being in use.</other>
