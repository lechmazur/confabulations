<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that learning about the late first reports of smallpox in California in 1806 and 1838 made the researchers wonder "how and why it took so long," which "got us to ships." It does not state that they chose to focus their study of smallpox outbreaks in California specifically on this period, but rather that this information was a catalyst for their broader research on disease transmission by ships.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that Ms. Blackmore "is continuing this thread of research for her doctoral work at Yale, looking to test her models against 'real outbreaks on real ships' described in historical archives." This implies that using historical archives to test or validate the models is ongoing or future work, not something that was done for the "new report" discussed in the article.</other>

Dido itself, nor does it provide any mortality rate for measles cases on the ship.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that Simon Levin called "a mathematical model" used by the researchers "beautiful." The question asks if he described it as "elegant." Since the word used in the article is "beautiful" and not "elegant," and strict adherence to the text is required, the answer is N/A.</other>
<question_number>5</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions that measles has an average infectious period of about nine days and that "Most often... infectious diseases burned themselves out on board before ships ever docked." However, it does not specify the average number of days it took for measles, in particular, to burn out on a typical 18th-century transatlantic voyage.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that the researchers "looked at steamships traveling to San Francisco from 1850 to 1852." This indicates a period they studied, but it does not explicitly state that 1850 was the year steamships *first* arrived in San Francisco.</other>

<other>The article mentions that Elizabeth Blackmore is a doctoral student at Yale and that she thought of the idea for the research "when she was working on her master's degree." It does not state which university she attended for her master's degree.</other>
