<other>First, I will review the article for specific details related to each question. For question 1, I will look for the amount raised by the "White Women: Answer the Call 2024" Zoom rally. For question 2, I will check if there is any mention of the average duration of pro-Harris Zoom rallies. For question 3, I will search for the name of the Republican campaign technologist who led Senator Marco Rubio's digital team in 2016 and is associated with virtual fund-raisers for the Trump campaign using Zoom.</other>
