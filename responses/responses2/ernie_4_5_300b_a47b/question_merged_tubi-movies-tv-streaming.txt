<other>First, I will review the article to find relevant information for each question. For question 1, the article mentions Tubi's revenue estimate but not for the year 2022 specifically. For question 2, the article mentions Lachlan Murdoch as Fox's CEO but does not name an executive credited with turning Tubi into a favorite. For question 3, the article provides data for April to June, not January to March. For question 4, the article lists genres that perform well on Tubi.</other>
