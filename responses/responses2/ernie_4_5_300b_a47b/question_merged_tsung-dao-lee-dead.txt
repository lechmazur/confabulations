<other>First, I will analyze the article to find relevant details for each question. For question 1, the article mentions that Dr. Lee and Dr. Yang knew each other as graduate students at the University of Chicago but does not specify the year they first met. For question 2, the article states that Dr. Lee worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton from 1950 to 1953, but it does not clarify how many of those years were spent there before being hired by Columbia. For question 3, the article lists awards Dr. Lee received, including the Nobel Prize and the Albert Einstein Award in Science, but does not mention any award received in 1962.</other>
