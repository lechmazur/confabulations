<other>The article does not mention any former RealPage executive. It quotes Rick Graf, the former chief executive of Pinnacle, but he is not a RealPage executive. The Justice Department has not taken legal action against RealPage, but filed a brief in support of the renters' case. No other federal agency is mentioned as having taken legal action.</other>
