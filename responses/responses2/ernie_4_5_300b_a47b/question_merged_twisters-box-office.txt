<other>First, I will review the article to identify relevant information for each question. For question 1, the article does not mention any comments from Lee Isaac Chung about the primary reason for the success. For question 2, the article only gives North American figures for "Twisters" and compares the original "Twister" to its opening weekend, not total worldwide collections. For question 3, the article mentions positive reviews for "Twisters" but does not directly compare critical reception to other sequels. For question 4, the article does not discuss specific distribution challenges for Universal Pictures. For question 5, the article lists several franchises with sequels, including one with a seventh installment besides "Mission: Impossible."</other>
