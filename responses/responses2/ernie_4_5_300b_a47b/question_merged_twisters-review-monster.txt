<other>First, I will review the article to find relevant information for each question. For question 1, I will look for any mention of how the film explains tornado changes. For question 2, I will search for details about stunt performers in the scene. For question 3, I will check for information about Academy Awards won by "Minari."</other>

<other>The article does not provide direct answers to these questions. It does not explain the increased frequency and intensity of tornadoes in the film, does not specify the number of stunt performers used, and does not state how many Academy Awards "Minari" won.</other>
