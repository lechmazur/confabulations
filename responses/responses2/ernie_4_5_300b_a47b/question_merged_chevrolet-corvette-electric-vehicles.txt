<other>First, I will review the article to find relevant information for each question. For question 1, the article mentions the discontinuation of the Dodge Challenger but does not provide a specific reason. It also states that the Corvette's sales have increased, but it does not link this directly to the Challenger's discontinuation. For question 2, the article describes the hybrid technology in the 2024 Corvette E-Ray, including the electric motor and its impact on performance. For question 3, the article mentions the discontinuation of the Chevrolet Camaro but does not specify the model year.</other>
