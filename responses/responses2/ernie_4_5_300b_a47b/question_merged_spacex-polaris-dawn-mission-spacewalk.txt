<other>First, I will review the article to find relevant details for each question. For question 1, I need to identify who exits the Crew Dragon capsule first during the spacewalk. The article mentions that Isaacman and Gillis will conduct the spacewalk, but it does not specify who exits first. For question 2, I need to determine the primary communication method between the Crew Dragon and ground control. The article states that SpaceX will try sending communications via laser pulses instead of radio signals.</other>
