For question 2, I will search for David Strayer's statements on cognitive advantages. For question 3, I will check for any percentage increase in traffic fatalities in 2021. For question 4, I will look for David Strayer's advice on improving human drivers' attention spans. For question 5, I will search for Matt Richtel's son's request regarding social media use in self-driving cars.</other>
