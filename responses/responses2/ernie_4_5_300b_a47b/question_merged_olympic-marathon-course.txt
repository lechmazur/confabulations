<other>First, I will review the article to find relevant details for each question. The article mentions the difficulty of the Paris marathon course and describes it as the most difficult in the history of the Games, with steep climbs and quad-crushing downhills. It does not, however, directly state that the organizers called it "sadistic," but it does mention that the course is designed to be extremely challenging. For the second question, the article mentions the route taken by women during the French Revolution to confront King Louis XVI, but it does not state that he designed the route. For the third question, the article provides information about Rory Linkletter's training for the Paris marathon, not the world championships last year.</other>
