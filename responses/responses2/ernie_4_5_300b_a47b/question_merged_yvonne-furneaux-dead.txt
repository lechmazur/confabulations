<other>First, I will look for information about "La Dolce Vita" and any awards it may have won in the article. The article mentions that "La Dolce Vita" tied for No. 35 on the British Film Institute's Sight and Sound directors' poll on the 100 greatest films of all time. However, this is not an award but a ranking. There is no mention of a prestigious award in the text.</other>
