<other>First, I will review the article to find information relevant to each question. For question 1, I will look for details about the time taken to complete the installation of the benches. For question 2, I will search for the name of the Renaissance architect associated with the benches in Pienza's main square. For question 3, I will check for mentions of any Hollywood actor with a villa near the Path of Art and Soul. For question 4, I will look for any nearby town known for Renaissance architecture and compared to Pienza.</other>
