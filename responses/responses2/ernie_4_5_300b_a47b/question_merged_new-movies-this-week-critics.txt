<other>First, I will identify the relevant sections of the article for each question. For question 1, I will look for details about the film "Blink Twice" and the tech billionaire character. For question 2, I will search for information about "Between the Temples" and Ben's role as a cantor. For question 3, I will check the review of "Shortcomings" for any mention of Carla Juri's performance and potential award nominations. For question 4, I will identify the two films noted as remakes and compare them to determine which is truer to the original. For question 5, I will examine the review of "The Inspection" for details about the use of different languages and its contribution to the film's message about gentrification.</other>
