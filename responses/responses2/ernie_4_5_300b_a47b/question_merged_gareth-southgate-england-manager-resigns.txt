<other>First, I will review the article for specific information related to each question. For question 1, the article mentions that a substantial portion of the population wanted Southgate to be prime minister, but it does not provide a specific percentage. For question 2, the article mentions that England was losing to Iceland as recently as 2016, but it does not explicitly state how many years had passed since the last finals or semi-finals appearance before Southgate became manager.</other>
