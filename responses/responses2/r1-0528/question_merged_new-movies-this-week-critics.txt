<other>First, I will analyze the article text to answer each question based solely on the facts provided.</other>
<other>For question 1, the article states: "After Frida (Naomi Ackie) and Jess (Alia Shawkat) accept an invite to the private island of a tech billionaire (Channing Tatum)". This directly names the actor playing the billionaire.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>Channing Tatum</answer>
<other>For question 2, the article describes Ben as "a cantor at a local synagogue" and mentions his musical background with a teacher, but never specifies what instrument he plays. No instrument is named.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>For question 3, the review of "Chloe" (not "Shortcomings") praises Carla Juri's performance as "subtly heartbreaking" but does not mention, suggest, or imply any award nomination. The text provides no information about awards.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>For question 4, the article identifies two remakes: "The Killer" (remake of Woo's 1989 film) and "Incoming" (indebted to older comedies). However, neither review compares which is "truer to the original source material". "The Killer" review states it "adds several new twists" and "is not a retread", while "Incoming" is called "derivative" and "old hat". Neither evaluates fidelity to source material.</other>
<question_number>4</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>For question 5, the article discusses languages in "Mountains" (not "The Inspection"), stating: "Mountains," whose characters move fluidly between English and Haitian Creole...". However, the review does not explicitly state how this use of languages contributes to the film's message about gentrification. It only notes this language use and says the film is "poignant" as a portrait of intergenerational tensions.</other>
