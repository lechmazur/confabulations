<other>I need to find when the Rodchenkov Act was first proposed. The article states: "WADA has been a critic of the new law since it was first proposed" and "since the United States passed legislation known as the Rodchenkov Act in 2020." It mentions the year it was passed (2020) but does not specify the year Congress first proposed it. Therefore, the exact proposal year is not provided in the text.</other>
