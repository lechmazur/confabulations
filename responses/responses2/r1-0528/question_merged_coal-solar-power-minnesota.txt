<other>I need to answer based solely on the article. The question asks for the current percentage of electricity produced by solar power according to the Energy Department report mentioned. The article states: "One Energy Department report concluded that solar energy could provide up to 40 percent of the nation's electricity by 2035." This is a projection for 2035, not the current percentage. The article does not provide any figure for the current percentage of electricity produced by solar power from this report. Therefore, the answer must be "N/A".</other>
