<question_number>1</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article mentions Nicole Gaudelli as working with Dr. Liu to develop the base editing system, but it does not state that she is now leading the effort to apply it to human patients with progeria. The current effort is described as involving Dr. Collins and his team, with no specific leader named for the application to patients.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that the team aims to start the clinical trial in "two years or less," but it does not provide any timeline for FDA approval of the system for use in patients after a successful trial. The question specifically asks for the expected timeline for FDA approval post-trial, which is not addressed.</other>
