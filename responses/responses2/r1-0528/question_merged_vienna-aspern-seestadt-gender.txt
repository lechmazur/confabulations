merged_vienna-aspern-seestadt-gender.txt

<other>I need to answer only based on the article text. The question asks for the main reason Anna Nagy-Staron moved to Aspern Seestadt and how it reflects broader trends. The article states Anna moved there and specifically mentions the benefit of having everything within walking distance for her job and family life. This is her stated reason. The article discusses the 'city of short distances' concept as a feminist urban planning goal promoted by Eva Kail, which Anna's experience exemplifies. However, the question asks how her decision reflects broader trends in urban migration. The article does not provide any information about broader trends in urban migration in general. It only discusses the specific planning philosophy and benefits within Aspern Seestadt. Therefore, the answer to the first part is clear from the text, but the second part about broader trends lacks information.</other>
