merged_chips-packaging-semiconductors.txt

<other>I need to answer based solely on the article. The article states: "Resonac, a company based in Tokyo, announced on Monday a new consortium with nine other Japanese and U.S. companies to focus on packaging research and development in a new facility that will be built in Union City, Calif." It specifies Resonac (1 Japanese company) plus nine *other* companies that are a mix of Japanese and U.S. It does not state how many of those nine are Japanese. Therefore, the exact number of Japanese companies in the consortium is not provided and cannot be directly inferred from the text.</other>
