<other>Looking at question 1 about the New York Liberty fine for chartering flights in 2020. The article states "Just two years ago, for example, the New York Liberty was fined $500,000 for chartering planes for the team." Since the article doesn't specify this happened in 2020, I need to check if "two years ago" refers to 2020. The article doesn't provide the current year to calculate this, so I cannot confirm if this fine was in 2020.</other>

<other>For question 2, I need to find other woman-centric companies besides Bumble, Mielle, and Opill that had a presence at W.N.B.A. Live. The article states "Woman-centric companies like the dating app Bumble, the hair care company Mielle and Opill, an over-the-counter birth control pill, all had a presence in the 100,000-square-foot space." The word "like" suggests these are examples, but no other woman-centric companies are specifically named.</other>
