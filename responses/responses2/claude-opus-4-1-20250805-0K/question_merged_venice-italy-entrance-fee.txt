<other>The question asks about what Luigi Brugnaro said during a speech at a UNESCO World Heritage Sites conference last year. The article mentions that UNESCO recommended Venice be put on the endangered list last year citing mass tourism, but it doesn't mention any speech by Brugnaro at a UNESCO conference. The article only mentions what officials said about the reason for the fee (to dissuade day-trippers from visiting at peak times), but not specifically what Brugnaro said at a UNESCO conference.</other>
