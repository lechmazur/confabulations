<other>For question 2, I need to find what the French commerce group said about expected tourists. The article mentions "Projections have fallen to 11 million tourists for the Olympics, from 15 million" but this doesn't specify that the French commerce group made this projection. The French commerce group is mentioned regarding sales data but not tourist projections.</other>
