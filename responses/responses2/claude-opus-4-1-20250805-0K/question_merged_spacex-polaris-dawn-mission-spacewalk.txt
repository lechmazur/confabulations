<other>Looking at the article for information about who exits the Crew Dragon capsule first during the spacewalk. The article states "Then two crew members -- Mr. Isaacman and Ms. Gillis, connected by umbilical cords that will provide power, air and other life support needs -- will move outside the spacecraft to conduct tests on the spacesuits." It doesn't specify which of these two will exit first.</other>

<other>Looking for information about the primary method of communication between Crew Dragon and ground control. The article mentions SpaceX will "try sending communications via laser pulses, instead of radio signals, between the Crew Dragon and SpaceX's Starlink constellation" but this appears to be a test, not the primary method. The article doesn't explicitly state what the primary communication method with ground control is.</other>
