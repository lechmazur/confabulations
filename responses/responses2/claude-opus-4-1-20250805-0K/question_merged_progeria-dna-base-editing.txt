<other>Looking at question 1, I need to find who worked with Dr. Liu to develop the base editing system and is now leading the effort for human patients. The article mentions Nicole Gaudelli as a postdoctoral researcher who worked with Dr. Liu to develop the enzyme for base editing. However, the article doesn't say she is leading the effort to apply this to human patients. The article mentions various researchers involved but doesn't specify a single person leading the human application effort.</other>
