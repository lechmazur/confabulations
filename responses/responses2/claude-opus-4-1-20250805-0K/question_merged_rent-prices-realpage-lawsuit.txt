<other>Looking at question 1 about which federal agency has already taken legal action against RealPage. The article mentions that "The Justice Department has not taken legal action against the company." It also mentions attorneys general from various states/districts taking action, but these are not federal agencies. The article does not mention any federal agency that has already taken legal action against RealPage.</other>

<other>For question 2, I need to find the name of a former RealPage executive quoted on the company's website. The article mentions "According to RealPage's website, the former chief executive of the Texas-based property management company Pinnacle said his firm's revenue rose by 4 percent at the height of a recession in 2009." The person quoted is Rick Graf, who is identified as "the Pinnacle executive" but he is described as the former chief executive of Pinnacle, not RealPage. So this person is not a former RealPage executive.</other>
