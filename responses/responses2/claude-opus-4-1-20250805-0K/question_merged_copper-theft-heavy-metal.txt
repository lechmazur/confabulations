<answer>N/A</answer>

<other>The article mentions Governor Walz signed a new law requiring people selling copper scrap metal to obtain a license, but doesn't give the law a specific name.</other>

<other>For question 2, I need to calculate the increase in cases. The article states there were 6,900 cases in the last fiscal year and 600 cases five years ago. The increase would be 6,900 - 600 = 6,300 cases. But the question asks for the dollar amount of the increase, not the number of cases.</other>
