<other>Let me analyze each question based on the article.</other>

<question_number>1</question_number>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<other>The article mentions the attack on the Capitol of Jan. 6, 2021, as something that could create drastic problems, but it's discussing potential future political strife, not citing it as a direct cause of past market volatility.</other>

<answer>N/A</answer>

<question_number>4</question_number>
<other>The article states "The Morningstar Direct calculations also showed that over five-year periods, you would have had losses in fewer than 10 percent of those stretches if you held at least 10 percent of your portfolio in bonds." This doesn't say "no market losses" - it says losses in fewer than 10% of periods. The article doesn't give a specific percentage to ensure no losses over 5-year periods.</other>
