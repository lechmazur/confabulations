<other>Let me analyze the article for the answers to these questions.</other>

<other>For question 1: The article mentions that Dr. Waugh is "a researcher with the National Severe Storms Laboratory" and that he works with "national storm lab scientists." However, the article doesn't explicitly state that this agency funded the research project that the movie is based on. The article mentions the research group called Lift but doesn't specify its funding source.</other>

<other>For question 2: The article mentions "more nimble mobile radars and lidar" but then says "The real future, they say, is getting radars closer to the base of a tornado to create a 3-D representation." It doesn't specify a type of radar other than mobile and lidar that scientists hope to use.</other>
