<other>Let me examine the article for information about question 1. The article mentions that Dr. Lee and Dr. Yang knew each other as graduate students at the University of Chicago, but it doesn't specify when they first met there or when they began discussing K meson decay. The article says Dr. Lee called Dr. Yang in 1956 to work on the K meson problem, and that they had known each other from the University of Chicago, but no specific year of their first meeting is given.</other>

<other>For question 2, the article states that Dr. Lee worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton after receiving his Ph.D. in 1950. It says "Over the next three years, he worked at Yerkes Observatory in Williams Bay, Wis., as a guest lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, and at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He was then hired by Columbia University as an assistant professor." This indicates he worked at various places including the Institute for Advanced Study during a three-year period (1950-1953), but it doesn't specify exactly how many years he spent specifically at the Institute for Advanced Study.</other>
