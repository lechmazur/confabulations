<other>Let me examine each question carefully against the article.</other>

<other>Question 1 asks about how many gigawatts Germany aimed to add by the end of 2023. The article mentions that Klaus Muller said "Compared to the total capacity at the end of 2023, almost 10 percent more solar capacity was added" but this is looking back at 2023, not stating what they aimed to add. The article does say Germany aims to reach 200 gigawatts by 2030 (a third of the EU's 600 gigawatt goal), but doesn't specify what they aimed to add by end of 2023.</other>

<other>Question 2 asks how many European countries besides Germany have legalized plug-in solar panels. The article mentions they are "popular in the Netherlands, and interest is growing in France, Italy and Spain" but doesn't state whether they are specifically legalized in these countries or how many have legalized them.</other>

<other>Question 3 asks about a price point after stabilization following an initial surge in demand. The article mentions current prices (as low as 200 euros for individual panels), but doesn't discuss any initial surge in demand or price stabilization after such a surge.</other>
