<other>Looking at the article for information about why Anna Nagy-Staron moved to Aspern Seestadt. The article mentions she moved there in 2015 and lives with her husband and two children. It discusses the conveniences of having everything within walking distance, but doesn't state this was the main reason they decided to move there initially. The question also asks about broader trends in urban migration, which the article doesn't directly address.</other>
