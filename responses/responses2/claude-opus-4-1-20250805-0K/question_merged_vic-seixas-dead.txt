<question_number>2</question_number>
<other>The article states "Seixas, who remained an amateur throughout his career, played in 28 U.S. championship tournaments at Forest Hills between 1940 and 1969.

<answer>N/A</answer>

<question_number>3</question_number>
<other>The article states "Seixas captured eight mixed doubles titles, seven with Doris Hart and one with Shirley Fry." Since he won 7 with Hart and 1 with Fry, and that adds up to 8 total, the last one must have been with either Hart or Fry. But the article doesn't specify which was chronologically last.</other>
