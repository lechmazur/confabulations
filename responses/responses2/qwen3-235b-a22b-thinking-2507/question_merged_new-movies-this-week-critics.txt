<other>Scanning the article for question 1: The review states Frida and Jess accept an invite to the private island of a tech billionaire (Channing Tatum), but the film title is not given as "Blink Twice" in the article. The article describes the plot without naming the film "Blink Twice". Since the question references a title not present in the text, the answer is N/A.</other>

<other>Scanning the article for question 2: The review of "Between the Temples" states Ben is "a cantor at a local synagogue" but does not mention any instrument he plays. Cantors typically lead singing, but no specific instrument is referenced in the text. Therefore, the answer is N/A.</other>

<other>Scanning the article for question 3: The film "Shortcomings" is not mentioned in the article. Carla Juri stars in a different film described as "When Chloe (Carla Juri), a recent widow, visits Japan...", but the review does not suggest any award nomination for her performance. The question references a non-existent film title and an unmentioned nomination, so the answer is N/A.</other>

<other>Scanning the article for question 4: Two remakes are noted: John Woo's film (remake of his 1989 movie) and the "Constantine" adaptation (referenced as trying to escape the 1994 film's shadow). The reviews state the Woo remake "is not a retread" with new twists, and the "Constantine" review calls it "hollow caricaturization". Neither review compares faithfulness to original source material or states which is "truer". The question asks for a comparison not made in the text, so the answer is N/A.</other>

<other>Scanning the article for question 5: The film "The Inspection" is not mentioned in the article. The question references this title, but the article discusses "Mountains" regarding gentrification, which uses English and Haitian Creole. Since "The Inspection" is not present, the answer is N/A regardless of the language detail in another film.</other>
