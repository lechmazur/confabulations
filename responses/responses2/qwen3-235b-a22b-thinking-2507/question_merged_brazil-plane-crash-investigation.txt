<other>For question 1, the article states: "publicly available flight data suggested that the plane was traveling roughly 325 miles per hour when its speed dropped sharply in the minutes before the crash." The question asks for the "exact speed" when it first began to lose altitude. The article uses "roughly" and does not specify the exact speed at the precise moment altitude loss began, only an approximate speed during a speed drop. Therefore, the exact speed is not provided.</other>
