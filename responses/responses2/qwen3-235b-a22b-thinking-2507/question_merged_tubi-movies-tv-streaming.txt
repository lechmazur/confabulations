<other>For question 1, the article states: "Mr. Nollen, the analyst, estimated that Tubi drew about $900 million in revenue over the last year compared to $775 million from the year before." The "year before" would be 2022 if the "last year" is 2023, but the article does not specify the years. However, since the question asks for 2022 revenue and the text provides "$775 million from the year before" relative to the time of writing, this is the figure for 2022 as per the context.</other>

<other>For question 2, the article mentions Lachlan Murdoch as Fox's CEO who "often touts its growth to investors" and that Tubi "has since become something of a favorite for Lachlan Murdoch." It credits Anjali Sud as Tubi's CEO and Nicole Parlapiano as marketing chief, but does not name any Fox executive (other than Murdoch himself) as being responsible for turning Tubi into Murdoch's favorite project. The question asks for the name of the Fox executive credited with this, but no such executive is named in the text.</other>

<other>For question 3, the article states: "Between April and June, there were roughly 45 million sign-ups in the United States for video subscription services, but also 43 million cancellations, according to Antenna." The question asks about cancellations between January and March, which is not mentioned in the text. Only April-June data is provided.</other>

<other>For question 4, the article states: "Horror, thriller and true crime programs also do particularly well, executives said." It lists specific shows like "Columbo" (a 1970s procedural) and "Everybody Hates Chris" (a sitcom), but does not state that any other specific genre besides horror, thriller, and true crime performed particularly well. The question asks for a genre besides those three, but no additional genre is specified as performing particularly well by executives.</other>
