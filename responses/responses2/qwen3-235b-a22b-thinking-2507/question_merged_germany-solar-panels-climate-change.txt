<other>For question 1, the article states Germany added nine gigawatts in the first six months of the year (2024) and that this was "almost 10 percent more solar capacity" compared to the total capacity at the end of 2023. However, it does not state what Germany aimed to add by the end of 2023; it only provides the actual addition for early 2024 and the comparison to the end of 2023 capacity. The question asks for the aimed addition target by end of 2023, which is not provided.</other>

<other>For question 2, the article mentions plug-in solar panels are "popular in the Netherlands, and interest is growing in France, Italy and Spain," but it does not state that any of these countries have "legalized" plug-in solar panels. It only discusses Germany's new laws that "effectively prevent landlords and co-op boards from blocking solar panel installations and drop some of the more cumbersome registration requirements." The question asks for the number of European countries besides Germany that have legalized them, but the article provides no information about legalization in other countries.</other>

<other>For question 3, the article states that individual plug-in panels in Germany sell for "as low as 200 euros" and complete sets are "about twice that cost," and that prices have seen a "steady drop." However, it does not mention an "initial surge in demand" after which prices stabilized, nor does it specify a price point at which prices stabilized following such a surge. The question asks for the stabilized price point after an initial surge, but the article provides no information about price stabilization after a specific surge event.</other>
