<other>For question 1, the article states that an anti-abortion group called the sculpture a "satanic" memorial to abortion and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but it does not provide any justification or reasoning from the group for this claim. The text only reports the group's statement without explaining their rationale.</other>

<other>For question 2, the article mentions that Sikander said her intention was "not specifically to comment on abortion or Supreme Court justices" and that the sculpture was meant to convey a broader message about "a woman's power in the justice system." While the lace collar is described as part of the artwork's symbolism, the text does not state that any specific Supreme Court justice inspired it. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is only referenced in the anti-abortion group's mischaracterization, not as Sikander's inspiration.</other>
