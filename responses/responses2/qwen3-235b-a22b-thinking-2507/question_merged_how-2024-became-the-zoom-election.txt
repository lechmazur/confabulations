<other>For question 1, the article mentions the "White Women: Answer the Call 2024" Zoom rally had over 100,000 attendees and broke Zoom's technical limits, but it does not state any specific amount raised by this particular rally. The fundraising totals provided in the article are for other events: "$4 million" for "White Dudes for Harris" and "$1.5 million" for the "Win With Black Women" meeting. Since the exact amount for the "White Women: Answer the Call 2024" rally is not given, the answer must be N/A.</other>

<other>For question 2, the article describes one specific rally ("White Dudes for Harris") as running "nearly three and a half hours" and mentions viewing replays of "several other Zoom rallies," but it does not provide durations for any other specific rallies nor calculate or state an average duration for all pro-Harris Zoom rallies. Without multiple duration figures to average, the average duration cannot be determined from the text.</other>

<other>For question 3, the article identifies Eric Wilson as "a Republican campaign technologist who led Senator Marco Rubio's digital team during his 2016 presidential run." However, it states he "told me that Republicans' resistance to Zoom rallies stemmed from the pandemic" and "said he hoped Republicans would learn from the success of the pro-Harris Zooms and start hosting their own." The text explicitly says he is commenting on why Republicans aren't currently using Zoom rallies and expressing a hope for future action, not that he is currently "hosting virtual fund-raisers for the Trump campaign using Zoom." The article provides no information indicating he is actively hosting such events now.</other>
