The text only notes the increase exists alongside climate calls, without explaining why the increase happened. Therefore, the answer is N/A.</other>

<other>For question 2, the text discusses Azerbaijan's fossil fuel industry expansion plans (e.g., increased gas exports, pipeline funding requests from Europe) and mentions the United States' increased oil and gas production, but it does not state or imply any impact of the US production increase on Azerbaijan's plans. The text links Azerbaijan's expansion to European demand (e.g., EU commissioner visits), not US production. Therefore, the answer is N/A.</other>
