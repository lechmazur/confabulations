<other>For question 1, the article states: "Polling found that a substantial portion of the population wanted him to be prime minister." It uses the phrase "substantial portion" but does not provide a specific percentage. Since the question asks for a percentage and none is given, the answer must be N/A.</other>

<other>For question 2, the article mentions: "Southgate had taken a country that as recently as 2016 was losing to Iceland into a regular presence in finals and semifinals." It states the low point was in 2016 (when Southgate became manager, as he had "eight years in charge" ending in 2024), but does not specify how many years had passed since England last reached a final or semifinal before 2016. The text references Alf Ramsey's 1966 World Cup win but does not state the gap between 1966 and Southgate's tenure. Since the exact number of years is not provided or logically inferable, the answer must be N/A.</other>
