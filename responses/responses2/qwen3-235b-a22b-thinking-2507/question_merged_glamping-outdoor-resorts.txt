<other>Processing question 1: The article states "vintage Airstreams that can sleep up to three people" at Ofland Escalante (formerly Yonder Escalante), but does not specify the exact number available. The text mentions "20 vintage Airstreams" are part of the 52 total rooms, but this is under the Ofland Escalante section after the name change. The question specifically asks about "Yonder Escalante" which was the former name. The article does not state how many vintage Airstreams existed under the Yonder Escalante name before the rebranding. Therefore, the exact number for Yonder Escalante specifically is not provided.</other>
