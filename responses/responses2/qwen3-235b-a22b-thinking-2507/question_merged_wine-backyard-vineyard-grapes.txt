<other>For question 1, the article states Erica Ritchie's vineyard was planted in 2018 by her father, but production details begin with "Since 2022, Haven has produced 500 bottles... a year." There is no information about wine production in the first year after planting (2019) or any year before 2022. The question specifically asks about the first year after planting in 2018, which is not covered in the text.</other>

<other>For question 3, the article describes Jeremy Winkie battling "mildew and fungus" and losing grape clusters due to rain, but explicitly names no insect pests for him. While Craig Lemoine dealt with Japanese beetles, Jeremy's struggles are only attributed to mildew and fungus, not insects. The question specifically asks for an insect type, which is not provided for Jeremy Winkie.</other>
