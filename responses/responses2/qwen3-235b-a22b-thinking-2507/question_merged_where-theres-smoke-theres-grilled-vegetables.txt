<other>The article mentions "my Brooklyn neighborhood" where Tanya Sichynsky describes being enticed by charcoal grills on the sidewalk, but it does not specify the name of the neighborhood. Additionally, she states that she grills with her parents "some 800 miles away at my parents' place," which is not in Brooklyn (as her Brooklyn apartment has "no inch of outdoor space"). Therefore, there is no named Brooklyn neighborhood where she grills with her parents, and the premise of the question is incorrect based on the text.</other>
