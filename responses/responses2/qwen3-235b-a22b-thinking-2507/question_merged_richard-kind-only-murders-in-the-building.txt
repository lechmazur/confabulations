<other>For question 1, the article states: "After a stint at Second City in Chicago, he moved to Los Angeles in his early 30s. It was as Galati predicted: He booked series after series, including the pilot 'Bennett Brothers,' where he met Clooney..." This identifies "Bennett Brothers" as the first television series mentioned after his move to Los Angeles.</other>

<answer>Bennett Brothers</answer>
<other>For question 2, the article mentions he moved to Los Angeles in his early 30s and booked "Bennett Brothers," but it does not specify that this was his "first major television role" or provide his exact age for any role described as major. The article states: "People say, 'What was your big break?' said Kind, 67. 'I still haven't had one.'" This indicates no role is identified as his first major one, and no specific age is given for such a role.</other>

<other>For question 3, the article states Frank Galati predicted Kind "would come into his own around age 32 or 33," but this prediction was specifically about working in Hollywood ("he wouldn't work for 10 years because 'Hollywood doesn't want you'"), not about winning awards. The text contains no mention of Galati predicting anything about awards.</other>
