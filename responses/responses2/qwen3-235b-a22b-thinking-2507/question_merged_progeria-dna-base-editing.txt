<other>For question 1, the article states that Dr. Francis Collins is actively leading the effort to apply base editing to human patients with progeria. It mentions he called Dr. Gordon after Dr. Liu's seminar, is quoted saying "We want to start this trial in two years or less," and describes the team meeting on Zoom with the goal of obtaining FDA permission for a clinical trial. While Nicole Gaudelli and Luke Koblan worked with Dr. Liu on developing aspects of the base editing system, the article specifically attributes the current leadership for applying it to human patients to Dr. Collins. No other individual is described as leading this specific effort for human application.</other>
<other>For question 2, the article discusses planning to seek FDA permission to start a clinical trial ("obtain permission from the Food and Drug Administration to start a clinical trial") and states "We want to start this trial in two years or less." However, it contains no information about the expected timeline for FDA approval *after* a clinical trial is successful. The text only covers the steps leading up to starting a trial, not any post-trial approval process or timeline.</other>
