<other>For question 1, the article states CNH told the U.A.W. it was moving "more than 200 jobs to Mexico from Racine, Wis." However, it does not specify the year 2022 for this move, nor does it attribute this job number to CNH's financial filings. The financial filings mentioned in the article relate only to Caterpillar's workforce numbers (Latin America jobs increasing from 11,000 in 2016 to 20,000 last year). Since the question asks specifically about CNH's move in 2022 according to financial filings, and the article provides neither the year nor financial filing source for CNH's job relocation, the answer must be N/A.</other>

<other>For question 2, the article mentions two economists/experts: Joyce Sadka (described as "an economist who is an expert on Mexico's labor institutions") and Daniel Rangel Jurado (described as "the research director at Rethink Trade"). Joyce Sadka provides "positive feedback" on the USMCA enforcement mechanism and states employers have become "more careful about following labor law," contradicting the premise that she argued USMCA led to increased outsourcing. Daniel Rangel Jurado is not identified as an economist and discusses petition strategies under the trade law, not outsourcing impacts. The article does not name any economist who has "written extensively on the impact of the USMCA on labor markets in Mexico and has argued that the agreement has led to a significant increase in outsourcing." Therefore, the answer is N/A.</other>

<other>For question 3, the article states: "enforcement actions are scant by comparison, partly because many Mexican workers don't know their labor rights." However, it does not specify or explain the main reason *why* workers are unaware of their rights. The text mentions established unions collaborating with management to suppress wages as a separate cause of low wages, but this is not presented as the reason for workers' lack of awareness about their rights. Since the article provides no cause for the unawareness (only noting it as a contributing factor to scant enforcement), the answer must be N/A.</other>
