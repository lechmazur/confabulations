<other>For question 2, the article states: "The inaugural season, which began on Jan. 1, had three teams from Canada (Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa) and three from the United States (Minnesota, Boston and New York.)" It also states: "Player salaries for the 24-game season, which will increase to 30 games in 2025..." However, it does not mention any expansion of the number of teams or new cities for the 2025 season. The question asks for the number of teams the league will expand to and the cities of new teams, but the text only discusses an increase in games, not teams. Therefore, the answer is N/A.</other>

<other>For question 3, the article provides details about player salaries, stipends, and the number of teams (six total), but it never states the total number of players in the PWHL. It mentions "each PWHL player" receives benefits and refers to "player salaries for the 24-game season," but does not specify roster sizes per team or the league-wide total. Since the exact number of players is not provided and cannot be logically inferred from the text, the answer is N/A.</other>
