<other>The question asks for the current percentage of electricity produced by solar power according to the Energy Department report. The article states: "One Energy Department report concluded that solar energy could provide up to 40 percent of the nation's electricity by 2035." This refers to a future projection (by 2035), not the current percentage. The article provides current percentages for coal (16%) and natural gas (43%), but does not state the current percentage for solar power from the Energy Department report or elsewhere. Since the report only discusses future potential and no current solar percentage is given, the answer is N/A.</other>
