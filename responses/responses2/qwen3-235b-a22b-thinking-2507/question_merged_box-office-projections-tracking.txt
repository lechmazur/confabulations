<other>For question 1, the article states Coca-Cola bought Columbia Pictures in 1982 and pushed for box office estimates, leading to tracking. It mentions Kevin Goetz founded Screen Engine/ASI and authored "Audience-ology", but does not state or imply that Coca-Cola's acquisition directly led to the book's development. The book is presented as his work, with no causal link to Coca-Cola.</other>

<other>For question 2, the article states "Projected by some to bring in $40 million over Memorial Day weekend" for "Furiosa", but specifies this was "by some" forecasts, not specifically the National Research Group. The National Research Group is mentioned earlier as being pushed by Coca-Cola to come up with estimates, but no attribution of the $40 million figure to them is made.</other>

<other>For question 3, the article states opening-weekend estimates "have been a Hollywood fixture since the 1980s" and that Coca-Cola bought Columbia Pictures in 1982 and "pushed the National Research Group to come up with an estimate figure". It does not state that Columbia Pictures introduced the concept; it attributes the push to Coca-Cola after acquisition. The question incorrectly attributes the introduction to Columbia Pictures.</other>

<other>For question 4, the article states Kevin Goetz is "the founder and chief executive of the analytics firm Screen Engine/ASI" and that he authored "Audience-ology". It mentions the firm in the present tense but gives no founding date. The article states box office projections became a fixture "since the 1980s" due to Coca-Cola's 1982 actions, but does not state Goetz founded his firm in the 1980s or that Coca-Cola acquired it. No acquisition by Coca-Cola is mentioned.</other>

<other>For question 5, the article uses "Barbie" as a hypothetical example: "if you're an exhibitor and you know you've got a 'Barbie' coming, you might bump it up from playing on two screens to six." This is presented as a general scenario illustrating how tracking affects decisions, not as actual historical data about the "Barbie" film's screen count. The article does not state what theater owners initially planned for "Barbie".</other>
