<other>For question 1, the article states: "Last month, Governor Walz signed a new law that will require people selling copper scrap metal in Minnesota to obtain a license from the state and to attest that the material was obtained legally." However, the article does not provide a specific name for this law, only describing its provisions. Since the question asks for the name and none is given, the answer must be N/A.</other>

<other>For question 2, the article states: "In Mr. de Leon's district alone, there were 6,900 cases of copper wire theft in the last fiscal year, up from just 600 cases five years ago." The question asks for the dollar amount of the increase, but the text only provides case counts (6,900 vs. 600), not dollar values. No dollar amount for the increase is mentioned, so the answer must be N/A.</other>
