merged_Who Are the Korean Cheerleaders Flooding TikTok_ - The New York Times.txt
<other>The question asks for another Kia Tigers cheerleader mentioned by name besides Lee Ju-Eun. Scanning the article, Lee Ju-Eun is explicitly named as a cheerleader. Lee Si-Young is mentioned as the founder and president of Apex Communications representing the cheer squad, but he is not identified as a cheerleader. No other Kia Tigers cheerleaders are named in the text. Melissa Minh and Deborah Park are mentioned as imitators/content creators, not as Kia Tigers cheerleaders. Therefore, no other cheerleader name is provided.</other>
