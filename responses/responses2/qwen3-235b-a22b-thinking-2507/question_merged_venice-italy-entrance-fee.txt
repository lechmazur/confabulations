<other>The question asks about a specific speech by the mayor at a UNESCO World Heritage Sites conference last year. I need to check if the article mentions this specific event and what reason was given during that speech.</other>
<other>The article states that "Last year, UNESCO, the United Nations' culture agency, recommended that the city be put on the list of its endangered World Heritage Sites, citing mass tourism as a principal concern, though Venice stayed off the 'in danger' list after the access fee was approved." However, there is no mention of the mayor giving a speech at a UNESCO conference. The article only mentions a news conference where the mayor spoke about the fee being a "great success," but this was not specified as a UNESCO conference. The question contains a premise (a speech at UNESCO conference) that isn't supported by the text.</other>
