<other>Reviewing the article to see if there's any mention of why Fabrice Pierret opened Le Lutetia or any mention of tourist counts from the French commerce group.

Regarding tourist numbers, the article attributes the 11 million figure to the Paris tourism office, not the French commerce group. So we can't answer from the commerce group's perspective.</other>
