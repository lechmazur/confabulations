<other>The user wants me to answer two questions based solely on the provided article. I need to extract the specific information and format the response using the required tags. I must answer "N/A" if the information is not present or cannot be logically inferred.</other>
<question_number>1</question_number>
<other>The article states Dr. Waugh is a researcher with the National Severe Storms Laboratory. It mentions scientists from this lab were involved in calculations related to the movie's plot and are part of the Lift research group. However, it does not explicitly state that this laboratory *funded* the research project that the movie is based on. Therefore, I cannot answer the question as asked.</other>

<question_number>2</question_number>
<other>The article mentions "more nimble mobile radars and lidar" used by real scientists. It states the fictional movie team uses "portable phased radar". It says the real future is "getting radars closer to the base of a tornado to create a 3-D representation". The question asks for a *type* of radar other than mobile and lidar that scientists hope to use in the future for 3D representation. The article does not name a specific type of radar for the real scientists' future plans, only "radars".</other>
