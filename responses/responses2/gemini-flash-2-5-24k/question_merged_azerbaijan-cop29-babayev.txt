<other>The user wants me to answer two questions based solely on the provided article. I need to find the answers within the text or state N/A if the information is not present or cannot be logically inferred. I must use the specified tag format.</other>
<other>Question 1 asks for the primary reason for the US's increased oil and gas production according to the text. I will scan the text for mentions of US oil and gas production and look for a reason.</other>
<other>The text mentions: "Similarly, the United States has called on the world to move more quickly to fight climate change, even as it produces and exports more oil and gas than ever." This sentence states the fact of increased production but does not provide a reason for it.</other>

<other>Question 2 asks how the US's increased production has impacted Azerbaijan's plans to expand its fossil fuel industry. I will look for a connection between US production and Azerbaijan's plans in the text.</other>
<other>The text mentions Azerbaijan's plans to increase gas exports and invest in renewables. It also mentions the US producing and exporting more oil and gas as an example of contradictory policies. However, it does not state that the US's increased production has had any impact on Azerbaijan's plans.</other>
