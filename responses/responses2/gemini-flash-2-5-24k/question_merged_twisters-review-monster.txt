<other>The user wants me to answer three questions based solely on the provided article. I need to ensure each question has a corresponding question number tag and answer tag, and that the answer is either directly from the text, logically inferred from the text, or "N/A" if the information is not present or cannot be inferred. All other text must be within `other` tags.</other>
