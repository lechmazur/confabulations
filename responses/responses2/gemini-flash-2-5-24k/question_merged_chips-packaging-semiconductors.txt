<other>The user wants me to answer question 1 based solely on the provided article.
The question asks for the number of Japanese companies in the new packaging research consortium in California.
I need to find the part of the article discussing this consortium and count the Japanese companies mentioned.
The article states: "Resonac, a company based in Tokyo, announced on Monday a new consortium with nine other Japanese and U.S. companies to focus on packaging research and development in a new facility that will be built in Union City, Calif."
Resonac is a Japanese company.
The consortium includes Resonac and "nine other Japanese and U.S. companies".
This means the total number of companies is 1 (Resonac) + 9 (others) = 10.
The nine other companies are a mix of Japanese and U.S. companies. The article does not specify how many of the nine are Japanese.
Therefore, I know there is at least 1 Japanese company (Resonac), but I cannot determine the exact total number of Japanese companies in the consortium.
According to the instructions, if the exact answer cannot be determined from the text, I must answer "N/A".</other>
