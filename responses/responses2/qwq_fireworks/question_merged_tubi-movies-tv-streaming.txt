Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. 

First question: What was Tubi's total revenue in 2022? The article mentions that an analyst estimated Tubi's revenue for the last year was $900 million compared to $775 million the year before. But when was that? The article doesn't specify the exact years. The current year isn't mentioned either. Since the article was written in the present tense and mentions a recent quarter (April-June), maybe the $900 million is for 2023? But without clear dates, I can't be sure. The question asks for 2022 specifically, so if the $775 million is the previous year, maybe that's 2022? But the article doesn't say. Since it's unclear, the answer is N/A.

Second question: The name of the Fox executive credited with turning Tubi into a favorite for Lachlan Murdoch's projects. The article says Fox bought Tubi in 2020 and that Lachlan Murdoch, Fox's CEO, often touts its growth. But who is the executive responsible? The article mentions Anjali Sud as Tubi's CEO. It says Ms. Sud joined last year (when the article was written) and that Murdoch supports Tubi. Maybe Anjali Sud is the one credited? The question is about the Fox executive, though. Wait, Tubi is owned by Fox, so maybe Lachlan Murdoch himself is the executive? But the question says "credited with turning Tubi into a favorite among Lachlan Murdoch's projects." The article states that Lachlan Murdoch touts its growth, so perhaps the answer is Anjali Sud as Tubi's CEO under Fox? Or maybe there's another name. Let me check again. The article says "Fox bought Tubi for $440 million in 2020, the media company's effort to move into streaming. It has since become something of a favorite for Lachlan Murdoch, Fox's chief executive..." So the executive is Lachlan Murdoch himself. Wait, but the question is asking for the executive credited with turning it into a favorite. Since Murdoch is the one touting it, maybe the answer is Anjali Sud? Hmm. Wait, the article says "Fox bought Tubi... It has since become something of a favorite for Lachlan Murdoch..." So maybe the answer is Lachlan Murdoch. But the question says "executive who is credited with turning Tubi into a favorite", which might refer to the Tubi CEO. The article says Anjali Sud is the CEO. Maybe the answer is Anjali Sud. Wait, the article says "Ms. Sud said that before she joined the company last year, she was only dimly aware of it." So she became CEO recently, and under her leadership, maybe? The article doesn't explicitly name the executive responsible, but the only named executive is Anjali Sud. Alternatively, since Fox's CEO is Lachlan Murdoch, perhaps he's the one. The question is a bit ambiguous. The article states that Lachlan Murdoch touts its growth, so perhaps he's the one credited. Wait, the question says "Fox executive", so Lachlan Murdoch is the Fox CEO. The answer is Lachlan Murdoch? But the question might be referring to Tubi's CEO. Let me re-read the exact sentence: "Fox bought Tubi... It has since become something of a favorite for Lachlan Murdoch, Fox's chief executive, who often touts its growth to investors..." So the favorite is Lachlan Murdoch's project, so he is the one credited. Therefore, the answer is Lachlan Murdoch. Wait, but the question is asking for the name of the Fox executive credited with turning it into a favorite among Murdoch's projects. The answer is Lachlan Murdoch himself? But the question might be looking for someone else. Alternatively, the article mentions Anjali Sud as CEO, so maybe she's the one leading Tubi, making it successful. The article says "Ms. Sud said that the company was continuing to invest..." So perhaps the answer is Anjali Sud. Hmm. The article doesn't explicitly name the executive who turned it into a favorite. It says that Fox bought it, and Murdoch touts it. So maybe the answer is Anjali Sud as the Tubi CEO under Fox. But the question says "Fox executive". Since Tubi is owned by Fox, but Anjali Sud is Tubi's CEO, not a Fox exec. Therefore, the answer is Lachlan Murdoch. Wait, but the question is phrased as "the Fox executive who is credited with turning Tubi into a favorite among Lachlan Murdoch's projects". Since Lachlan is the one who is the owner and promotes it, he is the one credited. So the answer is Lachlan Murdoch. But the question says "executive credited with turning it into a favorite among Murdoch's projects". So Murdoch is the one who is the executive, so yes, the answer is Lachlan Murdoch. But the article says "Lachlan Murdoch, Fox's chief executive, who often touts its growth to investors in earnings calls." So he is the one promoting it, so he is the executive credited. Therefore, the answer is Lachlan Murdoch.

Third question: How many cancellations of video subscription services were there in the US between January and March, according to Antenna? The article states that between April and June (so Q2), there were 43 million cancellations. The question asks for January-March (Q1), which is not mentioned. The article only talks about April-June. So the answer is N/A.

Fourth question: Besides horror, thriller, and true crime, what other specific genre performed well? The article mentions that Tubi's executives said horror, thriller, and true crime do well, but also "Some popular programs include the 1970s procedural 'Columbo' and the UPN sitcom 'Everybody Hates Chris'." So procedural and sitcom are genres. The question asks besides the three mentioned, so the answer would be "procedural" and/or "sitcom". Wait, the question says "specific genre", so maybe "procedural" is a genre. Alternatively, the article says "procedural" in the context of Columbo, which is a police procedural. So the answer is "procedural". Alternatively, sitcom. The article mentions both. The question asks for "genre", so perhaps "sitcom" is the genre of "Everybody Hates Chris". So the answer would be sitcom. The question says "specific genre", so either of those. The exact wording in the article is: "Some popular programs on the service include the 1970s procedural 'Columbo,' and an early 2000s UPN sitcom, 'Everybody Hates Chris.' Horror, thriller and true crime programs also do particularly well, executives said." So the genres mentioned as performing well by execs are horror, etc. The other examples are procedural and sitcom, but are those genres that the execs said performed well? The execs said horror, etc., but the article mentions other shows. The question is asking what Tubi executives said performed well besides those three. The article says "executives said" about horror, thriller, true crime. The other examples are in the article but not attributed to the executives. Therefore, the answer is N/A because the question asks what executives said, and the other genres aren't mentioned as such. Wait, the question says "what other specific genre did Tubi executives say performed particularly well". The article says "Horror, thriller and true crime programs also do particularly well, executives said." So only those three are mentioned. The other examples (Columbo and the sitcom) are mentioned as popular programs but not as genres that the execs highlighted. Therefore, the answer is N/A. Wait, the question says "besides horror, thriller, and true crime, what other specific genre did Tubi executives say performed particularly well?" Since the article only lists those three as what the execs said, then the answer is N/A.
