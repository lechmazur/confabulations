Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. 

First question: What was the nature of Tucker Carlson's interaction with Rupert Murdoch at the Fox studio during the convention?

Looking through the article, there's a part that says Rupert Murdoch visited the Fox studio just minutes before Carlson's encounter. But the text mentions that Carlson bumped into Suzanne Scott, the CEO, and that the encounter was cordial. However, there's no direct mention of an interaction between Carlson and Murdoch at the studio. The article says Murdoch was there earlier, but Carlson and Murdoch's interaction isn't described. So the answer would be N/A because the text doesn't state their interaction.

Second question: In what year did Tucker Carlson first express his deep ambivalence towards Donald Trump, and what was the reason behind it?

The article states that Carlson once expressed deep ambivalence towards Trump. The text mentions a 2021 text message where Carlson said he hated Trump. The year here is 2021. The reason isn't explicitly given, but the article refers to the Dominion Voting Systems case where those texts were made public. However, the question asks for the reason behind his ambivalence. The text says he was venting frustration to a colleague, but the exact reason isn't provided beyond his personal feelings. Wait, the question asks for the reason behind his ambivalence. The article says he had turned on Trump toward the end of his presidency, and the text message was from 2021. The reason might be related to his frustration during Trump's presidency, but the article doesn't specify a particular reason like a policy or event. The answer for the year is 2021. The reason part might be N/A, but the question combines both parts. Since the question asks for the year and the reason, but the reason isn't explicitly stated beyond his personal feelings, maybe the reason is "N/A". Wait, the text says he had turned on Trump toward the end of his presidency, so maybe the reason is his frustration during Trump's presidency. Alternatively, the text message mentions wanting to ignore Trump, so perhaps the reason is his frustration with Trump's behavior. But the question asks for the reason behind his ambivalence. The article doesn't state the exact reason, just that he expressed it. Therefore, the reason part would be N/A. But the question asks for both the year and the reason. Since the year is 2021, but the reason isn't provided, the answer would be the year and N/A for the reason. But the question is phrased as "what was the reason behind it?" so maybe the answer is "N/A" for the reason part. Wait, the user instructions say to answer exactly the question. The question is two parts: year and reason. The article says he expressed ambivalence, and the text message in 2021 was part of the Dominion case. But the reason for his ambivalence isn't given beyond his own venting. So the answer for the reason would be N/A. But the question combines both parts, so maybe the answer should be "2021 and N/A". But the instructions say to answer in a sentence fragment or words, not full sentences. Maybe separate the two parts. The first part is the year: 2021. The second part, the reason: N/A. But how to format that? The question asks for both in one answer. The article says "last year's revelations that Mr. Carlson had turned on Mr. Trump toward the end of his presidency." Wait, "last year's" in the context of the article's publication time. The article is written in 2024 (since the RNC is this year, and he was fired in 2023). So "last year's revelations" would be 2023. But the text message was from 2021. The question asks when he first expressed ambivalence. The text message in 2021 is when he expressed it, so the year is 2021. The reason isn't stated beyond his personal frustration. So the answer would be 2021 for the year, and N/A for the reason. But the question asks for both parts in one answer. So the answer would be "2021 and N/A" but maybe the user wants separate answers? Wait the question is phrased as a single question with two parts. Since the reason isn't provided in the text beyond his own venting, which isn't a specific reason, the answer for the reason part is N/A. Therefore, the combined answer would be "2021 and N/A". But the instructions say to answer in sentence fragments. Alternatively, maybe the answer is only the year, and the reason is N/A. But the question is asking for both. Since the user requires both parts, but the reason isn't given, perhaps the answer is "2021" for the year, and the reason part is N/A, but how to combine them? The question is one question, so the answer must address both parts. Since the reason isn't specified, the entire answer would be N/A? Wait no, the year is given. The first part of the question can be answered (the year), but the second part (reason) can't. The question is phrased as two parts, so the answer should include both. For example, "2021 and N/A". But the user's instructions say to answer in a sentence fragment or words. Alternatively, maybe the reason is that he was frustrated, as he said he got pissed. The text says "venting frustration to a colleague". So the reason could be "frustration with Trump". But the question says "the reason behind it" (the ambivalence). The article says he had turned on Trump toward the end of his presidency, but the exact reason isn't given. The text message expresses his personal feelings, but not the cause. So the reason isn't provided, so N/A. Therefore, the answer for the second question would be "2021 and N/A" but formatted as per instructions. Since the user wants the answer in the tags, the answer should be written as two parts. However, the instructions say to answer the exact question, so if the question asks for both, but only part is answerable, then part is answered and the rest N/A. So the answer is "2021" for the year, and the reason is N/A. But how to combine? The question is one question, so the answer must include both parts. Maybe the answer is "2021, N/A". That seems acceptable.
