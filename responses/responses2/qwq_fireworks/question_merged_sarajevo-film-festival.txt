Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and follow the strict instructions.

1. **Question 1:** How did the Sarajevo Film Festival's relationship with the United Nations evolve after the siege ended?

Looking at the article, the mention of the UN is in the part where Purivatra got the generator through the UN mission. But after the siege ended, the article doesn't discuss how the relationship evolved post-siege. The text stops at the initial help during the war. So the answer is N/A because there's no info on post-siege developments with the UN.

2. **Question 2:** How many years did Jovan Marjanovic work as a projectionist before becoming festival director?

The article states Marjanovic started as a projectionist over 20 years ago and is now the director. But it doesn't specify the exact number of years he worked as a projectionist before becoming director. Since it's "over 20 years ago" but we don't know when he became director, can't calculate the exact years. So N/A.

3. **Question 3:** What was the name of the punk collective Mirsad Purivatra belonged to during the siege?

The article mentions Purivatra was in a "punk" collective with others in the cellar, but it doesn't give the collective a specific name. So the answer is N/A because the name isn't provided.

4. **Question 4:** Who was the director of the first film screened at the festival, which was brought to Sarajevo by Phil Alden Robinson as part of a humanitarian mission?

Phil Alden Robinson brought Universal films, including "Field of Dreams," which he directed. The article says he brought a box of Universal films, so "Field of Dreams" is his. Since that's one of the films brought, and it's the first film screened? Wait, the first festival's screenings included films like "A Little Princess" by Cuaron and others. Wait, the question says the first film brought by Phil Alden Robinson. The answer would be Phil Alden Robinson himself, as he directed "Field of Dreams." So the director is Phil Alden Robinson.

5. **Question 5:** What year did Jasmila Zbanic win her Oscar for "Quo Vadis, Aida?"?

The article says her film "Quo Vadis, Aida?" (2020) was Oscar-nominated. It doesn't mention winning, only that it was nominated. Since the question is about winning, and the text only says nominated, the answer is N/A.
