Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided.

1. **First Question:** "Which film festival did Guy Lodge claim was the first to become an Oscar launchpad before Venice?"  
The article mentions that "Oppenheimer" (2023) was the first best picture winner since 2006's "The Departed" that didn't premiere at a North American or European festival. So before Venice became the launchpad, maybe Toronto or another festival was? Wait, the article says that Venice became the launchpad after "Birdman" in 2014. But the question is about a festival that was first before Venice. However, the text doesn't mention another festival being the first. Lodge says Venice became a launchpad around "Birdman" time. The answer might be N/A since there's no prior festival named here as the first.

Wait, actually, the article says that before Venice's resurgence, Toronto was where studios went. Maybe the answer is Toronto? Let me check again. The article states that Barbera feared losing Hollywood to Toronto. Lodge mentions that Venice needed a new identity and that distributors realized Venice was a good launchpad. The question is about a festival that was first before Venice. The article doesn't say another festival was the first launchpad. So maybe the answer is N/A?

Hmm, but the question is phrased as "the first to become an Oscar launchpad before Venice." Since the article doesn't name another festival as the prior launchpad, the answer is N/A.

2. **Second Question:** "What was the total number of films submitted to the Venice Film Festival in the year 'Poor Things' won the Golden Lion?"  
"Poorest Things" won in 2022 (since 2022's Golden Lion was mentioned for "All the Beauty and the Bloodshed" by Poitras, but wait, "Poor Things" won in 2022? Wait, the article says "last year" when talking about 2023's festival presenting "Poor Things". Wait, the article says in 2022, "All the Beauty..." won, and "Poor Things" was in 2023's festival? Wait, let me check. The article says: "The festival's 77th edition in 2020... last year, the festival presented a robust installment despite the SAG-AFTRA strike. The 23-title main competition included work by Sofia Coppola, Ava DuVernay, Michael Mann and Yorgos Lanthimos, who won the Golden Lion for his surreal horror-fantasy film 'Poor Things.'" So "Poor Things" won in 2023's festival (since it's the last year before the current one mentioned in the article, which is probably 2024 when the article was written). The question is about the year "Poor Things" won (2023), and the article states that Barbera mentioned this year's program was assembled from over 4,000 submissions. Wait, the article's last part says: "Barbera said he was 'particularly satisfied' with this year's program, which was assembled from over 4,000 submissions." But "this year" would refer to the current festival being discussed, which is the one opening on Wednesday (the article's present time). Since the article mentions "last year" for 2023's festival, the "this year" is 2024. Therefore, the 4000 submissions are for 2024, not 2023. The question is about the year "Poor Things" won (2023), so the number isn't given. The answer is N/A.

3. **Third Question:** "How many consecutive years has the Venice Film Festival's Golden Lion winner gone on to win Best Picture at the Oscars?"  
The article mentions that "Nomadland" (2020) and "The Shape of Water" (2017) both won Golden Lion and Best Picture. However, it says "second film after Guillermo del Toro's 'The Shape of Water' (2017) to claim that double distinction." So only two films have done so. But consecutive years? Between 2017 and 2020, that's three years apart. So the answer would be 0, since they aren't consecutive. The question asks for consecutive years. So the answer is 0?

Wait, the question is about how many consecutive years the Golden Lion winner went on to win Best Picture. Since the two instances (2017 and 2020) are not consecutive, the answer is 0. So N/A if the question expects a specific number of consecutive years, but since it's asking how many consecutive years have occurred, the answer is 0. But maybe the article doesn't mention any others. So the answer is 0?

Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased as "how many consecutive years has the Golden Lion winner gone on to win Best Picture?" Since only two films did so, but not in consecutive years, the answer is 0. So 0.

4. **Fourth Question:** "Which famous director did Alberto Barbera personally convince to premiere their film at Venice instead of Toronto?"  
The article says Barbera flew to LA to court studios. The first success was when he got "Gravity" to open in 2013 (his second year, since he started in 2012). The director of "Gravity" is Alfonso Cuaron. So the answer is Alfonso Cuaron.

5. **Fifth Question:** "What prestigious award did 'Birdman' win at the Venice Film Festival before going on to win the Oscar for Best Picture?"  
"Birdman" won the Golden Lion, as mentioned when it opened the festival the year after "Gravity". The article states that "Birdman" went on to win Best Picture in 2015, and since it opened Venice, it likely won the Golden Lion. The exact sentence: "the festival opened with Alejandro G. Inarritu's 'Birdman,' which went on to win the Oscar for best picture in 2015." The award from Venice is the Golden Lion, since that's the main prize. The article mentions "The Shape of Water" and "Nomadland" both won Golden Lion and Oscars. So "Birdman" would have also won the Golden Lion. So the answer is Golden Lion.
