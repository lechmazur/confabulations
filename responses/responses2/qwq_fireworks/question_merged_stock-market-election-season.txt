Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the information from the article provided.

1. **Question 1:** Which specific companies were mentioned as having outstanding corporate earnings that fueled the market rally?  
   The article says "Corporate earnings -- which fuel the market -- have been outstanding." But it doesn't name any specific companies. So the answer is N/A because there's no mention of specific companies.

2. **Question 2:** Which specific historical event was cited as a direct cause of the market's volatility during the political season?  
   The text mentions "the attack on the Capitol of Jan. 6, 2021" as an example of political strife that could create problems. So that's the event they're referring to.

3. **Question 3:** What is the name of the economist who devised the 5-year price-to-earnings ratio?  
   The article talks about the 10-year price-to-earnings ratio called CAPE, devised by Robert Shiller. Wait, the question says 5-year, but the article says 10-year. Since the question specifies 5-year, but the article mentions 10-year (CAPE), the answer here would be N/A because the economist's ratio is for 10 years, not 5. The user wants the exact timeframe, so unless there's a 5-year one mentioned, it's not there.

4. **Question 4:** What is the minimum percentage of bonds required in a portfolio to ensure no market losses over a 5-year period, as calculated by Morningstar Direct?  
   The article states that with at least 10% in bonds, over five-year periods, losses occurred in fewer than 10% of those stretches. Wait, the exact wording: "if you held at least 10 percent of your portfolio in bonds. Losses were more common over one-year periods..." But the question asks for the minimum percentage to "ensure no market losses over a 5-year period." The article says that with 10% bonds, losses were fewer than 10% of the time, but it doesn't say "no losses." The part about ensuring no losses was for 15 years with pure stocks and 10 years with bonds included. The 5-year part doesn't specify a minimum to ensure no losses, just that 10% bonds reduced losses. Therefore, the answer here is N/A because the question asks for the minimum to ensure no losses over 5 years, but the article only states that with 10% bonds, losses occurred in fewer than 10% of cases. It doesn't say that 10% bonds eliminate losses entirely over 5 years. So the exact answer isn't there.
