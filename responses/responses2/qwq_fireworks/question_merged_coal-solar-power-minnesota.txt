Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the current percentage of the nation's electricity produced by solar power according to the Energy Department report mentioned in the text.

Looking at the article, there's a part that says: "One Energy Department report concluded that solar energy could provide up to 40 percent of the nation's electricity by 2035." The key word here is "could provide up to 40 percent by 2035." The question is about the current percentage, not the future projection. The report doesn't mention the current figure, only what it might reach by 2035. 

Since the text doesn't state the current percentage, just the future projection, the answer should be N/A. The question specifically asks for the current percentage, and the article only provides a future estimate. There's no information on the present solar contribution here.
