Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the article provided.

1. **Question 1:** What was the total value of China's exports to the European Union in June?  
   The article states, "The surplus with the European Union reached $22.6 billion in June, up from $19.1 billion in the same month last year." Wait, the surplus is exports minus imports. The question asks for total exports, not the surplus. Hmm, but the article mentions exports jumped to $308 billion in June overall. However, the EU surplus is $22.6B. To find exports to EU, we need exports minus imports from EU. But the article doesn't give the exact export number for EU. The surplus is given, but without knowing imports, can't compute. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check again. The article says the surplus with EU was $22.6B in June. The total exports were $308B, but that's total exports globally. The question is specifically about the EU's exports value. Since the surplus is exports minus imports, and the surplus is $22.6B, but we don't have the imports number for EU, so can't directly answer. Wait, maybe the question is a trick? The article says "exports to the EU" but actually gives the surplus. Since the question asks for total exports, not surplus, and the article doesn't state the exports number for EU specifically, only the surplus. So answer N/A.

Wait, no. Wait the surplus is exports minus imports. The surplus with EU was $22.6B, but without the imports figure, we can't get exports. The question is about exports value. Since the article only provides the surplus, not the exports number, the answer is N/A. But wait, the question might be a trick. Let me check again. The article says "China's trade surplus with the United States rose to nearly $32 billion last month... The surplus with the European Union reached $22.6 billion in June..." So only surplus is given. So the answer is N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Name of the Chinese government's new economic strategy to expand industrial output announced by Xi during the four-day meeting.  
   The article says Xi set a national goal of fostering "new quality productive forces," with emphasis on building more factories with robots and automation. The exact name is mentioned as "new quality productive forces." So the answer is "new quality productive forces".

3. **Question 3:** Name of the senior fellow at CFR who stated China's surplus with US expected to reach $50B by end of year.  
   The article quotes Brad W. Setser as a senior fellow at CFR, but his statement was about the June surplus and the strategy. The article doesn't mention a $50B projection. The surplus with the US was $32B in June, up from $29B. The question's claim about $50B isn't in the text. So the answer is N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Name of the Chinese city with deadly protests over taxes and economy, major export hub.  
   The article mentions Kenya had deadly protests due to debt and proposed taxes. Wait, Kenya isn't a Chinese city. Wait, the article says "Kenya... recently experienced deadly protests..." So the country is Kenya, not a Chinese city. The question asks for a Chinese city, but the text refers to Kenya. So answer N/A.

5. **Question 5:** Other factor besides post-Shanghai lockdown contributing to July 2022 surplus.  
   The article states the 2022 July surplus was due to factories and ports racing to meet global demand after Shanghai's lockdown. The question asks for another factor besides that. The article says "a record set in July 2022, when the country's factories and ports were racing to catch up with global demand after a stringent Covid-19 lockdown in Shanghai had crippled output..." So the only factor mentioned is the post-lockdown surge. The question asks for another factor, but none is provided. So answer N/A.
