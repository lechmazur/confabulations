Okay, let's tackle the first question. The user is asking for the name of the Brooklyn neighborhood where Tanya Sichynsky grills with her parents. 

Looking at the article, the first paragraph mentions: "On summer evenings in my Brooklyn neighborhood, you won't get far before you're enticed by the exhaust of a charcoal grill parked on the sidewalk." Then later, it says she grilled at her parents' place, which is a house with grilling infrastructure, unlike her own one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn.

But the problem is, the article never actually names the specific neighborhood in Brooklyn. It just refers to "my Brooklyn neighborhood" generally. There's no mention of a specific name like Williamsburg, Bushwick, or any other. So even though it's her neighborhood, the text doesn't provide the actual name. 

Therefore, the answer should be N/A because the article doesn't specify the name of the neighborhood.
