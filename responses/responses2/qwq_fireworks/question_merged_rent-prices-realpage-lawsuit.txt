Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. 

First question: Which federal agency has already taken legal action against RealPage? The article mentions the Justice Department filed a brief in support of the renters' case, but it also says the Justice Department hasn't taken legal action. Then there's the District of Columbia's lawsuit by the Attorney General, but that's a local agency, not federal. Wait, the question specifies a federal agency. The text says the FBI executed a search warrant related to a Justice Department investigation. But the FBI is part of the DOJ. However, the question is about taking legal action. The article states that the Justice Department hasn't taken legal action, but the District of Columbia's lawsuit is by a local AG. The only federal action mentioned is the brief, not actual legal action like a lawsuit or charges. Hmm. Wait, the user's first question is about which federal agency has already taken legal action. The text says the DOJ filed a brief in support, but that's not legal action against RealPage directly. The lawsuits mentioned are from state AGs like DC, Arizona, and North Carolina. So maybe the answer is N/A because the federal agency (DOJ) hasn't taken legal action, only filed a brief. But the question says "taken legal action"â€”maybe the brief isn't considered legal action against the company. So the answer would be N/A?

Wait, let me check again. The article says: "The Justice Department has not taken legal action against the company. But its antitrust division filed a brief in November in support of the renters' case." So the DOJ hasn't sued. The FBI's search warrant was part of an investigation into potential antitrust violations in the multifamily housing industry, but that's separate from RealPage specifically? The text says the search was at Cortland's office, and it's unclear how RealPage factors into that. So the federal agency hasn't taken legal action against RealPage. Therefore, the answer to question 1 is N/A?

Wait the user's first question says "federal agency has already taken legal action against RealPage". The only possible candidate is the DOJ, but the text says they haven't. The other lawsuits are from state attorneys general. So the answer is N/A.

Second question: The name of the former RealPage executive quoted on the company's website. Wait, the article says: "the former chief executive of the Texas-based property management company Pinnacle said his firm's revenue rose by 4 percent..." His name is Rick Graf. But he's a Pinnacle executive, not RealPage's. The text clarifies that the quote is from Pinnacle's CEO. RealPage's website features his quote. So the answer is Rick Graf. The question asks for the name of the former RealPage executive, but actually, he's from Pinnacle. The article says "former chief executive of Pinnacle" so he's not a RealPage executive. Therefore, the answer would be N/A because the question is incorrect. Wait, the question says "former RealPage executive", but the text says he's from Pinnacle. So that's a mismatch. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

Wait, the question says "former RealPage executive quoted on the company's website praising the software's effectiveness". The article says that RealPage's website has a video where Rick Graf, the former CEO of Pinnacle, talks about their success with the software. Since he's not a RealPage executive, the answer would be N/A because the question incorrectly refers to him as a RealPage executive. The text doesn't mention any RealPage executive being quoted there. So the answer to question 2 is N/A.
