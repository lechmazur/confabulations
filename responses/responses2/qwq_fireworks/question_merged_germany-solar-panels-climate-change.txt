Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. 

Starting with question 1: "How many gigawatts of photovoltaic capacity did Germany aim to add by the end of 2023 according to the Federal Network Agency?" 

I need to look through the article for any mention of Germany's targets related to photovoltaic capacity. The article states that in the first six months of the year, Germany added nine gigawatts, and Klaus Muller from the Federal Network Agency mentioned that compared to the total capacity at the end of 2023, almost 10% more was added. However, the exact target for 2023 isn't specified here. The article does mention that Germany aims to reach a third of 600 gigawatts (from the EU's target) by 2030, which would be 200 GW, but that's for 2030, not 2023. Since the question is about 2023's target and the article doesn't state a specific number for that year, the answer is N/A.

Moving to question 2: "How many European countries besides Germany have legalized plug-in solar panels?" 

The article mentions that plug-in systems are popular in the Netherlands and interest is growing in France, Italy, and Spain. However, it doesn't explicitly state that these countries have "legalized" them. The text says Germany's new laws contributed to the boom, but for other countries, it's about popularity or growing interest, not legal changes. Since the question asks specifically about legalization in other countries, there's no direct info, so N/A.

Question 3: "At what price point did the cost of individual plug-in solar panels in Germany stabilize after the initial surge in demand?" 

The article states that individual panels sell for as low as 200 euros, and complete sets are about twice that. However, it doesn't mention anything about stabilization after a surge in demand. The price is given as current, but there's no info on prior surges or stabilization points. Hence, N/A.
