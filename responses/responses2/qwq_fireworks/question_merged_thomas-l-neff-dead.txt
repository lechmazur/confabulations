Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. 

1. **First question:** What was the primary reason Dr. Neff was initially skeptical about the feasibility of his own idea? Hmm, the article mentions that Dr. Neff thought his idea would take care of itself and that he was naive. But the question is about his initial skepticism. Wait, actually, the text says he faced skepticism from others, but the question is about his own skepticism. Wait, let me check again. The article states: "Dr. Neff succeeded in setting his recycling idea into motion in spite of (or perhaps because of) his lack of name recognition, his inexperience on the world stage and his lack of credentials in arms control." So maybe those factors were his own hurdles? Or was he skeptical? Wait, he said he was naive, thinking the idea would take care of itself. That might mean he wasn't skeptical himself but others were. The question is about his own initial skepticism. The article doesn't mention Dr. Neff being skeptical of his own idea. Instead, he faced skepticism from others. So the answer would be N/A because the text doesn't state his own reasons for skepticism.

2. **Second question:** How many grandchildren did Dr. Neff have at the time of his death, according to the Russian brochure? The article says in the survivors section: "he is survived by his wife, Beth Harris; his son from a previous marriage, Chris Neff; his brother, Bill; and two grandchildren." The Russian brochure is mentioned in the context of the Megatons to Megawatts program's end, but it doesn't mention his family details. The number of grandchildren is stated in the survivors part, not the brochure. Since the question specifies "according to the Russian brochure," which only talks about the program details, not his family, the answer is N/A.

3. **Third question:** What was the name of the Soviet leader who first approached Dr. Neff with the idea of selling uranium from Soviet nuclear arms? The article says Dr. Neff approached Viktor N. Mikhailov, a Soviet bomb complex leader. The question is who approached him first. The article states that during a break, Dr. Neff approached Mikhailov. So Mikhailov didn't approach him first. The question is phrased as "the Soviet leader who first approached Dr. Neff," but according to the text, it was Neff who approached Mikhailov. Therefore, there's no Soviet leader mentioned as approaching him first. So answer is N/A.

4. **Fourth question:** In what year did Dr. Neff first travel to Russia to discuss the uranium deal with Soviet officials? The article mentions that he made his pitch openly in December 1991, and later estimated he flew 20 times starting from after that. The first trip would be after the initial meeting in October 1991. The first shipments started in 1995, but the first trip to Russia would have been in 1991, since he was among the last Westerners to see the Soviet flag in December 1991. The text says "Later, he estimated that he flew 20 times to Russia and other former Soviet states to work on the deal..." So the first trip would be in 1991. The answer is 1991.
