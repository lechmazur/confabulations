Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. 

First question: How does the film explain the increased frequency and intensity of tornadoes compared to the 1996 original? The article mentions that "Twisters" addresses climate change indirectly. It says the words "climate change" are never uttered, but the movie shows tornadoes now rove in packs and the context of worsening extreme weather. The article also points out the deeper themes about fighting the tornadoes and the literal effects of climate change. But the film itself doesn't explicitly explain it; the article infers it's due to climate change. Since the question is about how the film explains it, and the text says the movie doesn't mention climate change directly, maybe the answer is that it's not explained explicitly. Wait, the article says "the reason the title is plural" is because tornadoes now come in packs. So the increased frequency is shown through their packs, but the explanation in the film might be through the plot's focus on unpredictable and relentless weather. The article says "the real effects" of climate change are present but the film doesn't state it. So the film's explanation is through the depiction of tornadoes in packs and the havoc, but not directly via dialogue. The question is how the film explains it. The article states that "Twisters" is about the increased frequency and intensity, so maybe the answer is that it's not directly explained but implied through the plot's context of extreme weather and climate change's effects. However, since the question asks how the film explains it, and the text says the movie doesn't use the term "climate change," the answer might be N/A because the film doesn't explicitly explain it. Alternatively, maybe the article says that the increased tornado activity is part of the plot's premise, like through the new project Javi is involved in. Wait, looking back: the article states that "Twisters" shows tornadoes now tend to rove in packs, and the title is plural because of that. The movie's plot is about fighting the tornadoes, implying that the increased frequency is part of the scenario but not explained causally. Since the question is how the film explains the increase, and the text doesn't mention any in-film explanation (like a scientist character explaining climate change), the answer would be N/A. Because the article says the movie doesn't mention climate change, so the film itself doesn't explain the cause, just shows the effect.

Second question: How many stunt performers were used to film the scene where Jeff Swearingen's character is pulled up into the air by the tornado? The article says after Jeff is yanked back, they changed Jeff out with "this wonderful stunt performer who we rigged up to really be pulled up into the air." So only one stunt performer was used for that part. The answer is 1.

Third question: How many Academy Awards did "Minari," Lee Isaac Chung's previous film, win? The article states "Minari" garnered six Oscar nominations. It doesn't mention how many it won. So the answer is N/A because the text only says nominations, not wins.

<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article states that "Twisters" addresses increased tornado frequency/intensity through context like tornadoes roving in packs and references to climate change's effects but clarifies the film never utters "climate change" as an explanation. Since the question asks how the film explains it and the text specifies the movie doesn't explicitly state this, answer is N/A.</other>
<question_number>2</question_number>
<answer>1</answer>
<other>Lee Isaac Chung mentions they replaced Jeff Swearingen with "a stunt performer" to be pulled up, indicating one stunt performer used for that specific action.</other>
<question_number>3</question_number>
<answer>N/A</answer>
<other>The article only mentions "Minari" received six Oscar nominations, not how many it actually won. Since the question asks for awards won and the text lacks this info, answer is N/A.</other>
