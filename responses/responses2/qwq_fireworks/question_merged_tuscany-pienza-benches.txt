Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided.

1. **First question**: How many years did it take Urs Rechsteiner to complete the installation of all 28 benches along the Sentiero dell'Arte e dell'Anima?

Hmm, the article mentions that Urs Rechsteiner had a second home in the area for 30 years. But the project's timeline? The text says the path was unveiled in March, but the exact duration for installing the benches isn't given. However, there's a part where it took about two years to formulate the route and get permissions, as stated by Giampietro Colombini. But does that refer to the entire project's duration? The article also mentions that 20 years ago, Grazzi and others had a similar vision but couldn't install them, and they were in a warehouse. So maybe the actual installation time under Rechsteiner's project was shorter, but the total time from the initial idea might be 20 years? But the question specifically asks about Rechsteiner's completion. The article says the benches were unveiled in March (assuming the article is recent, but the exact years aren't given). The two years mentioned were for formulating the route and permissions, so maybe the actual installation was part of that? The question is about how many years Rechsteiner took. The article doesn't explicitly state the duration from start to finish for him. So maybe the answer is N/A?

Wait, the text says "It took us about two years to formulate the route and get the permissions," so maybe the total time from starting the project to completion was around two years? But the question is about Urs Rechsteiner's involvement. The article says he had the villa for 30 years, but the project started when? The benches were a gift from his foundation, so perhaps the actual installation time is part of the two years mentioned. But the question is about how many years he took. Since the article says "it took about two years to formulate the route and get the permissions," maybe the answer is 2? Or maybe the two years is part of the process but the actual installation time isn't specified. The question is tricky. Since the article doesn't give a specific number of years for Rechsteiner's completion beyond the two years for planning, I think the answer is N/A because the question is about the duration to install all 28 benches, not the planning. The article mentions that the benches had been in a warehouse for 20 years, but Rechsteiner's role was to install them, so maybe the actual installation was quick once the permissions were done. But without a specific time mentioned, it's safer to say N/A.

2. **Second question**: What is the name of the Renaissance architect who designed the travertine benches in Pienza's main square?

The article states that Pienza was designed by Bernardo Rossellino (Bernardo Gambarelli's better-known name). However, the benches in the main square are mentioned as part of the existing structures in Pienza, not necessarily designed by Rossellino. The article says "travertine benches have long been built into Pienza. They sit in the main square..." So the benches themselves weren't designed by Rossellino; he designed the town's architecture. The question is about the architect who designed the benches. Since the article doesn't name an architect for the benches in the square, the answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe Rossellino is considered the designer because he designed the town's structures? The article says the town was designed by him in white travertine marble, so maybe the benches are part of that? But the text doesn't explicitly say he designed the benches. So the answer is N/A.

3. **Third question**: Which famous Hollywood actor mentioned in the article has a villa near the Path of Art and Soul?

The article mentions that Urs Rechsteiner has a villa called Villa Santa Maria. The only other person mentioned with a villa is George Clooney, who is a star frequenting Lake Como, but the Path is in Val d'Orcia, not Lake Como. Wait, the article's last part talks about Lake Como, Italy: Stars like George Clooney frequent this scenic corner... So Clooney is mentioned in the article, but his villa is in Lake Como, not near the Path of Art and Soul in Pienza. The question asks for someone mentioned in the article who has a villa near the Path. Since the article doesn't mention any Hollywood actor with a villa near Pienza's path except Rechsteiner, who's a Swiss art collector, not a Hollywood actor. So maybe the answer is N/A? Because the only villa mentioned near the path is Rechsteiner's, but he's not a Hollywood actor. The other mentions like Clooney are in a different location. So N/A.

4. **Fourth question**: What is the name of the nearby town that is also known for its Renaissance architecture and is often compared to Pienza?

The article only discusses Pienza as a Renaissance example. It doesn't mention another town nearby with similar architecture. The Val d'Orcia is the region, but no specific town is compared to Pienza. So N/A.
