Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. 

First question: In which year did Billie Jean King first meet Kendall Coyne Schofield to discuss forming a women's hockey league? The article mentions that the initial phone call was arranged in March 2019. So the meeting that followed would be in that same year. The answer should be 2019.

Second question: How many teams will the P.W.H.L. expand to in the 2025 season, and what cities will the new teams be based in? The article states that the inaugural season had three teams from Canada (Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa) and three from the U.S. (Minnesota, Boston, New York). It mentions the 2025 season will have 30 games but doesn't specify the number of teams or new cities. So the expansion details aren't provided. Therefore, the answer is N/A for both parts.

Third question: Total players in the P.W.H.L.? The article doesn't give the exact number of players. It mentions player salaries and other benefits but no total count. So N/A here as well.
