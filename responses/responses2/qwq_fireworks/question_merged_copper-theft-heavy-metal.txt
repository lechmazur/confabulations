merged_copper-theft-heavy-metal.txt
Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. 

First question: The user is asking for the name of the new law signed by Governor Walz that requires scrap metal recyclers to get a license and attest the material is legal. The article mentions that in late April, Governor Walz signed a new law requiring individuals selling copper scrap metal in Minnesota to obtain a license and attest legality. But the text doesn't explicitly name the law. The article just refers to it as "a new law." So I can't find the specific name here. Answer would be N/A.

Second question: The increase in copper wire theft cases in Kevin de Leon's district over five years. The article states that in his district, there were 6,900 cases last fiscal year, up from 600 five years ago. The question asks for the dollar amount of the increase. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Dollar amount? Wait, maybe the user meant the numerical increase. But the question specifically says "dollar amount." The article doesn't mention the financial value of the increase, just the number of cases. So the answer should be N/A because it's asking for dollars, not case numbers. The 6,900 vs 600 is case count, not dollars. So the user made a mistake here, so N/A.

Third question: The same as the first but phrased differently. The user is asking the name of the law again. The article doesn't provide the law's name. So again, N/A.
