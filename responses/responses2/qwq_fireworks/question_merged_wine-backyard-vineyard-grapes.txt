Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided. 

First question: How many bottles of wine did Erica Ritchie produce in the first year after planting her vineyard in 2018?

Looking at the article, Erica Ritchie's vineyard was first planted in 2018 by her father. The text mentions that since 2022, Haven (her vineyard) has produced 500 bottles a year. The first year after planting would be 2019, but the article doesn't mention production until 2022. So, there's no info on the first few years. The answer here should be N/A because the article only states production starting in 2022, not the first year after 2018.

Second question: How many clients did Vines of the Valley have when they first started their business?

The article says Vines of the Valley began in 2021 after planting the previous year. It mentions they have 12 clients throughout Southern California as of the current time. But the question is about when they first started. The text doesn't specify the number of clients at the very start, only that they started in 2021 and now have 12. So, since there's no data on the initial number, it's N/A.

Third question: What type of insect did Jeremy Winkie struggle with while growing his grapes?

The article discusses Jeremy Winkie's challenges. He mentions battling mildew and fungus due to rain, and training vines. However, there's no mention of insects. The only pest mentioned in the article is the Japanese beetle, but that was Craig Lemoine's problem. Jeremy's issues were with mildew, not insects. Since the question asks for an insect and the text doesn't mention any for Jeremy, the answer is N/A.
