Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. The user provided an article and two questions that need to be answered based solely on the article's content.

First question: "How did the anti-abortion group justify their claim that the sculpture was a 'satanic' memorial to Ruth Bader Ginsburg?" 

Looking through the article, the relevant part says: "an anti-abortion group drew attention to the sculpture after its installation in February, calling it a 'satanic' memorial to abortion and the Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg." The article mentions the group's claim but doesn't elaborate on their justification. There's no explanation provided in the text about why they considered it satanic or linked to RBG. So the answer here would be N/A because the article doesn't state their reasoning, just the claim itself.

Second question: "Which Supreme Court justice did Sikander say inspired the lace collar on the sculpture?"

The article states: "symbolizing the need to 'break the legal glass ceiling.'" and mentions Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the context of the anti-abortion group's claim. However, when discussing the lace collar, Sikander's intention was about the stained-glass dome of the courthouse, not a specific justice. The text doesn't mention any Supreme Court justice being the inspiration for the lace collar. Therefore, the answer here is also N/A since the article doesn't connect the lace collar to a specific justice, only the broader theme of justice and the courthouse's dome.
