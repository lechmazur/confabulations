Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking what prestigious award "La Dolce Vita" won that solidified its place in cinematic history. I need to look through the article for any mention of awards related to that film.

The article mentions "La Dolce Vita" tying for No. 35 on the British Film Institute's Sight and Sound directors' poll on the 100 greatest films of all time. Wait, that's a poll, not an actual award. The question specifically asks for a prestigious award. The text doesn't mention any traditional awards like Oscars or Golden Globes. The only recognition listed is the Sight and Sound poll ranking. Since the question is about an award, and the poll isn't an award, the correct answer here would be N/A because there's no mention of an actual award won by the film. The user might confuse the poll with an award, but according to the instructions, I have to stick strictly to the text. So, the answer should be N/A.
