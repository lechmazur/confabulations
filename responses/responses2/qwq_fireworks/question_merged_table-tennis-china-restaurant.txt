Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided.

First question: What dish did Yuan Jia Nan specifically mention as her favorite at Tang's restaurant? I need to find where Yuan Jia Nan is mentioned. The article says, "Yuan, the 19th-ranked player in the world, said she enjoyed her first visit so much that she returned days later for a second meal. 'It was good, because I like spicy food,' said Yuan, 39..." So she mentioned liking spicy food, but the specific dish isn't named. The dishes listed later are suan cai yu and shui zhu niu rou, but she didn't specifically name either. So the answer should be N/A because the text doesn't state the exact dish she liked.

Second question: How many years has Tang Zhongqiu been living in the 15th arrondissement of Paris? The article states, "Tang, 49, knows these people aren't famous in France, where he has lived for two decades." Two decades equal 20 years. So the answer is 20.

Third question: What is the name of the popular Chinese social media platform used? The text mentions, "Customers, often carrying flags and homemade banners, have learned of the restaurant by word of mouth and Chinese social media platforms like Little Red Book." The platform named here is Little Red Book. So the answer is Little Red Book.
