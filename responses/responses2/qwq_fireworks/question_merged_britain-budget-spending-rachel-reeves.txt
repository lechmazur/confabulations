Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided.

First question: Which infrastructure project did Rachel Reeves specifically mention cancelling to reduce spending? The article mentions that she cut some road and rail projects, but it doesn't name a specific one. It also talks about ending the Rwanda deportation program, but that's not an infrastructure project. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Let me check again. The text says she announced measures including reducing spending on consultants and ending the Rwanda program. The infrastructure cuts are mentioned generally, not a specific project. So the answer should be N/A because there's no specific project named.

Second question: What tax did Rachel Reeves hint at raising to help close the budget gap? The article states that Labour promised not to increase income, corporation, or VAT. But analysts mentioned capital gains or inheritance tax could be altered. However, Reeves herself didn't hint at those specifically. She mentioned more decisions on taxes but didn't specify which. The Conservatives accused her of planning tax rises, but the text doesn't say which ones she hinted at. So the answer is N/A because the article doesn't state a specific tax she mentioned.

Third question: Which former Conservative minister did Rachel Reeves directly criticize in her speech? The article says she accused the Conservative Party, not a specific minister. Jeremy Hunt, the previous chancellor, responded to her, but she didn't directly criticize him by name in her speech. The text doesn't mention her naming any individual Conservative minister. So the answer is N/A again.
