Okay, I need to go through each question one by one based on the provided article. Let me start with question 1. The first question asks for the exact amount Google paid Samsung in 2022. The article mentions that Google paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 but doesn't specify Samsung's payment amount. So the answer should be N/A.

Question 2 is about Apple's 2021 payment. The article only states the 2022 amount for Apple, so again N/A.

Question 3 asks which Republican senator explicitly called for breaking up Big Tech. The article mentions Senator JD Vance as Trump's running mate who supported a crackdown. That's the answer.

Question 4: The judge proposed a remedy. The text says Mehta set a hearing to discuss potential remedies like divestitures or operational fixes, but didn't propose a specific one yet. So N/A.

Question 5: Mike Moritz's concerns about Musk's endorsement. The article says Moritz cautioned peers about Musk's political involvement, but the exact concerns mentioned are about Musk's influence and potential scrutiny. The answer should be about Musk's political influence.

Question 6: Nvidia's stock rise in first six months of last year. The article states that Nvidia's stock more than doubled in the past year, but not specifically the first six months. So N/A.

Question 7: Apple's alternative search engine before making own maps. The article says Apple might consider Microsoft's Bing or others, but the question mentions developing a mapping system. Wait, the article says "as it did with maps, would Apple enter the market itself?" So the alternative was Bing. The answer is Bing.

Question 8: Treasury's actions to manipulate bond market. The article says Republicans and economists accused the Treasury of seeking to manipulate, but doesn't specify actions. So N/A.
