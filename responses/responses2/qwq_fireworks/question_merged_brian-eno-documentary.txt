Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article. Let me go through each question and see what the article says.

1. **How did Brian Eno's experience with the band Roxy Music directly influence the creation of the generative documentary?**
   - The article mentions that Eno was a member of Roxy Music and that his work with generative music influenced the documentary. However, the direct link between his time in Roxy Music and the documentary isn't explicitly stated. It says his generative music inspired the film's approach, but Roxy Music's role was more about his early career. The answer might be N/A since the article doesn't directly connect Roxy Music's influence to the documentary's creation beyond his general work in generative music.

2. **What was the primary influence of Steve Reich's "It's Gonna Rain" on the structure of the documentary "Eno"?**
   - The article states that Eno was inspired by Reich's piece, which used loops that fell out of sync. The documentary uses a software to reconfigure content each time, similar to how Reich's work used generative techniques. The primary influence here is on the generative structure, so the answer would be that it inspired the generative approach.

3. **In which year did Eno leave Roxy Music to start his solo career?**
   - The article says he left after two albums. Roxy Music's first two albums were released in 1972 and 1973. Since he left after two albums, he likely left in 1973 or 1974. The exact year isn't given, but the article mentions he left after two albums, which were released in 1972 and 1973. So he left in 1973? Wait, the text says "after two albums" and he was in the band in 1972. The first album was 1972, the second in 1973, so he left after the second, so 1973. But the article says "left Roxy after two albums" so the year would be the year after the second album? The exact year might not be specified. Wait, the article says "In 1972, as an original member of the unsurpassed British art-rock band Roxy Music... He left Roxy after two albums..." So the two albums were 1972 and 1973. So he left after the second, so in 1973 or 1974? The exact year isn't given. Hmm, maybe it's 1973? The article doesn't state the exact year he left, so this might be N/A. Wait, the article says "He left Roxy after two albums and started a solo career that anticipated punk and new wave." Since the first two albums were 1972 and 1973, he left after the second, so probably 1973. But since the text doesn't explicitly say the year he left, maybe it's N/A. Wait, the article says "In 1972... He left Roxy after two albums" â€” so he was in the band in 1972, left after two albums. The exact year isn't given, so answer N/A.

4. **At what film festival did Rob Tannenbaum first see the documentary "Eno" and write a review praising its innovative use of generative storytelling?**
   - The article mentions "the film's New York premiere" and later talks about Sundance: "Sundance premiere of 'Eno' for IndieWire". So Rob Tannenbaum is the author, but the review by Siddhant Adlakha was at Sundance. The question is about Rob Tannenbaum's review, but the article doesn't mention him writing a review. The article is written by Rob Tannenbaum, but the review mentioned is by Siddhant Adlakha at Sundance. So the answer would be N/A because the question is about Rob Tannenbaum's review, but he's the article's author, not the reviewer. The article says Siddhant wrote the Sundance review. So the answer is N/A.

5. **In what year did Brian Eno first start experimenting with generative music, inspired by Steve Reich's opus "It's Gonna Rain"?**
   - The article says "In 1972, as an original member of Roxy Music... His interest in generative music was inspired by Steve Reich's opus 'It's Gonna Rain.'" So the inspiration was in 1972, but when did he start experimenting? The next mention is his 1978 album "Music for Airports." The article says "his interest... was inspired by Reich's work" but doesn't specify when he started experimenting. The answer might be N/A unless we infer from the 1978 album. Wait, the article says "For his 1978 album 'Music for Airports,' a founding document of ambient music, he recorded three simple melodies..." which was part of his generative work. So maybe he started experimenting around 1972, but the exact start year isn't given. The article says "his interest... was inspired by Reich's opus 'It's Gonna Rain' in 1972, so perhaps he started in 1972. But the question is asking the year he first started, which might be 1972. The article says "In 1972... his interest... was inspired by..." so the answer would be 1972.

6. **Given Eno's initial reluctance, what specific aspect of Hustwit's filmmaking background convinced Eno to participate in the documentary?**
   - The article mentions that Eno had contributed the soundtrack for Hustwit's "Rams" (2018). Hustwit showed Eno a generative remix of "Rams" using the Brain One software. When Eno saw it, he was excited. So the specific aspect was Hustwit's prior collaboration on "Rams" and the generative approach demonstrated through the remix of "Rams".

7. **Besides "Rams," which other documentary by Hustwit did Eno provide music for, leading to their initial collaboration?**
   - The article says "Eno had contributed the soundtrack for Hustwit's previous documentary, 'Rams' (2018)". It doesn't mention any other documentaries. The question asks for another one besides "Rams", so the answer would be N/A because there's no other mentioned. The article only refers to "Rams" as the previous collaboration.
