Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to make sure I only use the information from the given article and follow the strict instructions. Let me start with question 1.

Question 1 asks for the total amount raised by the "White Women: Answer the Call 2024" Zoom rally. Scanning through the article, there's a section that mentions this event. The article states that one meeting, "White Women: Answer the Call 2024," had over 100,000 attendees and mentions that the company (Zoom) had to raise the cap to 200,000 registrants. However, the exact amount raised isn't specified here. Wait, earlier in the article, there's a part about the "Win With Black Women" event which raised over $1.5 million. But the "White Women" event's fundraising total isn't mentioned. The article says "some of these rallies have been so popular that they strained Zoom's technical limits," but doesn't give a number for that specific event. So the answer here is N/A because the article doesn't state the amount raised for that particular rally.

Moving to question 2: the average duration of the pro-Harris Zoom rallies mentioned. The article mentions the "White Dudes for Harris" call lasted nearly three and a half hours. Another event, the "Win With Black Women" meeting, but the duration isn't specified. Other rallies like "White Women: Answer the Call 2024" don't mention their duration either. The only duration given is the three and a half hours for the "White Dudes" event. Since there's no data on the duration of other mentioned rallies, we can't calculate an average. So the answer should be N/A.

Question 3 asks for the name of the Republican campaign technologist who led Rubio's 2016 digital team and is hosting Trump's virtual fundraisers using Zoom. The article mentions Eric Wilson as a Republican campaign technologist who worked on Rubio's 2016 campaign. However, it says he commented on the effectiveness of Zoom rallies but there's no mention of him hosting virtual fundraisers for Trump. The article states that he hoped Republicans would start their own, but it doesn't say he's actually doing it. Since the question requires someone who is "hosting virtual fund-raisers for the Trump campaign using Zoom," and the text doesn't mention that, the answer is N/A.
