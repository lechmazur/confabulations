Okay, let's tackle these questions. First, I need to read through the article again to make sure I don't miss any details. 

Question 1: "What is the primary reason for the United States' increased oil and gas production, as mentioned in the text?" 

Looking through the article, I remember there's a part where it says, "The United States has called on the world to move more quickly to fight climate change, even as it produces and exports more oil and gas than ever." But the question is asking for the primary reason why the US is increasing production. The text doesn't explicitly state a reason. It just mentions that the US is producing more despite urging others to act on climate. Since there's no stated reason in the article, the answer should be N/A.

Question 2: "How has the United States' increased production of oil and gas impacted Azerbaijan's own plans to expand its fossil fuel industry?"

The article mentions that Europe is taking Azerbaijani gas as a replacement for Russian supplies. The US increasing its own production might not directly affect Azerbaijan's plans unless there's a mention of competition. The text says Europe is seeking more from Azerbaijan, so maybe the US's actions aren't directly impacting them. The article doesn't link the US production to Azerbaijan's expansion plans. Therefore, the answer is also N/A here.
