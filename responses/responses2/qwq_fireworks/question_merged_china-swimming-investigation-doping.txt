Okay, let's tackle the first question. The user is asking for the year the United States Congress first proposed the Rodchenkov Act.

Looking through the article, I need to find any mention of the Rodchenkov Act and its proposal date. The article states: "The federal investigation is being conducted, partly, by prosecutors and F.B.I. agents in Boston, according to two people briefed on the matter. The authorities have interviewed at least two witnesses, according to the two people. In a statement, WADA said it was 'disappointed to learn that the U.S. Department of Justice is now investigating' the positive tests, adding that it 'has not received any contact or request from U.S. law enforcement.' Similar to its posture since April when it was first forced to publicly defend its decision not to discipline the swimmers, WADA said it had done nothing wrong and that its decision was supported by scientific and legal experts. The escalation in the case represents perhaps the most significant investigation into a doping offense since the United States passed legislation known as the Rodchenkov Act in 2020, criminalizing doping in elite-level international sporting events wherever they take place. The investigation would be the first time U.S. authorities have focused on an international sports body under the act. WADA has been a critic of the new law since it was first proposed, arguing that criminalizing doping in one country would compromise WADA's efforts to maintain one set of rules for sports everywhere."

Here, the key sentence is: "WADA has been a critic of the new law since it was first proposed, arguing that criminalizing doping in one country would compromise WADA's efforts to maintain one set of rules for sports everywhere." The Rodchenkov Act was passed in 2020, but the question is about when it was first proposed. The text doesn't explicitly state the year it was proposed, only that WADA opposed it since the proposal phase. The article mentions the Act was passed in 2020, but the proposal could have been before that. However, the article doesn't give the exact year of proposal. Since the question is about the proposal year and the text only mentions the passage year (2020) and that WADA opposed it since it was proposed, but no specific year is provided for the proposal, the answer should be N/A.
