Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided. 

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks why the researchers focused on 1806-1838 for smallpox in California. The article mentions that the first reports of smallpox outbreaks in California were not until 1806 and 1838. So, the reason they chose that period is because those were the first recorded outbreaks there. That's straightforward.

2. **Question 2:** The second question is about how historical archives validated their models. The article says Blackmore is continuing her research by testing models against "real outbreaks on real ships" described in historical archives. So, they used the archives to compare their models with actual historical data.

3. **Question 3:** The measles epidemic on HMS Dido in 1874 killed 20,000 in Fiji, which was up to a quarter of the population. The mortality rate here is 20,000 deaths out of a quarter of the population. Wait, the text says "up to one-fourth of the population" died. So the mortality rate among the population affected by the epidemic would be 25%, but the question asks for the mortality rate of the epidemic itself. Since it's stated that 20,000 died and that's up to a quarter, the mortality rate is 25% of the population. But maybe the question is about the rate among those infected? The article doesn't specify how many were infected versus the total population. It just says 20,000 deaths out of up to a quarter of the population. Hmm, perhaps the answer is 25% as the mortality rate relative to the total population. The question says "mortality rate of the measles epidemic," so maybe that's it. But need to check exact wording.

4. **Question 4:** Simon Levin called a model "beautiful," not "elegant." Wait, the article says Simon Levin, a mathematical ecologist at Princeton, called the model "beautiful." The question says "elegant," but the text says "beautiful." So discrepancy here. Since the question is about the exact term, the answer would be "N/A" because the term used was "beautiful," not "elegant." Unless it's a typo. But according to the article, it's "beautiful." So the answer is N/A.

5. **Question 5:** The average days for measles to burn out. The article states that the infectious period for measles is about nine days. So if the voyage took longer than that, the disease might die out. But the question is about how many days it took on average for measles to burn out on a typical 18th-century transatlantic voyage. The article says "infectious period of about nine days," so maybe the burnout period is around that. But the question is about the voyage duration versus the infectious period. The article says that in the days of sailing ships, diseases burned out before reaching shore. But the exact average days for the burnout isn't given. Wait, maybe the answer is the infectious period's duration, which is 9 days. The question might be asking for that. The article says "the infectious period is about nine days," so perhaps the answer is 9 days. But need to confirm.

6. **Question 6:** The year steamships first arrived in San Francisco. The article mentions steamships traveling to San Francisco from 1850 to 1852 during the Gold Rush. So the first arrival would be 1850. The exact start is mentioned as 1850, so the answer is 1850.

7. **Question 7:** Elizabeth Blackmore's master's degree university. The article states she is a doctoral student at Yale, and that she was working on her master's when they thought of the idea. It doesn't explicitly say where her master's was from. Wait, the article says "Ms. Blackmore, a doctoral student at Yale" and that "she was working on her master's degree" when the idea came up. But it doesn't specify the university for the master's. So this would be N/A unless it's implied to be Yale. But usually, doctoral students can have their master's from the same or another place. Since the article doesn't specify, the answer is N/A.
