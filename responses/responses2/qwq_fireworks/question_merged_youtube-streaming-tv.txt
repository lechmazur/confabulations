Okay, let me tackle these questions one by one. 

Starting with question 1: "How many subscribers does Michelle Khare's YouTube channel have?" The article mentions Michelle Khare's videos but I need to find the exact number. Let me scan through the text again. Oh here it is: "Rhett McLaughlin and Link Neal started uploading comedy videos to the platform in 2006. Now their channels have a combined 31 million subscribers." Wait, but that's about Rhett and Link, not Michelle. The part about Michelle says, "Half of Michelle Khare's viewers watch her videos of high-stakes challenges on TVs." There's no mention of her subscriber count. So the answer here would be N/A because the article doesn't provide that number for her.

Question 2: "What was the viewership share of YouTube on TVs in May according to Nielsen data?" The article states, "In June, its share ballooned to 9.9 percent, setting a record for any streaming platform." Wait, the question is about May. Let me check again. The Nielsen data mentioned for May is about the demographic under 34: "In May, roughly 48 percent of its TV viewership was from people under the age of 34." But the specific share for May isn't given. The June figure is 9.9%, but the question asks for May. Since there's no May viewership share provided, the answer is N/A.

Question 3: "Which YouTube original series starring PewDiePie became a major hit?" The text says, "the platform started releasing comedies, dramas and a horror-themed reality show, 'Scare PewDiePie,' which starred one of its biggest personalities. Within a few years, the content library grew to include a Taylor Swift concert and a Justin Bieber docuseries. But only one show became a hit: 'Cobra Kai,' which was a sequel to the 'Karate Kid' films." So 'Scare PewDiePie' was made but the hit was 'Cobra Kai.' The question specifies a series starring PewDiePie. 'Cobra Kai' isn't mentioned as starring him. The show that had PewDiePie was 'Scare PewDiePie,' but it's noted that only 'Cobra Kai' was a hit. Wait, but the question is asking which one starring PewDiePie became a hit. The article says that 'Scare PewDiePie' was the one with PewDiePie, but it doesn't say it was a hit. The hit was 'Cobra Kai,' which might not star him. So maybe the answer is N/A because the hit show wasn't the one with PewDiePie. Wait, the article says "But only one show became a hit: 'Cobra Kai'..." so even if that's the only hit, it's not the one with PewDiePie. Therefore, the answer would be N/A because the question asks for the series with PewDiePie that was a hit, but the hit wasn't that one. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick because the article doesn't mention any other hit with PewDiePie. So answer is N/A.

Question 4: "What is the name of the research firm that found that YouTube's attention rates are higher than those of Amazon Prime Video among viewers aged 18-34?" The article mentions TVision as the research firm. The text says, "TVision tracks 5,000 households... YouTube tends to rank 'rock bottom in terms of attention every year' among major streaming platforms, said Yan Liu, TVision's chief executive. (Amazon Prime Video ranked first last year.)" Wait, so according to TVision, YouTube's attention rates are lower than Amazon's. The question is phrased as "higher than those of Amazon," but the article states the opposite. Since the question's premise might be incorrect, but the question is asking for the firm's name regardless. The firm is TVision. So the answer is TVision. The question's statement about being higher might be a mistake, but the answer is still TVision as the firm that provided the data, even if the comparison is the other way around. The question is asking for the name of the firm, not whether the comparison is correct. So the answer is TVision.

Question 5: "In what year did YouTube first introduce its 'Shorts' feature, which allows creators to upload vertical videos similar to those found on TikTok?" The article states, "TikTok-style vertical videos called Shorts." But when were they introduced? The article says, "In the second quarter, YouTube's ad sales climbed 13 percent..." but that's recent. Looking for the exact year: "Over the years, YouTube creator content graduated from the low-budget amateur videos of the early days. ... More than five million people tuned in..." Not seeing the year here. The article mentions "Cocomelon" as a children's show on YouTube, but not the Shorts launch date. The article's timeline includes 2022 when they canceled Originals. The Shorts are mentioned but the introduction year isn't provided. So the answer is N/A.
