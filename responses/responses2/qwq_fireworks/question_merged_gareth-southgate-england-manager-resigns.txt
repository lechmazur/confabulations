Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. 

First question: What percentage of the English public wanted Southgate to become prime minister at the height of his popularity?

Looking through the article, there's a part that says, "polling found that a substantial portion of the population wanted him to be prime minister." The problem is, the exact percentage isn't mentioned. "Substantial portion" is vague, so I can't give a specific number. The instructions say to answer with N/A if the exact figure isn't provided. So the answer here has to be N/A.

Second question: How many years had it been since England's men's soccer team had reached the finals or semi-finals of a major tournament before Southgate became manager?

The article mentions that under Southgate, England reached the semifinal of the 2018 World Cup and the finals of Euro 2020 and 2024. It also states, "Southgate had taken a country that as recently as 2016 was losing to Iceland into a regular presence in finals and semifinals." So before Southgate became manager in 2016, the last time they reached such stages was... Well, the article doesn't explicitly say. Wait, the first sentence says Southgate's eight years made him the most successful in decades. But the key part is that in 2016 they lost to Iceland, implying they weren't in the semifinals or finals. The article doesn't mention any previous tournaments before Southgate's tenure where they reached those stages. Maybe the last time was Alf Ramsey's 1966 World Cup win, but that's not mentioned here. The text doesn't provide the exact number of years. So this also might be N/A. Wait, the article says "England did not reach finals on foreign soil; Southgate did." So before him, they hadn't reached a final away. But how long ago was the last time they made it to a semifinal or final before 2018? The article doesn't give the exact years. So without a specific number, the answer should be N/A again.

Wait, but maybe there's another part. The article says "Under his leadership, England reached the semifinal of the 2018 World Cup and the final of the European Championship in both 2021 and 2024, making him the most consistently successful England men's manager since Alf Ramsey, who delivered the country's first and only World Cup in 1966." So before Southgate, the last success was 1966? So from 1966 to 2018, that's 52 years. But the question is asking how many years before Southgate became manager (which started in 2016) had it been since they reached those stages. So from 1966 to 2016 would be 50 years. But the article doesn't explicitly state that. It just says Ramsey in 1966 was the last successful one. So maybe the time between 1966 and Southgate's start in 2016 is 50 years. But the question is phrased as "before Southgate became manager," so the last time before his tenure. Since Ramsey's 1966 was the last time they won a major tournament, but maybe they reached semifinals or finals after that? The article doesn't mention any. It says "England did not win penalty shootouts; Southgate did. England did not win semifinals; Southgate did. England did not reach finals on foreign soil; Southgate did." So prior to him, they didn't reach those stages. So the last time would have been before his management, which would be 1966. So from 1966 to 2016 is 50 years. But the article doesn't state that explicitly. Since the question is asking how many years had it been before Southgate became manager, and the article doesn't give a specific number, the answer would be N/A. Because the text doesn't provide the exact number of years, just mentions that Ramsey's 1966 was the last success, but the time span isn't calculated here. So the answer should be N/A.
