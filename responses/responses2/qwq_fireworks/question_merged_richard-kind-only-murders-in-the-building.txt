Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. 

First question: What was the first television series Richard Kind appeared in after moving to Los Angeles? The article mentions that after moving to LA in his early 30s, he booked series like "Bennett Brothers" where he met Clooney, and "Carol & Company" with Carol Burnett. The key here is "first" so I need to see which one came first. The text says "including the pilot 'Bennett Brothers,' where he met Clooney, and the Carol Burnett anthology 'Carol & Company'." Since it lists "Bennett Brothers" first, maybe that's the first one. But the question is about the first after moving. The article doesn't explicitly state the order, but since "Bennett Brothers" is mentioned first, perhaps that's considered the first. So answer would be "Bennett Brothers".

Second question: How old was Richard Kind when he landed his first major television role? The article says he moved to LA in his early 30s. His first roles after moving include "Bennett Brothers" and "Carol & Company". Since he was in his early 30s when he moved, and those were his first roles there, his age would be in the early 30s. But exact age? The article doesn't give his birth year, but maybe we can calculate. Wait, the article says he is 67 in the text ("Kind, 67"). Assuming the article is current, but we don't know the year. However, the question is about when he landed his first major TV role. The text says he was in his early 30s when he moved, and those were his first roles. Since it's not specific, maybe the answer is "early 30s", but the instructions say to answer with exact numbers if possible. Since the exact age isn't given, maybe "N/A". Wait, but the question is "how old was he"â€”if the text says he was in his early 30s when he moved and that's when he got those roles, then the answer would be "early 30s". But the instructions say if the exact year or number isn't there, use N/A. Since it's a range, maybe N/A? Hmm, the instructions mention that if the question asks for a specific year like "early 1980s" and the text doesn't have that, then N/A. But here, the question is about age, not a year. The text says he was in his early 30s when he moved, so his age at that time would be in the early 30s, but not an exact number. Since the question asks for his age, and the article only provides a range, maybe "N/A" because the exact age isn't specified. Alternatively, maybe the first major role was "Bennett Brothers" and since that was when he was in his early 30s, but without an exact number, the answer would be "N/A".

Third question: At what age did Richard Kind's teacher, Frank Galati, predict he would win his first major award for acting? The article says Galati told him he wouldn't work for 10 years if he entered the business, and predicted he'd come into his own around 32 or 33. The question is about winning an award. However, the teacher's prediction was about coming into his own in his career, not specifically winning an award. The question asks for the age when he would win his first major award. Since the text doesn't mention an award, just coming into his own, which might not equate to winning an award, the answer would be "N/A". Because the teacher's prediction was about career timing, not an award.
