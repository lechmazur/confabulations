Okay, let's tackle these questions. First, I need to look at the first question: How much did Lark Hotels spend on renovating the Downtowner Motel in Saratoga Springs?

I'll go back to the article. The article mentions Lark Hotels bought the Downtowner Motel in 2018 for $4.25 million. But the question is about the renovation cost. The article says they turned it into the Spa City Motor Lodge. Let me check the details. There's a part where Rob Blood from Lark Hotels mentions that business was tepid at first until they did the renovation. However, the exact amount spent on renovation isn't specified. The article mentions that the Nomada Group spent $3 million on the Skyview, but that's a different motel. For Lark Hotels, the purchase price is given, but renovation costs aren't stated. So the answer here would be N/A because the text doesn't provide the renovation cost, only the purchase price.

Now the second question: What type of unique bed did Lisa Lennox install in every room of the Interstate Inn?

Looking at the section about Lisa Lennox, the article states that one room has a water bed and a black velvet headboard, and she also found a Magic Fingers bed. However, it specifies "one room" has those, not every room. The question asks if she installed that bed in every room. Since the text says "one room" had those features, the answer would be N/A because it's not every room. The Magic Fingers bed is mentioned as something she found, but it's not stated that every room has it. So the answer here is also N/A.
