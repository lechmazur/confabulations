merged_Who Are the Korean Cheerleaders Flooding TikTok_ - The New York Times.txt
Okay, let's see. The question is asking, aside from Lee Ju-Eun, which other Kia Tigers cheerleader is mentioned by name in the article?

I need to look through the article for any other names of cheerleaders. The article mentions Lee Ju-Eun as one of the cheerleaders, especially since she's the breakout star. Let me scan the text again.

Looking at the section about Lee Ju-Eun: "If there's one breakout star, it's Lee Ju-Eun..." Then later, the article mentions Ms. Lee, but that's probably her. The other names mentioned are people like Lee Si-Young (the president of Apex Communications), Dan Kurtz, Deborah Park, Melissa Minh. Wait, Melissa Minh is a model and influencer in Britain who imitated the dance, but she's not a Kia Tigers cheerleader. The cheerleaders themselvesâ€”does the article mention any other names besides Lee Ju-Eun?

The article also quotes Mr. Lee (Lee Si-Young) who is the founder, not a cheerleader. The cheerleaders are referred to as a squad, but I don't see another name. Let me check again. The only other possible mention is in the captions: "A post shared by KIA taigeojeu (@always_kia_tigers)" and another by Miss Missy (@melissaminh_), but those are handles, not real names. The article mentions Ms. Lee again when talking about Lee Ju-Eun: "Ms. Lee refreshes her makeup..." which refers to Lee Ju-Eun. 

So, the answer should be N/A because no other cheerleader's name is provided besides Lee Ju-Eun.
