Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. 

First question: How many times did Vic Seixas defeat Ken Rosewall and Lew Hoad in Davis Cup matches?

Looking at the article, there's a part that says he "teamed with Trabert to defeat Ken Rosewall and Lew Hoad to end Australia's four-year Davis Cup reign in 1954." So that's one specific instance where they defeated both players in a single match. The question asks how many times, so the answer is 1. 

Second question: How many consecutive U.S. championship tournaments did Seixas play between 1940 and 1969?

The article states he played in 28 U.S. championship tournaments at Forest Hills between 1940 and 1969, missing only when he was in the military during WWII. The key here is "consecutive." Since he missed some years due to the war, they aren't all consecutive. The question is about consecutive tournaments. The article doesn't specify the exact number of consecutive years, only the total number of tournaments. So the answer is N/A because we can't determine consecutive years from the given info.

Third question: Who did Seixas partner with to win his last mixed doubles Grand Slam title?

The article mentions he won eight mixed doubles titles, seven with Doris Hart and one with Shirley Fry. The last one would be with Shirley Fry since that's the only one mentioned after Doris Hart's seven. So the answer is Shirley Fry.

Fourth question: Who was Vic Seixas's doubles partner when he won the 1953 Wimbledon men's doubles championship?

Looking at the men's doubles info: "He also won a men's doubles championship with Mervyn Rose and four more with Tony Trabert." The 1953 Wimbledon singles win is mentioned, but the doubles partners are listed as Mervyn Rose for one and Trabert for four. Since the 1953 Wimbledon is his singles title, the question is about the men's doubles. The article doesn't specify the year for the Mervyn Rose partnership. Wait, the Wimbledon men's doubles win in 1953? Wait, the article says he won his first men's singles at Wimbledon in 1953. The doubles partners are mentioned as Mervyn Rose once and Trabert four times. Since the question is about the 1953 Wimbledon men's doubles, but the article doesn't link the year to the partner. The article says he won five men's doubles: one with Rose, four with Trabert. So unless the 1953 Wimbledon doubles is the one with Rose, but the article doesn't say. Wait, maybe the Wimbledon men's doubles in 1953 is part of his five? The article doesn't specify the exact year for the doubles. Therefore, since the question asks specifically for the 1953 Wimbledon men's doubles partner, but the text doesn't mention the year of the doubles wins, only that he won with Mervyn Rose once and Trabert four times. Since the question is about the 1953 Wimbledon men's doubles, but the article only mentions his singles win in 1953. Therefore, the answer is N/A because the partner for that specific year isn't stated.
