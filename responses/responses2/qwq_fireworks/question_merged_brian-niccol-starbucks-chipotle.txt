Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. I need to make sure I only use the information from the provided article and answer exactly as per the instructions. Let me start with each question and check the article for the answers.

1. **Question 1:** What was the primary reason for Brian Niccol's departure from Chipotle to join Starbucks, as mentioned in the text?  
   The article says Starbucks "poached" him and mentions leadership change due to weak sales and falling stock. But the text doesn't explicitly state his reason for leaving Chipotle. So maybe N/A?

Wait, the article says "Abrupt leadership change... Brian Niccol... after months of weak sales...". The departure reason isn't stated, just that Starbucks hired him. So the primary reason isn't mentioned, so answer N/A.

2. **Question 2:** Main reason for decline in US and China sales?  
   The article says Starbucks is "grappling with weakening results in some of its biggest markets, particularly the United States and China." The text doesn't specify the exact reasons for the decline in those regions. So N/A?

3. **Question 3:** Key elements of the labor contract framework under Narasimhan?  
   The text states under Narasimhan, Starbucks made progress toward bargaining a framework for a labor contract with union stores, aiming to wrap up by end of the year. The key elements aren't listed, just the progress. So N/A.

4. **Question 4:** Total amount Chipotle paid in settlements during Niccol's tenure?  
   The article mentions a $240,000 settlement for the Augusta, Maine case. So that's the total mentioned. Answer is $240,000.

5. **Question 5:** Primary reason for replacing Narasimhan with Niccol?  
   The text says the leadership change was due to "months of weak sales at the coffee giant and a falling stock price." So the primary reason is weak sales and falling stock.

6. **Question 6:** Current chairman and tenure under Schultz?  
   The article says Schultz is chairman emeritus, not chairman. The current chairman isn't named. So chairman is N/A, and tenure can't be answered. Answer N/A for both parts.

7. **Question 7:** Investment bank that advised Starbucks on Niccol's appointment?  
   Sharon Zackfia works at William Blair. The article says she's an analyst there. The question asks which bank advised Starbucks. The text doesn't say they advised, just that she commented. So N/A unless the bank's advice is mentioned. Since it's her quote, maybe the bank isn't stated as advising Starbucks. So N/A.
