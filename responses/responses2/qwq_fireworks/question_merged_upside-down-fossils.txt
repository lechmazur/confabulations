Okay, let's tackle the first question. The user is asking how many different species of jellyfish the paleontologists initially classified the Essexella fossils as before realizing they were anemones.

Looking at the article, it mentions that the fossils were first described as a jellyfish named Essexella asherae. The text says, "Paleontologists decided that they were odd jellyfish named Essexella asherae." So they classified them as one species of jellyfish. The question is asking for the number of different species they initially thought it was. Since they named it as one specific species, the answer should be 1. There's no mention of multiple jellyfish species here. The key point is that they were considered a single species of jellyfish before the reclassification. So the answer is 1.
