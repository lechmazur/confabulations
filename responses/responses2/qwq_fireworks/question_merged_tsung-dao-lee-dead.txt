Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. 

First question: The user is asking for the year Dr. Lee and Dr. Yang first met at the University of Chicago. Let me check the article. The article mentions that Dr. Lee was a doctoral student at the University of Chicago, and that he and Dr. Yang had known each other from graduate school there. However, the exact year they met isn't specified. Wait, there's a part where it says Dr. Lee started at Chicago in 1946. Dr. Yang was at the Institute for Advanced Study later, but their meeting at Chicago is mentioned as when they were graduate students. Since Lee was at Chicago from 1946 to 1950 (he got his PhD in 1950), and Yang was also there earlier? Wait, the article says that Yang was a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton when Lee contacted him. The text states that Lee and Yang had known each other as graduate students at Chicago, but the exact year isn't given. Since the question is about when they first met at the University of Chicago, the article doesn't state the specific year. So the answer would be N/A.

Second question: How many years did Lee work at the Institute for Advanced Study before Columbia? The article says after getting his PhD in 1950, he worked at Yerkes Observatory, Berkeley, and the Institute for Advanced Study. Then he was hired by Columbia. Wait, the order is: after PhD, he worked at Yerkes (1946? Wait no, he was at Chicago until 1950. Wait, after 1950, he worked at Yerkes, then Berkeley, then the Institute for Advanced Study. The timeline is: "Over the next three years, he worked at Yerkes Observatory in Williams Bay, Wis., as a guest lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, and at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton." So three years total across those three places. The question is specifically about the time at the Institute for Advanced Study. The article doesn't specify how long he was at each of those three places. Since it's grouped together as "over the next three years" split among the three, we can't know exactly how much time he spent at the Institute for Advanced Study before Columbia. Hence, the answer is N/A.

Third question: The award Dr. Lee received in 1962 besides the Nobel. The article mentions he became a U.S. citizen in 1962. The awards listed are the Nobel, the Albert Einstein Award in Science, and a minor planet named after him. The article says "Dr. Lee received many awards aside from the Nobel, including the Albert Einstein Award in Science..." but doesn't mention the year he got the Einstein Award. The question is about an award received in 1962. Since the only mention of 1962 is his citizenship, there's no info on an award from that year. So the answer is N/A.
