Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one using the article provided.

1. **Question 1:** The first question asks for the name of the tech billionaire who invited Frida and Jess to his private island in "Blink Twice." Looking at the article's section on "Blink Twice," it mentions that the tech billionaire is played by Channing Tatum. However, the article doesn't specify the character's name, only the actor. Since the question asks for the name of the character, not the actor, this might be N/A. Wait, the article says "a tech billionaire (Channing Tatum)" so the name in parentheses is the actor. The character's name isn't given. So the answer should be N/A because the tech billionaire's name isn't provided, only the actor.

2. **Question 2:** In "Between the Temples," Ben is a cantor. The article states he's a cantor at a synagogue. A cantor typically leads prayers and might sing or play an instrument like a piano or guitar. The review doesn't explicitly mention an instrument. The text says "former music teacher" but doesn't specify the instrument. So maybe the answer is N/A? Wait, the question is about the instrument he plays as a cantor. The article doesn't mention any specific instrument, so N/A.

3. **Question 3:** The review of "Shortcomings" (assuming that's the correct title from the list; looking at the list, "Shortcomings" isn't there. Wait, the reviews listed are "Between the Temples," "Blink Twice," "Constantine," "Close Your Eyes," "The Killer's Shadows" (remake), "Incoming," "The Inspection," "Mountains," "When Chloe Visits Japan" (maybe "When Chloe..."), and "Diner." The question mentions "Shortcomings" but that's not in the articles. Wait, maybe a typo? Let me check again. The reviews are:

Looking through the articles again: The 9th entry is "When Chloe (Carla Juri), a recent widow..." titled "When Chloe Visits Japan" perhaps? The review says "Bradley Rust Gray." The question refers to "Shortcomings" but that's not listed. Wait, maybe "Close Your Eyes" is the one by Victor Erice? Or perhaps the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe "The Inspection" is the one with gentrification? Wait, the question about Carla Juri's performance is in the 9th entry: "When Chloe visits Japan," the review mentions Carla Juri's performance. The question asks what award nomination she deserves. The article says "subtly heartbreaking performance" but doesn't mention any award nominations. So the answer would be N/A because the review doesn't suggest an award.

4. **Question 4:** Two films are noted as remakes. The article mentions "The Killer's Shadows" as a remake of John Woo's 1989 film, and "Constantine" from 2005 is referenced but that's not a remake here. Wait, looking at the reviews, the fifth entry is "The Killer's Shadows" (remake of 1989's same name). The third entry is "Constantine" as part of the 1994 adaptation, but that's not a remake. The fourth entry is Victor Erice's "Close Your Eyes," which isn't a remake. So only "The Killer's Shadows" is a remake. Wait, the question says two films are noted as remakes. Let me check again. Wait, the third entry mentions an adaptation of a comic book series, trying to escape the 1994 film. That might be a remake? Or maybe the third entry is "Constantine" but no, the third entry is "The Crow" perhaps? Wait the third entry says "new adaptation of the comic book series about a grief-stricken, supernatural vigilante tries to escape the shadow cast by the cult-classic film adaptation from 1994." The title here isn't given, but it's likely "The Crow." So two remakes: "The Killer's Shadows" (John Woo's remake) and the new "The Crow" adaptation. The question asks which one is identified as being truer to the original. The review of "The Killer's Shadows" says "this may be a remake, but it's not a retread," implying it's better. So the answer would be "The Killer's Shadows."

5. **Question 5:** "The Inspection" deals with gentrification in Miami's Little Haiti. The review says the characters move between English and Haitian Creole. The question is how this contributes to the message about gentrification. The article states: "it captures an area of Miami that is rarely seen onscreen." The language use might reflect cultural identity amid gentrification. The review says "as a portrait of intergenerational tensions in an immigrant family, it is poignant." So the languages highlight cultural heritage vs. gentrification pressures. The exact phrasing in the review says "the characters move fluidly between English and Haitian Creole" and it's a poignant portrait of intergenerational tensions. The answer would be that it highlights cultural identity and immigrant experiences, but the question is specifically about how it contributes to the message about gentrification. The review says it "captures an area rarely seen," so maybe the languages emphasize the cultural presence resisting gentrification. The exact answer from the text: "it captures an area of Miami that is rarely seen onscreen." So the languages contribute by illustrating the community's cultural identity, which is part of the gentrification conflict. The answer is probably that the languages reflect the immigrant community's cultural identity amidst gentrification. The exact wording in the article: "As a drama... it is poignant, and it captures an area of Miami that is rarely seen onscreen." The languages are part of that cultural portrayal. So the answer would be that it emphasizes the immigrant community's cultural heritage, underscoring their struggle against gentrification. But the question asks how the use of languages contributes to the message about gentrification. The article's exact statement is that the film "captures an area... rarely seen," so the languages help portray the community's identity, which is part of the gentrification context. So the answer would be that the languages highlight the cultural identity of the community facing gentrification.
