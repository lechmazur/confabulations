Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. 

First question: How did the Netflix algorithm specifically identify "Your Honor" as a potential hit, according to the article?

Looking through the article, the text mentions that the Netflix algorithm has a history of boosting shows like "Breaking Bad," "Schitt's Creek," "You," and "Suits." However, the article doesn't explain the specific method the algorithm used for "Your Honor." It just states that the "Netflix effect" led to its popularity. Since there's no detail on how the algorithm specifically picked it, the answer is N/A.

Second question: Which other show, besides "Your Honor," was mentioned as having been revived for a new season due to its success on Netflix?

The article says that "Evil" and "Your Honor" might be resurrected because of their new audiences on Netflix. However, it only mentions that CBS and Netflix are discussing a revival for "Your Honor." For "Evil," the article notes it ended next month and was on Netflix, but there's no mention of it being revived. The Kings express hope, but no confirmation. So no other show is explicitly stated as revived, so N/A.

Third question: How many consecutive weeks did "Your Honor" reach 2 billion minutes of viewing time on Netflix?

The article states that "Your Honor" hit the billion-minute mark for three consecutive weeks and is on track for a fourth and possibly fifth. The exact number mentioned is three, and the fourth is preliminary. The question asks how many it "reached," which is three. The 2 billion might be a typo since the article says "billion," not 2 billion. But even if it's a typo, the answer is three weeks.
