Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. 

First question: "What is the name of the researcher who worked with Dr. Liu to develop the base editing system, and who is now leading the effort to apply this technology to human patients with progeria?"

Looking through the article, I need to find who developed the base editing system with Dr. Liu and is now leading the effort. The article mentions David Liu's lab developed the base editing. It says Nicole Gaudelli was a postdoc in his lab and helped create the enzyme. Then there's Luke Koblan, a grad student who tested it on progeria cells. But the current effort to apply it to humans is led by whom? The article mentions Dr. Collins and others in the group working towards clinical trials. The key sentence is: "The project... is being worked on by a small group including Dr. Francis Collins." However, the question asks specifically about the researcher who worked with Liu on developing the system. Since Nicole Gaudelli worked on the enzyme in Liu's lab and Luke Koblan tested it, but the leader now might be Dr. Collins or someone else. Wait, the article states that Dr. Liu is a co-founder of companies but the team now includes Dr. Collins. The question mentions "leading the effort to apply this technology to human patients"—the article says the group including Collins is moving towards clinical trials. But the question specifies the researcher who worked with Liu. The answer might be Dr. Collins, but the article doesn't explicitly state he worked with Liu on the system's development. Wait, looking back, the team now includes Collins, but the developer was Liu's group. The question might be a trick here. The article says the current effort is led by the group including Collins, but the researcher who worked with Liu on the system's development would be Nicole Gaudelli or Luke Koblan. However, the question says "now leading the effort"—so maybe Dr. Collins? The article says "the team meets on Zoom every Monday... their goal is to obtain FDA permission." The main leaders mentioned are Dr. Collins and others. But the question specifies the researcher who worked with Liu. Since Nicole Gaudelli was part of Liu's lab, but now leading the clinical effort? The article doesn't explicitly say she's leading it now. The answer might be N/A because the article doesn't name a specific person leading the current effort who also worked with Liu on development. Wait, the article mentions Dr. Collins and the group, but the question wants the researcher who worked with Liu. Alternatively, maybe Dr. Liu himself is involved? The article says Dr. Liu's group developed it, but he's a co-founder of companies for common diseases, not progeria. The article states that Dr. Liu presented at NIH, and Dr. Collins got excited. The current team includes Collins and Gordon. The answer might be N/A because there's no explicit mention of who is leading the human application from Liu's team. Hmm, tricky.

Second question: "What is the expected timeline for the FDA to approve the base editing system for use in human patients with progeria, assuming the clinical trial is successful?"

The article says the goal is to start a clinical trial in two years or less. The question is about FDA approval timeline after a successful trial. The article doesn't mention the timeline for approval after the trial, only the start of the trial. So the answer would be N/A because the text doesn't provide the expected timeline post-trial. The article says "want to start this trial in two years or less," but that's the trial start, not approval after success.
