Okay, let's tackle the first question. The user is asking how many Japanese companies are part of the new packaging research consortium in California.

Looking at the article, there's a section that mentions Resonac, a Tokyo-based company, forming a consortium with nine other companies. The exact sentence says: "Resonac, a company based in Tokyo, announced on Monday a new consortium with nine other Japanese and U.S. companies to focus on packaging research and development in a new facility that will be built in Union City, Calif."

So the consortium includes Resonac plus nine others, which are a mix of Japanese and U.S. companies. The question specifically asks for the number of Japanese companies. However, the article doesn't specify how many of those nine are Japanese. It just says nine other companies from Japan and the U.S. So the total Japanese companies would be Resonac plus however many of the nine are Japanese, but we can't determine the exact number from the text. The article doesn't break down the nine into Japanese and U.S. numbers. Therefore, the answer isn't provided, so the answer should be N/A.
