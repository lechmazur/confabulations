Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. Starting with the first question: "What was the primary reason Richard Brauer gave for supporting the sale of the paintings?" Wait, actually, I need to check the article again because I remember Brauer was opposing the sale. Let me look through the text. 

Looking at the section where Richard Brauer is mentioned, the article states that he filed a motion to intervene and is fighting the sale. He argues that the university's reason (dorm renovations) isn't equivalent to the original purpose of exposing students to the artwork. The quote from Brauer says, "The masterpiece painting is a great painting, and it's a great teacher. We'd lose three great teachers." So his opposition is because he believes the paintings are educational tools for students. Therefore, the question asks for his reason for supporting the sale, but he's actually opposing it. Since the question is about supporting the sale and he's against it, the answer would be N/A because he doesn't support the sale. Wait, the question might have a typo, but according to the given text, Brauer is against the sale, so the primary reason he gave for supporting it doesn't exist. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

Now the second question: "What is the name of the law firm representing Valparaiso University in the court case, and what is their argument regarding the sale of the paintings?" The article mentions that the boutique appraisal and art advisory firm Sterling Teel Capital argued that the O'Keeffe isn't conservative because it's abstract. However, the law firm representing the university isn't explicitly named. The text says Valparaiso's petition is supported by Sterling Teel Capital, but that's an appraisal firm, not a law firm. The attorney general's office is involved but represents the state. The article doesn't name the law firm representing the university. Therefore, the first part of the question can't be answered, so the answer would be N/A for the law firm's name. The argument part is that the paintings aren't conservative, so that part can be answered. But since the question combines both parts with "and," if either part is missing, the whole answer might be N/A. Wait, the question asks for the name of the law firm and their argument. Since the law firm's name isn't provided, the first part is N/A, so the entire answer would be N/A. Alternatively, maybe the argument is from the university's petition, but the law firm isn't named. The article doesn't mention the law firm's name, so the answer for the first part is N/A. Therefore, the entire question's answer is N/A. Wait, but maybe the argument is the university's argument, not the law firm's. Since the question is about the law firm's argument, but the law firm isn't named, both parts can't be answered. Therefore, the answer is N/A. Alternatively, perhaps the article says the university's petition is the argument. The question might be misphrased, but according to the instructions, if the firm's name isn't there, then the answer is N/A. 

Wait, re-reading the article: "In a filing alongside the university's petition, the boutique appraisal and art advisory firm Sterling Teel Capital argues..." So Sterling Teel is an appraisal firm, not a law firm. The actual law firm representing Valparaiso isn't mentioned. Therefore, the law firm's name isn't provided, so the first part is N/A. The argument part is the university's argument (that the paintings are not conservative), but the question asks for the law firm's argument, which isn't specified. Therefore, the entire answer would be N/A. Alternatively, maybe the university's argument is considered the law firm's, but since the firm isn't named, the answer is N/A. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me check the instructions again. The user says to answer based solely on the article. The law firm's name isn't mentioned anywhere. The article mentions the university's petition and the arguments in it, but the law firm representing them isn't named. Therefore, the first part is N/A. The second part, their argument, is that the paintings are not conservative because they are modernist and abstract. But since the question asks for the law firm's argument, but the firm isn't named, perhaps the answer is only the argument part, but the question combines both parts with "and", so the entire answer is N/A. Alternatively, maybe the argument is the university's, but the question specifies the law firm's. Since the law firm isn't named, the answer is N/A. 

So for question 2, the answer would be N/A because the law firm's name isn't provided in the text. The argument part is present, but since the question asks for the firm's name and their argument, and the name isn't there, the whole answer is N/A. 

Wait, the article might have mentioned the law firm elsewhere. Let me search again. The article says: "The Indiana attorney general's office, which represents the state in charitable trust litigation, declined to object to the petition." That's the attorney general's office. The university's representation by a law firm isn't named. So yes, the answer is N/A for the first part, so the entire question's answer is N/A. 

So final answers:

1. N/A (since Brauer opposed the sale, so he didn't give a reason to support it)

2. N/A (law firm's name isn't provided)
