Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. 

First question: How did the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association respond to the 1996 findings on drug exposure to heat and humidity?

Looking back at the article, there's a section that mentions the 1996 study by United States Pharmacopeia. The task force that looked at the results included representatives from the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association. The article states that the task force decided against acting on the findings. So the association was part of the group that chose not to take action. The answer should reflect that.

Second question: How many states have implemented regulations requiring mail-order pharmacies to monitor the temperatures inside packages during transportation?

The article discusses Oklahoma's attempt to create rules. The executive director, Marty Lee Hendrick, tried to pass a rule but faced opposition, and the rule was abandoned. It also mentions that other states have "no appetite" for stronger rules. There's no mention of any states actually implementing such regulations. So the answer here would be N/A since the text doesn't specify any states that have enacted such laws.
