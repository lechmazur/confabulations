Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided.

First question: Besides zucchini, what other vegetable does Melissa Clark suggest is currently abundant in August? The article mentions "an absolute abbondanza of zucchini" but doesn't list another vegetable as being abundant. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The article talks about seasonal veggies like corn and green beans in the Caribbean fish tea. But does it say they're abundant in August? The first part specifically mentions zucchini as August's abundant veg, then later mentions corn and green beans as ingredients in a recipe, but not as being in season or abundant. So the answer here would be N/A because the text only explicitly states zucchini as abundant. Wait, the user might think of avocado? But the avocado part says they aren't necessarily a summer veg, but there's something summery about them. So maybe not. So first question answer is N/A.

Second question: What specific type of fish does Ashley Lonsdale recommend using in her Caribbean fish tea recipe? The article says "either whole fish or fillets" but doesn't specify a type. So the answer is N/A because no specific fish name is given, just the option of whole vs. fillets.

Third question: The article mentions Melissa Clark's recipe for peach cobbler. What other fruit filling does she use in her second cobbler variation? The text says "two takes on the peach cobbler" but doesn't mention another fruit. Wait, the user might have misread. Let me check again. The article says "Here, Melissa Clark offers two takes on the peach cobbler." So both are peach variations? Then the other fruit would be N/A. Wait, maybe I missed a part. The question might be a trick. The article says "two takes on the peach cobbler" so the other filling is still peach, just different preparations. Therefore the answer is N/A because there's no other fruit mentioned. Wait, maybe the user is referring to another part? Let me check again. The only other fruit mentioned in the context of desserts is the summer fruit crumble which can use any ripe fruit, but that's a different recipe. The cobbler part specifically says two takes on peach, so the answer is N/A.
