Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. 

First question: What was the main reason the Paris marathon course was described as "sadistic" by the organizers?

Hmm, the article says that Paris 2024 organizers may have saved the most sadistic test for last because of the course's steep climbs and quad-crushing downhills. The term "sadistic" is used because of the difficulty. The main reason is the series of steep climbs and downhills making it the most difficult marathon course in the history of the Games. The organizers themselves are quoted as saying the course has demanding conditions because the Paris region isn't as flat as it seems. But the direct reason for calling it sadistic is the challenging terrain. So the answer should be the steep climbs and quad-crushing downhills.

Second question: What is the name of the French king who designed the original route that the marathon course follows?

The article mentions that the first half of the course approximates the route taken by women during the French Revolution seeking to confront King Louis XVI at his palace. So the king's name is Louis XVI. But wait, did the king design the route? The route was taken by the women towards his palace, so the original route was part of their path to his palace, not designed by him. The question asks if the king designed it. The text doesn't say Louis XVI designed it; it was the route the women took to reach him. So maybe the answer is N/A because the king didn't design it. The question's premise might be incorrect. Since the article doesn't state that the king designed the route, just that the course follows a route from that event involving him, the answer should be N/A.

Third question: How many miles per week did Rory Linkletter peak at during his training for the world championships last year?

Looking at the text, Rory Linkletter is mentioned as peaking at about 130 miles a week for his training for Paris. But the question is about his training for the world championships last year. The article says he placed 18th in the men's marathon at last year's world championships. It then mentions his training for Paris, where he peaked at 130 miles. The question is about the training for the world championships, not the Paris race. Since the text doesn't specify his mileage during the world championships training, only his current training for Paris, the answer would be N/A. The 130 is for Paris, not last year's worlds. So that's a trick. Therefore, answer N/A.
