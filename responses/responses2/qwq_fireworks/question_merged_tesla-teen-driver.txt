Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the article provided.

1. **First question**: "What was the primary reason Matt Richtel's son preferred to drive the Toyota Highlander over the Tesla Model 3?" 

Looking at the article, the part about the son driving mentions that Milo (the son) is learning in the Toyota Highlander. The article states that the Tesla was self-driving and involved in crashes, but the son's preference for the Toyota isn't explicitly stated. However, the article says the son has a learner's permit and is learning in the Toyota. The Tesla is mentioned as self-driving, but the son isn't driving it; the father is supervising. The reason given for preferring the Toyota isn't directly stated. Wait, the article says "my son had been watching" in the Tesla scenario, but the son is learning in the Toyota. Maybe the question is a trick? The article doesn't mention the son preferring the Toyota over the Tesla. The Tesla is leased, but the son is learning in the Toyota. The reason isn't given. So answer N/A?

Wait, the question says "primary reason" but the article doesn't state why the son prefers the Toyota. The article mentions that the father wishes the son had seen the Tesla's proper driving, but there's no stated preference from the son. So answer N/A.

2. **Second question**: "What specific cognitive advantage does David Strayer claim that human drivers have over Tesla's Autopilot system?"

Looking for David Strayer's comments. The article says Strayer states that automated vehicles can save lives because "computers can save many more lives than they risk taking, largely because of their cognitive advantage." Wait, the cognitive advantage is the computer's, so the question is flipped. The question is about human's advantage over Autopilot. But the article says computers have the cognitive advantage (they don't get distracted, etc.). The article says Strayer mentions "relative risk" and that computers have the cognitive advantage. So the question's premise might be wrong. The answer would be N/A because Strayer points out the computer's advantage, not the human's. Wait, the question is about a cognitive advantage humans have over Autopilot. The article doesn't mention humans having any cognitive advantages here. So answer N/A?

Wait, the exact quote: "computers can save many more lives than they risk taking, largely because of their cognitive advantage. 'They don't get distracted. They don't get fatigued. They don't get drunk or high. They speed only if the driver tells them to.'" So the cognitive advantages are the computer's. Strayer isn't saying humans have any cognitive advantages over Autopilot. Therefore, the answer is N/A.

3. **Third question**: "What percentage increase in traffic fatalities occurred in 2021 compared to the previous year?"

The article states: "Roughly 43,000 Americans died in crashes in 2021, according to the latest data, a 16-year high, to say nothing of hundreds of thousands of serious injuries." It mentions it's a 16-year high but doesn't give a percentage increase from the previous year (2020). So we can't calculate the percentage increase without knowing the 2020 number. Since the text doesn't provide the percentage increase, answer N/A.

4. **Fourth question**: "What specific advice did David Strayer give about improving human drivers' attention spans?"

Looking for Strayer's advice. The article says Strayer emphasized "relative risk" and the cognitive advantages of computers. There's no mention of specific advice to improve human attention spans. The article doesn't state any advice from Strayer on that. So N/A.

5. **Fifth question**: "What feature did Matt Richtel's son request be added to self-driving cars for social media use?"

The article ends with Richtel saying when machines rule the road, he can tell his teen to watch TikTok behind the wheel. But the son didn't request it; it's the father's hypothetical. The article says "I can tell my teen to go ahead and watch TikTok behind the wheel" but it's the father's thought, not the son's request. Therefore, the son didn't request any feature, so N/A.
