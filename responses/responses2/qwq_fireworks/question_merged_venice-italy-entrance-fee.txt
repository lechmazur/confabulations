Okay, let's tackle the first question. The question is asking for the primary reason the five euro entrance fee was introduced in Venice, according to Mayor Luigi Brugnaro's speech at the UNESCO World Heritage Sites conference last year.

First, I need to check the article for mentions of the mayor's reasons and any reference to a UNESCO conference speech. The article states that the mayor said the aim was to dissuade day-trippers from visiting at peak times to ease pressure on residents. That's in the first few paragraphs. 

However, the question specifically mentions a speech at the UNESCO conference last year. The article does mention UNESCO's recommendation to put Venice on the endangered list, and that the entrance fee helped keep it off. But does it say that Brugnaro mentioned this reason at a UNESCO conference? Let me scan again.

Looking at the text: "UNESCO... recommended that the city be put on the list of its endangered World Heritage Sites, citing mass tourism as a principal concern, though Venice stayed off the 'in danger' list after the access fee was approved." There's no mention of Brugnaro giving a speech at a UNESCO conference. The primary reason from the mayor is stated in the article as dissuading day-trippers, but the context of a UNESCO conference speech isn't there. Since the question ties the reason to that specific event, which isn't mentioned in the text, the answer should be N/A.

<other>The article mentions the mayor's stated aim to dissuade day-trippers but does not reference a speech at a UNESCO World Heritage Sites conference. The UNESCO mention relates to their recommendation about the endangered list, not the mayor's speech.</other>
