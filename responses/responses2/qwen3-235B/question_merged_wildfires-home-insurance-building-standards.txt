<other>First, I'll check the article for each answer. For question 1, the text mentions California and Oregon have their own requirements but not the I.B.H.S. standards. No states are stated to have adopted the I.B.H.S. standards as mandatory. For question 2, the text explicitly states 220,000 acres. For question 3, only State Farm's 30% rate increase is mentioned, not Allstate's.</other>
