<other>The text does not mention the primary reason for the United States' increased oil and gas production. It only mentions that the United States has called on the world to move more quickly to fight climate change, even as it produces and exports more oil and gas than ever. Therefore, the answer to question 1 is "N/A". Similarly, the text does not discuss how the United States' increased production of oil and gas has impacted Azerbaijan's plans to expand its fossil fuel industry, so the answer to question 2 is also "N/A".</other>
