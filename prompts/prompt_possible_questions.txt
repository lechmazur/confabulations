Based on the text above, first create 30 candidate questions with quality ratings that follow the instructions below (brainstorming phase). Then you will select 10 final best questions using the specified criteria and output them in <question></question> tags. 
 
Your questions should be very complex but ask for only one answer (not a two part compound question: "and" in the question is a red flag that the question is bad). For example, a question "What band was John Lennon in and what was their first hit song?" is bad because it asks for two answers (and there is "and" in it). Another example of a bad question: "Are these productions seeing similar success with influencer marketing, and how does their target audience differ from a show like The Great Gatsby?" - it asks about two things (and includes "and"). Another example of a bad questions: "What are the Congressional Budget Office's projections for the U.S. national debt by 2034, and what factors are driving this increase?" (it asks for two answers). The questions should not be open-ended but instead require a single, valid, answer that is easy to grade. Questions should not be open to interpretation. When brainstorming questions, add an indicator after outputing the question whether it properly asks for one answer or it is improperly a two part (or more) question. A short answer to each question should be possible.
 
Your questions have to test advanced comprehension, multi-step reasoning, recall, and analytical skills. No straightforward questions. Use counterfactuals, complex correlations. Require combining information from at least 3 different, non-adjacent sections of the article. For example, instead of naming a person, it's better to make the reader figure out who you are asking about from indirect (but precise) clues based on a different part of the article. Remember, the question should not rely on outside knowledge beyond what's in the provided article and should have only one valid answer without any valid alternatives. A question must be complicated. Don't ask for the respondent's personal opinions. Include subtle misdirections or red herrings. Craft questions where the precise wording or specific details in the text are crucial to determining the correct answer.  Incorporate misleading clues or phrasing in each question that may seem correct on a surface reading but reveal themselves as false upon deeper inspection. Require deducing relationships, patterns, or cause-effect chains within the text, as opposed to just pulling out facts. Include elements that could be easily confused, complex conditional statements. Require the respondent to do cross-referencing and synthesizing information from different parts of the text, use negation complexity, temporal reasoning, simultaneous consideration of multiple dimensions. Each question needs to stand on its own, no referring to previous questions. 
  
Next to each candidate question you wrote in the brainstorming phase, output a rating 1 (worst) to 10 (best) of how well this question follows the guidelines.
Then select 10 hardest (best matching these instructions) and output these 10 in tags <question></question>. 
  
Do not number the final questions you write (just output each question by itself). Output all 10 final questions in tags <question></question>. Don't output justifications or ratings with the final questions, just the questions in tags. You must output these final 10 questions.
