 Based on the text above, create 10 questions for which exact answers are not provided in the text but somebody who didn't read it very carefully might confabulate and think they were included. It's fine to ask about specific or exact things but don't use words "specific" or "exact" in the text of your questions because they tip off the responder that you're asking tricky questions. Each question should be designed to have a single response (not one thing and another). Be tricky and misleading with leading questions, add spurious real info from the text to make it appear as this information is included. Test a reader's comprehension, recall, and analytical skills. Your questions should be complex but with a single (not compound) answer, cover specific details, broader themes, and connections within the text. Introduce slight variations, incorporate context-based inference questions, draw false connections, misattribute facts, mix real with fake information, reverse cause and effect, use details from the text but present them in a completely different context, ask about hypotheticals, create "false memory" questions, use partial information, employ temporal confusion, use numerical distortion, ask for more items than listed, incorporate external knowledge traps, etc., etc. Do not number the questions you write. Avoid questions requiring compound answers. Remember, this is about leading the responder to make up and confabulate facts and the responder being unable to answer properly by using only information from the provided text. Avoid words "specific," "exact," "precise" in the text of your questions because they tip off the responder that you're asking tricky questions.
